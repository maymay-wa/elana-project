president reagan likes to boast that marxists 
have not gained a single square inch of territory during his 
tenure and one of his more satisfying moments occurred when a 
communist government actually was uprooted 
rolling back communism was once an american cold war battle cry 
but marxist regimes always proved remarkably resilient in the 
postworld war ii era the trend was constant when marxists took 
power they were there to stay 
five years ago that pattern was interrupted on oct 25 1983 
us troops aided by forces from seven friendly caribbean 
countries deposed the leftist government in grenada 
was the administration telling the truth when it said the 
invasion was justified by dangers confronting the more than 700 
american medical students on the island or was that just an excuse 
for striking a blow against a country simply because it had ties to 
the soviet bloc 
was grenada an event of transcendental importance or merely a 
speck on the historical horizon did the soviets see grenada with 
its deep water port as an ideal stopping off place for nuclear 
missile submarines 
to michael ledeen a former administration aide who spent months 
studying official documents captured on grenada by us military 
forces the events of october 1983 had an enormous impact 
psychologically 
it may well be that 20 years from now people will say that 
was the beginning of the end of the soviet empire ledeen said 
the russians had always claimed that once a country became 
part of communist world it was there to stay grenada proved that 
it wasnt 
but former national security council aide oliver l north felt 
that grenada could not be regarded as a major defeat for 
international communism because the government there was ousted by 
foreign invaders not by a popular uprising 
assistant secretary of state langhorne a motley who like 
north played a key behindthe scenes role in coordinating the 
invasion said the episode sent a clear message to americas 
friends and adversaries 
it showed that the united states was prepared to use force in 
the defense of its national interests said motley who left 
government service in 1985 
motley insisted that the driving force behind the invasion was 
concern for the fate of the american medical students on the island 
after leftist opponents of prime minister maurice bishop deposed 
and then executed him and about 50 of his supporters on the 
bloodiest day in grenadas history 
afterward the revolutionary military council which ousted 
bishop imposed a 24hour curfew motley noted there was no official 
us presence on the island and said state department efforts to 
obtain information about the students were unsuccessful 
he and other officials were haunted by the memory of the 52 
american hostages who had been detained by iranian militants for 
444 days as motley described it alarm at the state department 
mounted as the days passed with no word on whether the students 
were safe 
he ridiculed the notion that the prime us concern in going 
ahead with the invasion was the existence of a prosoviet 
government in grenada 
the primary and overwhelming consideration was the safety of 
the students he said 
but cuban president fidel castro has said the administration 
fabricated a mountain of lies about the supposed dangers 
confronting the students he felt the administration was guided 
above all by aggressive intentions 
ramon sanchez parodi head of cubas diplomatic mission in 
washington said the stated us concern about the students was a 
very thin veil covering the reagan administrations true intent 
there was no effort of a nonmilitary nature to take the 
students out sanchez parodi said the united states he said 
had no purpose other than to impose its will on the people of 
grenada in the aftermath cuba moved quickly to bolster its own 
selfdefense worried that it might be the next american target 
answering critics reagan noted that the us intervention was 
carried out at the request of the organization of eastern caribbean 
states which was worried about grenada being used as a base of 
subversion against caribbean democracies some had security forces 
totaling only a few dozen compared with grenadas force of 4000 
when the reagan administration took office in 1981 it found the 
trends in the caribbean area worrisome leftist governments had 
assumed power over the previous two years in grenada nicaragua and 
suriname 
in grenada bishops government moved quickly to establish close 
ties with cuba a large contingent of cubans began constructing an 
airport capable of handling cubas large fleet of mig jet fighters 
although bishop insisted that the airport was designed for 
commercial purposes us military analysts were concerned that the 
facility had the potential for enabling cuba to project its 
military power for the first time into the northern tier of south 
america captured documents showed that grenada had entered into 
three military agreements with the soviet union and one each with 
cuba and north korea all secret 
whatever the objectives of the soviet bloc in grenada might have 
been the ouster of a friendly government there and its replacement 
by an avowedly proamerican regime was a setback especially for 
castro 
cuba had committed substantial resources in grenada for more 
than four years and castro had nothing to show for it the 25th 
anniversary of his own revolution which occurred nine weeks after 
the grenada invasion was a low key affair instead of the big 
extravaganza he had planned 
the invasion also produced shock waves in nicaragua and 
suriname in managua defense minister humberto ortega was 
determined not to allow the united states to use the same pretext 
for invading nicaragua as it did in grenada 
he called us ambassador anthony quainton and offered him 
unlimited use of nicaraguas bus fleet to evacuate americans from 
the country in suriname military leader desi bouterse worried 
that the large and growing cuban presence in his country might be 
seen as a provocation by the united states ordered the cubans home 
delighted that the invasion seemed to make americas adversaries 
in the hemisphere squirm one official facetiously said at the time 
that the best way to deal with nicaragua was to set up a medical 
school for americans in the country 
the invasion of course was not costfree eighteen americans 
45 grenadans and 29 cubans were killed during the fighting 
but given the fact that the students were spared potential harm 
and the soviet bloc had lost an ally in the process the 
administration felt the loss of life was worth it 
the episode helped ease the anguish of what was perhaps the 
darkest moment of the reagan presidency the deaths of 241 us 
marines in a bombing incident in lebanon just two days before the 
grenada invasion

the gun lobby physicians and real estate 
agents are potent political forces with multimilliondollar 
campaign chests but when it comes to doling out dollars nobody 
does it like the teamsters 
for every dollar the national rifle association spends on this 
years election the teamsters spend 3 for every 3 the american 
medical association or the national association of realtors spends 
the teamsters spend 4 
fulfilling jackie pressers dream that his union become a 
political giant and believing firmly that money is the key the 
governmentbesieged teamsters have amassed the largest campaign 
chest of any business labor or special interest group in the 
nation 
without money youre going nowhere in the political arena in 
this country the late teamsters president told the aflci0 when 
he brought his union back into the labor federation a year ago 
the teamsters under new president william mccarthy broke with 
the aflcio at least politically last week and endorsed george 
bush over michael dukakis 
under presser the teamsters drive democratic republican 
independent voter education fund grew from less than 250000 in 
1980 into the nations richest political action committee 
as of sept 1 the teamsters pac had collected 7692850 from 
the unions 16 million members most of it through dollaraweek 
payroll deductions from 100000 interstate truck drivers and united 
parcel service employees 
with drive growing at a rate of 400000 to 500000 a month and 
including 15 other pacs operated by the some of its larger locals 
and state councils the teamsters stand to spend more than 10 
million before the 1988 election is over 
the biggest pacs in past elections the national association of 
realtors and the american medical association had accumulated 
4841363 and 4759178 respectively as of july according to 
federal election commission records the national rifle 
associations political victory fund stood at 1993665 
the primary impetus behind the geometric growth of the 
teamsters political spending was the deregulation of the trucking 
industry in 1980 
the teamsters found then they had only 26 allies in the senate 
when they tried to block the move and former union president roy 
williams went to prison for five years for attempting to bribe 
former sen howard cannon dnev to derail the legislation 
presser vowed that the union would never suffer that kind of 
political defeat again a viewed echoed by mccarthy a veteran 
boston area labor leader 
we have to show our appreciation to those in congress who 
support working men and women and we do this best through drive 
mccarthy told a meeting of east coast teamster leaders last month 
at hilton head sc 
because of deregulation we dont have any trouble signing our 
ups and freight guys up for drive said dave sweeney the 
teamsters legislative director 
theyve seen all the freight companies going out of business 
all the madness out there sweeney said you dont have to 
convince them we need to be politically active 
high on the unions political agenda is legislation to outlaw 
doublebreasting the simultaneous operation of union and 
nonunion shops under the same ownership or management 
despite the teamsters surprise endorsement of bush last week 
fec records show 88 percent of their contributions to federal 
candidates go to democrats and 12 percent to republicans about 
the same ratio as organized labor as a whole 
the teamsters had funneled some 16 million to 282 democratic 
house and senate candidates and 190000 to 52 republicans as of 
sept 1 according to the latest government records 
among the recipients rep joseph p kennedy ii dmass who got 
5000 kennedy is the son of the late attorney general robert f 
kennedy who put teamster leaders like jimmy hoffa and william 
presser jackie pressers father in jail 
sen lloyd bentsen has received 9000 in teamster money this 
year all of it before dukakis tapped bentsen as his running mate 
and all devoted to bentsens simultaneous texas campaign for 
reelection to the senate 
the teamsters gave bushs running mate sen dan quayle rind 
5000 when he was running for reelection to the senate two years 
ago 
besides being incumbents quayle and bentsen shared another 
trait common to beneficiaries of teamsters largess chairmanships 
of subcommittees and committees vital to the unions legislative 
agenda 
quayle was chairman of the senate labor subcommittee at the time 
and bentsen now chairs the senate finance committee responsible for 
shaping the nations tax and trade laws 
indirect teamster political aid for voter registration phone 
banks and gubernatorial and state legislative candidates totaled 
more than 25 million as of september according to fec records 
as of sept 1 the teamsters had a 3 million cash balance in 
their drive account 
like many construction unions the teamsters are more inclined 
than most aflcio affiliates and the federations committee on 
political education cope to side with a friendly gop incumbent 
over a democratic challenger 
if a republican supports you six or seven times out of 10 you 
ought to be able to support him sweeney said

in at least one case this year that approach has caused a major 
rift between unions headquarters and local teamster leaders 
teamster officials in connecticut wanted the union to support 
democratic attoney general joseph i liebermans bid to unseat 
veteran republican sen lowell p weicker jr national union 
leaders preferred weicker 
you defeat the system and the whole purpose of a political 
action committee if you work against a guy like weicker who has a 
100 percent prolabor voting record sweeney said 
sweeney said officials in his office also try to dissuade 
teamster locals from going after a very conservative republican 
where you cant beat him 
he cited veteran conservative republican reps james h quillen 
of tennessee the ranking minority member on the house rules 
committee and donald e lukens of ohio both have large teamster 
locals in their districts 
and both according to sweeney were instrumental in getting 
signatures from other pillars of the far right such as rep 
newt gingrich rga on letters from 264 house members condemning 
a justice department suit to take over the union under the 
racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act 
the suit has become an issue in some house campaigns 
the campaign manager for incumbent rep doug bereuter rneb 
suggested that democratic opponent warren jones return a 5000 
drive contribution the teamsters gave jones another 5000 
thomas h fetzer jr the gop opponent of rep david e price 
dnc challenged prices acceptance of 10000 from the teamsters 
in light of the suit 
rep james mcclure clark dnc was accused of accepting 
tainted teamster money by his opponent republican charles h 
taylor 
clark responded that he has yet to hear taylor or any republican 
suggest that president reagan return any contributions from the 
teamsters in the unions endorsement of him in 1980 and 1984 
sweeney said the attacks have stopped since the teamsters 
complained to sen ted stevens ralaska and stevens talked to 
former republican sen paul laxalt of nevada now an adviser to the 
bush campaign 
we think it was organized they deny it he said 
rep beryl anthony of arkansas chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee sent a letter to colleagues 
suggesting they neutralize the attacks by pointing to the 
teamsters 189275 in contributions to republicans 
among them according to the fec are 8000 to sen phil gramm 
of texas 5000 to house republican leader robert michel of 
illinois and 1000 to house republican whip trent lott who is 
seeking the senate seat of retiring mississippi democrat john 
stennis

two young whales trapped by ice 
tentatively tested a narrow escape route to open water sunday that 
was being carved with chain saws by eskimos who ordinarily hunt 
whales 
a national guard helicopter hammered at the ice off alaskas 
northern coast with a 5ton chunk of concrete but the whales were 
more than three miles from a strech of open water with a massive 
ice ridge in between and a wind shift threatening to push ice 
around them and trap them further 
rescuers said that even if everything went as planned it would 
be at least wednesday night before they could get the whales as far 
as the ridge 
as crews concentrated on coaxing the whales to freedom the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration asked for help from 
two soviet icebreakers 
the icebreakers admiral makorov and vladimir arseniev however 
need about 39 feet of water to operate the soviet news agency tass 
reported the whales are trapped in an area where water depth 
varies from 12 to 25 feet 
noaa rear admiral sigmund r petersen director of the pacific 
marine center in seattle said even if the icebreakers cannot reach 
the whales they could help clear a path to the first opening or 
lead from open water 200 miles away 
petersen said that depending on ice conditions the ships could 
reach barrow by noon tuesday 
while hightechnology equipment poured into barrow during the 
weekend eskimos using chain saws and their strong backs made the 
most progress at freeing the california gray whales from a tiny 
breathing hole 
about two dozen natives hacked 34 breathing holes saturday for 
a total of about 60 holes extending more than 1 miles from where 
three whales were stranded by moving ice about two weeks ago before 
they could migrate south 
the smallest and youngest of the whales named bone disappeared 
friday night and was presumed dead 
just as the tedious holecutting hit its stride the whales 
balked advancing only a few hundred feet past a large opening 
where they spent friday night and most of saturday 
biologists said the animals had gone back to earlier breathing 
holes sometimes breaking up to 2 inches of ice to surface they 
said that was a good sign because the marine mammals still must 
negotiate 200 miles of ice before hitting open water if they are 
freed 
if they know they are capable of doing that they may continue 
doing so said biologist jim harvey 
basically we have to condition them that their best chance of 
survival is to move ahead to new holes harvey said 
he said rescuers planned to begin filling or covering the holes 
behind the whales to force them along the desired path 
rescuers said they feared the whales were spooked by an 
underwater shoal north slope borough biologist geoff carroll said 
most of the water in the area is about 20 feet deep compared to 
only 12 or 13 feet of water in the shoal 
you figure two feet of ice and five feet of whale and that 
doesnt leave them too much room to swim carroll said i dont 
blame them for not wanting to go through there 
whaling captain arnold brower whose crew used donated chain 
saws to help free the animals was frustrated by the whales 
reluctance 
if we move them then ill call it progress brower said 
leaning down to push the snout of a surfacing whale in the 
direction he wanted it to go 
ron morris a biologist with the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said sonar would be used to see if 
there is an easy way around the shoal 
the surviving whales appeared to be healthy immature whales 
estimated at 27 to 35 feet long said david withrow of the marine 
mammal institute in seattle he said one apparently was a yearling 
and the other was 2 to 3 years old 
rescuers worked in the dark using portable lights snowmobile 
headlights and deicing equipment dubbed the bubblers to keep 
the holes open ahead of the whales 
the skycrane helicopter on saturday used its concrete plunger to 
probe the ridge a jumble of ice blocks as big as a house but the 
battering ram seldom penetrated the ridge formed by colliding ice 
masses is several hundred yards wide 
of additional concern was a shift in the wind which eskimo 
hunters said could turn the area where the whales were trapped into 
an impassable jumble of ice rubble 
noaa spokesman brian gorman in washington dc said the agency 
asked for the soviet icebreakers and they were dispatched under a 
1976 cooperative environmental agreement with the soviet union 
he said the rescue effort also involves use of some of our own 
noaa satellites to take ice pictures we are relaying that 
information to the soviets to assist them in determining the most 
expeditious route 
heavy ice in the arctic ocean earlier disabled two canadian 
icebreakers and the us coast guard icebreaker polar star 
the latest piece of high technology to be thrown into the battle 
is a pontoonmounted vehicle known as an archimedes screw which 
pulls itself along by augers that eat into the ice 
while marine biologists called the whales bone crossbeak and 
bonnet the eskimos have named the two survivors siku or ice and 
putu ice hole the vanished whale they named knik one of 28 
eskimo words for snowflake 
the young whales lack of experience apparently led them farther 
north than the endangered california gray whales normally go and 
caused them to stay too long before starting their annual migration 
to the warm water off mexicos baja california withrow said 
harvey and withrow said the whales have a reasonable chance of 
survival if they can be freed within a week 
harvey said the whales condition sunday appeared stable but 
that a wound on the snout of the larger whale appeared worse than 
before 
the rescue effort had attracted so many spectators and news 
teams that a police officer was stationed out on the ice to direct 
traffic 
a giant air force c5a cargo plane sent in with fresh equipment 
took up so much ground space at barrows airport that a commercial 
flight didnt have room to land

emperor hirohito was in good spirits sunday but 
palace officials said his blood pressure rose to its highest level 
since he was confined to bed with internal bleeding five weeks ago 
the 87yearold monarchs blood pressure at midafternoon was 
174 over 76 imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda said 
the reading was sharply higher than in the morning when it was 160 
over 70 a normal reading is about 120 over 80 
high blood pressure places an additional burden on the heart and 
other organs and can aggravate internal bleeding 
maeda said hirohito continued to discharge small amounts of 
blood from his bowels saturday and sunday but remained in good 
spirits and was chatting amiably with aides and family members 
maeda said earlier that the emperors serious anemia improved 
slightly after large blood transfusions hirohito received 248 
pints of blood since his condition worsened nearly three times the 
normal amount in his body 
in a related development british rock guitarist eric clapton 
reportedly took out a 105000 insurance policy against 
cancellation of his concert tour next month in japan if hirohito 
dies the sun newspaper of london said the policy would pay clapton 
more than 175 million 
already many concerts festivals and other events have been 
canceled in japan because of the emperors illness

general election to know that there is an arab partner who is 
ready for peace 
egyptian and plo officials told reporters much of the discussion 
centered on a proposed confederation between jordan and an 
independent palestinian state 
relations between arafat and king hussein have been chilly since 
february 1986 when the king froze ties with the plo leader after a 
yearlong joint effort at peace with israel 
the palestinian question has since been transformed by a 
10month uprising against israels military occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip and by king husseins decision to cut ties with 
the west bank which jordan ruled from 1948 until 1967

atlantis moved a big step toward the 
second postchallenger space shuttle flight when workers moved it 
into an assembly building to prepare for next months launch with a 
secret military satellite 
a tractor saturday night towed the 85ton space ship the 450 
feet from a processing building where it had been undergoing 
modifications for several months 
in the assembly building over the next several days atlantis 
will be joined with its two solid fuel booster rockets and large 
external fuel tank in about a week it will be transported to 
launch pad 39b 
nasa is aiming for a latenovember launch but a date wont be 
set until a twoday flight readiness review is completed on nov 10 
the flight will mark the third time in 27 launchings that a 
classified defense department payload will be carried on a shuttle

the contras the nicaraguan rebels president 
reagan lauded as freedom fighters and made the centerpiece of 
his central america policy are fading into history 
supporters and opponents alike say the rebels who once claimed 
to be inflicting severe damage on the leftist sandinista regime 
through their forays inside nicaragua now are little more than 
refugees huddled in camps along the honduran border 
every single contra who died died for nothing it turns 
out said rep mickey edwards rokla who has led a losing 
battle in the house of representatives to win military aid for the 
rebels ive got to say that im depressed about it i would like 
to find a way to put a good light on it but i cant 
reagans personal devotion to the contras has largely sustained 
them since they were formed in 1981 congress alternately going 
along and resisting aid to the rebels sent at least 294 million 
to support the contras over that period that doesnt include some 
41 million raised from other countries and private contributors 
or illegally diverted during the irancontra affair 
as recently as february there were upwards of 16000 rebels 
inside nicaragua attacking sandinista patrols and sabotaging power 
and transportation lines but in deference to a halting effort at 
reaching a negotiated ceasefire us military aid was suspended 
feb 29 
according to intelligence estimates fewer than 2000 opposition 
troops remain inside nicaragua struggling to conserve dwindling 
supplies of ammunition the rest have been starved out forced to 
march weeks through the jungle to reach camps just inside honduras 
where they huddle under black plastic shelters and receive us 
food and medicine handouts nearby more than 20000 contra family 
members subsist in similar camps 
supporters who have toured the area say morale among the rebels 
astonishingly remains good but anticontra lawmakers say that 
with congress having adjourned for the year and no chance for new 
military aid on the horizon the contras appear finished as a 
fighting force 
the rebels primary patron reagan can do little more for them 
one candidate to succeed him democrat michael dukakis opposes the 
reagan contra policy the other vice president george bush is 
talking little about what he would do for the rebels if he takes 
office in january and contra supporters doubt he will have the 
same fervor as reagan 
retired maj gen john k singlaub who has supported the rebels 
for years last month wrote bush to warn of an impending 
disaster for the rebels and chastised him for ignoring the issue 
in his presidential campaign 
theyre moribund said rep david bonior dmich a leader 
of house anticontra forces for practical purposes as a 
fighting force theyre history 
one sign that even the rebels most devoted backers have given 
up is their fingerpointing at democrats 
they are a people to whom this country owes an obligation 
said rep henry hyde rill 
those who want to come to this country are truly refugees 
they would be politically persecuted if they went back to 
nicaragua we should be talking about reception centers in the 
united states fort worth texas comes to mind hyde said in a 
sarcastic reference to the home district of house speaker jim 
wright the administrations main foe on the contra issue 
i believe the consequences are going to be very heavy and the 
responsibility ought to be very clear added jeane kirkpatrick 
reagans former united nations ambassador and a strong contra 
supporter 
hyde and kirkpatrick predicted the failure to oust the 
sandinista regime would lead to increased soviet influence in the 
region and embroil the united states directly in military action to 
save nascent democracies in el salvador and guatemala 
administration policymakers say they may share some of the blame 
for the failure of the contra policy but say it will be a major 
dilemma facing the next occupant of the white house 
perhaps a new administration will have a different policy 
initiative toward all of central america said one senior 
administration official speaking only on condition of anonymity 
perhaps it will be able to sell a program in a way we could never 
do we have not done a very good job of convincing the american 
people 
while us policy toward the region remains adrift over the next 
few months the region is likely to take another run at a solution 
the presidents of the five central american countries nicaragua 
costa rica el salvador guatemala and honduras are talking about 
the possibility of a summit meeting in san salvador just before the 
nov 14 start of an organization of american states general 
assembly 
complicating their efforts is the continued presence of 
thousands of armed rebels along honduras border with nicaragua a 
presence that makes honduran president jose azcona increasingly 
nervous azcona has suggested a united nations force be stationed 
in the region to keep the borders clear of rebels something has to 
be done with the contras but nobody seems to know exactly what 
the contras themselves remain splintered over what to do next 
with us refusal to provide new military aid some hardliners 
believe the rebels should look to other countries to provide it 
one moderate member of the rebel political directorate alfredo 
cesar wants to return to nicaragua and work for reform through 
peaceful political and diplomatic means 
i dont blame them in the least edwards said its 
natural that there would be disagreements theyve had their 
friends killed without having achieved anything the sandinistas 
still put people in jail break up peaceful demonstrations close 
down the press whenever they feel like it theyre still getting 
military aid from the russians nothing has changed

a device being introduced in record stores 
monday crosses a jukebox with digital technology for a service that 
allows consumers to custommake their own music cassettes from a 
variety of artists and labels 
the new gadget has drawn mixed reviews from some major record 
companies which fear it may cut into album sales and some are not 
participating 
customers can select from up to 2500 songs a store clerk 
punches in the buyers selections in the order chosen and the 
customer gets a 90minute tape with up to 25 songs the cost is 50 
cents to 125 a song 
the stores copy of the music is recorded on an optical disk 
allowing all those songs to be copied onto the tape in just five 
minutes 
personics system co of menlo park calif hopes to have as 
many as 15000 songs available eventually in its monthly catalogue 
personics is introducing 25 systems at record stores in 
california and hopes to expand to other areas of the country 
personics from day one will offer a vast constellation of 
musical artists you will be able to personalize music like 
never before said charles garvin founder and president of 
personics 
the personics system will give smaller record stores pressed for 
space a deeper offering of songs 
the price includes fees and royalties for artists and their 
labels who otherwise wouldnt get a penny if consumers made their 
own tapes from radio or friends records 
personics has attracted at least 30 labels including polygram 
mca warnerelektraatlantic chrysalis and others 
personics has not yet been able to attract giant cbs records 
home of bruce springsteen and michael jackson or the bmg group 
formerly rca records aampm records with such artists as sting and 
janet jackson is not interested spokeswoman diana baron said 
friday 
record companies are cautious about personics because sales of 
single songs could cut into album sales said michael greene 
president of the national academy of recording arts and sciences 
for the most part the idea is a good one said greene who 
praised any system that would cut into illegal home taping and 
give artists their royalties billions of dollars a year are lost 
worldwide through record pirating and home recording industry 
experts have estimated 
the problem im concerned with is what happens when people go 
into a record store and start doing compilation tapes of hits 
greene said the artist may have other material in the album they 
consider necessary for a listener to understand what they are doing 
musically 
garvin said personics test marketing in two stores showed it 
brought royalties from new consumers who would not have been 
album buyers and people who would not have bought the music at 
all but probably would have hometaped it 
growing record companies like 6yearold enigma are making 
available their entire catalogue 
its another way to sell songs like ktel compilations 
said enigma cofounder william hein who said personics could be a 
way to rekindle the dying market for single releases 
other companies are more cautious about the system which took 
8 million and five years to develop and market 
capitol records one of personics principal owners has made 
available its current single releases and older albums for 
instance but not material from its current albums unreleased as 
singles 
and while the capitol beach boy catalogue will be available the 
legal tangle surrounding the beatles music means they wont 
immediately be in the personics catalogue said personics board 
member elliot goldman 
the industry has a right to be skeptical garvin said but 
i think we have convinced everyone this is an effort of by and for 
the music business for continued control over its product

london police said sunday that they tracked down 
an unemployed computer hacker who tapped into military commercial 
and university systems in europe and the united states over several 
years 
they said the man was questioned about alleged attempts to 
blackmail a computer company but that there was not enough evidence 
to pursue the matter 
he was officially cautioned about that but as he wasnt 
charged with anything we are not identifying him said a 
spokeswoman at scotland yard 
a scotland yard statement said only that the man was 23 and out 
of work it said the inquiry by its serious crimes squad lasted 
five weeks 
the sunday telegraph which broke the story said the man was 
connected with an international ring of computer hackers who have 
penetrated the electronic information systems of more than 200 
sensitive military and commercial establishments 
it said the computer systems penetrated included nasa the us 
nuclear defense agency the british defense ministry as well as 
those of american defense establishments and suppliers 
the weekly said american security experts were going to london 
to examine papers found during the police investigation which gave 
details of hacking activities over five years 
the newspaper said the man used computers on the university of 
surrey campus at guildford 30 miles southwest of london and had 
not committed any offense under british law 
it said the mans hacking included finding out details of 
peoples financial accounts and that his motive appeared to have 
been the pleasure of beating the system 
it reported he had contacts with unidentified hacking clubs in 
the united states and with one in west germany which specializes 
in gaining access to military systems but there is no suggestion 
that he tried to disclose secrets to foreign countries the 
report added 
the newspaper said the alleged blackmail attempt originated with 
a request to a large computer firm for a 5250 fee to be shown how 
its equipment had been used to tap different computer systems 
the firm went to the police who traced the hacker to one of 
surrey universitys 900 terminals and trapped the man when the 
university collaborated in setting up a terminal programed to 
monitor external computer calls the newspaper said

chinas top newspapers sunday heaped unusually 
lavish praise on former defense minister peng dehuai the peasant 
general purged from the communist party for criticizing mao 
tsetungs ruinous economic program 
in the peoples daily the partys main organ elder statesman 
bo yibo expressed regret for not joining peng in standing up to 
maos great leap forward of 1958 the mobilization of peasants into 
selfsufficient peoples communes 
several leading newspapers also carried an article by president 
yang shangkun praising the publication of pengs selected writings 
on military affairs to mark the 90th anniversary of his birth 
the prominent tributes to peng who died four years before he 
was officially rehabilitated in 1978 may have been intended to 
encourage people to fight recordhigh inflation and rampant 
corruption after 10 years of marketoriented economic reform 
the party has launched a campaign against officials who have 
illegally profited from chinas modernization and opendoor 
policies and in an effort to control inflation has at least 
temporarily halted moves to reduce central planning and increase 
market freedom 
our economic reforms have reached a critical stage hope and 
difficulties exist together bo said at the end of his 
8000pluscharacter article that covered most of the back page of 
the party newspaper 
all party members ought to carry forward pengs 
revolutionary spirit of pioneering and seeking truths to develop 
china said bo an 80yearold former vice premier who now holds 
the largely honorary post of vice chairman of the party central 
advisory commission 
bos article titled unforgettable recollections also 
appeared to attack mao by praising one of his most prominent 
critics 
although chinese leaders openly acknowledge maos mistakes in 
launching the great leap forward in 1958 and the cultural 
revolution of 196676 he has not suffered bitter official attacks 
in a manner similar to the soviet criticism of stalin 
peng was purged from the party in september 1959 shortly after 
his attack on maos policies peng died nov 29 1974 and was 
officially rehabilitated in 1978 two years after mao died

republican george bush is running an 
advertising campaign so successful that it has overshadowed news 
events and swayed voters in a nearvacuum that democrat michael 
dukakis only now is moving to fill 
with the nov 8 election little more than two weeks away 
dukakis went on the air during the weekend with strong 
counterpunches to a monthsold bush offensive that raked him over 
the coals often inaccurately and obliterated any momentum the 
massachusetts governor had leaving the democratic convention in 
july 
from the first commercials filled with children and warmth 
balloons and adulation to stinging ads attacking dukakis to a 
series of foreign affairs spots stressing the vice presidents 
experience bushs ad people sought to transform his image from 
wimp to strong yet sensitive leader 
they have not made a false move 
at the same time bushs ads have battered dukakis to the point 
that voters who once viewed him as a competent innovative governor 
or at worst an unknown tend to see the democratic nominee as 
soft on crime weak on defense and questionable on the environment 
dukakis own advertising got off to a late and shaky start 
which was an unexpected bonus for bush and his highly experienced 
media team led by roger ailes 
if roger ailes was working for dukakis he would be the 
frontrunner said kathleen hall jamieson a university of texas 
professor specializing in political communication 
jamieson and other experts say that in contrast to bush the 
dukakis media campaign has been damagingly out of sync television 
viewers saw nothing that countered bushs attacks on crime and the 
environment 
instead they say there were celebratory atlanta convention 
scenes a month later and obscure packaging of george bush 
commercials when voters needed to know more about dukakis and his 
record 
in lengthy television appearances between now and election day 
dukakis hopes to publicize his record and persuade voters to take 
one more look at him and bush before they make up their minds 
on friday dukakis came out slugging he began airing a series 
of blistering tv ads during the weekend in which he appears in 
shirtsleeves to accuse bush of broadcasting claims that are full 
of lies and dragging the truth into the gutter about the 
democratic nominees positions on crime and defense 
he personally goes on the attack against bush and his running 
mate dan quayle mentioning both by name one tv ad savages the 
vice presidents antidrug leadership showing scenes of children 
buying drugs and bush meeting with panamanian leader manuel noriega 
dukakis has reentered the campaign dialogue doing the job 
that a candidate is supposed to do engage the claims of the other 
candidate and when they are distorted point that out said 
jamieson 
its a good move in the ninth hour it would have been a 
better move in the first hour she said expressing a view shared 
by dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen 
if hed done this as soon as the attacks went on the air hed 
be ahead in the polls right now jamieson said 
for his part bush has used tv ads to reinforce the i share 
your values he doesnt campaign message he has delivered in 
stump speeches across the country 
the results have been dramatic bush started with high negative 
ratings and dukakis with high positive ratings among voters recent 
polls show those ratings are reversed 
pollster lou harris said last week that 60 percent of nearly 
2000 likely voters surveyed by his organization remembered a bush 
ad attacking the massachusetts prison furlough program most found 
it too negative and unfair but they also said it was effective 
the bush commercials have had an enormous impact harris 
said really more than the debates more than anything else they 
have determined the set of the election up until now 
julian cantor a political advertising expert at the university 
of oklahoma said dukakis has reduced crime and strengthened the 
police in massachusetts and received a national award from a crime 
victims assistance group yet he seems to be a willing victim 
himself 
hes been an effective governor in terms of crime the public 
is being left with a very distorted perception cantor said 
its bushs fault for creating the distortion but its dukakis 
fault for not setting the record straight 
dukakis endorsement by the league of conservation voters was 
overshadowed by bushs personal appearance in boston harbor and 
followup ads accusing the governor of failing to rid the harbor of 
pollution cantor says 
the dukakis campaign failed to get out front on the harbor 
issue or respond to the charge rapidly after it was made he 
said if you dont respond the public accepts the charge as 
valid 
dukakis weak media performance has been attributed to friction 
and confusion among his advertising people and a misguided belief 
that he could sit on a 17point lead in the polls and wait for bush 
to selfdestruct 
those days appear to have vanished with dukakis belated 
realization that he must join the fray and cut through what one of 
his aides leslie dach termed a bush campaign of labels fog and 
deceptions

when baltimore symphony orchestra players laid 
down their instruments in favor of picket signs a month ago they 
were following a long tradition of militancy among symphony 
orchestra musicians 
in the past 10 years the 31 major orchestras in the united 
states have struck or been locked out 28 times according to the 
american symphony orchestra league 
musicians in general traditionally have been the most militant 
of the various entertainment groups said leonard leibowitz an 
attorney who represents baltimore symphony members and the american 
federation of musicians symphony musicians in particular have 
probably been one of the most militant 
the baltimore orchestra has gone on strike three times and been 
locked out by management once in the past 20 years said john 
gidwitz symphony executive director 
the san francisco symphony walked out for 12 days in january and 
the utah symphony orchestra struck for nearly a month this fall 
leibowitz attributed the musicians feistiness to several 
things including a belief that they should be compensated for the 
years they have spent many since childhood devoted to their art 
and their view that working in the orchestra is a career not a 
stepping stone to individual acclaim 
for us the big break is to crack a major symphony 
orchestra said charles underwood bso violinist 
gidwitz attributed the strikes to a history of inadequate wages 
that musicians reversed by walking off the job 
i hope and guardedly believe as musicians start to attain more 
reasonable salaries we will collectively find less disruptive ways 
of settling labor contracts he said 
utah symphony orchestra executive director paul chummers blamed 
unrealistic expectations by musicians who he said dont 
realize the precarious financial state in which many orchestras 
exist 
the symphony league lists 13 orchestras that are in financial 
trouble including phoenix denver detroit houston and columbus 
ohio 
chummers said symphonies commonly earn half their costs from 
ticket sales and depend on donations for the rest 
a symphonys labor problems rarely alienate audiences the 
baltimore symphony has not lost community support during the 
strike gidwitz said unless a strike lasts the entire season 
patrons usually return quickly leibowitz said 
the baltimore contract expired sept 17 informal contact 
between both sides continues but no negotiations have been 
scheduled 
in san francisco musicians walked out during the last two 
contract negotiations this year and for two weeks in the 198586 
season 
sometimes it seems you need a strike just to get the other 
side serious about negotiating said tom hemphill chairman of 
the san francisco symphony players committee 
for the bso the strike follows four years of harmony between 
management and musicians a relationship that has created a 
worldclass reputation both sides said broadcasting and recording 
contracts and european tours brought good reviews and a 40 
million fundraiser recently put the orchestra on sound financial 
footing 
because of that the dissonance that creeps into both sides 
rhetoric is almost always balanced with at least a token note of 
respect for the adversary 
the 96 players walked off the stage after their sept 23 
performance rejecting managements final offer of a 42 million 
threeyear package that would have raised salaries by 25 a week in 
the first year from 770 to 795 
the union was seeking 1015 weekly by the end of the 198889 
season the orchestra offered 980 by the end of the 199192 
season said richard hafetz attorney for symphony management 
the union wants to be paid the average of its peer orchestras 
including socalled secondtier groups such as san francisco st 
louis and houston 
management said its offer would bring salaries in line with the 
group because it totals more than the contract houston players 
recently signed the offer is about 200 less a week than san 
francisco musicians earn

ferdinand marcos claims he is relieved that he 
has finally been indicted by the united states and will have a 
chance to defend himself in court but the deposed philippine 
president has plenty of other legal troubles 
besides new york where he was indicted friday marcos is the 
target of investigations or lawsuits in honolulu los angeles 
seattle washington dc alexandria va and his homeland 
most center on his enormous wealth and influence how he got it 
and how he used it after being exiled to hawaii in 1986 
but there are also allegations of marcos involvement in the 
slayings of two opponents of his regime in seattle in 1981 torture 
of opponents in his homeland and bribery in the sale of military 
equipment to his government 
john bartko an attorney for marcos in san francisco called the 
new york indictments probably the most complex case every filed 
in us courts 
marcos trial would be without doubt one of longest and most 
ardurous criminal proceedings in us history and they the 
indictments are just one facet of an incredibly complex case 
marcos 71 his wife imelda 59 and six others were indicted 
on federal racketeering charges accused of looting more than 100 
million from the philippines to buy art and real estate in new york 
city they were also charged with defrauding lending institutions 
of more than 165 million in the purchase and financing of the real 
estate 
paradoxical as it may seem imelda and i welcome the 
opportunity to show the whole world that these allegations of 
dishonesty and criminal activity cannot be proven by our 
accusers marcos said in a statement we are confident that we 
will be vindicated 
but as his lawyers prepare their defense other investigations 
continue 
dante b fascell chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee said saturday that marcos has been subpoenaed to appear 
before the asian and pacific affairs subcomittee the 
virginianpilot and ledgerstar newspapers of norfolk va 
reported the subcommittee was investigating allegations that marcos 
funneled millions of dollars into the 1980 and 1984 campaigns of 
president reagan and vice president george bush 
richard hibey another marcos attorney confirmed that marcos 
has been subpoenaed but did not say whether he would appear 
last august in seattle a federal judge ruled that marcos and 
his wife must stand trial in a lawsuit to determine whether they 
were involved in the 1981 slayings of two antimarcos union 
officials there 
marcos claimed headofstate immunity but us district judge 
barbara rothstein ruled he lost that protection after fleeing to 
hawaii in february 1986 during the civilianmilitary revolt that 
catapulted corazon aquino to power the ruling has been appealed 
and the case is expected to be tried next year 
federal grand juries in honolulu and alexandria va have been 
investigating marcos since shortly after his arrival in the united 
states 
the honolulu investigation reportedly focuses on an alleged 1987 
plot to return marcos to power which was thwarted when philippine 
officials here alerted aquino and on an armssmuggling plot 
allegedly hatched by marcos 
the virginia investigation involves possible bribery in 
usfinanced sales of military equipment to the philippines during 
marcos 20year rule 
in the philippines 39 suits seeking to collect nearly 100 
billion are pending against marcos 
no criminal charges have been filed there because marcos has 
said he would demand his constitutional right to return to his 
homeland and face his accusers in court mrs aquino has refused to 
allow marcos return 
mr marcos will face criminal indictments in the philippines 
eventually said tomas gomez philippine consul in honolulu 
the long road to retribution and restitution has begun 
philippine officials including aquino hailed the us 
indictments because they could hasten recovery of his alleged 
hidden wealth the philippine government claims much of that 
wealth is sheltered in secret swiss bank accounts swiss 
authorities had indicated they would wait for indictments not 
civil proceedings before releasing information about frozen 
marcos accounts 
besides new york the other main us main battleground in the 
hidden wealth hunt is california where a 564 billion 
philippine suit led to the freezing by a federal judge of more than 
215 million in alleged marcos cash real estate and other assets 
including swiss accounts that suit has not been resolved 
also unresolved is a 120 million suit filed in march 1986 by 
the american civil liberties union on behalf of alleged victims of 
torture and arbitrary arrest by the marcos regime 
in honolulu the marcoses are being sued by a philippine 
treasure hunter who claims they stole from him a treasure worth 60 
billion that included a 2000pound gold statue of buddha marcos 
called the suit fantasy

a state paternity survey that asks for 
intimate details of a welfare mothers sex life is so intrusive 
its offensive a legal aid lawyer says 
one federal official said such surveys are discouraged 
human services department officials confirm that the survey asks 
women for the exact dates when sexual relations between them and 
the childrens alleged fathers began and ended according to the 
charleston sunday gazettemail 
other questions include is there anyone else who could 
possibly be the father of the child did the childs father ever 
suggest an abortion how often did you have sexual relations with 
him 
why dont i just put a video camera in my bedroom one 
unidentified woman complained to the newspaper 
human services commissioner reginia lipscomb said the survey is 
used to identify the childs father and is federally approved 
a department employee said the questionnaire does not ask even 
more personal questions that might turn up later if the matter went 
to court such as details of the mothers menstrual cycle her use 
of contraceptives and the names of other sexual partners 
lipscomb said the form was mailed to women in kanawha county 
which includes charleston who collect or have collected aid to 
families with dependent children and whose last names begin with 
letters k to z she said she did not know how many of the forms 
were sent 
my problem with the questionnaire is that it did not seem to 
be reasonably limited to the cases where information would be 
needed said bruce perrone of the legal aid society of charleston 
it was being sent out in a blanket format to all sorts of 
women i find that grossly intrusive and offensive there should be 
some screening procedure for who this is sent to 
lipscomb said she has no problem with the survey and thinks the 
only mistake the department made was to send it through the mail 
she declined to comment about specific questions 
lipscomb said federal law requires the state to learn the 
identity of fathers of nearly all children being raised by mothers 
who collect public assistance the state then tries to collect 
child support from those fathers 
she said the survey was adapted from other federal forms and 
received federal approval 
a federal official disagreed 
george hurley of the midatlantic region iii of the us 
department of health and human services said his office does not 
get involved with individual state questionnaires and even 
discourages the use of paternity questionnaires 
we are concerned about their use and wonder if they are really 
necessary hurley said 
in 1982 a federal judge ordered the california department of 
human services to interview clients in person when trying to 
establish paternity the judge also told the department to develop 
separate sets of questions so that extremely personal questions 
were not asked in cases where paternity was not in question 
paternal support is a problem in west virginia a congressional 
report says fewer men in west virginia pay support for their 
children than in almost all other states

the memory of hubert h humphrey has not 
given his son the democratic senate nominee a free ride to 
washington 
hubert h skip humphrey iii has trailed sen dave 
durenberger rminn throughout the fall campaign though 
democratic party strategists say humphrey might score an upset on 
nov 8 
humphrey also has lagged by at least a 21 margin in fund 
raising for a contest that could cost more than 10 million 
theres no question the spirit of hubert humphrey has played 
an enormous role in the minnesota race said republican 
consultant bob anderson his skips name recognition and his 
support his entry into the party has come because of his 
relationship to his father 
jesse jackson in a campaign appearance last week recalled that 
humphreys father led the fight for civil rights at the 1948 
democratic national convention 
the acorn does not fall far from the tree jackson said 
skip humphrey anticipated republican claims that he would trade 
on the reputation of his father who served in the senate from 1949 
to 1964 and again from 1971 until his death in january 1978 the 
elder humphrey also served as lyndon johnsons vice president and 
was the unsuccessful democratic presidential nominee in 1968 
i bear a famous name made famous not by me but by my father 
and my mother said humphrey 46 when he entered the senate race 
in february 
humphreys mother muriel humphrey brown was appointed to 
succeed his father and served in the senate until november 1978 
when durenberger 54 was elected to succeed her 
humphrey says he is running on his own record as minnesota 
attorney general since 1983 and as a former state senator 
i will not trade on what i have not earned humphrey said 
i will build on what i have been given 
republicans contend that his magic name is humphreys biggest 
asset after 10 years in the state senate humphrey won his first 
statewide race for attorney general in 1982 with 108 million 
votes the top votegetter in that election 
but if his name has helped being the son of the famous happy 
warrior of a generation of democratic politics also has been a 
burden 
as he would be the first to admit his father was one of a 
kind and you cant help but come up wanting in a comparison such 
as that said dj leary a political analyst and former adviser 
to the elder humphrey 
one republican wag has suggested that if humphrey presented an 
opening durenberger could retort i knew your father and youre 
no hubert humphrey 
if humphrey has been reluctant to invoke his fathers name 
durenberger has been almost eager to do so 
after humphrey aired his first ad attacking durenberger last 
spring the incumbent retorted in a commercial that the attack was 
unbefitting the humphrey name 
skips mudslinging doesnt fit in minnesota durenberger 
said skips great late father never would have started a 
campaign this way skips father knew minnesota 
but it was a different minnesota that humphreys father knew 
when the state had a reputation for liberalism in a minnesota poll 
released last week by the star tribune of minneapolis only 29 
percent of the respondents said they were liberal while 53 percent 
described themselves as conservatives and 14 percent said they were 
moderates 
durenberger survived a troubled period in his personal life he 
has reconciled with his wife after they were separated from 
february 1985 to october 1986 during the separation durenberger 
who is roman catholic moved into a christian retreat house for 
several months 
he also was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after a 
shouting match with a police officer at bostons logan airport in a 
dispute over a taxi 
each candidate has retained a highpriced east coast consultant 
to help draw comparisons between them in an increasingly negative 
tv ad war 
humphreys ads have accused durenberger of voting to increase 
defense spending and cut medicare spurning funds for antidrug 
programs while voting to send foreign aid to countries that 
actually sell illegal drugs here and helping write legislation 
that forced rural hospitals to close 
durenberger has responded in kind a recent durenberger ad says 
that although humphreys most important job as attorney general was 
to fight crime violent crime in minnesota has mushroomed since 
he took office

the coast guard was searching sunday for a 
british teenager and a schoolteacher missing after a collision 
between a greek cruise ship and an italian freighter 
a merchant marine spokesman said there was little chance of 
finding vivienne barley 14 and bernard butt 41 after fridays 
accident the teacher had originally been reported safe 
we dont think anyone could have survived so long said the 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the 6300ton cruise ship jupiter with 486 british 
schoolchildren and their teachers aboard collided with the 
5500ton italian freighter adige in piraeus harbor near athens 
killing two greek seamen and injuring more than 60 people butt a 
history teacher at bloxwith school near the town of walsall about 
80 miles northwest of london failed to board any of the charter 
flights taking survivors home on saturday according to a spokesman 
for schools abroad the organizer of the trip 
a british embassy spokesman said the girl of sutton coldfield 
in central england was last seen before the accident and must 
probably be presumed dead 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said butt at first was 
thought to have wandered off in a state of shock but now it seems 
that he may also be missing at sea 
anthony greedy a spokesman for epirotiki lines the cruise ship 
owners said butt had been reported seen helping the children in 
a hospital in the early hours of saturday but that story later 
turned out to be wrong 
in england butts elder brother neville said i think it is 
now very likely he has perished 
only one victim of the collision was still in the hospital 
sunday she was identified as mrs w howard 68 who was in stable 
condition with abdominal injuries 
greek officials blamed the italian freighter for the accident 
and arrested its skipper capt flavio caminale on charges of 
manslaughter and negligence italian officials denied the freighter 
was at fault 
the adige which was transporting a cargo of automobiles was 
preparing to dock at piraeus at the time of the collision 
we radioed the italian ship because we realized it was coming 
straight for us and told them to reverse they said they would but 
the next thing we knew theyd rammed us kyriakos moustakis the 
jupiters secondincommand told reporters 
capt caminale said his ship which was awaiting a greek pilot 
was not moving at the time of the accident he said the greek ship 
veered sharply as it approached the adige and in so turning 
the captain struck my prow

george bush wasnt sure at first exactly what 
it meant either that line about the thousand points of light but 
aides said he liked the music of the phrase 
since bush speechwriter peggy noonan penned it for bushs 
convention acceptance speech in new orleans the pointsoflight 
line has taken on a life of its own in the 1988 presidential 
campaign 
noonan a former speechwriter for president reagan also came up 
with the kinder gentler nation phrase that the republican 
nominee uses frequently 
bush aides say the thousand points of light line which has 
evolved into a description of volunteer and charity efforts that 
supplement government assistance was first a little baffling to 
the vice president 
even later bush told audiences he sympathized with those who 
werent sure what the phrase meant 
one of those was democratic rival michael dukakis who expressed 
he was puzzled by the phrase during his first debate with bush in 
late september i dont know what that means dukakis said 
even so dukakis built on the phrase telling audiences that he 
wasnt for the 1000 points of light but for 240 million points 
of light a reference to the us population 
bush occasionally has scrambled the phrase calling it 1000 
points of life and in an interview with the new york times 
bush referred to a thousand shining hills 
i cant do poetry he said 
the phrase blinked on again the other night at the al smith 
charity dinner in new york city which both presidential candidates 
attended 
bush told a joke on himself he said he and his wife barbara 
had gone to the movies the night before and had asked an usher for 
help finding a seat in the darkened theater 
the usher declined telling bush youre the one with the 
1000 points of light 
in the same speech bush gave an admiring nod to a variation on 
the theme by syndicated washington post cartoonist herblock who 
drew a beerdrinking bar patron telling a companion that he 
endorsed bushs pledge of one thousand pints of lite 
sometimes the line loses a bit of its luster as it did during 
the second presidential debate at los angeles in midoctober 
bushs media consultant roger ailes was pacing nervously 
backstage while he and other senior campaign advisers watched the 
bushdukakis encounter on television 
the hefty ailes tripped over an electrical cord bringing a lamp 
crashing to the floor and shattering 
well that means theres only 999 points of light said 
campaign adviser stuart spencer 
the secret service had concerns whether bush himself would 
become a thousand points of light when he spoke during a severe 
lightning storm at a holocaust memorial in skokie ill 
bushs security detail urged him to stay inside but bush decided 
to venture out to greet a crowd waiting in the rain with bolts of 
lightning flashing around them 
before he left security agents made him slip into thick 
thighhigh rubber boots borrowed from the local fire department he 
also was given strict advice under no circumstances touch the 
microphone

security was tightened sunday at a theater showing 
the last temptation of christ after a fire closed another 
cinema running the controversial film and injured 10 people 
the fire saturday night at the st michel cinema on the left 
bank began as patrons were leaving and apparently started in a 
theater seat the blaze heavily damaged the building the site of 
religious protests against the film 
on sunday security guards were posted outside the gaumont 
champselysees theater the only other paris house showing the film 
the blaze was under investigation by the criminal brigade of the 
city police department the unit that investigates cases of 
suspected arson 
paris archbishop jeanmarie lustiger condemned the fire and told 
those who have been demonstrating against the film you believe 
you are defending christ but you are doing exactly the contrary 
you are not behaving as christians but as enemies of christ 
said lustiger speaking during a break at a conference in lourdes 
the communist party in paris called for a demonstration monday 
outside the st michel cinema to protest attempts to inhibit 
artistic freedom 
jean desandre a spokesman for the gaumont champselysees said 
management had instructed employees to be vigilant from the day 
the film opened he said the increased security was necessary 
and that people buying tickets to the film were being searched in 
the theater lobby 
a sign posted at the front of the theater said because of 
provocative incidents by unscrupulous spectators the public is 
advised that a search will be conducted before the entrance to the 
cinema 
the film an adaptation of the 1955 nikos kazanthakis novel led 
to protests by christian groups elsewhere in europe and in the 
united states 
some christians have been offended by the films portrayal of 
jesus christ as a human being with passions and weaknesses the 
film includes a short scene in which christ imagines having sex 
with mary magdalene

the moose lodge seemed too obvious a stop so 
the meandering mammal headed for the high school in search of peace 
and quiet 
but authorities decided the school wasnt an appropriate stop 
either for the visiting moose cow which was trying to make its way 
through town and away from all those excited people with cameras 
we were afraid because at the school there are all kinds of 
windows if she had taken a jump she would probably have had to 
have been destroyed said police officer john saw in this town of 
4800 
so police and state wildlife officers blocked off traffic and 
following the loose moose on foot gradually herded it back to the 
vicinity of the moose lodge in this town in the forests and lakes 
of northeastern minnesota 
that sounds easier than it was sometimes curious people got in 
the mooses path and it veered away 
heck nobodys seen a moose for years and years in the city of 
ely saw said 
eventually the moose made it safely across a highway and a golf 
course past the moose lodge away from all those annoying people 
and into the deep woods said al heidebrink of the state department 
of natural resources 
heidebrink used to work in grand marais over on lake superior 
moose arent as uncommon there he said and people usually just 
ignore them while they find the road out of town on their own

astronauts from the shuttle discovery 
will ride in vintage corvettes once driven by speedloving pioneers 
in the nations space program for a nostalgic parade monday in this 
space coast town 
from 1967 to 1971 a melbourne chevrolet dealership gave 
astronauts the cars of their choice for 1 a year under a 
promotional lease 
almost all chose corvettes and they were easily spotted each 
was red white or blue with two stripes in the other patriotic 
colors slashed across the hood and trunk 
being the hotfooted test pilots they were craving for speed 
it was only natural for them to choose corvettes said jim 
falkowski of fort lauderdale who paid 25000 for astronaut gus 
grissoms 1967 convertible corvette and has been offered 52000 
for it 
grissom one of the seven original mercury astronauts drove the 
car until he died in the apollo 1 launch pad fire in 1967 
a 1968 corvette originally owned by astronaut alan shepard will 
be used in mondays parade along with two 1988 corvette 
convertibles on loan from jim rathmann chevrolet in melbourne 
the fivemile motorcade from patrick air force base to a cocoa 
beach motel will be modeled after a halfdozen parades held in 
cocoa beach for astronauts during the 1960s 
thousands of people lined the streets from the air base to cape 
canaveral during those parades 
it was like a big homecoming parade said bob murkshe cocoa 
beach mayor from 1963 to 1972 the astronauts would ride in open 
convertibles and people would line the streets and wave flags 
we were all working in the space program then 
about 500000 people watched the launching of discovery on sept 
28 the shuttle fleet had been grounded for 32 months since the 
january 1986 explosion of the shuttle challenger which killed all

president corazon aquino said sunday 
she hopes other countries will follow the united states example in 
indicting ferdinand marcos and help recover money marcos allegedly 
stole during his 20year reign 
manila newspapers speculated the indictment may have been a 
precondition to an accord signed in washington regarding us 
military bases in the philippines 
the agreement signed last week allows washington to keep six 
military facilities in the philippines until 1991 in exchange for 
about 962 million 
mrs aquino made her statement during her weekly radio program 
ask the president 
because this happened in the united states i hope other 
countries where we hear of reports that marcos also hid his wealth 
which is actually owned by the filipino people will help in the 
swift recovery of these stolen assets mrs aquino said 
i think it is very obvious now that crime does not pay she 
added 
marcos his wife and eight others were indicted friday in new 
york on charges they collaborated in amassing 103 million through 
embezzlement theft bribes and kickbacks funneling it through 
secret bank accounts and buying real estate 
the 71yearold former president and his 59yearold wife 
imelda also were charged with defrauding three us lending 
institutions of 165 million to buy and finance properties in the 
united states 
marcos denied the charges 
the indictment coming as it did at an uncannily short time 
after the signing of the new accord on the military bases is 
triggering all sorts of questions foremost of which are is the 
timing merely coincidental or are the two developments related 
the manila standard said 
the philippine daily globe asked could a us promise to step 
up the prosecution of mr marcos have been the real substance of a 
secret deal that has been bruited about since the signing of the 
accord 
foreign secretary raul manglapus who negotiated the bases 
agreement denied linkage

pope john paul ii on sunday beatified a 17th 
century danish scientist who converted to catholicism and served as 
a bishop in predominantly protestant germany 
during the solemn ceremony in st peters basilica the pope 
praised niels stensen as an example for scientists missionaries 
and christians around the world 
all his life niels stensen tirelessly sought the truth 
scientific and religious in the conviction that every discovery 
no matter how modest marks a step ahead toward absolute truth 
the pope said 
a top scientist never satisfied with just hypothesis and 
always in search of complete certainty he was especially moved to 
discover the ultimate reason for everything god who cant be 
discovered with the most sophisticated instruments of science 
but only through the science of the heart the pope said 
stensen was born a lutheran in copenhagen in 1638 after 
studying medicine in holland he moved to florence italy and 
converted to catholicism in 1667 
he was appointed bishop in germany where he died in schwerin in 
1686 he was buried in florences basilica of st lorenzo 
his mission in a predominantly protestant country shows how 
honesty combined with distinction and discretion can and should 
establish those relations which facilitate mutual understanding 
love and unity john paul said 
the pope said stensen should serve as inspiration for christians 
living outside their native lands in solitude or in places that 
dont understand them 
the ceremony was concelebrated by 10 cardinals and bishops from 
italy west germany and denmark about 1000 danish pilgrims 
attended 
beatification is a step toward possible sainthood in the roman 
catholic church

the mayor of the nicaraguan city of bluefields 
which was devastated by hurricane joan appealed for urgent aid 
sunday to help his city and the storm victims 
we are sending out an sos to governments agencies to the 
people in general for urgently needed help in whatever area 
health food clothing construction materials and practically 
everything said mayor henningston omeir 
omeir and lumberto campbell nicaraguas minister of state are 
part of a delegation that has been visiting denmark norway 
belgium and britain to seek support for development projects both 
men said the delegation had now decided to focus on aid for the 
hurricane victims 
hurricane joan tore across nicaragua on saturday with winds of 
125 mph and torrential rains dozens of people were killed in the 
storm 
nicaraguan radio reported the hurricane destroyed 90 percent of 
the homes in bluefields a coastal city of 60000 about 180 miles 
east of the capital managua 
campbell and omeir said the hurricane had destroyed the economy 
of a region which has little infrastructure and was already 
suffering serious economic problems 
in bluefields where the main source of income is fishing 
campbell said two fishing plants were blown down 
the mayor said his wife son and parents are in bluefields and 
that he last spoke to them on wednesday because the hurricane cut 
communications to the area 
at first since i have my family and friends and everyone at 
home i would like to be home he said but i realize going 
home without some help means nothing 
omeir said most of the 5500 homes in bluefields are modest 
wooden homes built on stilts 
near the water side the houses were right in front of the 
bay so i cant imagine them still standing those at least at the 
front of the bay he said 
the largest building in bluefields is the hospital lets hope 
its still standing omeir said 
the delegation had planned to return to nicaragua in the middle 
of the week but omeir said the visit may be extended to continue 
the appeal for aid 
the foreign office said britain through its ambassador to 
nicargua had donated 17500 in cash to a relief organization in 
nicaragua

in a brief wreathlaying ceremony at arlington national cemetery 
where some of the american victims are buried marine corps maj 
gen robert winglass said they will be remembered as turning world 
opinion against terrorists 
thats the great lesson thats learned from the beirut 
experience winglass told the solemn gathering that terrorism 
is wrong it is no longer recognized by any person of any stature 
and dignity as having any foundation in principle 
the oct 23 1983 attack on a marine compound at the beirut 
airport by a truck laden with 12000 pounds of explosives 
eventually prompted the reagan administration to withdraw 1800 
us military troops in lebanon as part of an international 
peacekeeping force 
it is difficult to recall the horror the devastation and the 
agonies that preceded this day five years ago said john knipple 
of alexandria whose son lance cpl james knipple was killed in 
the attack they need to be honored they need to be remembered 
kevin jiggets then a lance corporal in beirut and a survivor of 
the explosion said the ceremony also was to pay tribute to all 
the victims of terrorist acts and their families 
the french paratroopers were killed the same day as the 
americans in a separate terrorist attack in another part of beirut

humanitarian organization devoted to helping families who have lost 
loved ones in wars or by acts of terrorism

irans information minister said 
political parties sharply limited for years will be allowed to 
operate freely if they do not conspire against the islamic 
government 
an opposition group called the announcement nothing new 
minister mohammad mohammadi reyshahri in a statement broadcast 
sunday said as long as the parties demonstrate their commitment 
to the islamic system and abide by their commitments in action 
they can operate freely 
the statement made saturday and carried by the official islamic 
republic news agency said there would be limits on party 
activities but did not spell them out the irna report was 
monitored in nicosia 
rifts between different groups led to armed clashes between the 
opposition groups and government forces in june 1981 two years 
after the islamic revolution that toppled the shah mohammed reza 
pahlavi most parties were banned including the mujehedeen khalq 
organization and the monarchists 
the promoscow tudeh party was banned in early 1984 several 
groups went underground and worked clandestinely after the ban 
the main government party the islamic republic party and other 
islamic groups continued to operate legally but irans 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini abolished the 
irp in june 1987 after president ali khamenei and parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani said there was no need for it 
a parties act passed by the majlis or parliament in august 
1981 provided for political groups to operate legally as long as 
they upheld the constitution groups were outlawed if they 
undermined national unity sowed discord violated the principals 
of islam or the islamic foundations of the country or received 
foreign aid 
parliament had not passed the acts enforcement procedures and 
with the ministers statement the government appeared to lay the 
groundwork for that 
in baghdad iraq a spokesman for the mujahedeen khalq scoffed 
at the iranian information ministers announcement 
spokesman ali reza jaferzada said it was nothing new and was 
made for external consumption 
the regime is besieged by international condemnation for its 
massive executions and this is an attempt to beautify its ugly 
image the spokesman said 
the opposition group charges that tens of thousands of political 
opponents have been jailed and executed 
the group had joined iraq in fighting iran during the 8year 
iraniraq war iran and iraq ceased fire aug 20 under a 
unmediated peace agreement

monday is homecoming day for the uss vincennes 
the ship that mistakenly shot down an iranian airliner and the 
navy is trying to remove any unease by bringing out a band and the 
crews wives and girlfriends 
this is not one of those vietnam things with the ship coming 
in at midnight navy spokesman cmdr david dillon said were 
not going to sneak the ship in were inviting people to watch 
people understand this was an arduous deployment the sailors have 
a lot of public support 
the welcoming for the cruiser wont be any different than the 
ones given to any other navy ship returning from an extended 
deployment officials said 
a navy band will play the normal john phillip sousatype 
stuff said senior chief petty officer steve hiney its going 
to be a big story and we understand that but its a regular old 
homecoming were planning 
excited family members will be on the pier and excited sailors 
on the ship theres going to be punch and cookies new fathers are 
going to be seeing new kids for the first time the wives and 
girlfriends mothers and fathers are going to be there 
speakers at the welcoming include william rose mayor of 
vincennes ind the city which like the ship was named for a 
revolutionary war battle and rep bill lowery rcalif 
lowery organized a volunteer effort that gathered 10000 
signatures and sent the messages of support to the crew in the 
persian gulf after the july 3 accidental downing of the iranian 
airliner all 290 people aboard the civilian jet were killed 
i empathized with how low the crew the officers and the 
skipper capt will rogers iii were feeling lowery said 
their sense of isolation and anguish because of the civilian 
casualties on that airplane they had to be feeling incredibly low 
i just wanted to let them know that we understood they were 
defending their country to the best of their ability and that we 
were not passing judgment they needed to know they were not 
being abandoned 
the official pentagon report concluded that the vincennes 
mistook the airliner for an iranian f14 fighter jet and blamed 
misinterpreted readings of computer and radar data on crew stress 
in a firsttime combat situation the vincennes was engaged in a 
firefight with several iranian gunboats at the time 
dr thomas rusk a clinical associate professor of psychiatry 
said ending the vincennes tragedymarred 180day deployment with a 
normal greeting is the best way to smooth the sailors reunion 
with their families as well as society 
i think thats absolutely indicated and i applaud the navy for 
doing that said rusk who also works with police officers 
involved in shootings in his private practice and formerly 
counseled air force personnel while in the service 
these people did the best they could its terrific that they 
are being welcomed home just like anybody else he said 
but rusk a university of california san diego clinical 
faculty member said it may be a difficult homecoming for those who 
either were involved in the chain of command that led to the 
decision to fire the missile or who are emotionally unable to open 
up to others about their anguish 
theres a grieving process here because you dont come back as 
heroes rusk said there may be the perception you come back as 
inadvertent screwups you grieve the sense of failure the sense 
of loss

city efforts to keep manhattan sidewalks clear 
of debris are drawing complaints from street people who say 
sanitation workers are carting off their belongings 
the cleanup began months ago after residents on the lower east 
side complained of mattresses box springs and cardboard boxes 
blocking sidewalks near a cityrun mens shelter the sanitation 
department said 
two garbage trucks four sanitation workers and several police 
officers sweep the area once every week or two said department 
spokesman vito turso our job is to keep the streets clean he 
said we do it under police supervision because some of the 
homeless people are pretty hostile 
but an advocate for the homeless saw it differently 
weve had about a dozen complaints of homeless people getting 
their belongings taken and thrown into garbage trucks said 
robert hayes counsel for the coalition for the homeless 
they took my id clothes shorts sleeping bag everything i 
had said robert lee marion 47 who sleeps on a sidewalk they 
took my american flag about 500 records six to eight boxes of 
books its terrorism

move along with their belongings if items are abandoned on the 
street they are considered garbage and thrown away

larry kramers just say no is a sledgehammer 
farce battering everybody in sight including the audience 
its nasty savage meanspirited unnerving often in bad taste 
and surprisingly considering the possibilities only sporadically 
funny that may be the fault of director david esbjornson who has 
supervised the frantic doorslamming and bedhopping with a heavy 
hand and has neglected the comedy 
the play which arrived thursday at offbroadways wpa theater 
requires a not very great leap of imagination to identify its 
supposedly fictional characters the program proclaims any 
resemblance to actual events or to persons living or dead is in 
the eye of the beholder dont believe it 
the chararcters include the closeted homosexual mayor of the 
northeasts largest city the termagant clotheshorse wife of the 
countrys potentate who is called daddy by just about everybody 
in the play and the couples ballet dancer son who lusts after his 
secret service escorts 
the play is set in the plush townhouse of foppy schwartz the 
gay confidant and lunch buddy to mrs potentate its foppy 
selfderided as the flower behind the drone who sets the farce 
spinning hes galvanized into action as a crusader for gay rights 
when he acquires a videotape of sexual hijinks by people in high 
places 
blackmail is the order of the day as the tape is passed around 
as frequently as the bodies of course the bad guys win out in 
this morality tale and kramer supplies a chilling finale that is 
the best moment in the play until then the playwright scatters 
his potshots shooting wildly at every alleged governmental 
conspiracy of the last 25 years 
but much of it is not very funny many of the jokes depend on 
name recognition those names that have not been changed to protect 
the guilty 
the acting doesnt help matters only david margulies as the 
epicene foppy manages to be outrageous and affecting at the same 
time kathleen chalfant bears a striking resemblance to a certain 
first lady the others are given to hyperventilating particularly 
joseph ragno as the mayor and keith reddin as his boyfriend 
in the normal heart his best known play kramer was not 
afraid to shout telling the world about the inaction and 
indifference in the governments fight againt aids 
he shouts in just say no but the sound is shriller less 
personal and more diffuse this time you cant hear the play for 
all the yelling going on

blacks hope to pick up at least one new house 
member in the nov 8 elections but arent optimistic that their 
biggest political boost of the year jesse jacksons strong 
showing in the democratic primaries will result in major 
congressional gains 
if all 23 black house members win reelection and donald payne 
a newark nj councilman takes a vacant seat as expected the 
number of blacks in congress will be at its highest level ever 
all the house incumbents are democrats and only one rep 
cardiss collins of illinois is a female 
payne a democrat running against black republican michael webb 
is the frontrunner in the race for the seat left open by the 
retirement of rep peter rodino dnj chairman of the house 
judiciary committee who has represented his predominantly black 
district since 1948 
the congressional black caucus is cautiously optimistic about 
picking up a seat in louisianas 8th district where attorney faye 
williams is fighting a rematch against rep clyde holloway the 
oneterm republican 
faye is in a dead heat right now said rep mervyn m 
dymally dcalif caucus chairman she does have a chance 
another black challenger democrat betty wimbush has virtually 
no chance of upsetting rep bill young a popular republican who 
has represented the st petersburg fla area since 1970 
black rep mike espy dmiss elected in 1986 must fend off an 
enthusiastic challenge from republican businessman jack coleman in 
the 2nd district where blacks slightly outnumber whites 
ron walters a political science professor at howard university 
said espy might have a coattail problem if white voters turn 
out heavily for gop nominee george bush and rep trent lott 
rmiss who is running for a vacant senate seat 
blacks are keeping a close eye on rep alan wheat dmo 
although he was expected to win election to a fourth term wheat is 
one of the few blacks elected to congress from a majority white 
district his opponent in kansas city is community activist mary 
ellen lobb 
in an unusual development in the senate two black republican 
candidates alan keyes in maryland and maurice dawkins of virginia 
are running against two popular democrats neither republican is 
given any chance of winning 
keyes a former state department official is challenging sen 
paul sarbanes while dawkins a onetime civil rights activist with 
conservative views is opposing former gov charles robb 
soninlaw of the late president johnson 
linda williams an analyst at the joint center for political 
studies a research organization that focuses on black political 
affairs said keyes and dawkins were chosen to run in nowin 
races 
nevertheless she said the republican party will earn some 
brownie points with black americans by selecting two black 
candidates for the senate 
the only black elected to the senate since reconstruction was 
edward brooke a massachusetts republican who was defeated in 1978 
despite jacksons secondplace finish in the democratic 
presidential primaries behind michael dukakis some blacks hold 
little hope of future gains in congress unless more white americans 
can be persuaded to vote for black candidates 
walters doubts this will happen in the near future because of 
race politics in america 
some black politicians such as virginia lt gov douglas wilder 
manage to win white support by appealing to middleincome 
americans walters said wilder stressed his government experience 
when he was elected in 1986 
but walters said the toughest races for black congressional 
candidates are those in districts where a large segment of the 
white population is at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale 
it is easier for blacks in the higherincome white districts 
which tend to be more liberal walters said for instance 
jacksons white support came primarily from the neoliberal wing 
of the yuppies williams said 
even so she said jackson only received about 20 percent of the 
white vote about the same as successful black mayoral candidates 
but williams said the positive impact of the jackson campaign is 
that more blacks will run in places where they would not have run 
before she said there are about 7000 local black officeholders

roman catholics in central illinois 
offer prayers for farmers in trouble but theyre also sending a 
little cash along with the good thoughts this year 
the diocese of springfield which covers 28 counties is 
offering interestfree loans of up to 2000 to area farmers 
regardless of religious affiliation 
we would like to give some generous help which comes from 
the same heart that our prayers come from says bishop daniel 
ryan who heads the diocese 
applications will be accepted starting next month for the 1989 
loan program dubbed project isidore for the patron saint of 
farmers for the 1988 growing season the programs first about 40 
loans averaging 1000 were made the purpose of the project is 
to provide funds for farmers who are hurting funds which would 
help them not to turn away foreclosure on their properties im 
sorry to say but which would give them some money for seed or 
fertilizer or important things like that ryan said 
diocesan officials say the small loans wont save failing farms 
but might make a difference for farmers who need help 
we just dont have the availability of funds to stave off 
these enormous problems which face our farmers ryan said but 
we wanted in a realistic way to help them with some items with 
which we could be of help 
the loans are intended to help farmers with spring planting 
needs for fuel seed feed fertilizer and chemicals farmers can 
apply between nov 7 and feb 1 and loan checks will be mailed by 
the end of february 
ryan said the money for the program was not from the collection 
plate but from donors who have chosen to remain anonymous 
the size of this years program will depend in part on future 
donations as well as on the ability of the farmers helped so far to 
repay their loans 
we do not demand but we certainly expect repayment so that 
we can help others who are in similar plights ryan said 
the bishop said there could be an increase in the number of 
applicants this year because of the drought which hit illinois 
hard the us department of agriculture estimated earlier this 
month that the states farmers will have the worst corn yield in 28 
years and the lowest soybean yield in 14 years 
diocese officials say the program the only one of its kind in 
illinois is patterned after a similar loan program offered in 
milwaukee 
harold dodd president of the illinois farmers union praised 
the diocese for getting involved 
i think its a very commendable thing for the diocese to be 
doing this dodd said i would have to agree that thats not 
going to cure peoples problems but every little bit helps

the pittsburgh cancer institute has started 
human testing of a treatment that doctors hope will enhance the 
bodys ability to fight cancer and maybe dissolve malignant tumors 
two patients at the center were the first people to receive the 
treatment in vitro sensitization or ivs which previously had been 
tested only on mice the pittsburgh press reported sunday 
studies have shown the process fights remaining tumor cells in 
mice the newspaper said in some cases the animals cancer has 
been eliminated entirely 
researchers say it is too soon to tell what effect the treatment 
has had on the two patients their patients identity and the type 
of cancer they had were not disclosed the tests began in june 
i have no question but that at some point in the 
intermediateterm future this will be of therapeutic benefit 
said dr john m kirkwood one of two principal investigators in 
the study 
dr norman wolmark the other lead investigator said the 
information gathered in the study should be useful in pointing the 
way even if there is no immediate effect on the two patients 
tumors i think the treatment can be modified in the hope that a 
successful tumor response will result he said 
in vitro sensitization involves removing a tumor and irradiating 
it to inactivate the tumor cells researchers told the press the 
cells are combined with a bacterium commonly used to vaccinate 
against tuberculosis in order to stimulate the patients immune 
system 
the patient then is injected with the irradiated cells to 
produce sensitized lymphocytes or cells critical to the bodys 
natural defense against disease and infection researchers said 
other steps in the complex treatment involve the use of the 
tumorfighting hormone interleukin2 
researchers told the press it may be two years or more before 
enough patients are treated for a sufficient amount of time to know 
the effectiveness of the treatment 
the groundwork for the treatment was begun more than five years 
ago at the national cancer institute in washington by research 
scientist suyu shu in 1986 shu moved to the pittsburgh cancer 
institute which is affiliated with the university of pittsburgh 
where he continued his laboratory work with mice he recently left 
for the university of michigan 
shus approach called adoptive cellular immunotheraphy is not 
a widely used approach to cancer research most tumors are not 
recognized or only weakly recognized by the bodys immune system 
and therefore continue growing because the immune system does 
little to attack them said dr ronald herberman director of the 
pittsburgh cancer institute 
this is basically the main reason there has not been great 
emphasis in research to enhance the immune system he told the 
newspaper 
herberman said researchers ideally would like to see some 
almost immediate shrinkage of the tumor but it may not happen that 
way 
its a tall order to expect this kind of treatment would 
actually make a large tumor melt away he said

soviet attorneys hope reforms in their 
country will give them more independence and are looking to the 
american bar association as a possible model for a soviet lawyers 
organization a law journal reports 
a delegation of lawyers and judges from the soviet union met 
with their counterparts at aba offices in washington and chicago in 
the past two weeks the legal newspaper the daily journal 
reported in mondays editions 
delegates candidly discussed problems concerning the soviet 
legal system and the effects of soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs 
policy of perestroika or restructuring on the legal profession 
we have to have perestroika in the essence of our law said 
group leader venyamin yakovlev and because advokati lawyers 
know the practical realities that perestroika can have on the 
practice of law it is important to have an independent union of 
lawyers that can push for change 
the delegation included a justice of the latvian supreme court 
district judges from moscow and leningrad law professors several 
private attorneys procurators similar to american prosecutors 
and police investigators 
theyre interested in our structure as they restructure 
said aba presidentelect stanley chavin theyre beginning to 
envision the practice of law as a freestanding institution of its 
own 
members of the delegation expressed hope that soviet attorneys 
will have a bigger role in shaping their countrys laws 
but yakovlev said reform may be slow in coming and blamed that 
on the bureaucracy at the ministry of justice which he called 
too big too slow and too slowthinking 
the ministry puts ministry officials on public bodies evaluates 
lawyers work and regulate the number of lawyers some critics say 
that peoples rights are eroded under the present system because 
for example the state could give a lawyer a poor evaluation for 
helping a defendant too strongly 
psychological preconceptions against change are the main 
roadblock we have to remove the legal apparatus still operates 
along familiar lines its very difficult to cope with new ideas 
yakovlev said 
some soviet lawyers envision an attorneys organization that 
would work for an independent judiciary lobby the supreme soviet 
on legislation and file friend of the court briefs before the 
supreme court in moscow 
traditionally the soviets never had lobbyists or special 
interest groups since they could not acknowledge that people had 
interests different than the state said randy bregman program 
director at the institute of international law

prime minister yitzhak shamir in a 
debate sunday with foreign minister shimon peres accused his rival 
of election interference by seeking the support of jordans king 
hussein for peres peace plan 
peres countered that shamir misquoted him during the televised 
debate and claimed shamir staffers have lied to the voters 
i propose to mr shamir to urge his people to speak the 
truth peres said 
the halfhour debate is the only one scheduled before the nov 1 
parliamentary election shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc 
and labor party leader peres reiterated their positions on middle 
east peace initiatives 
shamir called for direct talks with arab leaders on palestinian 
autonomy and peres said only an international peace conference 
would bring hussein and the palestinians to the negotiating table 
about 200 reporters and party activists watched the debate over 
closedcircuit television in likuds television studio in the kfar 
maccabia sports village 
aides for both sides claimed victory but suggested the debate 
would have little influence on israels undecided voters estimated 
at 8 percent of the 29 million eligible voters 
shamir and peres have ruled in a coalition government since the 
1984 elections ended in stalemate 
shamirs most heated remarks came when asked to comment on a 
us television program last week in which peres and hussein 
appeared separately for interviews hussein said a shamir victory 
would be an absolute disaster 
i must say that to involve an arab ruler in israels election 
campaign is crass interference it is unprecedented said shamir 
shamir who opposes an international conference claimed peres 
rejected the idea three years ago he quoted peres as saying such a 
forum would lead to an israeli defeat 
peres accused shamir of misquoting him deliberately these are 
very terrible and serious allegations peres said 
he also said shamir was playing a verbal game in talking 
about palestinian autonomy 
id advise mr shamir to read the likud platform peres 
said pulling out the document it is written there implement 
the right to exert sovereignty over judea samaria the west bank 
and gaza 
peres has said he is willing to give up some of the 
israelioccupied west bank of the jordan river and gaza strip to 
the palestinians for peace he maintains this is better than trying 
to govern the occupied lands 15 million arabs against their will 
shamir refuses to give up any of the land seized from egypt and 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war he favors negotiating limited 
autonomy for the palestinians 
shamir insisted that only direct negotiations could bring a 
settlement with arab nations and the palestinians 
during a 10month palestinian uprising in the occupied lands 
more than 300 palestinians and six israelis have been killed 
in a related development the israeli newspaper hadashot said in 
an unattributed report sunday that peres tried to get hussein to 
visit jerusalem before the elections as part of a peace initiative 
but the monarch refused 
the foreign ministry declined comment 
in baghdad iraq palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafat was quoted sunday as urging arabisraelis to 
participate in israeli elections because they can push forward 
the peace process 
by participating in the elections arabs can assure themselves 
of 1415 seats in israels 120member parliament and influence the 
government arafat was quoted as telling egypts middle east news 
agency the report was monitored in cairo

the fbi is examining a report by pakistan on 
the plane crash two months ago that killed pakistani president 
mohammad zia ulhaq to determine whether to pursue an independent 
investigation of its own officials said sunday 
weve been forwarded the report by the justice and state 
departments and were analyzing it now fbi spokesman demery 
bishop said of the pakistani investigation into the aug 17 crash 
that also killed the us ambassador to the country and 28 others 
aboard 
its more of an inquiry now bishop said whether we will 
go forward with it or the next step is uncertain at this point 
the pakistani investigation which was assisted by a team of 
us technical experts concluded that sabotage was the most likely 
cause of the crash according to parts of the report made public 
last week 
members of congress were briefed on the report by pentagon and 
state department officials in closeddoor meetings last week 
reportedly they were told the pakistani investigation was unable 
to pin down the exact cause of the crash 
among those killed were us ambassador arnold raphel and brig 
gen herbert m wassom the senior american defense official 
stationed in pakistan 
the crash and the investigation into it has been a sensitive 
issue for us officials because of zias role with encouragement 
from the united states in helping supply rebel guerrillas in their 
fight against soviet troops in neighboring afghanistan

more than 450 years after copernicus proved the 
earth revolves around the sun millions of adult americans seem to 
think its the other way around a researcher said sunday 
its a fairly dire situation said jon miller director of 
the public opinion laboratory at northern illinois university who 
conducted a nationwide survey for the national science foundation 
the results show that on very basic ideas vast numbers of 
americans are scientifically illiterate he said in a telephone 
interview 
in the telephone survey of 2041 adults 18 or older conducted 
in july people were asked about 75 questions testing their 
knowledge of basic science miller said the survey had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 3 percent 
asked whether the earth goes around the sun or the sun around 
the earth 21 percent replied incorrectly seven percent said they 
didnt know 
of the 72 percent who answered correctly 45 percent said it 
takes one year for the earth to orbit the sun 17 percent said one 
day 2 percent said one month and 9 percent didnt know 
the responses indicate that about 55 percent of adult americans 
or some 94 million people dont know that the earth revolves 
around the sun once a year miller said 
it shows that there are basic misunderstandings about some of 
the things we would have presumed virtually everyone would have 
known said miller a political science professor at northern 
illinois university in dekalb about 60 miles west of chicago 
a similar survey conducted by the polling group in 1985 
indicated that only about 5 percent of adult americans could be 
considered scientifically literate with basic knowledge of 
scientific vocabulary methodology and an understanding of the 
impact of science on the world miller said 
miller said the latest results which havent been fully 
tabulated yet should put the literacy rate in the 5 to 7 percent 
range the survey results will be incorporated into an national 
science foundation report to be issued next year on the state of 
american science and technology 
leon lederman who was named cowinner of the 1988 nobel prize 
for physics called the latest findings pretty devastating 
im not surprised but its much worse than anyone had 
expected he said sunday in a telephone interview how you can 
preserve democracy when the world is increasingly more complex 
scientifically and technologically and people are increasingly 
more ignorant of the issues 
lederman said he plans to retire next year as director of the 
fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia ill to teach 
physics to freshmen at the university of chicago 
get them while theyre young if you get them as a senior 
its too late he said we have to roll up our sleeves and get 
to work to improve and solve the scientific literacy question 
in an election year in which candidates are talking about 
issues like the strategic defense initiative acid rain the 
greenhouse effect and the space race the survey results indicate 
many americans have little idea of what the candidates are talking 
about miller said 
asked a truefalse question on whether lasers an essential 
component of the star wars defense system work by focusing sound 
waves only 36 percent of the respondents correctly answered the 
statement was false twentynine percent thought it was true and 35 
percent said they didnt know 
lasers work by focusing light waves 
i think the next president and congress have to face this 
issue of scientific illiteracy in some fashion or the other he 
said 
miller says schools deserve a lot of blame for doing a poor job 
in teaching math and science

hot colors burst onto the scene in enrico coveris 
sunday readytowear show for next summer an alternative to the 
more subdued spice tones and summer darks shown nearly everywhere 
else this week 
coveri has always been known for his bright colors but this 
time he outdid himself in easy clothes that didnt pretend to be 
high fashion 
one entire sports line shorts knotted blouses short skirts 
was made up in the stars and stripes of old glory coveri also 
showed long jackets with narrow or wide pants and the paris 
favorite of little boleros and pantskirts best in solid black or 
white linen 
but it was the maypole ribbons that really stood out 
multicolored maypole streamers covered sleeves and belts laced 
bare midriffs and fluttered from picture hats 
coveri offered a grand finale of strapless evening chiffons with 
the multicolored maypole effect in draped chiffon the prettiest 
were in shades of raspberry and pink or chartreuse and moss greens 
christian lacroix also offered a hotanddark color palette in 
his luxe show a collection between couture and readytowear 
with clothes selling at around 5000 or more per item 
there was nearly enough neon pink and green in the luxury 
cottons and chiffons to evoke miami beach and some spectators 
preferred lacroixs less expensive more versatile readytowear 
clothes shown last week 
but sundays wellcut clothes had their own charm and the 
antidote to electric colors was plenty of black and white 
besides some short and fitted ottoman cotton suits lacroix 
mixed themes of flower and polka dot prints in crepe de chine 
dresses or pareodraped strapless dresses with midcalf skirts 
tiny boleros heightened the long effect 
his favorite remained highwaisted flared linen pants suits and 
jumpsuits and he brought out some of his trademark full trapeze 
coats 
but the prettiest and most practical chiffons in bright green 
pink or black featured a removable long full skirt with a big 
satin bow over the sheath underneath giving two kinds of dress in 
one 
japanese designer issey miyake is considered as much artist as a 
maker of clothes and following his show fans went to the opening 
of his retrospective at the fashion museum in the decorative arts 
wing of the louvre 
in his show for next summer miyake wowed the audience with his 
use of a new type of cotton that had builtin tiny pleats to look 
like delicate ribbing in pearly grey the dresses had a geometric 
or folded paper look like dozens of versions of a walking chinese 
lantern 
he also threw in cotton tunics and dresses in redwhiteblue 
french flag colors along with hightopped suspender jumpsuits in 
saffron royal blue or chartreuse 
martine sitbon who sometimes dips into the costume bag for 
ideas was inspired this time by l8thcentury dandies with pointed 
tails or swallowtails the jackets over knickers or fuller pants 
came out in hotpepper red aubergine orange or okra green with 
big ruffled jabots for the aristocratic touch

prime minister herbert blaize told 
his countrymen sunday never to repeat the bitter fratricidal 
upheaval that brought a usled invasion of this tiny caribbean 
island five years ago 
eagles do not pay attention to flies blaize said in a 
message marking the invasion like the eagles grenadians should 
soar above petty squabbles and individual differences should try 
to understand and help each other and together concentrate on the 
solution of their problems 
the prime ministers message recalled the events of oct 19 
1983 at army headquarters at fort george then known as fort 
rupert 
then prime minister maurice bishop had been put under house 
arrest on oct 13 during a power struggle within his leftist 
government but six days later a crowd of thousands marched to his 
house and freed him 
bishop and some followers went to fort rupert where army troops 
in three armored vehicles attacked them with mortars and automatic 
weapons 
bishop some members of his cabinet and others were lined up 
against a wall and shot about 50 people were killed 
we were the targets of the guns in a war among brothers 
blaize said in a message read at all of the churches of this 
133squaremile island about 100 miles north of venezuela we 
shot and killed our own parents and brothers devastated our land 
and wasted our property we pray god that never again should we be 
subjected to such cruel experience and wasteful carnage 
on oct 25 the united states invaded grenada along with 
military units from from seven caribbean nations eighteen 
americans 45 grenadans and 29 cubans were killed during the 
fighting 
in 1984 blaize helped form the new national party which won 
parliamentary elections later that year it was the first elected 
government in grenada since 1979 
in his message sunday blaize said confrontation is the route 
most likely to lead to national catastrophe 
we should always keep in mind that the path of confrontation 
will sooner or later bring about selfannihilation for the whole 
nation as was so poignantly demonstrated five years ago he said

the director of training at a police academy where 
16 cadets were hospitalized for dehydration and exhaustion says he 
wouldnt do anything differently given what he knew at the time 
state trooper charles b gilmore 31 defended the academys 
training regimen and his own conduct two months ago saying he 
urged the cadets to drink plenty of water and that he reduced their 
exercise schedules 
gilmore said he thinks daily of timothy shepard 25 the police 
recruit who collapsed while running around a track went into a 
coma and required a liver transplant 
i feel bad for tim shepard and i feel for his family 
gilmore said there isnt a day that goes by that i dont think 
about him but i look back and with what i knew i wouldnt have 
done anything differently there was no detection of anything going 
wrong until he went down on the track 
gilmore said he was not responsible for screening candidates for 
the criminal justice training center in agawam which trains police 
officers for cities and towns in western massachusetts 
he had assumed that the entrance requirements were the same as 
for the state police academy in framingham he said it was not 
until three days into the training course that another officer 
cpl william coulter reviewed the prescreening material and found 
that only 20 of the 50 cadets in the class were in good enough 
shape to cope gilmore said 
gilmore also said he never received a 1985 memo from the 
criminal justice training council urging moderate exercise and 
banning some aspects of socalled stress training 
many states have abandoned stress training which is intended to 
produce anxiety and confusion through unclear orders verbal abuse 
sudden actions humiliating discipline and other pressures 
there has been a civilization of police training but 
massachusetts is a real dinosaur situation it is really a 
shocking perversion said george kirkham a criminologist at 
florida state university 
massachusetts is an anachronism when it comes to law 
enforcement its 40 years behind the times added los angeles 
deputy police chief louis reiter you could never show that this 
kind of training makes a better police officer 
but gilmore defended stress training saying it prepares 
officers for the highstress situations they face on the job 
after the controversy erupted over the illnesses of the cadets 
gilmore voluntarily requested reassignment from the training center 
to the state police academy the center is under investigation by 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon

the crew of a freight train say they feel 
theyve been abandoned by the government since their train ran over 
the legs of a protester who sat on railroad tracks outside the 
concord naval weapons station 
even though we do work for the navy and i should not say this 
we have not received any public support from the navy and that is 
something i am very bitter about brakeman bob mayfield said 
saturday at a rally near the base about 35 miles east of san 
francisco 
about 40 people turned out at the event set up to raise money 
and public support for the crews defense against a lawsuit filed 
by maimed protester s brian willson who lost both lower legs 
crew attorney bill kolin said the government originally offered 
to pay defense attorneys but at lower than average rates now the 
government refuses to pay anything he said 
a threeman civilian crew was operating the train sept 1 
1987 when willson and others sat on the tracks to protest arms 
shipments to central america willson was the only demonstrator 
seriously hurt 
since the incident mayfield engineer david a humiston and 
conductor ralph dawson have not returned to work and meet weekly 
with a psychologist 
they say they were not warned that protesters planned to block 
the train although base officials knew about it in advance 
it was a terrible accident and i hate that he had to suffer 
like he did but the fact remains that he is not the only one 
suffering said dawson 
during the saturday rally the arms shipment protest continued 
nearby 
demonstrator diane poole said the crews superiors knew the 
protesters were on the tracks and the crew was guilty of 
following orders 
i was deeply moved from what the train crew said and i feel a 
lot of personal empathy for them poole said ive seen a lot 
of lies but not from the train crew 
willson has spent the last year speaking out against us 
intervention in central america

police said sunday that a lebanese woman 
arrested in milan planned to deliver photographs of american 
hostages to an italian man who has been linked to arms scandals and 
the italian secret service 
the man aldo anghessa was questioned by police after they 
found the photos and a letter from a hostage hidden in a false 
bottom of the womans suitcase thursday authorities said she said 
anghessa was to receive them they reported 
fortunato finoli deputy director of milans police 
antiterrorist unit refused to say what anghessa told police or 
who he might be representing the italian was released after 
questioning 
the lebanese woman identified as aline ibrahim rizkallah 36 
was charged with carrying 1000 in counterfeit us bills and 50 
grams of heroin police said she was in jail in milan 
the rome daily la repubblica said anghessa had ties to the us 
drug enforcement administration the us embassy refused comment 
on the report 
police were still checking sunday to see if the photographs of 
terry anderson alann steen and another man were originals said 
finoli 
police also asked us authorities for samples of steens 
handwriting to authenticate the letter bearing his name finoli 
said by telephone 
the third photograph originally was believed to be of hostage 
thomas sutherland but authorities later decided they were unsure 
and were still examining the picture finoli said 
the identification of anghessa added a new twist to the case 
which police first described saturday 
italian media speculated that anghessa may have been acting as a 
gobetween in efforts to free hostages held in lebanon police 
refused to comment on his role 
anghessa 44 who has dual swissitalian nationality was 
arrested a year ago following the seizure of a lebanese cargo ship 
off bari in southern italy police said the ship was carrying drugs 
and weapons for use by the mafia and middle east terrorists linked 
to palestinian extremist abu nidal 
the case was dubbed italys irangate scandal by italian 
media after investigating magistrates said the cargo was part of a 
ring that also delivered italian mines to iran via syria 
anghessa was charged with organizing groups for illegal export 
of weapons international drug trafficking and organizing an armed 
band for terrorist ends however the charges were later dropped 
he has also worked as an informer for swiss and italian secret 
services according to reports by officials in both countries last 
year italian authorities have not given details of his role in the 
secret services but the italian news media said he worked in 
several countries including lebanon 
the lebanese woman said she was a courier and denied knowing 
anything about the photos the letter or other documents written in 
italian that were hidden in her suitcase police said 
authorities were still trying to decipher the documents which 
appeared to be in code finoli said the letter bearing steens 
name was written in english and expressed thanks to everyone who 
was working for his liberation finoli said 
the lebanese woman arrived at milans linate airport on thursday 
on a middle east airlines flight from beirut 
she told police an italian man was to receive the photographs 
and documents police traced anghessa through a telephone number in 
the womans purse newspapers said 
newspapers said the woman told police the heroin was to be 
delivered to a different man 
finoli said the woman told them she was a maronite christian 
guerrilla until last year she has a lebanese passport but was born 
in jordan police said 
maronites are a westernoriented group that oppose proiranian 
fundamentalist factions like those holding the us hostages 
anderson and sutherland are held by islamic jihad while steens 
kidnapping has been claimed by the islamic jihad for the liberation 
of palestine 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld foreign hostage in lebanon he was 
kidnapped on march 16 1985 
sutherland acting dean of agriculture at the american 
university of beirut was abducted three months later he is of 
fort collins colo 
steen of boston was kidnapped on jan 24 1987 at beirut

there are nine americans held by proiranian extremist factions 
linked to hezbollah or party of god other foreigners believed

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
said in a speech made public sunday that authorities will not 
hesitate to use force if needed to protect the nations communist 
system 
he also called on the opposition to avoid extreme elements 
jaruzelski said union pluralism can be allowed in poland only 
when the economy is improved and alternative political forms are 
created so that unions do not serve as vehicles for political 
demands 
i am aware that no polish problem can be solved in the long 
run by force reaching for it is an extreme measure although the 
hand will not shake if there are attempts at destabilization and an 
overthrow of the socialist state he said 
but our force should be first of all in facts and arguments 
he added and the success of economic policies will determine the 
extent of public support for the authorities 
jaruzelski spoke friday in warsaw to a meeting of 500 
progovernment workers from around the country excerpts of the 
speech were not made public until sunday 
there was a wave of strikes in august with workers demanding 
that the outlawed solidarity union be legalized solidarity 
chartered by the government during strikes in 1980 was suspended 
in december 1981 and subsequently declared illegal 
the strikes last august ended when the government promised to 
hold roundtable talks with the opposition that could include the 
topic of solidaritys future 
both sides have said they want the talks to start as soon as 
possible and have blamed the other for delays 
jaruzelski head of the polish united workers communist party 
said both political and economic conditions must be right for union 
pluralism 
his party has said a strong economy is needed if solidarity is 
to be legalized because legalization would set off a bidding 
war of economic demands between solidarity and the existing 
official unions 
jaruzelski said other conditions for union pluralism are that 
all partners to discussions in poland recognize the country will 
remain part of the soviet bloc that there could not be foreign 
financial support for solidarity and that solidarity avoid 
extremist and anticommunist forces

thousands of nicaraguans fleeing their wartorn and 
economically ravaged homeland are coming to dade county and the 
influx is straining social services hospitals and schools 
officials said 
the central american nations economy is worsening and us aid 
to contra rebels has been curtailed leaving a bleak future for 
many nicaraguans heavily latin dade county which includes miami 
is a natural destination 
as many as 300 nicaraguans a week have been arriving in recent 
months said perry rivkind district director of the us 
immigration and naturalization service 
in 1980 most of the 125000 cubans who came to florida in the 
mariel boat lift settled in dade county along with tens of 
thousands of haitians the sudden influx caused severe social 
problems local officials are now concerned that a similar 
situation could develop with the nicaraguans 
its going to be another mariel said rosario kennedy 
miamis vice mayor weve got to do something 
most nicaraguans are in a legal limbo and county and state 
officials cant obtain the federal aid that helped the county cope 
with the cubans and haitians 
call them entrants call them refugees call them whatever you 
want but the federal government must do something said bobby 
bernal county aide for refugee affairs because they will 
continue to come 
the county said most of the estimated 75000 to 100000 
nicaraguans in the county didnt qualify for the federal amnesty 
offered earlier this year to illegal aliens who arrived before 
1982 ins has granted 5000 of the 50000 requests for political 
asylym sought by nicaraguans 
the ins is issuing work permits to asylum applicants and the 
reagan administration has decided not to deport noncriminal 
nicaraguans even if they are here illegally but they do not 
qualify for federally funded programs such as food stamps or job 
training 
in the last three months more nicaraguan children have enrolled 
in local schools than at any time since the 1979 leftist sandinista 
revolution said ralph robinett executive director of the dade 
school systems bilingual and and foreign education 
from july to september 1653 nicaraguans registered for the 
first time pushing their total past 10000 in dade schools many 
of the students are poorly educated and need extra help 
they need to have a lot of remedial help robinett said the 
schools bilingual program isnt geared to deal with remedial needs 
but instead assumes students are fluent in spanish 
private efforts are being overburdened the nicaraguan 
assistance center is falling behind on its bills and charity 
funding is down officials say 
we do what we can said the rev francisco santana whose 
sweetwater parish our lady of divine providence is often a first 
stop for nicaraguans but i dont know how long we can stand it 
christianity says we cant turn them away but the numbers are such 
that we cant help them all

a woman who went undercover to help police 
arrest the six men who were supplying her daughters with drugs says 
the two are not speaking to her anymore 
pat morrison 44 also says her roommate has asked her to move 
and that she lives in fear of the people arrested wednesday after 
her work for the dallas ore police department 
in spite of it all morrison a mother of four and grandmother 
of two says she has no regrets she wanted to help her grown 
daughters get off drugs and she did the only thing she could think 
of she infiltrated the group that allegedly supplied her 
daughters with drugs from a methamphetamine lab 
i gave it a lot of thought because i didnt want to get the 
girls in trouble she said saturday i dont want em to have a 
record but i kept thinking of what drugs were doing to my 
girls 
morrison said she tried the drug herself a couple of times 
mixing it with milk to disguise the smell and taste but she didnt 
like what it did to her 
worse yet she was terrified by the grip drugs had on her 
daughters aged 21 and 24 who were living in their cars and 
selling drugs to support their habits 
in desperation morrison called authorities and offered to give 
them information about the suppliers they agreed and morrison 
soon was making daily treks to the fiveacre farm where her 
daughters bought drugs 
at first she pretended to be looking for her daughters before 
long people began feeling relaxed and eventually they started to 
open up she said 
as they talked about their operation they didnt guess that 
their words were being picked up by detectives hiding in a nearby 
motor home morrison was recording conversations through a hidden 
microphone 
morrison said that while she was afraid of the group she grew 
to like the friendly quiet people at the farm 
there toward the end it was really hard to do what i did 
she said of the twoweek project 
morrison figured the matter would be closed once the arrests 
were complete but reports of her mission stirred media interest 
since then she has had calls from a book publisher and tv movie 
producers 
though morrison would like to tell about her experiences right 
now she says she has more pressing problems 
her 3yearold granddaughter aquila needs her attention her 
16yearold car has broken down and her roommate left a note for 
her saturday asking morrison to move because the woman fears for 
her safety 
the police are keeping an eye on morrison who is concerned for 
her safety because four of the six men have been released on bail 
and though her daughters are hardly speaking to her she is 
hopeful they will understand someday 
i didnt know if it would help but i had to try said 
morrison the police cannot do this all by themselves why dont 
people do something about drugs instead of just sitting home 
worrying about them

lloyd bentsen and the rev jesse jackson accused republican 
nominee george bushs campaign sunday of injecting racism into the 
presidential campaign by pounding democrat michael dukakis over the 
massachusetts prison furlough issue 
a bush spokesman said the charge was absolutely ridiculous and 
stems from desperation politics 
dukakis attended a breakfast in boston with jackson and eight 
other black political leaders who pledged to support the 
massachusetts governors campaign in the remaining two weeks before 
the nov 8 election 
then dukakis flew via wisconsin to california for a full day of 
campaigning monday for that crucial states 47 electoral votes 
bush and his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana took a 
respite from campaigning at their washington homes 
the tenor and substance of the gop tickets campaign advertising 
on television dominated the political dialogue sunday 
bentsen the democratic vice presidential candidate told a 
television interviewer he thought the bush campaign was making a 
racist appeal by focusing on willie horton jr a black convicted 
murderer who escaped in 1986 from a massachusetts prison furlough 
in 1987 horton brutally stabbed a white maryland man and twice 
raped his fiancee horton is currently imprisoned in maryland 
asked if use of the horton case constituted an element of 
republican racist appeal bentsen replied when you add it up 
i think there is and thats unfortunate and i just dont want to 
see this election won on that kind of packaging and that kind of 
distortions 
dukakis campaign vice chairman john sasso said dukakis agreed 
with those comments 
in boston jackson avoided the word racist but said the 
horton case was one of several rather ugly raceconscious 
signals sent out by the bush campaign 
there have been a number of rather blatantly raceconscious 
signals that have had the impact of instilling ungrounded fear in 
whites and alientation from blacks jackson told reporters after 
the 90minute breakfast with dukakis 
the use of the willie horton example is designed to create the 
most horrible psychosexual fears jackson said the furlough 
ad with black and brown faces rotating in and out of jail the use 
of the jacksondukakis ticket symbolism which is distortion 
referring to me as a chicago hustler there have been a number 
of rather ugly raceconscious signals sent from that campaign 
dukakis made no mention of the prison furlough issue in a short 
statement after the breakfast he said only that it had been a 
good constructive meeting and that he was pleased by the black 
leaders commitment to his campaign 
but at an airport rally in eau claire wis dukakis said bushs 
disavowal of a brochure being distributed in michigan that says 
massachusetts convicts are voting for dukakis was an inadequate 
response 
disavowal isnt enough dukakis told the crowd of about 500 
people lets get that stuff out of this campaign 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin said that for bentsen and 
jackson to insinuate that the furlough issue has racial overtones 
is absolutely ridiculous and stems from desperation politics 
goodin said the gop campaigns television commercials focused 
not on horton but on how he got out of prison he said 
correctly that massachusetts granted furloughs to convicted 
firstdegree murderers serving life without the possibility of 
parole that policy was rescinded last spring 
to insinuate that racism is involved in the furlough issue 
operates from the ridiculous premise that black citizens care less 
about having a monster in their neighborhoods like willie horton 
than do white people goodin said 
that is totally incorrect and an outrageous suggestion he 
said anyone who makes it should be ashamed of themselves 
bentsen interviewed on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley said if bush wins on the basis of such a campaign i 
think thatd be a tragedy and i think thats one of the reasons 
the american people will turn against them with that kind of 
campaign and thats why i think were going to put it all 
together 
on the same tv program senate minority leader robert dole 
rkan a former bush opponent in the gop primaries also was asked 
if the bush campaigns willie horton ads were racially motivated 
i dont think thats the case he replied but then added 
im not involved in the bush campaign i can defend george bush 
but im not sure i can defend every ad 
kitty dukakis the democratic nominees wife appeared on 
cbstvs face the nation to say her husband had 
underestimated how vitriolic how vicious how negative those 
false attacks were by the bush campaign 
she said some of the bush campaign charges reminded her of the 
worst kind of mccarthylike technique from the 
communisthunting 1950s and of the dirty tricks of president 
nixons election campaigns 
on nbcs meet the press program charles black media 
consultant for the bush campaign denied that his colleagues are 
running a dirty campaign black said that weve presented 
assertions and facts that are all documented and that are all 
true 
democratic national chairman paul kirk said on the same program 
that the bush tv advertising campaign has been unprecedented in 
terms of the politics of deception deliberate distortion 
distraction from the issues that the american people are facing in 
the 1990s and disguised behind labels 
in other developments a new poll conducted for the dallas 
morning news and the houston chronicle showed that the bushquayle 
ticket led the dukakisbentsen ticket among likely texas voters by 
52 percent to 42 percent 
if bush were pitted only against dukakis without regard for 
their vice presidential running mates bush led dukakis by 56 
percent to 40 percent according to the survey of 776 potential 
voters conducted between oct 17 and oct 20 
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage 
points

frightened dogs watched from the 
roofless ruins of houses sunday as thousands of people who survived 
hurricane joan set up makeshift shelters cleared streets and 
shared their food 
bluefields had been celebrating its 85th anniversary with a fair 
that included dancing gambling and reggae music when warnings of 
the impending hurricane began few believed it would be as bad as 
it was 
during the height of the storm at 3 am saturday roofs and 
downed trees went flying through the air pounded into buildings by 
125 mph winds 
as the hurricane subsided after dawn dazed people began 
appearing in the streets soldiers carrying elderlyn women 
carrying their children girls carrying dolls 
the number of buildings that still had their roofs could be 
counted on the fingers of two hands the hotel caribe the radio 
station the colombian consulate the jail the moravian college 
and the roman catholic cathedral part of it 
now nobody can laugh at us said one impoverished survivor 
in tattered clothes nobody has anything 
the new city hall dedicated only last week during the 
anniversary celebration was reduced to a roofless skeleton so was 
the moravian church near the harbor 
streets were littered with the bodies of parrots rats bats and 
dogs 
despite the destruction only 21 people perished in bluefields 
said william ramirez a sandinista party official in charge of 
recovery efforts he said there were many injuries but few were 
serious 
the city with a population of 38000 may have been saved by 
its bay which protected it from the huge waves and tremendous 
storm surge that is usually the most serious killer in hurricanes 
the only communications with the outside were via government 
radio telephones were out and no roads penetrate the jungle that 
surrounds bluefields 
authorities drafted prisoners to help clear the road to the 
airport the first relief flight from cuba arrived shortly after 
noon sunday carrying doctors 
many neighborhoods in this city populated mainly by blacks and 
indians have american names brooklyn harlem new york in many 
of those poor neighborhoods not one house was left standing 
there isnt enough left of the houses to make a fire said a 
red cross nurse 
there were the unlucky ones a fishing boat that tried to escape 
up a flooded river sank killing a woman and her two children two 
women who took shelter in the anglican church perished when it 
collapsed 
but there was no panic except among the children at the height 
of the storm according to ramirez 
the people of bluefields are valiant and never were afraid 
he said 
people shared what food they had many fishing boats were 
destroyed but others were being repaired 
ramirez said many people have relatives in the united states and 
called on them for help when asked what was needed he said we 
need everything 
nicaragua recently passed a law banning aid from the united 
states to enter the country because of us support for rebels but 
ramirez said president daniel ortega had authorized help for 
bluefields from any part of the world

the clipper schooner pride of baltimore ii 
departed on its maiden voyage sunday more than two years after the 
original pride sank in a sudden storm killing four crew members

15star 15stripe us flag that is believed to have flown over 
nearby fort mchenry during the war of 1812 the flag that tradition 
holds was still flying and inspired francis scott key to pen the 
national anthem 
the us flag was quickly joined by the flags of maryland and 
baltimore and a pride of baltimore ii pennant 
a shot was fired from a replica of a 19th century cannon on the 
starboard side and the clipper schooner pulled away it sailed 
around the harbor with all five sails unfurled as thousands of 
people watched from the shore a small armada of about 50 private 
boats followed the vessel for about an hour until it sailed past 
fort mchenry and under the francis scott key bridge 
before it returns to baltimore april 21 the clipper schooner is 
scheduled to travel to bermuda houston and galveston texas new 
orleans mobile ala tampa fla puerto rico venezuela 
colombia miami jacksonville fla savannah ga north and south 
carolina and norfolk va 
it was built with 4 million in donations and government money 
the vessel was christened april 30 in memory of the captain and 
three crew members who died when the pride sank may 14 1986 when 
a sudden squall blew up 90 miles off the coast of puerto rico the 
eight survivors clung to a life raft for five days rationed to a 
bite of biscuit and a half cup of water daily

heres how many people are old enough to vote in this years 
election and how they are spread across the united states along 
with figures on the total population 
 
generally in the most recent elections when the presidency was 
at stake only about half of those who were old enough to vote 
actually went to the polls 
for example according to the census bureau turnout in the 1984 
presidential election was only 531 percent of the votingage 
population up from 526 percent in 1980 
the bureau said turnout was 628 percent in 1960 619 percent 
in 1964 609 percent in 1968 551 percent in 1972 and 536 
percent in 1976 
 
the last census in 1980 placed the nations total population at 
226546000 and the next such official count will be in 1990 
meantime the census bureaus most recent detailed estimates are 
that total population reached 243400000 in mid1987 and that 
182628000 residents will be at least 18 years old when america 
votes this november 
since the 1984 presidential election the votingage population 
is estimated to have grown by more than 8 million 
 
the bureau points out that votingage projections are based on 
the resident population of the united states including members of 
the armed forces where they reside at their duty stations 
it said these projections exclude people overseas about 
520000 in the military and 65000 federal civilian workers plus 
their dependents of voting age and an unknown number of other 
american citizens residing abroad who would be eligible to vote 
by absentee ballot in their home state 
meanwhile the bureau said that the population of voting age 
includes many who meet the age requirement but cannot vote 
because citizenship is a universal requirement for voting 
aliens are the main group of ineligible votingage people the 
bureau said 
about 65 million legal aliens and 25 million undocumented 
aliens age 18 or over are included in the estimates and represent 
roughly 5 percent of the total population of voting age the bureau 
said 
the bureau also said somewhat more than 680000 people will be 
ineligible to vote because they will be in prisons or mental 
hospitals 
 
based on census bureau reports here is a statebystate list 
covering 
total population figures from the census on april 1 1980 
an estimate of what the total population had reached on july 1 
1987 the latest available such list 
an estimate of this novembers votingage population residents 
aged 18 or over from projections released in february as a 
reference for the current election season

from new englands pine tree state to the neighborhood of 
californias golden gate theyll vote 
in the thousand towns between and even beyond theyll vote 
doing their civic duty in boston in austin in the concords 
the springfields des moines honolulu harlem dixville notch 
doing it in shreveport in fairbanks indianapolis theyll vote 
and privately because theyre sure the world will know soon 
enough thank you very much indeed it will from the precincts 
will flow the word to the wires to the world one vote one 
hundred one million ten million in 1984 it reached 92654861 
now it is election day 1988 and whats at stake 
well for george bush and michael dukakis and for all others 
who want the presidency 538 electoral votes are the big prizes 
not many votes you say why the big deal well those votes are 
the ones that pack the punch 
those votes those electoral votes the ones that make a 
president are scattered through 50 states and the district of 
columbia and the one who wins enough of them is awarded a 
temporary ticket to the white house and a permanent place in 
american history 
beginning with the unanimous election of george washington two 
centuries ago this is the 51st such round of balloting for the 
leadership of the federal governments executive branch many would 
say the free world 
term of office four years as usual and if you want four more 
youll have to try again next time thank you very much 
the starting date for job no 1s winner and coworker the vice 
president is jan 20 1989 
as required by the constitution incumbent republican president 
reagan must vacate the white house that day after having been 
elected twice and serving eight years 
his ticketmate in 1980 and 1984 vice president bush is this 
years republican presidential nominee facing democrat dukakis 
governor of massachusetts 
call it luck or fate call it what you will both bush and 
dukakis were born in massachusetts county of presidents 
norfolk county the one that already has given three of its 
natives to the nation john adams john quincy adams and john 
fitzgerald kennedy 
the new president will be the 40th person to rise to the office 
but will be known for all time as the nations 41st president 
thank you grover cleveland because clevelands terms 188589 
189397 were not consecutive he is counted as both the 22nd and 
24th president 
the new vice president will be the 44th in us history two 
us senators republican dan quayle of indiana and democrat lloyd 
bentsen of texas are vying for the vice presidency 
 
elsewhere on the ballots throughout the land 
 
the office of governor is up for election in a dozen states 
including nine with fouryear gubernatorial terms and three with 
twoyear terms 
present occupants of these 12 offices 8 republicans 4 
democrats 
in all the current lineup of the 50 state governors 27 
democrats 23 republicans 
 
33 us senate seats are at stake term of office 6 years 
starting jan 3 1989 winners will serve in the nations 101st 
102nd and 103rd congresses 
present occupants of these 33 seats 18 democrats 15 
republicans 
every state has two senators in all the current lineup in the 
100seat senate 54 democrats 46 republicans 
 
all 435 us house seats will be filled elections will be 
held in congressional districts throughout the nation 
under the constitution every state is entitled to one house 
seat beyond that representatives are apportioned among the states 
according to population with figures determined on the basis of 
every 10year census 
term of office 2 years starting jan 3 1989 winners will 
serve in the 101st congress 
to hold a majority one party must win at least 218 seats 
democrats have been in the majority in the house since the 1954 
election of the 84th congress 
present occupants of the houses 435 seats 255 democrats 177 
republicans with three seats vacant 
here are the vacancies and those who had held the seats 
1 new jerseys 3rd district democrat james j howard died 
march 25 
2 tennessees 2nd district republican john j duncan died 
june 21 
3 new yorks 19th district democrat mario biaggi resigned 
aug 5 
representatives must be elected house vacancies cannot be 
filled by appointment 
 
now heres some more about this business of the electoral votes 
in the election of a president and vice president there are two 
sets of votes to follow as the returns come in a popular vote and 
an electoral vote 
because the united states uses the electoral college system 
voters indirectly elect the president and vice president popularly 
chosen electors apportioned among the states and district of 
columbia are the ones who officially vote for the candidates 
electoral votes usually go to the statewide winner of the 
popular vote technically an elector is a free agent but only in 
a few cases have electors gone off on their own to vote for someone 
else 
the number of electors equals each states delegation in the 
us senate and us house currently for example california has 
two us senators and 45 us representatives so it has 47 
electoral votes 
the district of columbia meantime gets three electors although 
it has no us senators and no voting representative in the us 
house under the 23rd amendment to the constitution ratified in 
1961 dcs electoral votes equal the number provided to the least 
populous state 
at least 270 electoral votes are needed for victory electors 
will vote dec 17 and those votes will be counted jan 6 at a joint 
session of congress the winning presidential and vice presidential 
candidates then take office jan 20

for vice president not only that but what you are about to read 
is legal in texas its also bentsen for senate again in 1960 
lone star law let texan lyndon b johnson ride again for the

share the democrats national horse with john f kennedy who rode

vote and won the presidency and vice presidency johnson became no 
2 that senate seat he wanted to keep in 1960 just in case the 
national horse didnt make it was given up by him when the horse 
came through and that seat was won by tower at a 1961 special 
election and remains republican even today now occupied by phil

congressmen each time he wanted six more senate years bentsen won 
in 1976 with 568 percent of the vote against alan steelman and 
in 1982 with 586 percent against james collins this time its 
another gop congressman beau boulter between bentsen and another 
term and if bentsen like johnson wins both races takes the vice 
presidency and thus quits as senator it means bush didnt win the 
white house is available for other things come jan 20 and the 
republican governor must decide what next bush for senator or 
boulter will the governor punt to the voters on first down will 
he take the ball and hide do texans love this sort of thing is

27 utah republican orrin g hatch of salt lake city was 
born march 22 1934 
first elected 1976 
began serving jan 3 1977 
election history in 1976 hatch a lawyer launching his utah 
political career in an impressive way snapped up 556 percent of 
the vote and upset democrat frank e moss who has been a senator 
since jan 3 1959 hatch a conservative running as an opponent of 
big government and what he branded poor fiscal policies won the 
gop nomination over jack carlson a former assistant secretary of 
the interior moss was chairman of what then was the aeronautical 
and space sciences committee and contended he had reached the most 
productive part of his senate career he said he thought that 
once having put your hand to the plow you should continue to the 
end of the row but hatch ran away from moss at the polls 
republicans gained control of the senate with the 1980 elections 
and hatch still a firsttermer became head of the labor and human 
resources committee campaigning from that position of power hatch 
was unchallenged in the 1982 gop primary and surged to a second 
term against democrat ted wilson salt lake citys mayor 309332 
votes to 219482 hatch had tied himself closely to president 
reagans economic policy in an appeal to the states largely 
conservative electorate and it paid off in his 
strongerthanexpected showing in an expensive race with wilson 
the tide that returned the democrats to the senate majority in the 
elections of 1986 also washed away hatchs chairmanship but he 
remained the top republican on the labor and human resources 
committee

ballots and won every two years since back in the 1950s when the 
nation was younger and slimmer vermont occupied six of the 186 
us house seats available based on americas 1810 census but by 
the time stafford first won a house election in 1960 vermont had 
long ago slipped to the constitutional floor it was a singleseat 
state so when they saw his name voters cared not whether it was 
on the line for governor us house or us senate the real 
question was do we want to send him where he wants to go 
staffords wish and the voters majority will were one from start 
to finish it was close at times but they always decided to go with

running this year the voters had elected him governor in 1958

votes votes votes officially the way it 
works there are electors and tellers and such names and 
numbers are everywhere jefferson and burr lincoln and eisenhower 
there are the gentlemen and gentlewomen of the congress it is 
a song of the casters and the counters a song of votes and 200 
years of freedom and responsibility it tells of when george won 
em all george washington that is listen now theyre getting 
ready to sing that song again 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
and so another election will end 
if its close get out your scorecard 
if its not youll soon know unofficially who will be the 
next president 
but either way if you want to be nailitdown sure who won all 
you really need is the song the official score and please 
note that takes time theyve been singing that song casting 
those votes counting those votes for 200 years now 
whether it is a long night or a landslide in any election for 
the presidency and vice presidency its never really over until 
its over in the electoral college 
and congress officially counts the electoral colleges official 
votes 
and you can count on it its official right in your 
constitution 
</TEXT>

it was over early in the electoral college for george 
washington no question about it he was no 1 among the electors 
in his era they cast 69 votes and he got all of them for all we 
know they all shook his hand they even liked him after he took 
office sang that song again and gave him all 132 at stake in the 
election for the second term 
then again washington was perfect in every way if anybody 
deserved a perfect score it had to be washington and you have to 
figure even sam isnt likely to play that song again quite that way 
again 
then again some have come close ronald reagan fell only 13 
electoral votes short of unanimous when the college met in 1984 
richard nixon was just 18 votes away from a unanimous selection in 
1972 franklin roosevelt got 523 of the 531 at stake in 1936 and 
james monroe would have had a perfect score but john quincy adams 
found a friend in william plumer of new hampshire and the college 
of 1820 marked it monroe 231 and adams 1 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
the constitution demands americans use the college to elect 
their presidents and vice presidents many years by the time 
congress gets around to counting what arrives from the colleges 
classes in 50 states and the district of columbia the announcement 
is just for the record 
but that doesnt stop the officials this is after all for 
all times sake 
so the powers of the legislative branch of government will 
gather in 1989 to open the envelopes from the electoral college 
theyll check to be sure everything is there then theyll count 
state by state alabama first 
as they did in 1985 one of the tellers in congress will say 
the certificate of the electoral vote of the state of alabama 
seems to be regular in form and authentic and it appears therefrom 
that and then hell say the name and how many votes for 
president then for vice president 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
using the electoral college system in the constitution 
americans have been electing presidents and vice presidents from 
washington and john adams who were no 1 and no 2 in the first

the electoral college system was new when george washington 
first heard the official word 
heres how that first race turned out 
connecticut casts 7 electoral votes for washington delaware 3 
for washington georgia 5 for washington maryland 6 for 
washington massachusetts 10 for washington new hampshire 5 for 
washington new jersey 6 for washington pennsylvania 10 for 
washington south carolina 7 for washington virginia 10 for 
washington everybody accounted for theres a deadlock in new 
york so they wont be here rhode island and north carolina are 
not here either but they havent ratified the constitution yet 
total 69 electoral votes for washington he is unanimously 
elected president of the united states 
as was the rule in the early elections next in the tally gets 
the vice presidency that was john adams at 34 votes weve got 
some alsorans here but nobody is close to adams john jays got 
9 robert h harrison and john rutledge are here at a tie with 6 
for bob and 6 for john four go for john hancock george clinton 
picked up three a couple here and there for some others 
but all agree washington was one of a kind

as the years went on the operation of the college was put to 
the test people argued over whether a direct election would be 
better than this indirect system defenders said this thing works 
leave it alone opponents said it needed fixing and fast 
controversy centered on how the electoral vote math and the 
total popular vote math sometimes didnt match with a close 
election in the popular vote turning into a landslide in the 
electoral college because big state or small state the general 
rule is that the winner takes all of that state 
states with more people get more electoral votes but each 
state no matter how many people live there casts at least three 
electoral votes wyoming is as strong in the college as the 
district of columbia alaska gets what vermont gets 
and the mixture changes every decade in big ways and small 
based on the census this is a nation with wheels and wings a 
people wanting more sun perhaps or another job perhaps or just 
another place down that road 
the government is required to count where you are every 10 
years and it hands out house seats based on those census figures 
but the senate seats are fixed two to a state be it big state or 
small 
all of that is put into the electoral vote system 
so as it stands now california is the current heavyweight 
with 47 electoral votes because it has two senators just like 
the other 49 states but it also has 45 members of the house and 
no state can match that

early on they changed one of the voting rules when trouble 
developed it came in the balloting for a president and vice 
president for the fourth term 180105 
again as they had done in 1789 1792 and 1796 electors voted 
for two candidates the one with the most votes became president 
next in line got the next job down 
this time its a tie for the top job 73 votes for thomas 
jefferson 73 votes for aaron burr 
the house had to settle it in the end jefferson won for the 
future to keep this sort of thing from happening again the 
constitution is amended separate balloting for president and vice 
president from now on

down through time while others argued that it works or it 
doesnt work or it just might not work when we need it the most 
the electors on schedule did their number did it and didnt do 
it again for another four years 
some of them did it their own way they are after all free 
agents but most remained with the program as written the 
colleges of washingtons day and of jeffersons day too passed 
away one by one replaced by others one by one 
and through the years the official singers continued their 
song officially revealing results even when the word already was 
out

in 1985 just before congress opened counted and announced the 
results of reagans reelection landslide old news at that point 
rep jim wright dtexas who became the house speaker called the 
electoral college a relic of the powdered wig and snuff box era 
its a charming exercise but i think its outlived its 
usefulness 
but like it or not until america settles on something else 
the electoral college is official voter and it is the official 
vote that counts 
</TEXT>

and how does this official election music sound as the 
officials play it for the ages 
when last we heard reagans name for example the action was 
jan 7 1985 as the congressional record so officially records it 
even as it capitalizes it for all time 
 
at 12 oclock and 55 minutes pm the doorkeeper the 
honorable james t molloy announced the vice president and the 
senate of the united states 
the senate entered the hall of the house of representatives 
headed by the vice president and the secretary of the senate the

many of the words that follow in quotes sound strange indeed 
but these words flow from tradition and the law like the sound of 
people singing just as their parents sang sounding the same 
through time singing the joys of their freedom for all the world 
to hear exercising their vote and the power and the responsibility 
it brings the names the numbers they change in time youre 
hearing it now but you could be hearing it then when the names

with two lone stars on the national tickets this year no one 
knows whether texas will be carried by sen lloyd bentsen and his 
democratic partner michael dukakis of massachusetts or by vice 
president george bush and his gop sidekick dan quayle of indiana 
and just as certainly texans had no idea back in us grants 
day that the winning us senator from massachusetts they voted 
against in the vice presidential race would someday turn out to be 
texan bentsens greatgreatuncle 
indiana certainly has no complaint about the texas treatment 
texas did vote back then for a hoosier for president he didnt get 
that top job that time but he later won the next job down 
you remember henry wilson and thomas a hendricks vice 
presidents of the united states 
it turns out wilson also was vice presidential nominee bentsens 
distant relative from massachusetts now the home of dukakis 
presidential half of the democratic ticket this year 
hendricks from indiana eventually became quite a name in the 
households of his day 
texans went for b gratz brown of missouri over wilson in 1872 
but they were outnumbered so wilson won the vice presidency and 
brown got honorable mention 
horace greeley of new york was republican grants real rival in 
the election that year greeley and brown were the ticket for some 
republicans unhappy with the way grant was minding the store and 
also for the democrats however after the election greeley died 
and his presidential electoral votes were cast for assorted other 
candidates 
brown turned out to get electoral votes for both for president 
18 and for vice president 47 hendricks collected 42 for 
president 
grant won the presidential election with 286 votes and wilson 
got the same for vice president indiana contributed 15 of those 
votes to the winning ticket texas cast 8 votes for hendricks for 
president and 8 for brown for vice president 
hendricks finished second to grant that year but came back in 
1884 to win the vice presidency under grover cleveland

presidential candidate lenora b fulani will be atop americas 
ballots on election day along with republican george bush and 
democrat michael dukakis 
many voters will have various other options 
according to a ballotaccess count sept 26 by the federal 
election commission and latest tallies by the ballotwatching news 
election service at least 17 independent or otherparty 
presidential candidates are to be on ballots in one or more states 
fulani of new york will join bush of texas and dukakis of 
massachusetts on the nov 8 ballots around the nation while ronald 
e paul of texas will be on most ballots 
elsewhere depending on the state voters will find lyndon h 
larouche jr willa kenoyer and eugene j mccarthy among others 
running as either independents or otherparty candidates for the 
presidency 
fulani a psychologist who worked to become the first black 
female presidential candidate to show on ballots throughout the 
nation is running as the candidate of the new alliance party which 
bills itself as the party of the rainbow 
in some states she will be listed as an independent or the 
candidate of the illinois solidarity alliance or united citizens 
parties 
she says she hopes to draw enough votes from dukakis to make the 
democratic party take notice adding what i am schooling people 
to do is to use our votes in a way that puts pressure on the 
party which needs us to get elected i want us to have power 
fulani failed in her attempt to unseat new york gov mario cuomo 
in 1986 
paul a native of pittsburgh pa and a fiscal conservative who 
was elected four times as a republican to the us house 
representing a congressional district in texas is the libertarian 
partys presidential nominee this time he is listed as an 
independent in some states 
in 1984 libertarian david bergland finished in third place in 
the presidential race drawing 227204 votes nationally when 
republican ronald reagan defeated democrat walter mondale 
i changed parties last year because i felt the voters deserve 
a choice says paul i left the gop because it has lost all 
credibility on balancing the budget 
i would abolish the federal reserve paul says and create 
a sound money system and id get rid of the income tax its 
only a new 20th century phenomenon in order to finance the welfare 
workers state 
lets say we did not police the world and we had no welfare 
would we need an income tax isnt it interesting that the income 
tax came about the time we changed our foreign policy and got a 
central bank and started fighting wars overseas in woodrow 
wilsons day 
mccarthy a watkins minn native who resides in rural 
woodville va served a decade in the us house and a pair of 
sixyear terms in the us senate from minnesota as a democrat now 
he is in his fourth presidential campaign 
he failed to win the democratic presidential nomination in 1968 
and 1972 in 1976 against winning democrat jimmy carter and losing 
republican gerald r ford mccarthy ran as an independent candidate 
for the white house and received 680390 of the 81603346 votes 
cast 
there is no real choice between democrats and republicans 
mccarthy said in announcing his 1988 bid if any new direction is 
to come it must come through an independent party the consumer 
party and i have willingly offered myself to lead it 
he also will appear on ballots as an independent or a minnesota 
progressive candidate 
it was in the 1968 presidential race that mccarthy became a folk 
hero among the young when he was the political maverick whose 
opposition to the vietnam war helped mark the beginning of the end 
of that conflict 
sure ive lost before but i didnt feel i wasted my time 
and i expect to have a significant impact mccarthy says this 
year the one thing we have to do is shake up the twoparty system 
and thats what i hope to do 
larouche of virginia is running this year as an independent or 
the candidate of the national economic recovery party or the 
democrats for economic recovery party 
in unsuccessful bids larouche was the 1976 presidential 
candidate of the us labor party which he founded in 1973 he 
announced as his partys 1980 candidate in january 1979 but that 
september he decided to run as a democratic candidate in 1980 he 
again sought the democratic nomination in 1984 and 1988 and he ran 
as an independent in the 1984 election 
kenoyer a freelance writer from shelby mich is campaigning 
as a socialist and will appear in some states as the liberty union 
or independent candidate 
i learned my socialism on my daddys knee back in the 
mid1930s she says her father was a labor activist 
kenoyer says she would spend her first hour in the white house 
dismantling the cia and the second hour the fbi goes

us distributor of absolut vodka spent in excess of 1 million to 
produce the ads and buy space to run them in three magazines new 
york la style and the liquor trade publication market watch it 
hopes 2 million people will see them 
the absolut wonderland ads are the latest step in marketers 
efforts to cut through commercial clutter and get people to pay 
attention to a message 
advertisers selling everything from cookies and perfume to 
liqueurs and rollsroyce automobiles have used scent strips in 
magazine ads readers have faced cardboard popups of stetson hats 
christmas stockings stuffed with a paper bottle and views of the 
san francisco skyline in their magazines 
toyota motor sales in usa put a cardboard 3d viewfinder in a 
magazine ad last year so readers could glimpse its new corolla 
model sellers of johnnie walker black label scotch put a dozen 
peelandstick labels in a twopage ad last year so readers could 
remind others of what they wanted for christmas 
carillon was one of two liquor distributors last year that 
placed microchips in the middle of magazine spreads that played 
christmas carols when the page was cracked open 
at christmastime magazines are crowded with ads to catch the 
readers attention you have to do something a step ahead of the 
others said michel roux president and chief executive of 
carillon 
one complaint about the musical ads last year was that some 
people couldnt get the music to stop music reportedly played 
incessantly in some apartment building lobbies after certain 
magazines were stuffed in the mailboxes 
carillon and its admakers at tbwa advertising inc say they have 
taken every precaution this year to avoid one potential complaint 
soggy magazines 
we cant say it will never break tbwa president richard 
costello said if somebody sticks it with a knife they may 
puncture it 
but he said the ads were rigorously tested for leakage and 
proved tough 
costello said there were unique problems in preparing the ads 
the flakes had to be exactly the right size so they wouldnt stick 
together a small amount of antifreeze was added to the liquid so 
it wouldnt freeze and crack if the magazines were stored at low 
temperatures 
and oh yes the ad itself notes that the liquid is not absolut 
vodka it is a nontoxic liquid not for human consumption the 
ad says 
edward kosner editor and publisher of new york magazine said 
he thinks imaginative advertising approaches are usually good for 
the advertiser the magazine that runs them and the magazine 
business in general 
i dont think you could run a novelty unit like this every 
week because people might find it obtrusive he said but 
running one occasionally sparks up the magazine and attracts 
attention to the advertising 
costello has no complaints he said absolut vodka sales were up 
35 percent last year and are running 33 percent higher so far this 
year

it was not too long ago that automobile designers 
watched their drawings come alive in one car and then vanish into 
automotive lore 
but the concept or show car that was a designers pipe 
dream yesterday might actually make it to the road someday auto 
executives say 
the idea of show cars is to test the limits said tom gale 
chrysler motors corps vice president for product design 
were living in a world thats four to five years in the 
future he said 
yet today there are several reasons why the concept cars look 
a lot more realistic said jerry palmer director of advanced 
design at general motors corp a lot of it has to do with 
technology 
the cars in the 50s were really wildlooking things you 
couldnt do those kinds of things in production he said 
forget about the fact that they may or not have had fins they 
had glass canopies at that time the hardware and the technology 
wasnt there 
now all the technology is available its kind of hard to do 
a wild show car and shock anyone anymore someone is going to ask 
why cant i have one 
the car buyer can bit by bit 
gone are the bulletlike looks of the 50s and 60s when 
designers let their imagination roam unfettered by manufacturing or 
engineering restraints here are more aerodynamic lines with 
smoother unions between metal and glass 
in the 50s it was a period of incredible optimism said 
dave turner director of advanced concept design at ford motor co 
i think in the 60s and 70s society in general began to take a 
little more pragmatic approach 
concept cars today he said are used to condition ourselves 
to some ideas and test peoples reactions 
thats where the auto shows come in every year automakers haul 
some of their design cars around the country and the world to show 
them off 
gale said the chrysler portofino concept car with four doors 
that swing open on pivots and close like guillotines is getting 
show worn 
nowadays with a little imagination show goers can nearly see 
themselves tooling down the highway in one of the concept cars but 
peoples imagination had to be particularly fertile to picture 
themselves behind the wheel of a concept car from the 50s or early 
60s complete with their canopies 
despite all the other changes through the years glass roofs 
have endured most of the show cars automakers are willing to 
exhibit have clear roofs 
and the problem that faced designers of yesteryear incredible 
heat buildup in the canopy is disappearing with the advent of 
films that can darken as sunlight gets brighter its the sort of 
stuff thats been used in eyeglasses that turn lenses dark outside 
and clear inside 
that glass technology is one example of how designers hands are 
being freed by science 
and part of that science is creeping into cars on the highways 
automakers are installing such lightsensitive films in mirrors on 
some of their models 
these are vehicles that arent that far away from reality 
because they are designed or engineered around technology available 
now palmer said 
along with changes in technology in the cars and the factories 
the car buyer also is influencing the designers 
the customer has gotten very sophisticated turner said 
you cant fool him anymore he demands that real technological 
improvement 
they dont want technology for its own sake they want 
technology they can believe in

mitsubishi has a new idea that gives new 
meaning to the phrase station break 
the japanese company has offered city officials 12 million to 
battle graffiti if the electronics company wins exclusive rights to 
install television screens displaying news and commercials in 
underground transit stations 
mitsubishi has tentatively planned to design and install the 
prototype system at its own expense and to maintain them in the 
citys stations for the next eight years a local firm visualmedia 
concepts would sell advertising for the color tv monitors 
san franciscos municipal railway which has underground 
stations along market street would receive a small portion of the 
advertising revenue 
the televisions could also be used to announce train arrivals 
and departures to display public service messages and give news 
reports 
jaimie levin the railways director of community relations 
called the proposal very speculative 
we dont know if they can give us what we want she said 
friday we may not be able to go this route with them but wed 
be fools if we didnt explore it 
televisions that display advertising logos but not action 
videos already have been placed in subway stations in chicago 
the municipal railways general manager bill stead recently 
proposed an antigraffiti program that would cost up to 13 million 
annualy but mayor art agnos said a fare increase could not be used 
to pay for it

contract friday by a 70 percent majority with 1677 voting in 
favor of the agreement and 707 voting against it 
negotiators for the uaw and chrysler reached the tentative 
agreement on thursday

their jobs after negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline a 
tentative agreement was reached two days later but it was rejected 
in two ratification votes 
chrysler filed suit last week seeking a temporary injunction to 
halt the walkout but us district judge clyde cahill went no 
further than to urge the two parties to settle their differences 
karen stewart a spokeswoman for chrysler said the strike cost 
the company an estimated 3 million a day

opec members who ended three days of talks 
over the weekend agreed the cartel should maintain its crude oil 
output at current levels and not increase it until the group 
reaches a new agreement on production the oil minister of algeria 
said sunday 
opec leaders said several production plans were under 
consideration 
the algerian representative balkacem nabi said some of the 
eight ministers at last weeks meeting asked several opec members 
to reduce their output but were refused 
the ministers then agreed to freeze the cartels output at its 
current levels of around 21 million barrels a day he said 
the pricing and longterm strategy committees of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries had met in hopes of 
making progress toward a new production agreement that might 
stabilize prices 
rampant overproduction by several opec members forced the price 
of oil to about 12 a barrel recently the cartels output is well 
above its agreedupon overall ceiling of 1506 million barrels a 
day for 12 of the 13 member nations opec president rilwanu lukman 
said saturday the ministers decided to propose a 175 
millionbarreladay ceiling on production up from the current 
1506 million 
however secretarygeneral subroto of indonesia told a later 
news conference several production plans were under consideration 
he said no one plan had met the approval of all eight ministers 
lukman who also is nigerias oil minister said the proposed 
ceiling of 175 million would be for the short term with an 
unspecified increase later 
nabi said seven of the ministers said they were more concerned 
with revenue than production 
opec experts have estimated the demand for the cartels crude 
output in the final quarter of the year to be 189 to 193 million 
barrels a day which means the current glut of crude on world 
markets will continue 
in a statement released after the talks ended the cartel said 
its price planners would meet again in vienna austria on nov 17 
after consultations with their governments 
a full ministerial conference is set for nov 21 in vienna 
lukman told reporters he was happy with the latest meetings he 
said all eight participating ministers had emphasized the need for 
iraq to come back into the quota agreement 
however iran resisted at the meeting any proposal that would 
give iraq production parity with iran 
the meetings chief objective was to secure a new production 
control pact to include iraq for the first time since 1986 iraq 
has refused to abide by any opecmandated production quota if it 
does not have parity with iran 
iran has an opec quota of 24 million barrels a day and iraqs 
official ceiling is 15 million barrels a day the two countries 
have been at war since september 1980 but are now recognizing a 
ceasefire 
the countries represented at the meetings besides iran and 
iraq were saudi arabia kuwait indonesia algeria venezuela and 
nigeria

federal regulators have reopened bidding for the 
purchase of texas american bancshares inc and national bancshares 
corp paving the way for bidders who previously submitted 
proposals to step back into the action 
federal deposit insurance corp officials said friday minnesota 
businessman carl pohlads request for more federal assistance in 
his plan to buy the two banks was too significant to approve 
without obtaining competing offers 
pohlad owner of the minnesota twins said in july he would put 
up 200 million in capital to go with 475 million in government 
aid to buy fort worthbased texas american and san antoniobased 
national bancshares 
but after a close review of the companies books pohlad tried 
to make changes in the proposed transaction 
texas american chairman joseph grant told the dallas morning 
news pohlad was expected to join in the new round of bidding 
other likely contenders are richard rainwater of fort worth 
former financial adviser to the billionaire bass brothers and 
morton meyerson of dallas the two previously submitted a joint 
proposal to buy the banking firms 
also a likely suitor in the new bidding is dallas banker gerald 
ford 
rainwater contacted sunday by the associated press would not 
say whether he would reenter the bidding for texas american and 
national bancshares and declined to comment on the transaction 
morton and ford did not return telephone calls sunday from the 
associated press 
pohlads minneapolis firms mei diversified inc and bank shares 
inc have been trying to acquire texas american and national 
bancshares 
speculation was the deal soured when disagreement was fueled by 
generous terms subsequently granted ncnb corp of charlotte nc 
to take over first republicbank corp of dallas 
although the fdic will finance possible future losses at first 
republic pohlad would get no further help if losses exceeded 475 
million 
if pohlads transaction goes through his companies would own 
the fourthlargest banking company in texas its 8 billion in 
assets would dwarf bank shares present assets of 18 billion
