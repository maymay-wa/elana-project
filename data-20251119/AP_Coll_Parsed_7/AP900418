congress returns today from a 12day easter 
recess but the weekend death of a senator and a house turf battle 
over clean air are delaying action on major legislation 
both the house and senate were scheduled to convene at noon but 
the death on sunday of sen spark matsunaga dhawaii and plans by 
several senators to attend services for him in honolulu make 
significant floor action this week unlikely 
the house plans to vote thursday on a measure allowing the 
government to take over or revoke the charters of banks and savings 
and loan associations that launder money for drug dealers 
also scheduled for a house vote is an antitrust bill opposed by 
the administration that would make it easier for consumers to sue 
manufacturers and retailers engaged in vertical pricefixing 
the house passed a similar bill in 1987 after democrats 
complained that the justice department had prosecuted no cases 
involving manufacturers and retailers agreeing on minimum retail 
prices since 1981 when republicans took over the white house the 
senate however never acted on it 
operators of discount stores also have complained about 
manufacturers refusing to supply them under the practice which is 
illegal under the sherman antitrust act 
the office of management and budget said it will recommend that 
president bush veto the bill contending it would inhibit 
manufacturers and distributors from making procompetitive 
agreements 
bush and his aides meanwhile are focusing criticism on 
congress for delays in approving his 800 million package of new 
foreign aid for panama and nicaragua including 47 million to help 
resettle contra rebels and their families now living in honduras 
the house approved a version of the aid package before the 
easter recess and the senate originally was scheduled to act on it 
this week however that was before matsunagas death 
clean air legislation approved by the senate and the house 
energy and commerce committee faces new hurdles in the house 
the public works committee is concerned about language in the 
bill that would require the environmental protection agency to cut 
off federal highway funding to states that dont implement 
pollutionreduction plans 
also the house ways and means committee wants to convert 
certain fees in the bill to excise taxes house leaders do not 
expect the bill to be ready for floor action until sometime in 
early may 
after weeks of negotiating behind closed doors members of the 
house budget committee hope this week to agree on bushs 12 
trillion budget for fiscal 1991 majority democrats on the panel 
want to cut the presidents proposed 303 billion in defense 
spending next year by 8 billion 
next week the senate may take up a longawaited bill to alter 
the way congressional campaigns are financed majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine plans to bring a democratic version to 
the floor primarily to prod negotiations on finding an elusive 
compromise 
democrats want to impose ceilings on how much candidates can 
spend while the republican focus is on eliminating the influence 
of corporate and labor political action committees 
members of both parties while jockeying for political 
advantage also proclaim a desire to reduce the influence of 
unreported money raised and spent by outside groups and the parties 
themselves 
on tuesday three advocacy groups public citizen citizen 
action and the us public interest research group announced they 
will spend 1 million on newspaper tv and radio advertising during 
the next two weeks to support public campaign financing 
the groups endorsed an amendment planned by sen john kerry 
dmass that would raise the current voluntary 1 checkoff on tax 
returns for financing presidential elections to 3 to add funding 
for congressional races 
democratic leaders however have all but abandoned an effort to 
pass public financing after failing on eight attempts to break a 
republican filibuster on the issue two years ago

diets with about twice the amount of fiber and 
vegetables now consumed by most americans can reduce the risk of 
colon cancer by about 40 percent a government study shows 
a research report published today in the journal of the national 
cancer institute reviewed 37 studies conducted since 1973 and found 
what it called a great deal of evidence that diets rich in 
fiber and vegetables protect people against colon cancer 
the data suggest a reduction in risk of approximately 40 
percent for persons consuming diets high in fiber and vegetables 
the report said furthermore there are undeniable cardiovascular 
benefits and little likelihood of adverse consequences associated 
with this data 
bruce trock a researcher at fox chase cancer center in 
philadelphia said the evidence is powerful and very clear 
trock said he and two national cancer institute researchers 
elaine lanza and peter greenwald concluded there was a protective 
effect from fiber after a careful analysis of the statistics and 
methods used in the 37 dietary studies by different scientists 
populations in the variety of studies included japanese europeans 
australians americans and new zealanders 
some of the studies were based on questionnaires and others on 
actual dietary records 
we classified the studies as to how strong the evidence was 
trock said in a telephone interview 
we found of the studies that we thought were well done there 
were only two that did not support the anticolon cancer effect 
when you include some studies where there was some question about 
how valid the result was then there was an additional six that 
were not supportive of the effect 
trock said the studies did not emphasize any particular food or 
uniformly determine the precise amount of fiber needed to achieve 
the protective effect 
but he said most americans probably would have to double the 
amount of fiber consumed to achieve the cancer protection effect 
suggested in the studies 
the average american eats 11 or 12 grams of dietary fiber a 
day said trock the nci and other organizations are 
recommending 20 to 30 grams of dietary fiber a day so were really 
talking about doubling a typical intake 
this can be done he said with up to six servings a day of 
fruits whole grain bread vegetables and whole grain cereals 
it is a relatively simple change that is beneficial for other 
diseases and doesnt seem to bring with it any adverse side 
effects said trock 
people who eat 20 to 30 grams of fiber daily he said will 
automatically reduce the fat in their diet because you dont have 
much room for fat 
several studies have suggested that reduction of fat in the diet 
can lower the risk of heart disease and of some other types of 
cancer he said 
trock cautioned that the studies surveyed did not suggest that 
high fiber powders or tablets would accomplish the anticancer 
effect 
because the majority of the evidence is based on food rather 
than supplements i think people would be well advised not to 
achieve this effect by taking supplements said trock we worry 
that some people think they can just take a pill and then go ahead 
and eat a highfat diet maybe some day they can but right now we 
dont think so 
the journal of the national cancer institute is published 
semimonthly by nci which is one of the national institutes of 
health

federal investigators following the money 
trail left by colombian drug dealers say the medellin cocaine 
cartel stashed 400 million in 754 us bank accounts most of 
them now frozen under court order 
the justice department said it won a court order freezing 684 
us bank accounts as a result of a painstaking investigation of 
financial transactions used by colombian drug lords to hide at 
least 12 billion 
the order signed by a federal judge in atlanta also directed 
173 banks in 22 states and the nations capital to provide records 
to prosecutors 
the justice department said tuesday its longrunning 
investigation of colombian drug dealers dubbed operation polar 
cap determined that the accounts once contained 400 million the 
medellin cartel amassed from selling cocaine in america 
all but 50 million of the money was spirited out of this 
country and placed into foreign accounts it then was wired back to 
us banks to finance continued cartel operations in this country 
officials said 
authorities said they did not know how much money is left in the 
accounts but information from the records should point fingers 
in a lot of directions helping investigators pursue the money 
trail further said peter g djinis a justice department lawyer 
the manner in which the medellin cartel has laundered its 
money is overwhelming in size and complexity the justice 
department said in court papers 
through an operation known as la mina the cartel laundered 
more than 1 billion through the chase manhattan bank and the bank 
of new york in 1987 and 1988 the department said 
agents of the drug enforcement administration the internal 
revenue service and the us customs service used information from 
banks used by the cartel in eight foreign countries to unscramble 
the complex web of financial transactions 
an important break occurred when colombia turned over bank 
records to us authorities after it agreed to extradite eduardo 
martinez romero to face charges that he laundered drug proceeds for 
the cartel through american banks djinis said 
martinez was the sheepherder of the money transfers djinis 
said 
the investigation also got a boost in october when colombian 
police seized financial records of alleged cartel member jose 
gonzalo rodriguez gacha officials said 
an analysis of those records enabled us authorities last fall 
to freeze 62 million rodriguez kept in this country luxembourg 
switzerland austria and great britain 
those countries furnished bank records used by investigators to 
trace funds frozen this week in the us accounts 
the us accounts allegedly were set up by martinez or other 
representatives of cartel members including pablo escobar and 
jorge ochoa officials said escobar and ochoa still in colombia 
are among nine defendants charged with martinez in the atlanta case 
banco de occidente of panama has pleaded guilty to money 
laundering charges contained in the indictment 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the justice departments 
action seeks to lift the veil of secrecy over the financial 
network of these narcoterrorists 
the money also was traced through banks in uruguay canada 
colombia and panama 
in miami customs commissioner carol hallett said the bank 
accounts could not have been traced without the help of the 
panamanian government that replaced gen manuel antonio noriega 
justice department officials said they did not bother to seek 
panamanian bank records until after the us invasion that led to 
noriegas arrest in december on federal drug charges 
noriega is awaiting trial in miami on charges unrelated to 
operation polar cap 
the justice department said it does not have evidence that the 
us banks were knowing participants in the money laundering scheme

activists on both sides of the abortion 
issue looked to the fall legislative elections after the state 
house failed to override gov judd greggs veto of an abortion 
rights bill he said was too liberal 
this is neither a beginning nor an ending democratic rep 
peter burling the bills prime sponsor said tuesday we will go 
from here and where we go from here is directly into the campaigns 
in the fall 
representatives tuesday voted 215157 in favor of the bill 
which allowed unrestricted abortions until a womans doctor 
determined the fetus could survive outside the womb but the vote 
was 33 short of the twothirds margin needed 
republican stephanie micklon one of the bills sponsors called 
it patronizing and bizarre that new hampshire lets 
motorcyclists and drivers choose whether to wear helmets or seat 
belts but doesnt extend that freedom of choice to women when it 
comes to bearing children 
abortion is nothing more than planned killing countered 
rep frank reidy a democrat send this killer legislation to 
limbo or hell where it belongs hitler had his holocaust in germany 
and it appears we have one in this country 
the 1973 us supreme court ruling that legalized abortions 
effectively addresses the issue in the state since new hampshire 
has no laws regulating abortions 
new hampshires bill was pushed by prochoice advocates who fear 
the high court might turn greater control over abortion to state 
legislatures 
in his veto message earlier this year gregg argued that the 
bill would authorize abortion for convenience sex selection as 
a form of birth control and with or without parental notification 
or consent in the case of a minor 
i really dont think a majority of the people in this state 
would want new hampshire to have the most liberal abortion law in 
the country gregg said after the vote 
after the override attempt failed activists said they hoped to 
elect legislators sympathetic to their views in the fall 
its harder to lobby and change and influence a legislator 
than it is to vote them in and have them representing your views to 
begin with said warren aldrich spokesman for the antiabortion 
group new hampshire for life 
abortionrights activists are working to identify 20000 
sympathetic citizens to encourage them to vote in the fall to 
create a vetoproof legislature said peg dobbie of the 
national abortion rights action league

the bush administration wants delegates to an 
international conference to embrace its call for more research on 
global warming despite their grumbling that the united states is 
moving too slowly on the problem 
the twoday white house conference attended by senior 
government officials from 19 countries has been marked by discord 
over whether specific commitments should be made to reduce 
socalled greenhouse pollutants especially carbon dioxide 
despite the disagreements however senior administration 
officials and many of the delegates suggested the conference likely 
would go along with a us call for broader research into global 
warming and its economic impact 
the conference concludes later today 
president bush told the conference tuesday that more research is 
needed to sort out the science of the greenhouse effect he 
rejected suggestions that specific response strategies be developed 
immediately 
that brought prompt criticism from some of the european 
delegations 
gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide 
inaction declared klaus topfer the west german environmental 
minister later he tempered his criticism of the us position 
saying the call for additional research is not altogether bad 
the west germans today were to outline details of their proposed 
25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions 
the united states has argued it is too early to make a 
commitment on specific pollution reductions instead it has sought 
to focus the conference on gaining international support for more 
research on the scientific questions on global warming and the 
economic costs 
attending the conference were senior environmental ministers 
from the 19 countries as well as cabinetlevel officials on 
economics scientific and energy issues 
allan bromley bushs science adviser and a conference 
cochairman told reporters he hoped the delegates would commit to 
a broadened international research effort and begin to routinely 
consider economic issues in the global warming debate 
president bush does not feel in any sense the research should 
be a substitute for action bromley said 
some european countries have advocated for months that 
industrial nations commit themselves to stabilizing carbon dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000 many environmentalists say emissions 
should be cut by 20 percent 
such pollution cuts would require increased energy conservation 
development of more fuelefficient automobiles and more energy 
efficiency in homes and businesses 
talk about further research and economic considerations should 
not distract us from taking action on carbon dioxide 
stabilization now hans alders the dutch environmental minister 
told the conference during a closed working session tuesday 
we needed love canal before hazardous waste was tackled we 
needed a dying river rhine before waste water was treated my 
country has decided to learn the lessons from the past and act on 
global warming now alders told the delegates according to a 
transcript provided by the dutch delegation 
delegates from france italy and environmental officials from 
the european community also warned against substituting research 
for action 
we didnt come here to argue with the united states or anybody 
else said padraig flynn the irish environmental minister and a 
member of the delegation from the european community 
but while supporting the call for more research flynn added 
research must not be used to put off the problems that must be 
addressed today 
in welcoming the delegates tuesday bush acknowledged the 
disagreements saying i know theres a debate raging out there 
scientists agree that manmade pollution especially the release 
of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is causing heat to be 
trapped and will result in a warming of the globe but the severity 
of the warming and how specific regions of the earth will be 
affected is not as clear 
some computer models have suggested the global temperatures 
could increase by as much as four to nine degrees fahrenheit by the 
middle of the next century causing coastal flooding and a shift of 
weather and agriculture patterns other scientists say the impact 
is uncertain because of a variety of factors such as the uncertain 
effect of clouds

the white house says the environment is the 
theme of the week for president bush that means mostly golfing 
fishing and boating 
brushing aside fresh assaults on his environmental scorecard 
bushs top advisers in recent days have bent over backward to 
trumpet the presidents keen interest in outdoor sports as a 
manifestation of his concern for the environment 
thus bush will honor earth day on sunday by fishing in florida 
for tarpon and bonefish 
bush needs no prompting to get in touch with the elements but 
the elements hes been getting in touch with the wellmanicured 
greens of country clubs the azure waters off the florida keys 
may not exactly match environmentalists notions of the endangered 
biosphere 
i dont think what hes done qualifies him to proclaim himself 
the environmental president said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine hes got a long way to go 
and while praising bush for helping forge a compromise on clean 
air legislation mitchell said the president missed a golden 
opportunity in not taking a more assertive role on global warming 
in fact bush received sharp criticism from environmentalists 
from around the world this week for the goslow approach he 
advocated at a conference in washington on global warming a 
conference he convened 
bush often boasts about his environmental record but he has 
been criticized by many for moving too slowly and too timidly on a 
range of issues from global warming to wetlands policy to 
offshore oil production 
the fishing is pretty darn good near these drilling rigs 
bush said in a relaxed interview with a group of outdoors writers 
the interview was one of a series of events organized for the 
president over the past few days to stress conservation and 
environmental themes leading up to earth day 
im not suggesting thats the reason to have drilling bush 
continued on the subject of oil rigs as fishing grounds but i am 
saying that we cannot become totally dependent on foreign oil 
and offshore drilling offers some potential 
bushs drilling comment did not seem designed to win him points 
with florida environmentalists offshore platforms are a touchy 
subject there 
shortly after taking office bush imposed a temporary moratorium 
on drilling in environmentally sensitive areas off the florida and 
california coasts but his administration has done little since 
short of a proposal to move shipping lanes used by oil tankers 
further offshore 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called bushs visit to 
the florida keys this weekend a final installment in a weeklong 
effort to showcase the environment 
on sunday earth day he will fish with curt gowdy for an 
american outdoorsman special that will air later this spring 
fitzwater said at a news briefing 
other environmental week events included distribution of tree 
saplings at the annual easter egg roll and daily point of light 
awards for environmental volunteerism 
youve got to have a mix of work and recreation bush told 
reporters as he played 18 holes of golf in the rain at a bermuda 
country club last saturday after meeting with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
the environment in fact remains one of the most divisive 
issues within the administration with white house chief of staff 
john sununu and budget director richard darman in a continual 
tugofwar with william k reilly chief of the environmental 
protection agency 
so far sununu and darman appear to be winning as reilly a 
conservation activist before bush tapped him for the epa post has 
found many of his environmental proposals watered down including a 
stronger policy for global warming 
in fact on negotiations with capitol hill on clean air act 
amendments reilly is likely to be sidelined completely with white 
house and budget office aides doing the prime bargaining white 
house sources said 
meanwhile bush sees a clear link between the environment and 
outdoor athletics 
im trying to do my part to get outdoors and show the flag for 
sports fitness and recreation taking a few shots in the process 
but nothing i cant handle so far he said 
by that i mean i am determined to go fishing and i think 
people understand he told the outdoors writers 
im down there in florida to have fun bush added 
previewing this weekends trip and if we can help by pointing 
out the sensitivity of the environment there the ecological 
balance in the everglades i want to do that

suprati mahana has been working the fetid 
alleyways of bombays redlight district since she was sold into 
prostitution four years ago ms mahana 16 doesnt know what aids 
is 
why should i force my customer to use a condom she said as 
she sat on a small bed in a ratinfested bordello besides if 
the men give it to us well just give it back to them ill go to 
a doctor 
the sprawling slums of one of indias biggest cities have become 
a breeding ground for the deadly virus and health officials fear 
that if the government doesnt act fast india will be faced with 
asias first aids epidemic 
about 10000 prostitutes in this city of 10 million people are 
believed to be infected with the virus aids specialists say five 
times higher than three years ago 
hundreds of professional blood donors also carry the virus 
although the government has been slow to screen donations a 1989 
survey showed the incidence of aidsinfected blood had increased 
almost 40 times since 1987 to more than 1 percent 
many eunuchs who work the redlight districts of bombay madras 
and new delhi are also infected doctors say 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims prone to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
of the worlds 20 worst national aids epidemics 18 are in poor 
countries although the united states has the most cases more than 
120000 since indias first reported aidsrelated death in june 
1986 at least 17 people have died 
in asia while thailand has more people carrying the virus 
indian health officials worry that their country with 880 million 
people and a weak health system will soon top the list 
we could have an epidemic situation in 10 years said dr 
sm bhadkamkar the top health official in bombay every six 
months the number of aids carriers is doubling 
critics say bhadkamkar and his colleagues in new delhi have done 
little to stop the disease after a brief flurry in 1986 there 
have been few governmentbacked educational drives more than 90 
percent of the 8 million used to battle aids goes into testing and 
less than 5 percent into education and prevention 
solutions from the medical community have also been criticized 
two years ago as paintal who now heads the indian council on 
medical research called for a bill outlawing indians from having 
sex with foreigners and indians living overseas it was never 
introduced 
the government is doing nothing about aids said dr is 
gilada a crusading specialist on the disease who founded indias 
first aids clinic in bombay several years ago they have their 
heads in the sand 
in thailand they have posters on almost every street corner 
and condoms everywhere in zaire and the ivory coast they use 
music to fight it gilada said in india the professionals say 
theyre still studying the problem 
gilada a government doctor is a oneman antiaids publicity 
machine bureaucrats accuse him of seeking the limelight but his 
response is that the problem is too serious to worry about style 
when the first aids patient died in bombays jj hospital in 
1988 government officials told gilada to certify the cause of 
death as tuberculosis gilada said 
he refused and publicized the death the government tried to 
transfer him to a leprosy unit outside the city gilada said a 
court ruling prevented his move 
bhadkamkar declined to comment on giladas allegations 
now gilada spends much of his time in bombays three redlight 
districts attempting to educate prostitutes and professional blood 
donors about the disease 
prostitution is legal in india many prostitutes come from the 
countryside homosexuality is illegal but tolerated if the men join 
a certain hindu cult 
one organization of prostitutes the neglected and helpless 
womans association has crusaded against aids with giladas help 
its president rukminibai barsode said she has received no help 
from the government 
a rich businessman gave us 10000 condoms for world health day 
last april but the government wont give us one rupee said the 
50yearold madam speaking out of her office on 14th alley the 
government also ignores any attempts to keep our daughters and the 
young street urchins from the business 
as she spoke three 12yearold girls in braids and shabby 
dresses sat together on a rock near the door they poked each other 
and giggled all three said their mothers were planning on making 
them work as prostitutes 
ms barsode said pimps have stopped many prostitutes from 
joining her organization which has 500 members on 13th alley 
suprati mahana said she wanted to join but her uncle wouldnt 
let her 
gilada has also called on the government to pay professional 
blood donors who test positive for the aids virus not to give their 
blood 
partly because of giladas jostling bombay is starting to take 
action 
in january maharashtra state which includes bombay began 
screening all blood donations bhadkamkar said in may it will 
start a comprehensive aids education program aimed at college 
students industrial workers prostitutes and professional blood 
donors 
we are committed to attacking this disease bhadkamkar said 
and now we have to

members of a top contra rebel 
delegation toned down their demands that the sandinista army 
disband along with their own forces after meeting late tuesday with 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro 
a representative of mrs chamorros coalition said afterwards 
that the possibility of finally bringing peace to nicaragua is 
enormous dismissing sandinista predictions of a fresh outbreak 
of fighting 
maj gen joaquin cuadra deputy defense minister and chief of 
staff of the sandinista army said that with political will 
the contras could be dismantled by the time mrs chamorro takes 
office april 25 
rebel leaders have said they will not lay down their arms until 
the military built and dominated by the sandinistas during their 
decade in power is dismantled and replaced by a police force 
but after meeting with mrs chamorro contra leader oscar 
sovalbarro seemed to soften his tone and said demands that the 
military disarm are aspects that must be negotiated 
antonio lacayo mrs chamorros soninlaw and a leading 
official in her coalition dismissed sandinista claims that a new 
round of war could break out there are enormous possibilities of 
assuring peace in nicaragua 
a spokesman for the presidentelects united national opposition 
coalition uno luis sanchez said the contra demand to cull the 
army of sandinista officers had not been discussed and there were 
no plans to discuss it he said the talks were progressing and 
focused on a ceasefire and moving contra fighters to security 
zones where they are to turning in their weapons he said he was 
optimistic a ceasefire agreement could be signed wednesday 
the conciliatory statements followed a morning of hardline 
stances and alarmist headlines in the sandinista press 
sovalbarro had been standing firm on a contra demand that there 
would be no peace unless the contras and the sandinista army 
disbanded simultaneously 
there is no date for disarming he said earlier tuesday 
that is part of the negotiations 
we have opted that there be a total demilitarization of the 
armed force in nicaragua sovalbarro added we are not 
demanding to share power with the new government 
aristides sanchez another member of the delegation said the 
contras wanted to do away with the military entirely as costa rica 
did in 1948 he said the rebels want the army replaced by a 
national police like the one in costa rica 
but the deputy defense minister cuadra said the contra demand 
that the sandinistas simultaneously disarm was not subject to 
discussion 
he spoke prior to a meeting of uno contra and sandinista army 
representatives at the managua headquarters of the organization of 
american states the oas and the united nations are helping 
supervise the contra demobilization 
prosandinista newspapers had quoted the general secretary of 
the sandinista labor federation as saying sandinista workers would 
seize strategic points in managua if the contras refuse to 
disarm the union claims 100000 members 
one such daily el nuevo diario said in a frontpage headline 
either the contras demobilize before the 25th or a general strike 
explodes 
mrs chamorro was elected to a sixyear term in february 
balloting that saw her 14party coalition defeat the sandinistas 
her administration is counting on a peaceful nicaragua to 
deliver on her key campaign promise of reviving the economy 
under a protocol agreement signed by uno and the administration 
of outgoing president daniel ortega mrs chamorro pledged to 
respect the armys professionalism but vowed not to let 
officers serve as political party leaders as is now the case 
both ortega and mrs chamorro have called on the contras to 
disband the contras and uno signed an agreement on march 23 for 
the contras to disarm but set no firm date 
in another development la prensa the evening newspaper owned 
by mrs chamorros family said bernard aronson the assistant us 
secretary of state for the region was expected to visit thursday 
for talks with the sandinistas and uno washington backed the 
contras in their nineyear war with the sandinistas but now 
supports mrs chamorros call for their dissolution

biomedical scientists are almost evenly 
divided about whether the government is taking too much money from 
cancer heart disease and other medical studies to support aids 
research a congressional study finds 
the survey released tuesday by the office of technology 
assessment said most of the experts believe aids research has 
made many important contributions to advances in the biomedical and 
behavioral sciences and that virtually every medical specialty 
has benefited from money spent on aids studies 
in the current fiscal year that ends sept 30 the federal 
government is spending about 29 billion for treatment and 
prevention of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research into 
the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids is 
about 116 billion 
critics of rising expenditures on hiv disease point out that 
hiv funding has exceeded funding for heart disease and rivals 
funding for cancer despite the much greater number of deaths from 
these latter diseases ota said 
the report said almost 10 percent or 7435 million of the 
national institutes of healths 1990 budget goes to aids funding 
to determine how the federal aids spending is affecting other 
biomedical fields the ota sent questionnaires to 400 scientists 
and received completed replies from 148 
the study said 48 percent of those who responded agreed or 
strongly agreed that too much research funding has been diverted 
to aids research from other fields fortyfour percent disagreed 
or strongly disagreed with this statement it said 
asked to evaluate federal spending for aids research 457 
percent of the scientists surveyed said the amount was about 
right 181 percent said it was too high 312 percent said it 
was too low and 51 percent had no opinion 
there were 87 scientists with some professional activity related 
to aids in the survey and 517 percent of those believed the level 
of aids spending was about right onethird called it too low 
and 103 percent saw it as too high 
among the 49 surveyed scientists with no professional aids 
activity 347 percent called federal spending about right 327 
percent said it was too high and 265 percent found it too low 
dr mervyn silverman president of the american foundation for 
aids research said more money generally needs to be spend for 
health care 
we need to maintain and increase the amount of research in 
aids but we should not be doing this at the expense of other 
diseases he said the impact of heart disease cancer and aids 
are all terrible in our society and we should be dealing adequately 
with all of them 
in the ota survey more than half the experts agreed that each 
of nine basic biological sciences enjoyed at least some spinoff 
benefit from the aids research 
among the medical specialties the experts said virtually every 
one has received some spinoff benefit at least 40 percent of the 
experts said the fields of medicine most helped by knowledge from 
aids research are oncology study of tumors neurology study of 
the nervous system hematology study of the blood pulmonary 
medicine and general infectious disease treatment 
the aids research the experts said also has stimulated public 
health studies in teaching people about hazardous behaviors such 
as drug and alcohol abuse and in the public control of all 
sexually transmitted diseases 
even sociology has benefited from aids research the experts 
said by improving public understanding about social stigma and 
prejudice 
scientists surveyed were from universities government agencies 
and private organizations seventytwo percent were physicians and 
the rest held phd degrees in biomedical sciences more than half 
are in research and 16 percent are in patient care 
the office of technology assessment is an agency of congress 
that conducts scientific research into issues that might affect 
federal legislation

a ku klux klansman arrested for wearing a hood in 
violation of state law has his day in court thursday in a 
confrontation over whether the constitution guarantees the right of 
anonymous free speech 
any law that infringes on any persons first amendment rights 
infringes on all our rights said michael hauptman klansman 
shade millers lawyer 
miller was charged with violating the 1951 law in february after 
wearing a kkk hood at the county courthouse in lawrenceville 
the case is being watched closely by civil rights leaders who 
credit the law with helping reduce klan violence in the last four 
decades 
obviously we think it is a very relevant issue said earl 
shinhoster southeast regional director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people 
the klan uses anonymity as an instrument of terror and fear 
said shinhoster who plans to testify for the state at thursdays 
state court hearing that has been the whole reason for 
constructing their uniform and regalia as it is 
hauptman president of the american civil liberties union in 
georgia said the antimask law is so vague that it can be used to 
restrict the rights of any individual or group deemed offensive by 
the government 
if a gay rights group decided they wanted to have a massive 
rally including 20000 atlantans who havent come out of the 
closet this law would prohibit them from putting bags on their 
heads said hauptman who has taken the case as a private lawyer 
rather than as a member of the aclu 
without the protection of masks klansmen could face harassment 
on the job or from neighbors who oppose the kkk hauptman said 
state officials contend the law is clear and specifically 
targeted at hate groups such as the klan 
the law is not vague it says do not wear a mask unless you 
fall within one of the exceptions said david m fuller chief 
assistant solicitor for gwinnett county who will represent the 
state at the hearing 
the law makes it a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in 
jail and a 1000 fine to wear a hood or a mask to conceal ones 
identity when on public property exceptions include holiday 
costumes on the day of the holiday masks for use in sports 
theatrical garb or gas masks 
it does not violate free speech because it is in the pursuit 
of a legitimate public interest which is to keep the public free 
from threats and intimidation fuller said 
superior court senior judge osgood williams who as a legislator 
helped write the mask law said its always been my feeling that 
the bill in a large measure brought about the demise of the ku 
klux klan as a potent force it still should be the law of the 
land 
leonard zeskind research director for the atlantabased center 
for democratic renewal which monitors white supremacist 
activities said antimask laws are worth protecting 
the mask is in our opinion not an element of freedom of 
expression but an attempt to conceal zeskind said the purpose 
of the mask is to conceal the klan member and the only purpose of 
concealing the member in public has to do with worry over law 
enforcement finding out about who is committing crimes 
zeskind said the klans reason for launching this challenge may 
have less to do with regaining the right to wear a mask than 
inspiring its membership 
he said klan groups have suffered several setbacks in georgia 
courts over the past couple of years and this may be an attempt 
to rally the troops around some legal effort this may be an 
internal thing 
fuller said virtually every state has an antimask law though a 
few including those in california tennessee and massachusetts 
have been struck down 
but he said he believed georgias law was more narrowly written 
than those that were ruled unconstitutional

the democratic partys congressional campaign 
arm is joining the earth day celebration in a partisan fashion 
launching a television ad campaign that takes a swipe at the gops 
environmental record 
two ads produced for the democratic congressional campaign 
committee are scheduled to be broadcast today thursday and sunday 
in seven congressional districts where the environment is expected 
to be a major campaign issue 
those districts are in new jersey rhode island two in 
california new york colorado and alaska four currently are 
represented by democrats and three by republicans but two of the 
gop lawmakers claudine schneider in rhode island and hank brown 
in colorado are giving up their house seats to run for the senate 
the ads also are to be aired nationally thursday night on the 
cable news network 
dccc spokesman howard schloss would not disclose the budget for 
the campaign but said the ads would air from five to 10 times a day 
in the targeted districts 
i would simply say that with these spots the dccc is polluting 
the nations airwaves with misinformation said john roberts 
communications director for the national republican congressional 
committee if the democratic party has such an edge on the 
environment why did it take a republican president george bush 
to get the clean air act moving through congress 
one of the ads doesnt mention the gop but promotes the 
democratic party as most committed to protecting and cleaning up 
the environment 
as we approach a new century we must focus on the threat of 
global warming proper disposal of hazardous wastes and the 
prevention of industrial disasters the narrator says as 
environmental images are shown the democrats will continue their 
commitment to protecting our environment 
the second ad goes after the republican party it shows pictures 
of workers cleaning up after the exxon valdez oil spill as the 
narrator says 
when the valdez went on the rocks republicans took a 
waitandsee attitude like they did with the fires at yellowstone 
like theyre doing with nuclear waste at rocky flats but while the 
republicans waited the democrats went to work demanding the 
federal government take over the cleanup the democrats have been 
coming to the rescue of our environment for years because we cant 
afford to wait 
the seven congressional districts and the incumbents are 
new jerseys 3rd democratic rep frank pallone 
rhode islands 2nd schneider who is challenging democratic

colombias top generals said one of the 
worlds most powerful cocaine cartels is being torn apart in a 
dispute over its use of violence to intimidate the government 
on tuesday the chief of the countrys secret police gen 
miguel maza said some of the cartels leaders are opposed to the 
organizations campaign of killings and bombings in the belief that 
the violence is making the government more resolute in its fight 
against the drug trade 
president virgilio barco ordered a government crackdown on the 
traffickers in august 
in response the leader of the medellin cocaine cartel pablo 
escobar ordered a campaign of bombings and assassinations that has 
claimed more than 200 lives 
since beginning its crackdown the government has extradited 15 
traffickers to the united states and its security forces have 
seized millions of dollars in traffickers property and raided 
several cocaine labs 
one of the cartels leaders gonzalo rodriguez gacha was killed 
in a shootout with police in december since then police and army 
officials have said they are close to capturing the four remaining 
leaders of the cartel 
now security officials say internal pressures are causing the 
cartel to fall apart 
on sunday a statement purportedly issued by cartel dissidents 
said some traffickers oppose escobars use of violence 
there was widespread skepticism in colombia over the 
communiques authenticity colombias traffickers have for years 
used violence as a tool in building and maintaining their cocaine 
empire 
entire families have been killed government officials judges 
journalists and even a presidential candidate have been murdered 
despite the doubts the head of the armed forces gen oscar 
botero said monday that the communique was authentic and indicated 
that the cartel was falling apart 
on tuesday colombias largest daily el tiempo published an 
interview with secret police chief maza 
maza said the cartel is disintegrating and dozens of traffickers 
are breaking with escobar he said he was basing his assertion on 
intercepted communications from the cartel 
maza could not be reached by the associated press but a 
spokeswoman at his office said the interview was accurate 
el tiempo also quoted police gen octavio vargas as saying that 
escobar has marked for death 27 people accused of being police 
informants 
maza and other generals have not been able to explain why the 
intercepted communications have not led to additional arrests

the 1990 census is bypassing a few people 
like those who live in the odd zip code subdivision or skyscraper 
in houston 
officials from that city and others gathered tuesday to trade 
tales of woe and ask the federal government for help in the 
highstakes headcount that will determine how much aid theyll get 
and how many congressional representatives theyll have for the 
next decade 
there is still time for an accurate count said hulbert 
james director of special projects for new york city 
but he and others said that will only be possible if the 
government provides more money for the count keeps its district 
offices open well into next month and launches a major publicity 
campaign to persuade people to fill out forms and talk to census 
bureau counters 
even president bush needs to get into the act they said by 
making public service announcements that tell people they can 
safely open the door and talk to enumerators who show up to count 
them in person 
james said the 1990 headcount is in a crisis situation in 
the cities he and other officials members of a census task force 
of the us conference of mayors gave snapshots of what is going 
on in their cities 
houston officials initially estimated 10 percent of city 
residents did not get census questionnaires and were projecting a 
maximum 40 million loss due to undercounting but that was before 
a special census phone line started getting 900 calls a day from 
people who didnt receive forms 
we discovered that whole zip codes were being missed said 
patty knudson she said entire subdivisions were skipped and entire 
skyscrapers filled with condominiums failed to receive forms 
jessica heinz deputy city attorney in los angeles said 70000 
forms were returned to the post office as undeliverable and she 
said 108 of 556 people in a recent survey did not recall receiving 
census forms 
jai p ryu of baltimore said 81000 census forms were returned 
as undeliverable to a towson md office that serves the baltimore 
area we believe most of them are from baltimore which means 
well over 10 percent did not get their forms ryu said 
james said new york city would lose about 150 a year for each 
person that did not fill out a census form the initial projection 
was a 100 million a year loss for 10 years until the next census 
he said but mailing problems will probably drive the loss up 
higher james said the city found 1000 blocks with more than a 
halfmillion residents that were not on the census list of 
addresses he suggested many still were not on the list at mailing 
time 
the census bureau has estimated as many as 45 million people 
did not get census forms james said the number may be closer to 9 
million 
he and others also complained that the immigration and 
naturalization service made highprofile sweeps of immigrant 
neighborhoods at the same time the census bureau was trying to 
encourage illegal aliens to fill out the confidential forms 
james said there had been a number of ins raids in the past 
seven weeks in the washington heights area of new york home to 
many immigrants from the dominican republic others cited recent 
raids in los angeles and san jose calif and san antonio texas 
we did not expect that there would be public raids during this 
period james said 
new york city chicago los angeles houston dade county fla 
the state of california and groups representing mayors blacks and 
hispanics are already in court suing the census bureau on the 
theory that any count will be inaccurate

the value of tobacco exports doubled in the 
1980s contributing nearly 25 billion to the us trade account 
during the decade according to an industry report 
the study released tuesday by the tobacco merchants association 
of the united states said exports increased to almost 5 billion 
in 1989 from 25 billion in 1980 
last year alone while us industry as a whole produced a 
merchandise trade deficit of about 109 billion the us tobacco 
industry contributed 42 billion to the positive side of the 
nations trade ledger the association said 
the association in its 75th year said it represents all 
sectors of the tobacco industry including growers manufacturers 
suppliers dealers distributors securities firms and management 
consultants 
farrell delman president of the association said the growth of 
tobacco exports since 1985 when they were valued at 215 billion 
is attributable to the opening up of key asian cigarette 
markets as well as sustained exports to the middle east and 
europe 
tobacco exports have come under fire from some us health 
authorities and others who contend it is wrong to push sales 
overseas when americans are being advised to quit smoking because 
of health risks 
before he retired last oct 1 thensurgeon general c everett 
koop told congress it was the height of hypocrisy to export 
tobacco koop had conducted a vigorous antismoking campaign 
while in office 
dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation 
said american farmers and the us economy benefit from the recent 
upswing in tobacco exports 
kleckner in a statement said that increased sales of tobacco 
leaf and products are a result of american farmers producing they 
type of product wanted by foreign customers he also cited the 
removal of overseas trade barriers primarily in japan taiwan and 
south korea 
much of the increase is due to aggressive action by us trade 
officials to open overseas markets kleckner said farm bureau 
has been a vigorous supporter of liberalized trade for all 
agricultural products and we are pleased with the gains in 
tobacco 
kleckner said the 25 billion in tobacco exports during the 
1980s has been important to the us economy as well as the trade 
balance 
the success of tobacco has meant thousands of jobs in this 
country and has provided many farm families a good income he 
said

the congressional investigative agency citing 
flaws in the apache attack helicopter will recommend that the army 
abandon its plans to buy the final 132 aircraft capitol hill 
sources say 
the general accounting office will make its recommendations to 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations at a hearing thursday said the sources who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the panel also has subpoenaed army secretary michael stone who 
formerly was the armys chief acquisition executive 
the army said it responded to the subcommittees initial request 
for stone by offering two expert witnesses with the most 
knowledge on development fielding and sustainment of the apache 
they were maj gen donald williamson commanding general of the 
army aviation systems command and maj gen william forster 
director of requirements integration and deep operations and a 
former apache program manager 
however the subcommittee refused the offer and subpoenaed 
stone a spokeswoman maj nancy burt said he would appear 
the army plans to buy 807 apaches its topline attack 
helicopter from mcdonnell douglas corp at a cost of 12 billion 
it is committed to 675 the last 132 would cost 149 billion 
which has already been appropriated for the current fiscal year 
congressional investigators and a recent army memorandum 
described widespread problems with the aircraft 
although the apache is considered an allweather aircraft 
pilots had difficulty flying the helicopter through rain during the 
early hours of the us invasion of panama last december 
rain and humidity caused moisture to build up on the 
helicopters sensitive electronic components forcing mechanics to 
use heaters to dry out the parts 
improvements in the weather also prevented further problems 
from first deliveries in 1986 through last december the army 
had received 534 apaches investigators found that the helicopter 
could perform all assigned missions an average of 49 percent of the 
time a low rate for an army helicopter 
in addition the investigators found that as an apaches flight 
hours increased its ability to perform decreased 
the gao began its inquiry into the apache at the request of rep 
john dingell dmich chairman of the house subcommittee and is 
planning to issue a full report later this year 
complaints last year by army col r dennis kerr about the 
apaches unreliability in field exercises prompted dingells call 
for an investigation

civil libertarians and indian rights activists 
say the supreme court is abandoning its role as protector of 
unpopular minorities by permitting states to punish people who use 
illegal drugs in religious rituals 
the court by a 63 vote tuesday ruled that oregon officials 
may deny unemployment benefits to two fired drug counselors who 
took small amounts of peyote in indian religious ceremonies the 
court said there is no constitutional right to take illegal drugs 
for religious reasons 
this court seems to find it difficult to step outside of a 
white middleclass mindset said jack trope of the association 
on american indian affairs they really find it hard to 
understand what other cultures may feel and think this indian 
religion has a long tradition and is as spiritually worthwhile as 
any to which they might belong 
john rosenthal a spokesman for the american civil liberties 
union said the ruling is terrible mostly because it does an end 
run around the supreme courts longstanding commitment to 
religious freedom 
he said the ruling is the first in 50 years in which the court 
has treated a religious freedom claim with so little sympathy 
lenora begay spokeswoman for the navajo nation said to 
punish individuals because of their religious beliefs is beyond 
comprehension and an act of extreme ignorance 
but attorney general dave frohnmayer of oregon welcomed the 
ruling 
we have always insisted the state is not required to pay 
people for using illegal substances no matter what their religious 
beliefs might be he said 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said it would 
be courting anarchy to let a few do what is illegal for everyone 
else 
we have never held that an individuals religious beliefs 
excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting 
the conduct that the state is free to regulate he said 
the ruling leaves states free to permit religious use of illegal 
drugs 
in fact many states and the federal government already permit 
use of peyote in religious ceremonies 
in other rulings the court 
made it more difficult for employers to withdraw recognition of 
a labor union representing striking workers after new employees are 
hired to break the strike the justices voting 54 in a texas 
case reinstated a national labor relations board policy against 
presuming the new employees oppose the union 
ruled 90 in a case from illinois that lawsuits charging 
employers with violating a key federal antibias law may be filed 
in state as well as federal courts 
in the peyote case justice harry a blackmun wrote a stinging 
dissent that said the court reduced religious freedom for indians 
to an unfulfilled and hollow promise 
indians who have endured a history of religious persecution 
and intolerance may have no choice but to move to a state that 
permits them to practice their religion freely he said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall 
tuesdays ruling overturned decisions by the oregon supreme 
court that said state officials may not deny benefits to the fired 
workers galen w black and alfred c smith 
both were counselors with the douglas county ore council on 
alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment they were fired 
after each took small amounts of peyote as part of a native 
american church sacrament

charles h keating jr says he could save the 
taxpayers from losing any money if he regained control of his 
failed lincoln savings and loan association from federal regulators 
i think the bond holders would recover the equity holders 
would recover and the taxpayers would have no loss keating said 
tuesday in an emotional plea near the end of his seventh day on the 
witness stand in his suit seeking to recover the irvine calif 
thrift institution 
i think no one else could do a better job he said citing 
reports that the losses of governmentcontrolled thrifts are 
mounting 
however us district judge stanley sporkin who is hearing 
keatings suit prodded him to admit that he had no more money to 
protect the sampls depositors 
im completely broke as is all my family we have been 
absolutely broken by this debacle keating acknowledged at the 
same time he pledged to devote every ounce of energy and 
every asset i have to the task 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision is asking 
sporkin to dismiss keatings suit to overturn the april 1989 
seizure of lincoln 
regulators say lincoln could become the nations biggest thrift 
failure with losses topping 2 billion they have filed a 11 
billion civil fraud suit against keating and his associates 
on tuesday keatings attorneys introduced internal staff memos 
to support their contention that the federal home loan bank board 
the thrift offices predecessor had no reason to seize lincoln 
after examining lincoln regulators concluded it fell 114 
million short of its minimum capital requirement as of sept 30 
1988 
keating said lincoln officials pointed out extremely 
significant mathematical errors accounting for 100 million of 
the shortfall but regulators never responded 
however an internal memo introduced as evidence by keating 
indicates regulators were aware of one possible error that could 
have thrown their calculations off by 60 million 
alvin w smuzynski a senior bank board official told darrel 
dochow then the chief supervisory official at the agency in a 
feb 17 1989 memo it now appears that the examiners did make a 
significant 60 million error in their calculation 
i find this error if verified most distressing smuzynski 
wrote 
kevin oconnell another senior bank board regulator told 
reporters after the testimony that smuzynskis memo was the 
agencys first blush reaction to lincolns claims and that it 
never did agree that it had made an error 
note the hesitancy in the memo the memo said if verified 
in fact it was not verified oconnell said 
keatings attorneys introduced another internal memo from 
smuzynski to bolster their contention that the bank board unfairly 
killed his attempts to sell lincoln just before it was seized 
keating said bank board staff attached 21 conditions to the 
sale which were substantially accepted but still rejected it 
smuzynskis march 30 1989 memo to oconnell said we 
sometimes play a game with recommendations you can deny a 
recommendation by conditioning it to death i think we should try 
that 
regulators have said they rejected the sales because they were 
structured so keating was in effect financing the sale and was 
not giving up his interest in lincoln 
keating complained that on the day of lincolns takeover the 
government sent squads of armed guards to the phoenix 
headquarters of the sampls parent company american continental corp 
they insulted employees and searched people leaving the 
building including a daughterinlaw who was nine months pregnant 
keating said 
asked by the judge how regulators treated his customers he 
replied like dogs dirt locked them out roughed them up 
tuesdays testimony marked the 24th day of the hearing both 
sides have finished presenting their main case sporkin said he 
would give the government through friday to crossexamine keating 
and present any rebuttal witnesses the judge could eventually 
decide to uphold the seizure find it invalid or order a full trial 
of the matter

president bush cautions against counting prime 
minister margaret thatcher out based on her low standing in british 
opinion polls 
bush in an interview with european and canadian reporters said 
he hasnt given any thought to the possibility of having to 
deal with britains opposition labor party 
he shrugged off mrs thatchers low ratings citing his own 
underdog status in polls four months before a landslide election in 
1988 and the recent errant surveys that forecast victory for 
nicaraguas daniel ortega in february 
im enough of a politician to know that people can be down one 
moment and then soaring like an eagle the next said bush who 
met with mrs thatcher last friday in bermuda 
mrs thatcher who begins her 12th year in office next month 
has seen her popularity plummet partly due to an unpopular new 
method of taxation 
the white house on tuesday released a transcript of the 
interview bush gave the reporters on monday 
on another issue bush said he is very happy with the custom 
of keeping the supreme command of nato in the hands of an american 
general it contributes to the view that we have an important 
role to play in europe he said 
bush said he hopes his meeting with french president francois 
mitterrand in key largo fla on thursday will narrow any 
differences that might exist between france and the united states 
on the future of nato 
bush said there have been reports of a little drift and a 
little separation between the two allies on nato the best way 
to find that out is simply to sit and talk as we will do there 
he said 
it is my conviction that nato will have a perhaps even more 
important role to play in the stability of europe bush said 
mitterrands view doesnt exclude that but he has a keen 
interest in a role for csce said bush referring to the 
35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe which 
spans both nato and the warsaw pact 
i dont think were egregiously apart bush said 
asked if he could envision a french supreme commander of nato 
bush said were very happy with the present arrangements 
although france belongs to the 16nation alliance it does not 
participate in its integrated military structure 
i dont want to have this coming out in a chauvinistic sense 
but i think the american people have to feel the american 
presence is wanted in helping defend europe he said 
asked if the special usbritish relationship would endure 
under a labor government bush replied i havent given any 
thought to dealing with mrs thatchers opposition 
we do have a special relationship and itll continue im 
sure he said but he voiced the hope of steering clear of the 
bubbling cauldron of domestic politics inside the uk 
i think at least in this country people see mrs thatcher 
as a very courageous principled leader who fights for her beliefs 
and has survived many ups and downs he said 
on another issue bush said i think its premature for a 
threeway free trade agreement among the united states canada 
and mexico the united states and canada already have an agreement 
bush said the sensitivities on this question in mexico are 
such that we ought to let president carlos salinas set the pace 
here 
bush praised another ally japanese prime minister toshiki 
kaifu crediting his leadership with securing progress on long 
smoldering trade disputes with the united states

brazil has no intention of building 
nuclear weapons but it will not sign the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty because that would hurt the nations advances in nuclear 
technology the foreign minister says 
brazil is a country without enemies that strongly rejects the 
idea of building atomic weapons but we will not sign the treaty 
because we want to reach our objectives without foreign controls 
foreign minister francisco rezek said tuesday 
both rezek and the nations nuclear energy chief refused comment 
on a report released tuesday by the private carnegie foundation for 
international peace in washington that brazil and argentina engaged 
in smuggling to expand their nuclear weapons capabilities 
international environmental and political groups have pressed 
brazil to sign the 1967 world nuclear treaty 
a recent ministry statement however said the treaty is an 
unjust instrument that intends to perpetuate two classes of nations 
in the world those that can and cannot develop nuclear 
programs 
rezek said the new administration of president fernando collor 
de mello also rejects any form of foreign restrictions on brazilian 
installations for uranium enriching considered a major step toward 
building an atomic bomb 
jose luiz de carvalho santana the new president of the national 
commission of nuclear energy also denied that brazil would use 
nuclear technology for military purposes 
never have we imagined building atomic bombs santana was 
quoted as saying in an interview with the folha de sao paulo 
newspaper the constitution prohibits nuclear activities for 
nonpeaceful ends and that is why brazil will never make an atomic 
weapon 
brazil has only one nuclear power plant on line the angra i 
plant in angra dos reis 100 miles southwest of rio de janeiro the 
plant was built by the westinghouse co 
santana said all brazilian nuclear installations were under 
international safeguards and would be open for periodic inspection 
by the international atomic energy agency including the 
controversial aramar nuclear center 
the center kept secret until 1987 is run by the navy ministry 
in ipero 75 miles west of sao paulo in southeastern brazil two 
years ago the government enriched uranium at atamar as part of a 
program to build nuclear submarines 
the annoucement by former president jose sarney that brazilian 
scientists had successfully developed fuelcycle technology 
prompted speculation that brazil also wanted to build atomic 
weapons 
the brazilian society of physics recently said the aramar center 
is now capable of processing uranium for an atomic bomb and it 
warned in a report to congress about increasing militarization of 
the countrys nuclear program 
physicist luiz pinguelli rosa the author of the report said 
the government was treating the nuclear program on military and 
strategic merits and not for scientific or energy purposes 
it is worrisome to know that civil society has no type of 
control over the parallel nuclear program developed by the armed 
forces rosa wrote 
in response santana told folha da sao paulo that brazils 
nuclear program was coordinated in part by civilians and that the 
armed forces participated in the experiments as in any other 
scientific sector 
santana said the nuclear commission was studying the possibility 
of transferring uranium enrichment technology to the private sector 
for commercial use

the soviet union would have a completely 
modern formidable nuclear force even after carrying out cutbacks 
under a start treaty with the united states a senior adviser to 
president bush said today 
the cutbacks now being negotiated in geneva would trim the 
size of the soviet arsenal edward l rowny told the reserve 
officers association 
but in the meantime rowny said in a prepared speech soviet 
strategic forces longrange nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines are being systematically upgraded to provide for a 
powerful arsenal after the strategic arms reduction treaty 
the retired army lieutenant general who also served as an 
adviser to president reagan added the ussr is intent on 
retaining its claim to the status of a superpower equal to the 
united states that only firstrate nuclear forces can provide 
he said the soviets were upgrading their strategic nuclear 
weapons far more aggressively than the united states for instance 
rowny said the soviets are making their landbased ss18 
intercontinental ballistic missiles more accurate and more powerful 
while continuing to deploy ss24s with 10 warheads both in silos 
and as mobile weapons 
and the factory at votkinsk continues to turn out the single 
warhead ss25 at a prodigious pace he said the force of 
soviet ballistic missile submarines and strategic bombers continues 
to be modernized 
on the other hand rowny said the united states is unable to 
deploy the peacekeeping icbm on railroad cars while the b2 bomber 
and development of a mobile icbm are threatened by an untimely 
tally of the peace divided 
rownys remarks seemed to be aimed at congress which is 
reluctant to approve all the weapons requested by the bush 
administration while ussoviet tensions appear to be ebbing 
i will be the first to acknowledge that in todays world the 
threat of war between the us and ussr has declined dramatically 
rowny said but it has declined because america is strong not 
weak

the good news for nbc it won its fifth 
consecutive season in the primetime ratings the bad news it did 
it with the lowest ratings in history 
the seasonending arithmetic indicated cable tv is continuing to 
make inroads against the three major networks audience shares ten 
years ago they had 90 percent of the audience in the latest 
count theyre down to 65 percent 
network officials differed tuesday on whether cable and fox 
broadcasting or nielsens methods of estimating audience size 
caused the drop 
the primary cause of that drop is probably basic cable with 
a little bit of fox on the three nights that theyre on the air 
nbc research vice president robert niles said 
david poltrack and larry hyams research executives at cbs and 
abc respectively said tv viewing generally is down not just at 
the major networks and that the drop may result from methodology 
not competition 
citing declines in daytime viewing that he called unprecedented 
poltrack conceded that at this point we have no answer on the 
cause of the drop either in daytime or at night 
but the largest amount of that loss is from a decline in homes 
using television not from cable and other forms of competition 
said poltrack 
he said cbs has asked nielsen for a check of its methods of 
audience measurement which include instantdata peoplemeters 
in 4000 homes and diaries that viewers must fill in 
secondplace abc whose recent twin peaks series has gotten 
respectable ratings gained more viewers last season even though 
its share of the tv audience remained flat 
the ac nielsen co each year reports a larger number of homes 
with tv last year a ratings point represented 904000 homes this 
year the number was up to 921000 which meant abcs audience 
increased by more than 200000 homes 
cbs finished in third place for the third year with its worst 
ratings ever 
in the 30week season that ended sunday abc averaged a 129 
the same as in 198889 cbs averaged a 122 down 4 percent nbc 
had a 146 9 percent below last season 
nbc officials noted that nbcs ratings last season had the added 
boost of telecasts of the summer olympics the world series and the 
super bowl 
only fox broadcasting which doesnt yet consider itself a 
network and only has three nights of regular programs showed a 
ratings rise 
boosted by its midseason cartoon hit the simpsons it had a 
65 rating up from last seasons 53 average for two nights of 
shows according to fox estimates 
americas funniest home videos on abc was the seasons 
toprated new series coming in fifth overall 
of the midseason shows besides twin peaks nbcs new carol 
amp company starring carol burnett has shown ratings promise it 
has won its time period in all three of its saturday broadcasts to

the long road to a seat in a freely 
elected hungarian parliament was rutted with prison the threat of 
the gallows and selfexile for bela kiraly who led freedom 
fighters against soviet tanks in 1956 
for the 78yearold kiraly victory at the polls on april 8 
capped a perilous journey that saw him change continents and 
professions three times 
the ramrod career army officer fled after the failed 1956 revolt 
and began a new life in the united states as a history professor 
he returned last year to help cement democracy in his homeland and 
plans to sell his home in highland lakes nj 
my life moves like a sinus curve up and down said a 
reflective kiraly the old soldier never dies he just fades 
away but he always has a last hurrah this is my last hurrah 
while he had been prepared to live out his life in the united 
states kiraly always considered himself a hungarian 
the fact that i came back and among the circumstances that i 
did somehow just makes my whole justified kiraly said the 
predominant sentiment in my heart is im proud to be hungarian 
thirtyfour years ago when kiraly slipped into austria the 
revolution had failed and the soviets were hot on his trail there 
was no thought of returning 
the former brigadier general had spent years on death row for 
treason before communist leaders paroled him and others as part of 
a futile attempt to defuse growing popular outrage he joined the 
revolt shortly after it broke out oct 23 1956 
as the head of the national guard of freedom fighters kiraly 
was high on the list of men wanted by the postrevolutionary 
hungarian government staying would have meant the gallows as it 
did for premier imre nagy defense minister pal maleter and other 
leaders of the uprising 
their execution in 1958 shocked the western world kiraly then 
made a vow that seemed to make his exile permanent 
i set the precondition not to cross the frontier of this state 
until and unless my friends who became martyrs received the 
proper acknowledgement and honor in hungary 
kiraly was invited back to hungary on june 17 to speak at a 
reburial ceremony for his friends 
the hungarian communist leadership had been the only one in 
eastern europe to reject its monopoly on power without massive 
popular pressure 
in the process it embraced the 1956 revolution as legitimate 
rehabilitated the leaders of the uprising and moved their remains 
from weedrankled unmarked plots to proper graves 
as ranking communist officials stood with heads bowed kiraly 
invoked hungarys glorious day hundreds of thousands listened 
to his words some sobbing in catharsis 
for kiraly it ranked as one of the most memorable moments in a 
remarkable life along with his election to parliament in his home 
town of kaposvar about 90 miles southwest of budapest 
but not all the good times were in hungary 
kiraly said he felt an nearunparalled sense of accomplishment 
in 1964 when the students of the city university of new york 
elected him teacher of the year he speaks glowingly of the united 
states 
it was a very generous land i never felt any sense of 
confrontation there between being a decent american citizen and 
remaining a hungarian he said america will never be a closed 
book for me 
kiralys most vivid memories are still firmly rooted in 1956 
hungary and his face assumes a faraway look as he talks about the 
heady days of near victory and the despair of defeat and selfexile 
nothing compares to the election as head of the freedom 
fighter forces he said and those days will remain indelibly 
etched in my mind forever

the rev ralph david abernathy who shared 17 
jail cells with martin luther king jr marched with him in selma 
cradled his bloody head in memphis and broke with his followers 
over a tellall memoir is dead at 64 
abernathy died tuesday at crawford long hospital while being 
prepared for a lung scan to locate a suspected blood clot hospital 
spokeswoman tisha burland said the cause of death was not 
immediately known 
as kings chief lieutenant abernathy was at his side at almost 
every key battle of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s 
and took his place as leader of the southern christian leadership 
conference after kings 1968 assassination but the fame and 
adulation enjoyed by king never quite extended to abernathy 
in a 1986 interview he lamented that during a visit to a school 
in connecticut not a single student knew who i was 
in 1989 he was reviled as a traitor to the cause for writing 
about kings alleged marital infidelity in his autobiography and 
the walls came tumbling down abernathy wrote that king spent 
time with two women and had a violent argument with one in the 24 
hours before his assassination 
kings widow coretta scott king was among those who praised 
abernathy on tuesday she issued a statement from zimbabwe where 
she was attending celebrations of that countrys 10th anniversary 
of independence 
when our home was bombed and our lives were threatened he was 
there she said his strength as a tactician and a counselor to 
martin during our struggle has been eloquently recorded in martins 
own writings and in the annals of the american civil rights 
movement 
kings son fulton county commissioner martin luther king iii 
called abernathys death a very tragic loss to our nation 
president bush hailed abernathy as a great leader in the 
struggle for civil rights for all americans and a tireless 
campaigner for justice 
the rev joseph lowery who succeeded abernathy as president of 
the sclc described abernathy on tuesday as a faithful servant of 
the cause of liberty and justice 
abernathy had been in the hospital since march 23 for treatment 
of a sodium deficiency and had suffered strokes in 1983 and 1986 
at the time of his death he was pastor of west hunter street 
baptist church 
born in linden ala the son of a farmer abernathy joined with 
king in 1955 to lead the montgomery ala bus boycott that lifted 
king to national fame for the next 13 years king and abernathy 
were virtually inseparable 
we were known as the civil rights twins abernathy once 
recalled we always sought to complement each other i never 
tried to be a copy of him and he never tried to be a copy of me 
they cofounded the sclc in 1957 and abernathy was in a nearby 
cell when king wrote his famous letter from the birmingham jail 
in 1963 setting forth the goals of their movement 
later that year abernathy was at kings side for the i have a 
dream speech that climaxed the march on washington the biggest 
demonstration in us history he was in sweden when king received 
the nobel peace prize in 1964 and the two led the 
selmatomontgomery march for voting rights in 1965 
and on april 4 1968 in memphis tenn abernathy took kings 
bloody head in his hands moments after an assassins bullet cut him 
down 
but in his autobiography abernathy said he felt other king 
aides saw him as no more than an appendage to martin who 
never played an important role 
king had directed that abernathy succeed him at the sclc despite 
abernathys reluctance abernathy led the 1968 poor peoples 
campaign that brought thousands to washington but the sclc lost 
its leadership role in the civil rights movement as key aides such 
as andrew young and jesse jackson left to follow their own paths 
abernathy stepped down from the sclc leadership in 1977 and 
slipped back into kings shadow while other black leaders stepped 
to the fore in 1986 he was excluded from a planning group for the 
first martin luther king jr national holiday 
after publication of his autobiography abernathy was criticized 
in a statement signed by 28 prominent blacks including young 
jackson lowery and benjamin hooks executive director of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people his 
alma mater alabama state university rescinded its decision to 
name a dormitory after abernathy 
his friend hosea williams branded abernathy a judas 
on tuesday williams called him one of the truest human rights 
leaders america has ever produced 
by giving unselfish leadership and through suffering and 
sacrificing dr abernathy has earned the second most important 
place in history williams said 
abernathys survivors include his wife juanita two sons 
kwame and state rep ralph david abernathy iii and two daughters 
juandalynn and donzaleigh 
funeral arrangements were incomplete

bested by roseanne 
he included in his ratings average a special sunday broadcast of 
roseanne that he said had dragged the shows total ratings 
down roseanne is regularly broadcast tuesday nights

washington ap a district of columbia judge has dismissed a 
lawsuit against rep barney frank dmass alleging that franks 
relationship with a male prostitute constituted a public nuisance 
the suit alleged that frank was aware his capitol hill apartment 
was being used by stephen gobie for his prostitution business 
superior court judge harold cushenberry dismissed the suit on 
the grounds that the plaintiffs had no right to bring it and that 
any alleged nuisance was clearly not continuing 
the onepage decision dated april 10 was released by franks 
office tuesday as frank in boston was announcing his candidacy 
for a sixth term 
the suit was filed two ministers of washington churches and 
financially backed by the conservative caucus which has long 
opposed many of franks liberal views 
in his onepage order cushenberry wrote that he concluded 
that an ongoing statutory violation is required to seek an 
injunction against frank blocking the alleged nuisance and that the 
plaintiffs have failed to allege the special damage that must 
be pleaded in order for a private party to prosecute a public 
nuisance claim

forces bent on ending moscows reign as the 
capital of communism have taken over the city council and want to 
start by removing the giant bust of lenin from their meeting hall 
theres certain to be a fight over whether the plaster bust will 
stay or go and some wonder if with all the procedural wrangling 
the newly elected councils majority will be able to carry out any 
of its goals 
members did agree on one thing tuesday to remove the fancy 
sturgeon from the buffet at the house of political enlightenment 
where their sessions are held the russian delicacy is unavailable 
to the ordinary consumer and deputies decided it would be 
unsuitable to feast on it themselves 
the key figure in the economic revolution brewing in this city 
of 9 million is gavriil popov an outspoken economist and lawmaker 
whom the council was expected to elect mayor today 
popov rotund and steely haired has pushed for freemarket 
reforms to replace central planning he was always in the minority 
until the democratic russia bloc took control of more than 60 
percent of the 495 council seats in march balloting 
well be trying to bring in a program of the privatization of 
the economy said lev balashov a member of the bloc 
popov refused to be interviewed during a break in tuesdays 
session but his blocs plans are laid out in kommersant a new 
business newspaper with a capitalistic slant 
it said that under popovs administration moscows reforms would 
far outpace the country as a whole and the city would become a 
testing zone for economic reform nationwide 
the newspaper said the democratic russia bloc wants changes that 
would create a virtual free market in agricultural produce and 
remove private businesses known as cooperatives from a tangle of 
regulations 
it also wants incentives to attract foreign capital including 
easing rules on longterm leasing of buildings and allowing firms 
to pay in part with services to ease city problems 
there has been no kremlin reaction to the proposals the city is 
largely independent when it comes to funding 
radicals are banking on being able to do more to change the 
economy however they say president mikhail s gorbachev who 
began instituting reform after coming to power in 1985 
increasingly supports a market economy 
moscow clearly needs help as pravda reported tuesday public 
transport works badly the housing program is on the point of 
breaking down the health system is in a depressing state the list 
of food and goods shortages is lengthening the ecology is getting 
worse financial prospects are unclear and the crime rate is 
growing 
but the new city councils first session which began monday 
raised doubts about how effective it would be 
legislators bogged down for hours in procedural wrangles typical 
of soviet bloc parliaments 
most of these people are activists said boris kagarlitsky 
a sociologist and member of the democratic russia bloc they 
cant tell the difference between a public rally and a council 
session 
with such inefficiency the prospect for moscow is a 
disaster kagarlitsky said there are two possible outcomes 
either chaos or catastrophe within six months 
theyll have problems with electricity with food shortages 
and probably the city can go bankrupt 
members of moskva or moscow bloc which includes 95 council 
deputies who basically follow the communist party line also 
predict that the city is doomed under the radicals 
vladimir gruzdev of moskva said many feared the city would 
return to early uncontrolled capitalism and lose the social 
guarantees of communism 
members of democratic russia and moskva disagree on just about 
everything and moskva deputies have repeatedly walked out of the 
hall in protest 
however they have agreed for now to leave the bust of lenin 
scowling over the proceedings 
balashov said he was sure it would be gone by this time next 
year

art wilmer and his family lived in a 
quiet mountain cabin near yellowstone national park until a 
750person bomb shelter was erected nearby 
this winter wed go out in the middle of the night and hear 
the roar of the diesel engines he said tuesday its like 
living next to an industrial park 
the engines belonged to the church universal and triumphant a 
religious group building a giant underground falloutshelter 
complex in a high mountain meadow north of gardiner to prepare for 
the possibility of global catastrophe 
residents of the yellowstone gateway community ringed by 
10000foot mountain peaks have eyed the church with curiosity and 
suspicion since it bought a 12500acre ranch from the late 
millionaire publisher malcolm forbes in 1981 
that suspicion has turned to anger with construction of the 
churchs complex and last weeks news that more than 30000 gallons 
of gasoline and diesel fuel have leaked from underground tanks near 
the fallout shelter 
people are getting tired of what the church has been doing 
said wayne hoppe who lives east of gardiner which has a permanent 
population of about 600 theyre just literally tearing this 
country to pieces 
state health officials in helena said tuesday they would seek a 
court order stopping construction of the church complex just north 
of the park 
church spokesman murray steinman responded we believe that 
weve done everything that we were asked by the state to do and we 
will continue to do it our essential message is were going to 
cooperate cooperate cooperate 
after buying the forbes ranch church officials said they had no 
plans for extensive development the church has since bought 18000 
more acres moved its headquarters here from southern california 
and sponsored several housing developments 
hundreds of followers have moved into the area and many have 
built fallout shelters at housing developments near emigrant a 
ranching community 30 miles north of gardiner 
the church is led by elizabeth clare prophet who claims she 
receives and passes on to members messages from a group of souls 
known as the ascended masters she warned her followers that march 
and april would be dangerous times 
gardiner residents accused the church of lying about its 
development plans which many see as a threat to the environment 
their religion doesnt matter they can howl at the moon for 
all i care said bill hoppe wayne hoppes son and an outfitter 
im not against them living in park county but by god theyve 
got to be truthful they havent said one truthful thing for nine 
years 
steinman said church officials have communicated what we were 
doing when we knew what we were doing i dont want residents to 
get the idea that we dont care 
wilmer said he and his family recently moved from their cabin 
into gardiner because of constant traffic on the narrow twisting 
dirt road leading to the fallout shelter 
we just decided hey this is too much stress so we moved 
out he said it was like a frenzy my wife almost had a 
headon with some big trucks 
hoppe and others also accused the state of failing to 
aggressively regulate church developments i think the church is 
laughing at the people of montana and the people of park county and 
our governor he said 
local officials estimate 2000 to 3000 church members live in 
the valley 
a lot of people used to say hey were doing our thing let 
them do theirs wilmer said now theyre realizing that 
exercising its freedom is going to take away ours

share prices soared on the tokyo stock exchange 
wednesday while the dollar rose marginally against the yen 
the dollar ended trading at 15987 yen up 004 yen from 
tuesdays close of 15983 yen it opened higher at 16013 yen and 
ranged between 15980 yen and 16018 yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average rose 78746 points or 277 
percent ending the day at 2924906 in the markets ninthlargest 
singleday increase the nikkei had slipped a marginal 158 points 
on tuesday 
traders said the index surged in the afternoon because many 
market players shared the view that both stock prices and the yen 
had bottomed out 
as the yen weakened below the 160yen level which many 
investors had feared they felt the market had gotten over one 
negative element and started buying said takahiro kishishita a 
trader with nippon kangyo kakumaru securities co 
as long as the yen stays around 160 the stock market will 
remain stable kishishita said 
currency dealers said the dollars strength followed its upswing 
in new york tuesday the rise was spurred by the release of data 
showing continued strength in the us economy including a 07 
percent rise in industrial production in march they said 
expectations that february trade figures due out later wednesday 
in washington would show a dramatic improvement over januarys 93 
billion deficit also supported the dollar dealers said 
many investors have been buying the dollar based on an 
expectation of smaller us trade deficit said koichiro amaya a 
dealer with chemical bank in tokyo 
but amaya said the dollar will continue to move narrowly around 
the 160yen level because some investors who have already 
overbought the dollar are selling the us currency whenever it 
nears 16020 yen 
in the bond market the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bond slipped to 8576 points late in the 
morning from tuesdays 8590point finish that boosted the yield 
to 7415 percent from 7385 percent

a claim by scientists to have found a gene that 
may make people prone to alcoholism should be regarded with extreme 
caution says a leading researcher 
dr henry begleiter of the state university of new york health 
science center said such research is usually done on living members 
of the same family not cadavers as was done in the study in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
i would be at the very very least extremely cautious 
to report that the gene had been identified said begleiter who 
is studying 800 families in the nations largest research project 
on the role of heredity in alcoholism 
in the new study scientists reported finding a particular gene 
on a chromosome previously linked with alcoholism to be far more 
common in alcoholics than nonalcoholics 
if verified the finding would represent the first specific 
identification of a genetic root for alcoholism and would give 
added weight to the argument that alcoholism is a disease and not a 
moral weakness 
alcoholism afflicts about 18 million americans and tends to run 
in families environment also has been implicated as a contributing 
factor 
scientists exploring possible genetic factors have named three 
of the bodys 46 chromosomes as possibly playing a role but no one 
previously isolated one of the 100000 genes on those chromosomes 
as likely culprits 
the gene pinpointed in the new study has two forms each of 
which governs formation of a nerve cell called the dopamine d2 
receptor believed to play a key role in experiencing pleasure 
the researchers looked at both forms of the gene the a1 
allele and the a2 allele in brain tissue from the cadavers 
of 70 subjects 35 alcoholics and 35 nonalcoholics 
we found a very high association of the a1 allele with 
alcoholism and a very high association of the a2 allele with 
nonalcoholism said dr ernest p noble the studys coleader 
and director of the alcohol research center at the university of 
california los angeles 
the a1 allele was present in 69 percent of the alcoholics and 
in 20 percent of nonalcoholics the researchers reported such a 
high correlation was surprising given that alcoholism comes in a 
number of forms and is almost certain to have a number of causes 
they said 
we really cant say that indeed we found the alcholism gene 
per se said kenneth blum the studys coleader and chief of the 
addictive diseases division in the department of pharmacology at 
the university of texas health science center in san antonio 
but he added in an interview tuesday we think that in the 
ageold question of nature vs nurture this finding has added to 
the nature side to the disease concept rather than to the 
concept that alcoholism is just moral weakness or willful 
misconduct 
scientists at the national institute on alcohol abuse and 
alcoholism of which noble is former director wrote in an 
accompanying editorial that the study is provocative and 
promising but must be regarded with caution 
reasons for caution include a lack of complete information on 
the subjects medical histories and uncertainty over whether 
genetic differences between the groups are linked to traits 
unrelated to alcoholism they said

american indian peyoteeaters say ritual 
use of the psychedelic cactus is unlikely to stop despite a us 
supreme court ruling that religious beliefs are no excuse for using 
illegal drugs 
the court tuesday upheld the decision of oregon officials who 
denied unemployment benefits to two drug counselors fired for 
eating peyote as part of their religious practices 
justice antonin scalia writing for the courts 63 majority 
said it would be courting anarchy to let a few do what is 
illegal for everyone else 
dissenting justices said the ruling permits religious oppression 
of indians a view supported by american indian spiritual leaders 
we have been doing this all these years before the 
constitution was here i dont see why we cant continue said 
emerson jackson president of the native american church of north 
america the umbrella group claims at least 250000 members 
belonging to 70 church chapters that practice the peyote ritual in 
23 western states 
the oregon drug counselors galen w black and alfred c smith 
were fired after breaking a policy of adapt the nonprofit 
rehabilitation organization they worked for in douglas county 
ore by eating small amounts of peyote as part of a native 
american church sacrament smith is an american indian black is 
not but belongs to the church 
the two were fired in 198384 and denied unemployment benefits 
they did not use peyote on the job 
oregon officials see the case as a drugabuse issue 
we have always insisted the state is not required to pay 
people for using illegal substances no matter what their religious 
beliefs might be said oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer 
the court said our law does not discriminate against religions 
but defenders of peyote rituals see the case as a clash of 
cultures 
the native american church is the most persecuted bona fide 
religion in the united states said steven moore attorney for 
the native american rights fund in boulder colo the irony is 
that its one of the first its been here for 10000 years 
the small buttonshaped cactus contains mescaline a mild 
hallucinogen it grows mainly in the deserts of mexico and southern 
texas 
archaelogical evidence indicates the plant was used by indians 
10000 years ago said omer stewart a retired university of 
colorado anthropologist and author of the book peyote religion 
today the psychedelic cactus is dried into chewy strips ground 
into powder or made into a bitter tea its not likely to attract a 
wide following of casual users said stewart who has studied the 
ritual use of peyote since 1937 
jackson a navajo peyote priest from window rock ariz 
calls the peyoteinduced hallucinations teachings from the holy 
spirit he likens peyote to the sacramental wine used in roman 
catholic communion except that alcohol is habitforming and 
peyote is not 
he travels around the west as a road man administering 
peyote in fireside rituals of chanting and drumming that last all 
night 
the rituals build cultural ties and reduce the alcoholism that 
plagues indian reservations said ralph metzner academic vice 
president of the california institute of integral studies in san 
francisco and author of the psychedelic experience 
peyote also serves healing and psychotherapeutic roles metzner 
said in our more segmented approach we have doctors counselors 
and priests they have peyote 
congress repeatedly rejected attempts to ban the ritual use of 
peyote 
jackson is confident that peyote use will continue his concern 
for now is finding enough peyote which the church buys in texas 
from dealers regulated by state and federal governments 
were getting more members jackson said and the supplies 
are going down

massachusetts supreme court overruled a judge and 
ordered jury selection open to the public today in the case of a 
christian science couple charged with manslaughter for not seeking 
medical care for their son 
superior court judge sandra hamlin on tuesday had ordered jury 
selection closed on the grounds publicity would have a chilling 
effect on prospective jurors 
but supreme court associate justice neil l lynch overruled him 
on a challenge by the boston globe 
david and ginger twitchell are charged with manslaughter for 
relying on faith instead of medicine to heal their 2yearold son 
robyn who died in 1986 of a bowel obstruction 
prosecutors argued that the childs life could have been saved 
if he had received conventional medical treatment 
defense attorney rikki klieman contended that the twitchells 
far from acting recklessly sought the only real cure dictated by 
their beliefs 
founded in 1879 by mary baker eddy the church of christ 
science believes that disease like sin can be healed by 
spiritual means alone the case is being closely watched by the 
church which contends its doctrine is under attack 
the us supreme court typically has refused to hear such cases 
and there has been little consensus in similar cases heard around 
the country

contra rebel leaders have softened 
demands the sandinista army be dismantled before they disband but 
it remains unclear whether agreement can be reached by the time the 
new government takes office 
a top aide to presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro said 
after talks late tuesday involving the contras and the sandinistas 
that the possibility of nicaraguans finally living in peace is 
enormous 
the sandinistas defeated at the polls in february had 
predicted a fresh outbreak of fighting unless the thousands of 
contra fighters who have since flooded into the country from 
honduras lay down their arms 
sandinista and uno negotiators said they expected to sign a 
ceasefire agreement with the contras today 
contra negotiators did not comment after leaving the talks 
which focused on who should hold arms when her united national 
opposition coalition uno takes office a week from today 
the rebel delegation arrived for talks tuesday saying the 
contras would not lay down their arms until the military built 
and dominated by the sandinistas during their decade in power is 
dismantled and replaced by a police force 
the contras have said nicaragua should follow the example of 
costa rica a stable democracy that dismantled its army in 1948 
but after the 6hour meeting the rebel delegation appeared 
flexible 
chief contra negotiator oscar sovalbarro said demands that the 
sandinistas disarm are aspects that must be negotiated 
maj gen joaquin cuadra deputy defense minister and chief of 
staff of the sandinista army said that with political will 
the contras could be dismantled by the time mrs chamorro takes 
office 
but uno negotiator leopoldo navarro said the participants would 
have to be flexible about the april 25 deadline demanded by the 
sandinistas 
early in the day the sandinista press had expressed concern 
that a new round of war could break out 
it quoted the general secretary of the sandinista labor 
federation as saying sandinista workers would seize strategic 
points in managua if the contras refuse to disarm the union 
claims 100000 members 
one prosandinista daily el nuevo diario said in a frontpage 
headline either the contras demobilize before the 25th or a 
general strike explodes 
but after the meeting antonio lacayo mrs chamorros soninlaw 
and a leading aide struck an optimistic tone there are enormous 
possibilities of assuring peace in nicaragua 
the negotiations were the first involving uno the contras and 
the sandinistas since mrs chamorros 14party coalition defeated 
the sandinistas in feb 25 elections 
mrs chamorro will take office for six years and her 
administration is counting on a peaceful nicaragua to deliver on 
her key campaign promise of reviving the economy 
under a protocol agreement signed by uno and the administration 
of outgoing president daniel ortega mrs chamorro pledged to 
respect the armys professionalism but said officers would be 
barred from serving as political party leaders as is now the case 
both ortega and mrs chamorro have called on the contras to 
disband the contras and uno signed an agreement on march 23 for 
the contras to disarm but set no firm date 
a uno spokesman luis sanchez said the contra demand to cull 
the army of sandinista officers had not been discussed tuesday and 
there were no plans to take up the issue 
la prensa the newspaper owned by mrs chamorros family 
reported tuesday that bernard aronson the assistant us secretary 
of state for the region was expected to visit thursday for talks 
with the sandinistas and uno 
washington backed the contras in their nineyear war with the 
sandinistas but now supports mrs chamorros call for their 
dissolution

chippewas exercising their rights under 
19th century treaties to spear fish off the reservation were jeered 
by hundreds of protesters when they took to their boats for the 
first time this season 
one arrest was reported tuesday night when the tribes lac du 
flambeau band the most avid spearfishers were met by opponents at 
numerous lakes and reservoirs as in years past some protesters 
blew whistles at the spearfishers 
its not as bad as last year but its still bad said matt 
valliere a member of the lac du flambeau one of six chippewa 
bands

reservoir near mosinee again the crowd was mostly opposed to the 
annual spring offreservation spearfishing outings during the 
spawning season 
the lac du flambeau spearfish with batterypowered spotlights 
mounted on boats 
the states chippewa bands have the right to spear fish off the 
reservation in northern wisconsin under treaties that ceded the 
northern third of the state to the us government since 1983 
federal courts have upheld the treaties 
nonindians argue that spearing during spawning depletes game 
fish from lakes opponents also contend the treaties give indians 
unequal rights 
one protester at the big eau pleine reservoir questioned the 
chippewa claim that the fish are used to feed their families 
who do you sell them to what is the going rate right now 
asked candy radant of wausau who called indian treaties 
garbage 
the six chippewa bands are eligible to spear about 41000 
walleye this spring in a season that runs into early may last 
year nonindian rodandreel anglers took more than 600000 
walleye from wisconsin lakes

senior officials of the african national congress are expected 
to arrive in south africa on april 28 to prepare for talks four 
days later with the government on ending whiteminority rule a 
newspaper reported today 
police said five people were killed tuesday in clashes between 
rival black factions in the eastern province of natal hundreds of 
people have been killed in natal in recent months in the fighting 
mobs killed three women in the port shepstone area in ritual 
necklace killings two men were killed in separate incidents 
police did not give any reason for the killings 
the natal fighting pits the ancbacked united democratic front 
against the conservative inkatha political movement the rival 
groups oppose apartheid but differ over plans for a future south 
africa 
business day newspaper reported tuesday that five senior anc 
members were expected to arrive april 28 to prepare for talks with 
the government the leaders include south african communist party 
chief joe slovo and anc foreign affairs spokesman thabo mbeki 
the five leaders based at anc headquarters in lusaka zambia 
would assist anc leader nelson mandela in preparing for talks in 
cape town on clearing the way for fullscale negotiations on 
sharing power with the black majority the report said 
president fw de klerk said tuesday that the government will 
insist in the talks that the anc renounce violence in its struggle 
against apartheid he said the ancs advocacy of armed struggle 
would hold back any negotiations on powersharing between the white 
minority and the 28 million blacks 
the ancs continued commitment to armed struggle even if it 
were merely rhetorical constitutes a further obstacle alongside 
the reality of the violence which has to be removed de klerk 
said 
in a speech to parliament de klerk reiterated his views on the 
constitutional system he hopes to negotiate with the anc and other 
antiapartheid groups once obstacles to talks are removed 
de klerk said the government will propose blackwhite 
powersharing through a oneman onevote system however he said 
other reforms would ensure that white domination will not be 
replaced with black domination 
the president also condemned rightwing white groups saying 
they promote a psychosis of violence and criticized andries 
treurnicht leader of the proapartheid conservative party 
the irrevocability of the process which has been initiated and 
its urgency place an enormous responsibility on the shoulders of 
every leader in our country de klerk said 
he said political leaders must moderate their statements in 
the realization that negotiation is a process of debate and 
agreement of giving and taking 
if the quest by anyone is for victory before negotiation 
negotiation becomes meaningless de klerk said

northwest of pretoria to get treatment for his foot when the 
accident happened he died at the hospital 
masemola was already in prison when he was sentenced to life on

zsa zsa gabor has been ordered to 
appear at a hearing to decide whether the actress completed work at 
a womens shelter as part of her sentence for hitting a policeman 
a judge ordered the may 1 hearing because the shelters director 
failed to document miss gabors 120 hours of community service 
deputy district attorney elden fox said tuesday 
but a shelter staff member who refused to give her name told the 
los angeles daily news that the director mailed the documentation 
to municipal court judge charles g rubin on friday 
vera davis executive director of the lower income elderly 
united community assistance program has said miss gabor worked 
about 50 hours at the shelter and served the rest through guest 
appearances and in planning a celebrity auction at her belair 
mansion to benefit the shelter 
rubin asked for documentation after ms davis sent him a letter 
stating miss gabor completed her sentence but offered no details 
fox said the prosecutor had said substituting appearances and the 
auction was unacceptable 
miss gabor has said she put in much more than the required 120 
hours and plans to continue working to help the shelter 
miss gabor was convicted sept 29 for slapping officer paul 
kramer during a traffic stop she also was convicted of driving 
without a license and having an open container of alcohol in her 
rollsroyce she was sentenced to four days in jail but that 
portion of the sentence is being appealed

british government agencies might have allowed the 
sale of arms components to iraq before customs agents seized 
iraqbound steel pipes that could be used for a huge gun a 
newspaper said today 
sources indicated that the department of trade and industry 
and the ministry of defense may have known the military potential 
of the order raising the specter of government departments 
conniving to break britains embargo on arms trade with iraq the 
independent newspaper said 
the report based on unidentified british civil service sources 
also said customs officers were under intense political pressure by 
the government not to prosecute the suppliers 
government officials want the makers of the steel pipes to 
be protected from court proceedings which could reveal the extent 
of the government involvement in the deal it said 
a senior government source described the independent report as 
absolute rubbish government sources acknowledged there were 
some military aspects to all this but they did not elaborate 
customs seized eight forged steel tubes last thursday at the 
port of middlesbrough in northeastern england as they were about to 
be shipped to iraq officials say the tubes could be used as part 
of a giant artillery gun to fire shells hundreds of miles the 
makers of the tubes sheffield forgemasters denies this and iraq 
says the pipes were meant for the petrochemical industry 
the financial times britains leading business daily reported 
today that the british and belgian governments have evidence a 
belgian defense company prb was contracted by iraq to help 
produce a boosterassisted shell for a longrange artillery gun 
prb is owned by the british munitions company astra holdings 
the financial times said contracts for the suspected gun 
components and the projectile were coordinated by companies 
associated with ballistics expert gerald bull a canadianborn 
american murdered in brussels march 22 
the company walter somers a subsidiary of eagle trust said 
tuesday it was now concerned that hydraulic gear sent to iraq in 
october could be used as part of a shock absorber possibly a 
hydraulic recoil mechanism in a huge gun 
eagle trust chairman david james said our engineers are now 
wondering whether they have been misled up the garden path by the 
iraqis 
james said walter somers decided to reexamine its contracts 
with iraq following bulls murder he said bull and his 
brusselsbased company space research corp acted as agents for 
various iraqi orders and were the source of technical data and 
drawings related to them 
belgian police said bull 62 was shot twice in the head and 
that the gunman used a silencer the motive was not robbery because 
20000 was found in the victims pockets police said

when the kids munch a big mac sometime later 
this year they may be doing it while sitting on a bench made of 
recycled plastic the paper bag to carry it home may be made out of 
an old newspaper 
mcdonalds corp announced tuesday that it plans to spend 100 
million a year about onefourth of its construction budget on 
recycled materials when building new outlets or renovating existing 
ones it dubbed the program mcrecycle usa 
we think there need to be markets created for recycled 
materials edward h rensi president of mcdonalds usa said in 
a telephone interview from oak brook ill we decided to create a 
market 
rensi said that in addition to seeking out recycled products 
when building new restaurants the company plans soon to use 
recycled newsprint for carryout bags at about 500 of its outlets 
if it works the use of the newsprint will be expanded 
theyre not going to be as white as we necessarily would like 
but theyre going to be fully serviceable the printing on them is 
just fine and to be able to use newsprint is just fantastic 
rensi said 
he said mcdonalds will seek out suppliers of recycled building 
materials through a tollfree telephone number 
the uses of recycled materials are numerous and not expected to 
cost significantly more rensi said we have a lot of 
opportunities 
he said some of the possible uses of recycled plastics and other 
materials are as barriers to keep cars from going onto the curb in 
parking lots building insulation mop buckets menu boards 
chairs tables signs and playground equipment 
mcdonalds builds about 375 new restaurants each year and 
renovates an additional 1000 of its 8500 outlets annually 
earlier this year mcdonalds announced a pilot program in some 
of its new england outlets that promotes the recycling of 
polystyrene food containers and other plastics 
we think the program is working very well but it can work a 
lot better because weve only got 250 restaurants on the program 
right now we hope to add about 25 restaurants a week and get up to 
500 very soon rensi said 
eventually the company hopes to expand the program to all of its 
restaurants 
but rensi said mcdonalds which serves 22 million people daily 
worldwide and is one of the largest users of plastic food 
containers has no plans to shift away from using plastics which 
do not degrade in landfills 
a number of communities have begun to consider barring the use 
of polystyrene containers by fastfood restaurants because of 
growing concerns about shrinking landfills 
rensi maintained however that the polystyrene containers can 
be recycled while coated paper used in food packaging often cannot 
paper does not do the kinds of things people think it does 
he said you put it in a landfill and it doesnt biodegrade food 
packaging particularly doesnt biodegrade because its wrapped in 
some kind of a compound and you cant recycle it its 
costprohibitive 
wed rather use more plastic than less and we think if 
public opinion ever catches up to science consumers are going to 
applaud us for sticking to it the mcdonalds executive added

nepals prime ministerdesignate 
nominated eight cabinet ministers today to form this himalayan 
kingdoms first oppositionled government in almost 30 years 
prime ministerdesignate kp bhattarai acting president of the 
onceoutlawed nepali congress party said he would retain the posts 
of defense and foreign minister in the new government 
bhattarai said he had sent a list of his nominees to the palace 
for approval by king birendra who on april 8 lifted a nearly 
30year ban on political activity in response to prodemocracy 
protests 
bhattarai 65 who spent 14 years in prison for political 
agitation said he did not expect the king to block the nomination 
of any of his nominees 
it is not a question of his agreement bhattarai said it 
is a question of my wanting 
bhattarais cabinet nominees included three congress party 
members three united left front members and two independents 
the king wielded almost absolute power until he was forced to 
make concessions by opposition groups earlier this week prime 
minister lokendra bahadur chand was dismissed after he was besieged 
in a building by prodemocracy demonstrators 
the opposition has said it wants the 44yearold king to act as 
the constitutional monarch of a parliamentary democracy with 
lawmakers holding the real power 
the king will name two of his own nominees for the cabinet on 
thursday later that day bhattarai and his ministers will take 
their oaths of office 
the interim government headed by bhattarai is expected to remain 
in power until free general elections can be held bhattarai said 
the vote will be held by april 1991 
the prodemocracy movement was led by bhattarais centrist 
nepali congress party and the united left front a coalition of 
leftwing groups including the communist party 
birendras father king mahendra banned political parties in 
1961 after two years of westernstyle party government headed by 
the nepali congress party mahendra dismissed the government 
accusing it of corruption and inept administration 
afterward the country was controlled by a partyless political 
structure known as the panchayat or council with the king as the 
head of state 
the monarch nominated onefifth of the national assemblys 140 
members and approved the nominations of others running for 
election according to political observers 
nepal a predominantly hindu nation of 17 million is one of the 
worlds poorest nations with a per capita annual income of 150

a judge awarded custody of a 10monthold 
boy orphaned by the october earthquake to a cousin ending months 
of family squabbling over the child and the 1 million he stands to 
collect 
superior court judge roderic duncan on tuesday placed james 
brown iv with his mothers cousin instead of with his maternal 
grandmother or paternal grandfather who had accused each other of 
being unfit to raise the baby 
the child will live with arthur and tonia lewis on their 50acre 
hog and cattle ranch near chowchilla about 120 miles from san 
francisco duncan said that before the hearing the grandparents 
and the lewises met and agreed to a visitation schedule 
the judge last month had awarded temporary custody to the 
lewises and also removed the money issue by putting a guardian in 
charge of the boys estate 
lewis attended the court hearing and smiled broadly when he 
signed the custody settlement but lewis cousin to the babys dead 
mother declined to comment saying only that the boy is doing 
wonderfully 
the child is scheduled to receive 100000 in damages for his 
parents deaths but the settlement may reach upwards of 1 million 
by the time the case is finally resolved 
the custody fight started shortly after the oct 17 earthquake 
which claimed the lives of jimmys unmarried parents 18yearold 
michelle marie richard and 20yearold james brown iii 
they were among the 42 people killed in the collapse of the 
nimitz freeway all told 68 people died in the 71magnitude quake 
richards mother anita williams 35 and browns father james 
brown ii 37 sought custody of the infant and the compensation he 
was getting from the state both had been taking turns caring for 
the child 
ms williams is raising her own children on welfare during 
court proceedings she was accused of consorting with drug abusers 
and brown is on parole after going to prison for theft 
by tuesday two others had filed for custody james brown iis 
brother and the infants paternal grandmother 
but the three grandparents and the uncle finally agreed to give 
him up to the lewises who also have a 5yearold daughter and have 
been unable to conceive other children 
its absolutely wonderful said s simone campbell the 
childs attorney who recommended that the lewises get custody 
we got the lawyers out of the room and left the families to work 
it out 
campbell said the lewises who both work on the farm were the 
first choice because they could be with jimmy all day 
all of their jobs allow them to constantly be by jimmy 
campbell said he doesnt have to be in day care its better 
than with the other families 
afterward ms williams attorney don foley said his client 
was comfortable with the decision but still disappointed she has 
made a decent adjustment hes still part of her life

white said the judge could have ordered in a less specific way 
kansas city school officials to levy property taxes at a rate 
adequate to fund the desegregation remedy and could have enjoined 
the operation of state laws that would have prevented the school 
district from exercising this power white said 
the courts vote on that point was 54 chief justice william h

airports will never be safe from 
terrorist acts which are on the rise and getting bloodier despite 
new bomb detection systems developed by the federal government the 
fbis chief bomb technician says 
the numbers just keep going up and we dont see anything 
thats going to negate that trend robert quigley the head of 
the fbis bomb data center said tuesday i dont think airports 
will ever become a hard target because they have to have a level 
of free public access anyway 
there were 4368 terrorist incidents around the world last year 
up from 3734 in 1988 quigley said bombings rose to 1930 in 1989 
from 1622 in 1988 the figures came from a private research 
company 
in one of the most notorious incidents a bomb said to be 
concealed as a radio felled pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland on dec 21 1988 all 259 people on board as well as 11 
people on the ground were killed 
we dont see it will end not in my lifetime said 
quigley who along with a host of other bomb and security experts 
gathered tuesday at the massachusetts institute of technology to 
discuss the status of airport safety 
still raymond salazar the director of civil aviation security 
for the federal aviation administration said he thought it was 
definitely possible to stem the tide of terrorism 
no antiterrorism policy will ever be 100 percent effective 
salazar said but terrorists wont win if the civilized world 
launches a multipronged effort based on cooperation among local 
governments law enforcement and intelligence against them 
i think its definitely possible if all those things come into 
play he said 
the arsenal against terrorists now includes automated 
explosivedetection systems developed by the faa salazar said he 
estimated the faa spent about 60 million over 10 years to develop 
the systems which use neutrons uncharged atomic particles to 
detect explosives 
the systems are already being used in new york city and miami 
and should be deployed in about 40 cities worldwide over the next 
two years he said 
critics have called the new systems too large too slow like 
trying to stuff an elephant into a horses stall salazar said 
to these critics i say you have to start somewhere you cant 
wait for perfect while you have good available

the prague prosecutor has 
threatened to outlaw the communist party within the city limits 
just as campaigning is about to begin for czechoslovakias first 
free elections a newspaper said today 
in a letter to the communist partys central committee 
prosecutor tomas sokol drew a parallel between communism and 
fascism which is illegal in czehoslovakia he set an april 30 
deadline for the party to clarify its views 
as of may 1 the political activity of your party will be 
judged with a view to committing the criminal act of propagating 
fascism or similar movements the svobodne slovo daily newspaper 
quoted sokol as saying 
the justice ministry had no immediate comment and a spokesman 
for president vaclav havel also declined comment the communist 
party said it would make an official comment later 
all communist deputies about 40 percent of parliament reacted 
by failing to attend a debate on the fate of interior minister 
richard sacher accused of not dealing harshly enough with the 
disbanded secret police 
the accusations were made by the civic forum which led last 
winters prodemocracy revolution and now dominates the government 
the communist move forced the debate to be postponed 
sacher heads the peoples party part of a christian democratic 
coalition that poses some of the toughest opposition to civic forum 
in the june 8 elections but the communists who still claim 1 
million party members in a nation of 155 million also pose tough 
opposition to civic forum and placed second in recent opinion 
polls 
in his letter sokol said fascism and communism had in common 
destruction of all democratic rights and the method of terror 
and social demagoguery according to czechoslovak law 
propagation of fascism is punishable by up to eight years in jail 
if committed publicly using the media 
a deadline of april 30 was set to clarify the true essence of 
your ideology as well as settling of all administrative matters 
connected with the liquidation of your exposure in prague 
the letter said 
the communist daily rude pravo today protested publication of 
the letter in the czechoslovak media 
does this letter have any connection with the fact that 
the elections campaign starts in a couple of days is this a 
contribution to the newly formed objective justice the culture and 
decency of the campaign the daily said in an editorial

mexico has demanded that washington explain 
how us agents seized a mexican doctor charged in the murder of 
us drug agent enrique camarena following reports that the doctor 
was kidnapped by bounty hunters 
the physician dr humberto alvarez machain was delivered to 
los angeles this month to face charges in camarenas 1985 torture 
and murder 
the los angeles times reported today that alvarez was kidnapped 
in an unauthorized operation arranged by officials of the us drug 
enforcement administrations office in los angeles 
citing unidentified mexican sources close to the case it said a 
bounty of up to 50000 reportedly was offered to the four 
kidnappers and two pilots who took alvarez from mexico to el paso 
texas where he was arrested on april 3 
frank shults a dea spokesman in washington refused to comment 
on how alvarez arrived in the united states but said the arrest had 
violated no laws 
the times quoted the mexican sources as saying american 
officials told them the kidnapping was carried out without approval 
from washington 
mexicos foreign ministry said in a statement tuesday night that 
mexican diplomats in washington would ask the state department 
about the location and conditions under which alvarez was 
apprehended 
it said mexico was concerned about reports alleging he could 
have been arrested illegally in mexico with the participation of 
us authorities 
leftist politicians and newspaper columnists have been calling 
the case an affront to mexicos sovereignty for two weeks but this 
was the first expression of concern from the mexican government 
on tuesday the countrys congress asked for an investigation 
and us attorney general dick thornburgh told a news conference in 
washington that he has asked for a full report on the incident 
thornburgh was to fly to mexico today to attend a conference on 
drug enforcement 
alvarez 42 is one of 19 mexicans who have been indicted by a 
federal grand jury in los angeles on charges of kidnapping 
torturing and killing camarena a dea special agent 
charges against suspected participants in the murders in 
guadalajara of camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar have 
strained usmexican relations 
us law enforcement officials say the mexican government failed 
to respond to their requests to extradite several defendants 
mexican officials say the united states had never requested the 
extradition of alvarez or anyone else indicted in the case 
a jan 31 indictment in los angeles contained the latest round 
of charges in the case besides alvarez it named manuel ibarra 
herrera former director of the mexican federal judicial police 
and miguel aldana ibarra former head of the mexican office of 
interpol the international lawenforcement agency

a former state democratic party chairman said he 
was thoroughly vindicated by his acquittal on charges that he 
took part in a scheme to bribe dominican republic officials to 
release drug planes 
us district judge james kehoe on tuesday acquitted alfredo 
duran before the defense presented its case the judge said the 
government failed to prove the charges against him were a crime 
under the foreign corrupt practices act 
the case went awry in the past month after one of the defendants 
was revealed to be a drug enforcement administration informant and 
a chief prosecution witness turned out to be an attorney who failed 
to inform clients he was secretly cooperating with federal 
investigators 
i feel that i have been thoroughly vindicated said duran 
53 who could have faced a maximum five years in prison i was 
ready to take the stand in my own defense i am very happy 
democratic party officials at the time of the november 
indictment called it a political vendetta by us attorney dexter 
lehtinen a former republican state senator whose wife is a 
republican congresswoman 
durans defense attorney donald bierman played down the 
political angle in the case duran was state party chairman from 
1976 to 1980 
i think that it was a very poorly thoughtout prosecution but 
i dont personally believe it was political said bierman 
diane cossin spokeswoman for lehtinen again denied any 
political motivation behind durans indictment saying such charges 
showed a misunderstanding of the grand jury system that brought the 
indictment

canadian military authorities today 
grounded f18 training flights until investigators learn why two 
fighter jets collided in an accident that renewed german demands 
for an end to such nato exercises 
tuesdays crash left one canadian pilot dead and another 
injured and showered parts of karlsruhe with flaming debris 
crushing several cars and damaging buildings in the southwestern 
city of 285000 people west german media said it was a miracle no 
civilians were killed 
the collision of the two canadian fighters reminded germans of 
the 1988 military jet disasters at the ramstein us air force base 
and in the central west german city of remscheid both accidents 
killed german civilians as well as nato pilots 
the accident rekindled debate over the dozens of military 
training flights that crisscross west german skies each day west 
germans have said they would like to see the missions sharply 
curtailed as eastwest relations improve 
hansjochen vogel head of the opposition social democrats 
today demanded an immediate end to the nato practice flights over 
densely populated areas 
friedel laepple interior minister for saarland state and a 
social democrat demanded a stop to all military training flights 
over west germany 
the west german government was also concerned and used some of 
the most pointed language to date after a military crash 
the defense ministry in bonn said it has urgently asked the 
canadian air force to quickly and comprehensively clear up the 
causes of the accident 
in a statement the ministry said it asked the canadians to 
examine whether interceptor training with f18s should be 
stopped until the reasons for the accident are known 
the canadian forces today announced all f18 airtoair training 
flights were grounded until the cause of the collision is 
determined 
a spokeswoman for the canadian forces in lahr baerbel newman 
said both flight recorders had been found but the cause of the 
collision was not known 
maj john paul macdonald spokesman for canadian forces in lahr 
said the canadian air force f18s collided at about 9800 feet 
burning debris ripped from the jets in the collision rained 
down on karlsruhe streets west german television quoted witnesses 
as saying the engine of one jet smashed into a building near a gas 
station 
karlsruhe officials said about 50 damage reports were filed 
in canada the father of the dead pilot told canadian press that 
his son capt timothy kirk leuty 30 was nearing the end of his 
stint in west germany as a member of the 439th squadron based in 
badensoellingen 
we were really looking forward to his coming home stan 
leuty said from his home in meaford ontario he was due to leave 
in june and he was going to be based in cold lake alberta when he 
got back 
the other pilot capt reginald decoste 35 of jonquiere 
quebec ejected safely and landed on a highway breaking both 
heels he was listed in good condition at an area hospital 
macdonald said 
the two pilots had taken off from badensoellingen air base near 
rastatt about 25 miles southwest of karlsruhe police said the 
canadian air force has 48 f18s at the base 
thousands of canadian soldiers are stationed in west germany as 
part of a multinational nato force they routinely take part in

a series of strong earthquakes struck 
northern california today rattling the nerves of residents in a 
100mile area from san francisco south to salinas on the 
anniversary of the catastrophic 1906 quake 
the hardest quake struck at 654 am and measured a preliminary 
54 on the richter scale allen lindh of the us geological survey 
said the ucberkeley seismographic station measured the quake at a 
preliminary 55 on the richter scale 
both agencies said the quakes hit just east of watsonville 
about 60 miles south of san francisco in the loma prieta area 
where the october 17 quake measured 71 on the richter scale 
the two other strong quakes today included one at 638 am that 
measured a preliminary 45 on the richter scale centered four 
miles eastsoutheast of watsonville and another 45 quake at 641 
am 
watsonville police dispatcher bob spidle described the first 
quake saying it bounced weve had lots of calls but ive had 
no reports of any damage 
pacific gas amp electric co reported power loss to 6500 
customers in the watsonville area 
san francisco police said they received many calls from worried 
residents but no damage and no injuries were reported 
only the night before a rally featuring displays on earthquake 
safety had been held to mark the sixmonth anniversary of the oct 
17 1989 quake which killed 68 people and caused billions in 
damage and survivors of the great earthquake that destroyed san 
francisco in 1906 had gathered at dawn to commemorate the occasion 
on tuesday southern california quivered from a series of 
aftershocks from a february earthquake and a small temblor hit 
rural eastern indiana there were no damages or injuries reported 
from those two areas 
tuesdays quake measured 46 on the richter scale and was 
centered three miles west of upland said robert finn spokesman 
for the california institute of technology in pasadena upland is 
40 miles east of los angeles 
the 332 pm quake was the strongest in a swarm of minor 
tremors in the foothills of the san gabriel mountains three 
smaller tremors followed within two hours all in the same area 
finn said 
the shocks were in an area of the san antonio canyon fault that 
was not ruptured in the feb 28 quake which measured 55 on the 
richter scale and inflicted some serious damage to older buildings 
indianas tuesday morning quake shook buildings rattled windows 
and woke up residents but caused no damage jay county authorities 
said 
michael hamburger seismologist and geology professor at indiana 
university put the quakes magnitude at 25 to 3 on the richter 
scale and its epicenter in eastern jay county about 65 miles 
northeast of indianapolis 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of april 18 1906 which occurred 
before the richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on 
the richter scale the quake and subsequent fire were blamed for an 
estimated 700 deaths

the supreme court ruled today that a federal 
judge may not personally raise property taxes to pay for school 
desegregation but can order school officials to do so 
by a 90 vote the court said us district judge russell g 
clark abused his discretion when he personally imposed a school 
district tax hike in kansas city mo 
but in a victory for civil rights forces the court upheld most 
of the steps clark ordered school officials to take to racially 
desegregate the schools 
in a 54 vote the court said the judge could order officials to 
raise taxes to pay for the ordered desegregation remedies and could 
instruct them to ignore state laws limiting the anount of school 
taxes 
writing for the court justice byron white used sweeping 
language that could affect schooldesegregation cases nationwide 
a local government with taxing authority may be ordered to 
levy taxes in excess of the limit set by state statute where there 
is reason based in the constitution for not observing the statutory 
limitation white wrote 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices anthony m 
kennedy sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia dissented decrying 
the courts casual embrace of taxation imposed by the unelected 
lifetenured federal judiciary 
clark went too far the court said today local officials 
should at least have the opportunity to devise their own solutions 
to these problems white wrote 
whites opinion was joined by justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
through the last three decades the court has given federal 
judges sweeping power to take whatever steps necessary to end 
racial segregation in public schools those steps have included the 
forced busing of students teacher reassignments and even the 
partial merger of separate school districts 
but the court in january split 54 in limiting federal judges 
power to stamp out civil rights violations as it overturned fines 
against yonkers ny councilmen who blocked a housing 
desegregation plan 
the court said the judge who imposed the fines had exceeded his 
authority and should have waited to see whether potentially 
bankrupting penalties against the city would force adoption of the 
desegregation plan 
in arguments before the justices last october on the kansas city 
case missouri lawyer h barton farr iii representing the state 
called a tax increase ordered by an unelected judge taxation 
without representation 
when it comes to federal courts farr said then there is no 
power to tax period 
todays decision rejected that argument 
before 1954 missouri law required schools to be racially 
segregated in the following 35 years the percentage of black 
students in kansas citys school district rose from 225 to about 
75 percent 
black parents sued in 1977 over the decline of what had become 
predominantly black schools alleging that black students were 
being denied equal educational opportunities 
clark ruled in 1987 that the school districts physical 
facilities have literally rotted and ordered state and district 
officials to upgrade them 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld most of clarks 
order saying there are still vestiges of the dual school system 
lingering in the city school district and the district and the 
state have not met their obligations to disestablish that system 
the judges orders called for two major remedies 
a magnet school plan by the 199192 school year in which 
every high school and middle school and about half the elementary 
schools in the district will feature distinctive themes such as 
foreign languages performing arts or math and science 
a capital improvements program costing some 260 million to be 
completed by next fall 
the state was ordered to pay threefourths of the remedial 
costs the school district onefourth 
school district voters had rejected six proposals since 1970 to 
increase taxes for education clark nearly doubled the local 
property tax ordering the school district to raise the tax from 
205 to 4 per 100 of assessed valuation to help finance the 
capital improvements 
the court must weigh the constitutional rights of the 
taxpayers against the constitutional rights of black students in 
this case clark said the balance is clearly in favor of the 
students who are helpless without the aid of this court 
the 8th circuit court upheld the tax hike in 1988 today the 
nations highest court struck down the specific tax hike ordered 
but left open the option of some tax hike being imposed by the 
school district under court order 
the case is missouri vs jenkins 8811150

battling christian forces hit a school 
bus at a crossing gateway between east and west beirut today 
setting it on fire and killing at least 15 people 11 of them 
children police reported 
many of the pupils yelled for help as we tried to extinguish 
the fire at least one teacher also was among the dead along with 
the driver a soldier on the scene said 
a police spokesman said the bus was hit at 230 pm while 
trying to cross to christian east beirut 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations 
said the bus from mraijeh elementary school a new private school 
in south beirut was hit by an incendiary rifle grenade which 
ignited the fuel tank 
it couldnt be determined who fired the rifle grenade the 
spokesman said 
it was not immediately clear why students from predominantly 
christian east beirut were attending primary school in south 
beirut a shiite moslem stronghold but many students are among the 
estimated 30000 people who commute across the line daily 
the radio station of christian gen michel aoun said the bus was 
fired at by rival gunmen of samir geageas lebanese forces militia 
geageas fire burned out the children the broadcast said 
geageas command could not be reached by telephone from west 
beirut to comment on the report 
however the progeagea voice of lebanon radio station called 
the hit mysterious 
the gutted wreckage of the yellow bus lay on the pavement in the 
aouncontrolled sector a few yards east of the museum crossing 
that links beiruts eastern and western sectors across the dividing 
green line 
the army private one of the soldiers serving under aoun said 
he and his colleagues doused off the burning bus with water and 
we evacuated the victims to nearby hospitals 
the attack followed intermittent skirmishing and a powerful 
explosion that reportedly demolished two floors of aouns defense 
ministry news reports said three soldiers were killed aouns 
command said two were killed it was not immediately clear what 
caused the blast 
aoun has been locked in bloody power struggle with geagea for 
more than two months they have been battling since jan 30 for 
control of the 310squaremile christian enclave the fighting has 
killed 877 people and wounded 2388 
meanwhile rival shiite moslem militias fought a 90minute gun 
battle this morning in syrianpoliced west beirut and one person 
was killed and four wounded the police spokesman said 
the clash between the proiranian hezbollah or party of god 
and the syrianbacked amal arabic for hope subsided after 
about 100 syrian soldiers moved in to stop the confrontation 
police said 12 people have been killed and 52 wounded since the 
latest round of amalhezbollah clashes broke out in west and south 
beirut tuesday 
the police spokesman said most of the casualties were civilians 
including children caught in the crossfire of fierce street 
battles across densely populated residential districts 
amal in a communique blamed the confrontation on hezbollah 
charging that the fundamentalist faction wanted to block efforts 
being exerted to release the western hostages held by 
hezbollah it did not elaborate 
hezbollah has repeatedly denied involvement in the abduction of 
the 18 westerners including eight americans missing in lebanon 
however hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for the 
underground hostageholding factions that follow the teachings of 
the late iranian revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
there now appears to be a power struggle in iran between 
government officials who support the release of the hostages and 
radical hardliners who view hostagetaking as a way to punish the 
corrupt west 
the police spokesman said that despite syrian patrols fighters 
from amal and hezbollah maintained their rooftop positions in 
beirut threatening a renewal of allout fighting 
rival shiite fighters also skirmished in southern lebanons 
iqlim eltuffah province early in the day but no casualties were 
reported the police spokesman said 
amal and hezbollah have been fighting on and off for more than 
two years for lebanons 12 million shiites the nations largest 
sect by police count more than 1000 people have been killed and 
3000 wounded in the clashes

robert olson was convicted of murder armed robbery and assault 
in the july 18 1987 holdup of a gas station in minneapolis in 
which the station manager was shot to death olson was sentenced to 
life in prison plus six years 
he said he had been duped into driving the getaway car for the 
crime 
the minnesota supreme court had overturned olsons conviction 
and granted him a new trial todays decision upheld the state 
court ruling 
police acting on an informants tip went to a home where they 
believed olson was staying with the two women who lived there 
after surrounding the home police telephoned and asked to speak to 
olson a male voice was heard to say tell them i left 
police officers then rushed into the home found olson hiding in 
a closet and arrested him olson made an incriminating remark to 
police that was used against him at his trial 
todays decision means olson must be retried and that the 
incriminating remark the result of an unlawful arrest cannot be 
used as evidence 
the issue is whether the arrest violated olsons fourth 
amendment rights we hold that it did white wrote 
the fourth amendment bans unreasonable police searches and 
arrests 
white added we stay in others homes when we travel to a 
strange city for business or pleasure when we visit our children 
or more distant relatives out of town when we are in between jobs 
or homes or when we housesit for a friend we will all be hosts 
and we will all be guests many times in our lives from either 
perspective we think that society recognizes that a house guest 
has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his hosts home 
the court in 1980 invoking the phrase a mans home is his 
castle ruled that police almost always need warrants before 
arresting people in their homes 
todays decision extends the reasoning of that 1980 decision to 
house guests as well

the aids virus was found in almost one in 3000 
teens who applied for the military over a 42month period with the 
infection rate about equal among young women and men researchers 
reported today 
the data presented in this study suggest that hiv is a real 
and immediate threat to teenagers throughout the united states 
the researchers from the walter reed army institute of research in 
washington dc wrote in todays journal of the american medical 
association 
the study looked at 1141164 teens applying to enlist in the 
us military between october 1985 and march 1989 all of whom were 
tested for the human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids of 
that number 393 were hiv positive 
overall 48 of 150043 female applicants tested positive or 
032 percent and 345 of 991455 males or 035 percent the 
researchers said 
but women aged 17 and 18 tested positive more often than their 
male counterparts 28 of 102576 women or 027 percent compared 
with 177 of 763872 men or 023 percent an unusual phenomenon 
among any age group for example the malefemale ratio among 
adults with fullblown aids is 931 the researchers said 
the probable explanation the researchers said is that females 
aged 17 and 18 are more likely to have older infected sexual 
partners than males 
the study found that results varied widely in different regions 
with the most populous states accounting proportionately for the 
highest number of infected teen applicants 
hiv prevalence was greatest among minorities from densely 
populated counties the study said 
fiftytwo of the 90821 teens who tried to enlist in california 
tested hiv positive followed by 45 of 62244 in new york and 38 of 
73789 in texas nine states alaska colorado maine montana 
north dakota new hampshire rhode island south dakota and wyoming 
had no hivpositive applicants the study said 
the researchers reported that the prevalance of hiv infection 
among teen applicants appeared to decrease over the study period 
but cautioned that more research is needed to verify that finding 
they urged greater educational efforts to stop the spread of hiv 
and aids 
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

oil and natural gas flowed normally into lithuania 
today officials of the breakaway government said despite threats 
by moscow to halt the supplies to curb the republics independence 
drive 
lithuanian officials said they had expected the kremlin to begin 
cutting oil and natural gas supplies early today to enforce soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs threatened economic embargo 
soviet troops were seen near a pumping station at an oil 
refinery in northwestern lithuania this morning but there was no 
change in the supply of fuel at the facility according to a report 
on lithuanian television 
lithuanias energy minister said oil supplies were normal and he 
had not been informed of any planned reductions 
on friday gorbachev threatened to impose an embargo of critical 
supplies unless lithuania rescinded within 48 hours several laws 
meant to bolster its march 11 declaration of independence 
lithuanian leaders have made no move to meet gorbachevs demands 
but say they are willing to negotiate gorbachev refuses to meet 
with them until they rescind their declaration of independence 
president bush said in washington the united states was 
considering appropriate responses if supplies were cut but he 
also said he did not want to damage superpower relations 
secretary of state james a baker iii today told the house ways 
and means committee that us support for perestroika gorbachevs 
economic reform program was at risk 
our bilateral commercial contacts with the ussr may be 
more directly in their interest than in ours and those contacts 
are being put to risk by soviet actions in lithuania baker said 
lithuanias parliament the supreme council met today to forge 
an official response to the soviet leader and they were still 
debating the tone of the resolution into the afternoon said rita 
dapkus of the legislatures information office also under sharp 
discussion was the composition of a delegation to send to moscow 
she said 
worried lithuanians flooded the baltic republics government 
with phone calls and stocked up on fuel 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said he believed any 
hardships would strengthen the republics resolve to split from the 
soviet union 
lithuanian gas officials received a telegram late monday from 
the acting general director of the soviet unions western gas 
network saying natural gas supplies would be sharply reduced from 
the 17th of april 
but runya kontouteite a spokeswoman for the supreme council 
said by telephone that natural gas was flowing normally this 
morning 
she said that a check with the central pipeline duty officer 
indicated there were no signs of any fall in the pipeline pressure 
in addition oil supplies were being received normally at a 
major refinery in the town of mazheikiai which produces 
highoctane gasoline for export kontouteite said 
lithuanian tv reported that residents saw soviet troops in 
several armored vehicles stopped for a time near a pumping station 
at the mazheikiai refinery but there was no interruption of 
service said broadcaster edwardas potashinskas the presence of 
soldiers at the site was unusual he added 
nearly all western journalists were forced by the soviet 
government to leave lithuania last month 
leonas asmantas minister of fuel and power engineering told 
vilnius radio that the supply of oil is normal and he had 
received no official document from anyone informing him of a cutoff 
asmantas said he did not think the soviet union would take the 
step of reducing oil supplies perhaps economic pressure will be 
applied in some other forms but not in the supply of fuel he was 
reported as saying 
sales of gasoline to motorists have tripled this week as 
residents reacted to the threat but stocks were adequate and no 
rationing was anticipated asmantas said 
in his ultimatum friday gorbachev said moscow would demand hard 
currency from lithuania for materials the soviet union sells abroad 
for convertible currency oil and gas which lithuania receives at 
subsidized prices are the soviet unions biggest earners of 
foreign currency 
lithuanian officials were discussing shifting some oil and gas 
from industrial production to use in homes and hospitals if the 
cuts occur but had not publicly discussed a conservation program 
the republic uses 185 million cubic meters of natural gas a 
day including 11 million cubic meters for homes 
the kremlin forcibly annexed the three baltic republics 
lithuania estonia and latvia in 1940 estonia and latvia also 
seek to restore independence but are moving more cautiously 
gorbachev says lithuanian independence can be discussed only 
within the framework of soviet law 
a law passed this month would let republics secede if they gain 
approval of twothirds of their residents in a referendum and wait 
a maximum of five years 
also today a mentally ill man who claimed to have a bomb 
hijacked an aeroflot jetliner to lithuania but he was arrested

the supreme court ruled today that a lawyer 
who wins a civil rights case can collect a big chunk of a clients 
award under an agreement made when the attorney was hired 
by a 90 vote the court ruled against a california man awarded 
212 million and then ordered to pay 40 percent of the judgment to 
his lawyer 
justice byron r white writing for the court said federal 
civil rights law permits such contingentfee arrangements 
the case stems from a federal lawsuit by juan francisco venegas 
against long beach police officers venegas won a suit in which he 
said his murder conviction was based on perjured evidence 
venegas hired michael mitchell to represent him in the suit and 
agreed to pay the lawyer 40 percent of any award he won 
a federal court also awarded mitchell 75000 in legal fees a 
sum to be paid by the police officers 
mitchell and venegas parted ways in 1986 when the lawyer asked 
for an additional 10 percent of the judgment to represent venegas 
on appeal and venegas refused 
the lawyer then filed a court motion to place a lien on the 
judgment to recover his 40 percent fee or 406000 
a federal judge gave mitchell a partial victory ruling he may 
be entitled to the contingent fee but leaving the matter to a state 
court to decide 
mitchell won a bigger victory before the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals 
the appeals court last year sent the case back to the federal 
judge to reconsider the lawyers bid to enforce a lien on the 212 
million award 
today the supreme court agreed with the 9th circuit court that 
under federal civil rights law mitchell is not limited to 
courtawarded attorneys fees when there is a contingency fee 
agreement with a client 
the case is venegas vs mitchell 881725

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
april 14 
the arizona daily star tucson ariz on the tuna industry 
pledge 
most of the us tunacanning industry celebrated earth day a 
little early this year or else it moved to protect the tuna 
market with its pledge not to buy tuna caught in fishing nets 
that also catch or injure dolphins 
the announcement by the nations three largest tuna canners 
owners of the starkist chicken of the sea and bumble bee brands 
of tuna should prevent thousands of dolphins from dying in 
fishermens nets this year 
but consumers cant live on the word of big business alone 
congress must enact legislation to hold industry to its promise 
it is not as if the tuna industrys change of heart was 
motivated by environmental enlightenment on the contrary it was 
consumer consciousness including a letterwriting campaign and 
tuna boycott that moved the industry to crack down on fishing 
practices deadly to dolphins 
under the recent announcement called the most important step to 
protect dolphins since the 1972 marine mammal protection act the 
canning companies will rely on the reports of observers stationed 
on board tuna fishing vessels for making decisions about whether to 
buy a particular catch of tuna 
american consumers should seek more than pledges from the 
tunacanning industry however greenpeace urges monitoring to 
ensure companies keep their promises about not supporting unsafe 
fishing methods it also wants congress to pass legislation 
introduced by rep barbara boxer dcalif and sen joe biden 
ddelaware to create a tunacan labeling system to identify 
dolphin unsafe tuna 
the cost to consumers will be only a few additional cents per 
can its a small price to pay to protect the sea mammal

the bulletin bend ore on atampt and planned parenthood 
atampt the communications giant decided the other day to quit 
giving money to planned parenthood directors of the foundation 
which atampt supports should reconsider their decision 
a spokesman for atampt admitted the foundation made its decision 
because of pressure brought by ultra conservatives upset with 
planned parenthoods involvement with the abortion issue 
not that atampts funds went to finance abortions or even to pay 
planned parenthood employees to mention the operation no atampts 
money went to finance a program aimed at reducing the number of 
unplanned pregnancies that seem to fall most frequently on the 
nations poorest least educated teenagers 
atampts decision to withdraw its support for a worthy program 
based on the rantings of what it admits is a tiny minority poses a 
serious threat for a whole variety of charitable organizations if 
an outfit as large as atampt can be bullied into submission by a 
handful of nuts what can be expected from smaller less 
wellheeled businesses 
its position on abortion aside planned parenthood offers a 
variety of valuable services in an age of concern about the 
earths booming population it would be a shame to see the agency 
lose that support

the westerly ri sun on doublehulled tankers 
conoco inc a houstonbased oil company in one bold stroke is 
proving the truth of two old adages we can learn from our 
mistakes and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure 
conoco is ordering two new oil tankers but unlike the 
singlehulled exxon valdez which after running aground dumped 11 
million gallons of petroleum into alaskan waters last year these 
new ships will have double hulls 
the folks at conoco are well aware that this type of 
construction will increase the cost of their new seagoing 
acquisitions by as much as 15 percent somewhere into the 70 
million to 90 million range 
but they are also aware that a coast guard study has found that 
if the exxon valdez had been of doublehull construction its 
petroleum loss after running aground would have been reduced by as 
much as 60 percent 
truly conoco has learned from exxons experience and with what 
has been learned is making a powerful statement that at sea and on 
land it is better to prevent oil spills than clean up after them

albuquerque nm journal on cutting us troop strength 
with the pain and consternation at the pentagon in the aftermath 
of the outbreak of peace it is difficult to distinguish trial 
balloons from real plans among the resulting announcements and 
leaks 
nonetheless the disclosure that the army proposes to cut troop 
strength by 25 percent by 1997 is a reasonable strategy if world 
events stay on their trend toward peace 
the department of defense should not be so quick however to 
reduce strength in the reserves and national guard 
the proposal is to reduce active duty personnel from 764000 to 
580000 and reserve and national guard forces from 776000 to 
645000 
with a downsized regular army the strategic importance of a 
reserve of trained and organized manpower takes on greater 
importance

grand forks nd herald on the legacy of the vietnam war 
the vietnam war put a tarnish on our national nobility 
american policymakers couldnt convince americans that the war was 
right and the rest of the world was equally doubtful the 
foundation of american moral leadership was cracked and it hasnt 
been completely repaired 
then there were the thousands who first found political power 
through opposition to the war the civil rights movement had shown 
the way and the free speech movement had trained new cadres 
but it was the war that energized so many young people that 
brought them into the streets and later into the political process 
this politicization would have happened in any case but the war 
made it happen in a particular way and that way has had a profound 
influence on how todays world works 
the years of that war the longest war in american history 
were years that molded the nation we dont know yet just how 
the war is a part of the nations unfinished business the 
divisiveness the bitterness the doubt the grief these all 
remain it is understanding and acceptance that still elude us 
perhaps the longing for them in the nations soul is as great 
as the grief in the nations heart and the doubt in the nations 
mind

philadelphia daily news on lithuania 
it would be quite a picture the seminole nation in full 
tribal regalia pleads with mikhail gorbachev to pressure 
president bush for the return of their half of florida which the 
white man stole 
the photo op would be spectacular but gorbachev would never buy 
it nor would he intervene if the people of california tried to 
secede from the united states 
fortunately for all of us president bush has taken the same 
and proper position regarding independence movements within the 
soviet union 
quietly and firmly bush makes it clear that the use of military 
force to squelch the independence movements in places like 
lithuania estonia or latvia would not sit well with americans 
but he refuses to repeat the mistakes of 1956 which saw the 
eisenhower administration seemingly supporting the hungarian 
revolution only to find itself helpless when the soviet tanks 
rolled into hungary to crush the revolution some feel even today 
that the anticipation of american intervention helped inspire that 
uprising and the brutal soviet overreaction 
but 1990 is not 1956 gorbachev has demonstrated in word and 
deed that he wants to encourage peaceful and democratic change 
throughout the soviet spheres of influence 
as they prepare for the arms control summit next month bush and 
gorbachev know it would be insanity to abolish one form of mass 
destruction while inviting another form of carnage their cautious 
yet consistent approach to the promotion of peaceful change is 
encouraging and deserves the support of everyone who wants the 
process to continue

solidarity chairman lech walesa injected more excitement into 
eastern european politics when he bluntly confirmed his 
interest in becoming president of poland in remarks attributed to 
him by the official polish news agency pap about 24 hours later 
however walesa executed a remarkable aboutface although he 
didnt quite describe it that way 
today on radio and tv i hear that lech walesa agreed to be 
president i didnt say so at all walesa insisted 
walesa has picked up a decidedly american political trait not 
allowing himself to be pinned down about future plans 
walesa claimed that he had been cajoled into making a 
statement about his presidential ambitions and was misunderstood 
i simply did not guard my tongue enough somewhere he said 
obviously walesa has developed another skill that american 
politicians long have been famous for how to make excuses

lawrence kan journalworld on president bush broccoli and 
earth day 
its an interesting commentary on american priorities that a 
recent survey showed president bushs distaste for broccoli drew 
six times more public attention than earth day 
in the survey conducted by the times mirror center for the 
people and the press 76 percent of the respondents correctly 
identified the vegetable president bush had refused to eat by 
contrast only 13 percent knew that april 22 is being observed as 
earth day to honor the environment 
the broccoli story was humorous enough the president putting 
his foot down like an unhappy schoolboy and barbara bush promising 
to eat his share of the broccoli for him but in significance the 
bush and the broccoli stalk story pales in comparison to an event 
such as earth day which focuses on one of the worlds greatest 
challenges preserving the environment 
perhaps the poll doesnt say anything about american priorities 
perhaps the broccoli story just tickled peoples funnybones but 
its too bad that the nations media and the people it serves cant 
pay as much attention to the cutting of millions of trees in the 
worlds rain forest as it does to the cutting of a stalk of 
broccoli for the president

the daily tribune wisconsin rapids wis on returning the 
census forms 
the census forms were mailed in march and were supposed to be 
sent back by april 1 which was proclaimed census day 
well two weeks later the census bureau is saying that many 
people havent sent in their completed forms 
nationwide the response rate is a dismal 57 percent census 
officials are mobilizing their troops to go door to door to those 
households that havent responded 
let them come you say 
well consider this the census bureau had hoped to get back 70 
percent of the forms without begging in person to send out census 
workers door to door will cost an extra 10 million for each 
percentage point below that 70 percent budgeted goal 
thats a lot of money and who is going to pay for it taxpayers 
were already going to pay a budgeted 25 billion for this head 
count which occurs every 10 years 
theres no reason to add to the bill by being too lazy to fill 
out the form and send it in 
this census is very important it will determine how much money 
is distributed to states and local governments and it will 
determine how many representatives we have in congress 
its nothing to ignore if you want as much money as your 
municipality is entitled to send in your form youll be saving 
uncle sam the trouble and expense of having to come looking for you

the newsleader springfield mo on us supreme courts 
refusal to hear a case involving a school board ban on dancing in 
purdy mo 
tradition lives in purdy where dancing is a sin to a majority 
now the tiny community of 928 residents and its school board are 
free to continue a centurylong tradition of banning social dances 
despite the hopes of a minority that school dances be permitted 
the decision does nothing to explain the supreme courts 
rationale by simply refusing to hear the case the court let stand 
a 54 ruling by the us court of appeals in st louis late last 
year 
the lower court opinion rejected the argument that a ban on 
dancing amounted to an endorsement of the fundamentalist views of 
the majority in purdy 
using the rationale of the appeals court and by its refusal to 
grant a full hearing the courts have delivered a powerful message 
that leaves the majority to impose its beliefs however sincere 
they may be on the minority the minority of purdy students and 
their parents asked for nothing of the school board that would 
infringe on the rights of any students but the board and now the 
courts did exactly that

the bride shivered in the wind a tuxedoed 
accordionist played hail to the chief and a makebelieve george 
bush arrived 20 minutes late to officiate wednesday morning at a 
gag wedding outside the jefferson memorial 
the fake ceremony was staged by gary butler and his bride 
marilou brown who were married for real tuesday night by a 
suburban fairfax county va magistrate as a practical joke on 
about 50 of their friends 
the wedding guests gasped and then giggled as john simmons 
a bush lookalike from washingtons gross national product comedy 
troupe stepped from a white stretch limousine surrounded by phony 
secret service agents in dark glasses waved to the crowd and took 
his place behind a flowerbedecked altar on the lawn 
over the roar of airplanes helicopters and rushhour traffic 
the bush mimic announced he was playing minister to the couple as 
captain of the ship of democracy 
he called the newlyweds two points of light in this kinder and 
gentile nation of ours and led them in the pledge of allegiance 
as butler recited his vows the bogus bush advised the bride to 
read his lips he wished them mutual fidelity in a perfectly 
monotonous relationship 
its the second marriage for butler 41 and the third for ms 
brown 42 both are bankers and republicans whove been friends 
and drinking buddies since they met seven years ago butler said 
they decided to try something different something novel this 
time around for their friends amusement 
butler is an ardent admirer of thomas jefferson the former 
president he and his new wife courted during evening strolls 
around the floodlit jefferson memorial its very romantic he 
said 
they decided to be married there but the red tape of two 
virginia residents getting a wedding license in the district of 
columbia proved too much so they were married privately in 
virginia and invited friends to a public wedding the next 
morning at their favorite trysting place 
we couldnt get tom jefferson to marry us so we got the next 
best thing george bush said the bride 
after wednesdays reception the browns flew to a ski resort 
near salt lake city to spend their honeymoon at a threeday 
bankers conference

oneday delay because his attorney was ill fama and the alleged 
ringleader keith mondello are being tried together but separate 
juries are hearing the cases

crimes if convicted they face 25 years to life in prison opening

black crossed paths with a mob of mostly whites in brooklyns 
bensonhurst section the four blacks had gone to look at a used car 
on tuesday prosecutors showed jurors a videotape in which 
mondello admitted to being part of the gang but asserted that 
racism played no role in the attack 
no matter what color they were if someone was coming to beat 
my friends up we would do anything to protect ourselves mondello 
said in a television interview taped five days after the aug 23 
killing

believed were coming to look for trouble in their neighborhood 
i was told that 25 blacks were coming to beat me and my 
friends up he said the only reason baseball bats were on the 
scene was because we wanted to protect ourselves and we didnt 
know if they were going to be armed 
in the interview mondello denied knowing that one of the whites 
was carrying a gun

mondello was a liar who had changed his account of the attack 
after his arrest mondello told investigators that before the 
attack a man identified only as frank put an object in his car 
that mondello soon learned was a gun

the bush administration today again warned the 
soviet union that its actions in lithuania could disrupt relations 
between the superpowers and hurt the restructuring of the soviet 
economy 
secretary of state james a baker iii testifying before the 
house ways and means committee said us support for perestroika 
was at risk 
after listing benefits he said the united states gets from 
smoother ties with moscow baker cautioned the kremlin 
our bilateral commercial contacts with the ussr may be 
more directly in their interest than in ours and those contacts 
are being put to risk by soviet actions in lithuania 
the administration is providing no direct aid for the economic 
reconstruction efforts of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and baker stressed we must avoid the siren song calling for 
direct aid to moscow 
the superpowers are negotiating a new trade agreement that could 
open american markets more widely to soviet exports by reducing 
us trade barriers 
baker did not specify which commercial ties could be harmed if 
the soviets suppress the independence movement in the baltic 
republic but senate republican leader bob dole of kansas and 
others in congress who have taken a hard line toward moscow are 
suggesting a suspension of the trade talks 
the administrations cautious approach drew support from rep 
thomas downey dny one of the most liberal members of congress 
he said others would love an excuse to jumpstart the cold war 
but the new yorker told baker the measured response you have 
given to date is going to prove to be the correct one in the long 
sweep of history 
the soviets evidently have not followed through on an 
announcement that natural gas and other supplies to lithuania would 
be reduced lithuanias energy minister said today that oil 
supplies were normal and that he had not been told of any planned 
reductions 
likewise white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
there was no sign of a cutoff 
essentially its a matter of watching and waiting to see what 
happens he said 
fitzwater added weve been going through this process now for 
a month or two theres all kinds of maneuvering going on back and 
forth between the soviet union and lithuania therefore we dont 
try to spend a whole lot of time reading the tea leaves about what 
might happen or they think is going to happen or so forth 
on friday gorbachev threatened to impose an embargo of critical 
supplies unless lithuania rescinded within 48 hours several laws 
meant to bolster its march 11 declaration of independence 
lithuanian leaders have made no move to meet gorbachevs demands 
but say they are willing to negotiate gorbachev refuses to meet 
with them until they rescind their declaration of independence 
baker called on moscow again to engage in a dialogue and not 
merely talk about having a dialogue with lithuanian leaders he 
said dialogue not economic boycotts or threats to invoke 
presidential rule would be the solution to the problem 
despite the warning baker said good relations with moscow serve 
us interests in several ways including arms control agreements 
and working together on regional conflicts around the world 
its in our interest to lock in major reductions in soviet 
strategic forces and to create a more stable predictable and 
secure relationship that reduces the risk of nuclear war he said 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill said how the 
soviets handle the situation in lithuania will have a strong 
bearing on us economic policy toward moscow 
president bush said tuesday that he would take appropriate 
responses if moscow followed through on the threatened reduction 
of fuel supplies and yet bush showed a reluctance to move against 
the kremlin 
i want to be sure anything we do is productive he said 
theres been dramatic change in the world and i dont want to 
inadvertently take some action that would set it back 
the president gave no indication what options he might be 
considering other us officials told the associated press the 
us policy simply is to watch and wait and see what the soviets 
might do in lithuania 
these officials speaking on condition of anonymity questioned 
that moscow would cut gas supplies since the pipeline to lithuania 
goes on from there to kaliningrad a soviet city 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine met tuesday 
with bush at the white house and said afterward i think its a 
very serious matter a very serious delicate situation

had josef stalins hand shaken a little 
this town might have been in lithuania 
but the postwar boundary between poland and the soviet republic 
was drawn just to the east of punsk and thousands of ethnic 
lithuanians are today polish citizens 
now this lithuanianspeaking national minority by far the 
majority in punsk and the surrounding rolling farmland is on the 
outside looking in as the independenceseeking republic faces down 
moscow 
they are worried scared full of hope there is a lot of 
concern here because of their families they are praying a lot for 
them said the rev ignacy dziermiejko the bilingual parish 
priest who wears a little lithuanian flag pinned to his cassock 
residents of punsk put up lithuanian and polish flags after 
watching the march 11 television broadcast when lithuanias 
parliament declared independence from moscow 
tensions heightened april 3 when the soviets without warning 
shut the nearby border crossing between poland and lithuania the 
republics only road into another country 
for the lithuanians in poland the border closing meant no more 
visits with relatives on the other side and an abrupt halt to 
contacts eased less than three years ago when the border was opened 
for four decades the communist regimes in moscow and warsaw 
officially ignored the existence of the many ethnic minorities east 
and west of the border at times they repressed the minorities 
efforts to maintain their own cultural linguistic and religious 
traditions 
there are 260000 ethnic poles living in lithuania part of 
which was polish territory before world war ii 
about 5000 ethnic lithuanians make up 80 percent of the 
population of punsk named for the lithuanian word for a place for 
hay another 5000 live in the province and there are an estimated 
10000 more ethnic lithuanians spread across poland 
on a recent spring day the bells at the 109yearold roman 
catholic church in punsk rang out in support of lithuania as 
residents drafted a letter to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and spread word of a planned weekend demonstration 
masses are still said in lithuanian at the church in punsk and 
polands only lithuanian grammar school is here the baltic 
lithuanian language completely unrelated to slavic polish is 
taught at the local high school 
poles and lithuanians say they generally mix peacefully in this 
tranquil rural region they are less and less willing to be 
manipulated as they once were by governments exploiting ethnic 
differences for political ends 
poles here express a healthy respect for the way the lithuanians 
stick together to protect their interests 
and the lithuanians appreciate the relatively better life in 
poland despite the countrys considerable economic problems for 
lithuanians crossing the border said one poland is the west 
both groups watch the events unfolding in lithuania warily 
to some in poland which last year became the first east bloc 
country to have a noncommunist government the tense confrontation 
brings into question the soviet governments resolve toward 
introducing democratic reforms 
nothing has changed it took three minutes to close the border 
one phone call from moscow said maciej surel a polish 
businessman in the nearby heavily lithuanian town of sejny 
an exhibit of paintings by andrzej strumillo a wellknown 
polish artist of lithuanian heritage was turned back at the border 
crossing april 4 the paintings were en route to the lithuanian 
city of kaunas for a longplanned cultural exchange 
it should be a warning to the united states that the soviets 
can break a bilateral agreement said strumillo who paints at a 
renovated farmhouse in sejny 
strumillos name shares a typically lithuanian ending with that 
of the legendary lithuanian ruler jagiello 
jagiellos 1386 marriage to a polish princess led to a gradual 
merger between poland and lithuania but in 1795 when poland was 
partitioned lithuania came under the control of czarist russia 
poland and lithuania both returned as independent states after 
world war i in 1920 poland took the heavily polish city of 
vilnius by force to earn the lasting bitterness of lithuanian 
patriots 
under the hitlerstalin pact the red army swept through 
lithuania and eastern poland after the nazis invaded poland in 1939 
the postworld war ii border placed much of eastern poland 
inside the soviet union and left lithuania a soviet republic 
under gorbachev the soviets have officially disavowed the 
hitlerstalin pact but its effects remain 
some have questioned the lithuanian drive for independence as a 
too hasty challenge that could threaten the wider reforms advocated 
by gorbachev 
but the lithuanians of punsk are with their whole hearts 
behind independence said the village leader romas vitkauskas 
the soviet system has passed its time and it cant work 
anymore change cant come from one person gorbachev but other 
places and people must be involved he added

the bush administration on wednesday stressed 
its support for one man one vote rule in south africa after 
new assertions by president f w de klerk that his government 
would not agree to majority rule 
we support the achievement of a nonracial democratic society 
based on universal sufferage sufferage meaning a vote for all 
in a united south africa said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
de klerk said in a speech in cape town on tuesday that his 
government would not agree to majority rule although was prepared 
to work out a formula for whites to share power with blacks 
south africas population includes 28 million blacks and 5 
million whites blacks do not hold any seats in parliament or on 
major government policymaking bodies 
our effort is to support the one man one vote rule 
fitzwater said 
fitzwater noted negotiations begin next month between de klerks 
whiteminority government and the antiapartheid african national 
congress on forming a new governmental system 
whats most important is that the process of negotiations 
begin as soon as possible and lead to the creation of a nonracial 
democracy based on universal sufferage for adult south africans and 
guaranteeing equal political economic and social rights 
fitzwater said 
they should have the vote they should all have the vote 
fitzwater said our interest is in getting the democracy and the 
vote and allowing them to determine their own government

african president in the same speech had accepted the principles 
of universal franchise in which the vote of every adult citizen 
would have equal value 
in a speech to parliament de klerk said his government will 
propose powersharing for blacks and whites however he said other 
steps would be taken to ensure that white domination will not be 
replaced with black domination

national congress leader to washington for separate meetings

a bill introduced in congress wednesday calls 
for the government to spend 350 million over three years to 
develop a magnetic levitation system that would whisk passengers 
between major us cities at 300 mph 
the system planned as a us improvement on maglev 
transportation concepts being developed in germany and japan could 
eventually compete with railroads and airlines by running on 
elevated tracks alongside interstate highways said rep robert j 
mrazek dny 
he said maglev represents a kind of bold approach to 
national transportation needs that was missing from the national 
transportation policy laid out by transportation secretary samuel 
skinner earlier this year 
skinner proposed 61 million to study the electrically powered 
system which uses magnets to float cars several inches above the 
track bed 
mrazek said that wouldnt be enough to compete with systems 
being developed abroad based on us technology 
he said a us system would help provide work for defense 
contractors who will be affected by expected restraint in defense 
spending 
if we dont jump start it now then it will be too late 
mrazek told a news conference if the government doesnt step in 
and help he said communities will turn to foreign manufacturers 
for what will be a major new mode of transportation 
mrazek said the japanese and germany governments have invested 
1 billion each in development of their systems

states may outlaw all possession and viewing 
of child pornography even in ones own home the supreme court 
ruled today 
by a 63 vote the court upheld an ohio law that makes it a 
crime to possess socalled kiddie porn the decision extends a 1982 
ruling in which the justices said production and distribution of 
sexual depictions of children can be outlawed 
the justices had been told the ohio law is the toughest kiddie 
porn legislation in the nation 
nonetheless the court on narrower grounds struck down the 
conviction of clyde osborne of columbus 
the justices said the jury was not instructed properly they 
ordered a new trial for osborne who had been sentenced to six 
months in prison and fined 100 for possessing nude photos of a boy 
believed to be 13 or 14 
the case pitted the sanctity of the home against the safety and 
welfare of children 
justice byron r white writing for the court said ohio 
legitimately seeks to destroy a market for the exploitative use 
of children by making possession of child pornography a crime 
given the importance of the states interest in protecting the 
victims of child pornography we cannot fault ohio for attempting 
to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain 
he said 
white also said ohios law is not too broad because it 
specifically forbids possession of lewd material or material that 
focuses on genitals 
a prosecution could not be based on possession of innocuous 
photos of ones children wearing no clothes he said 
white was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices harry a blackmun sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and 
anthony m kennedy 
in a dissenting opinion justice william j brennan said the 
court is sacrificing privacy rights in its zeal to crack down on 
child pornography 
at bottom the court today is so disquieted by the possible 
exploitation of children in the production of the pornography that 
it is willing to tolerate the imposition of criminal penalties for 
simple possession he said 
mr osbornes pictures may be distasteful but the 
constitution guarantees both his right to possess them privately 
and his right to avoid punishment under an overbroad law 
joining brennans opinion were justices thurgood marshall and 
john paul stevens 
the court for over 30 years has allowed states to outlaw the 
sale and distribution of obscenity ruling in a series of cases 
that obscene material is not constitutionally protected 
but the court in 1969 barred states from outlawing the mere 
athome possession of obscene materials 
the court in 1982 carved out its newest exception to freespeech 
rights it let states outlaw material depicting children in sexual 
performances or poses even if not obscene 
today the court said the athome possession of kiddie porn is 
not entitled to the same protection given to athome possession of 
obscenity depicting adults 
osborne was 61 when he was prosecuted in 1985 for possessing the 
nude photos of a youngster prosecutors said osborne got the 
pictures from a florida mailorder business and had placed them in 
a photo album in his home 
the photos were discovered after police searched osbornes home 
on a tip that he had bought the material 
ohios law bans possession or viewing of any material or 
performance that shows a minor in a state of nudity 
exemptions were included for parents and among other things for 
photos with an artistic medical or scientific purpose 
in upholding osbornes conviction the ohio supreme court 
narrowed the laws ban to possession of lewd depictions of 
children under 18 
when osbornes case was argued before the high court last 
december columbus city attorney ronald j obrien urged the court 
to let authorities attack kiddie porn by making possession a crime 
child pornography has been driven underground by the courts 
1982 ruling obrien said then because its underground the 
additional tool of having a possession offense is necessary 
obrien and osbornes lawyer public defender s adele shank 
disagreed in december over how many other states have similar laws 
obrien told the justices that 18 other states have similar 
kiddie porn laws they are alabama arizona colorado florida 
georgia idaho illinois kansas minnesota missouri nebraska 
nevada oklahoma south dakota texas utah washington and west 
virginia 
but ms shank calling ohios law the broadest in the country 
said not one of those other states outlaws the viewing of child 
pornography 
the case is osborne vs ohio 885986

inmates in sofias central prison on 
wednesday rejected an accord reached with the government and 
opposition officials and continued a rooftop protest for a second 
day

issued a list of demands which included revising sentences deemed 
unjust shortening pretrial investigations and improving prison 
conditions 
it was not immediately clear how the protest began 
about 30 inmates initially climbed onto the prison roof to 
underscore their grievances some threatened to commit suicide if 
their demands were not met 
every third day one of us will jump from the roof one 
prisoner shouted tuesday the opposition daily demokratisya

greenpeace activists today bolted a 
steel box containing a member of the environmental group to 
railroad tracks leading to a du pont co facility to protest 
production of ozonedepleting chemicals 
railroad workers removed the box about three hours later after 
digging and using a crane to lift the box off the tracks said a 
greenpeace spokeswoman she said the man in the box was arrested by 
the san patricio county sheriffs department 
greenpeace staged similar protests today at railroad lines 
leading to du pont plants in antioch calif and deepwater nj 
she said 
the point is that du pont is continuing to manufacture 
ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbons despite the fact that 
scientific evidence from nasa the epa and the british antarctic 
survey show we need to have a phaseout of these toxic chemicals 
said julie brenegar of greenpeace 
a 23yearold greenpeace official from austin entered the 4 by 
5foot steel box which was bolted to the tracks about onequarter 
mile from the plant at 705 am ms brenegar said 
the du pont plant manager mack mccluskey said he was surprised 
by the protest considering the companys efforts to phase out cfcs 
by the year 2000 and its plans to make alternative freon 
products 
greenpeace says the ingleside plant manufactures 
chlorofluorocarbons that are used as industrial solvents chlorine 
molecules of these compounds have been associated with depletion of 
the earths ozone layer which protects life on the surface from 
the ultraviolet radiation of the sun

major universities are warning the pentagon 
that a military policy barring homosexuals from service is 
generating pressure to oust rotc from campuses 
the contradiction between the universitys principle of 
nondiscrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual 
orientation and the presence of an rotc that does discriminate 
cannot exist on the campuses indefinitely john m deutch 
provost of the massachusetts institute of technology said in a 
letter to defense secretary dick cheney 
many universities will withdraw from the rotc program 
deutch wrote 
the department of defense has declined to comment on the campus 
pressure 
maj doug hart said that because the policy is being challenged 
in court the department has limited responses to a written 
statement outlining the reasons for barring homosexuals 
the military contends that homosexuality is incompatible with 
military service because of the close quarters in which people of 
the same sex must live and because of the security risk posed by 
the possibility of a homosexual officer being blackmailed 
top administrators faculty groups and students from mit the 
university of wisconsin university of minnesota northwestern 
university and others have actively campaigned against the reserve 
officer training corps policy 
no rotc program has been removed from a campus as a result of 
the opposition 
the rotc in the past year has denied several gay cadets their 
officers commission and sought repayment of thousands of dollars 
in scholarship money 
until recently gay men and lesbians have been on their own in 
fighting the pentagon policy 
one such student robert bettiker was one semester from 
graduation at mit when he old his superior that he was gay 
bettiker was denied his commission and asked to repay 38612 in 
scholarship money 
the growing concern among university officials confronts the 
department of defense for the first time with institutional 
opposition to the policy 
in many instances the opposition stems from explicit 
antidiscriminatory provisions in university charters wisconsin 
has a state law barring discrimination against homosexuals 
the university of wisconsin faculty senate voted in december to 
expel rotc from campus because of its policy on homosexuals the 
university regents refused to accept that proposal but told 
president kenneth shaw to lobby the state congressional delegation 
which includes house armed services committee chairman les aspin a 
democrat 
we want to see the law changed shaw said in a telephone 
interview were not interested in getting out of rotc 
shaw said that aspin was supportive but not optimistic that 
congress could pass a law overriding the pentagon policy 
at northwestern university in evanston ill an ad hoc student 
group called for the removal of the campus rotc program and the 
student government organization voted to ban the program from using 
university facilities and funds neither recommendation was 
accepted by the administration 
a faculty group at the university of minnesota urged 
administrators to lobby washington lawmakers to change the policy 
we really shouldnt be standing for discrimination at any 
level said dick caldecott the universitys liaison for federal 
relations 
at washington university in st louis where gay rotc cadet 
james holobaugh is being asked to repay his scholarship a student 
referendum to remove rotc was defeated however the provost has 
written rotc officials complaining about the policy 
the concern by mit is particularly significant because of the 
institutes longstanding relationship with the pentagon mit 
receives substantial research grants from the government for 
projects with military applications 
one unfortunate consequence of this policy is to increase 
hostility to the dod on university campuses deutch said in his 
letter to cheney 
the rotc includes 86000 students at 529 campus locations about 
21700 students receive rotc scholarships which pay for tuition 
books and fees hart said

ultraviolet light treatment that is widely used to 
clear up psoriasis can dramatically increase the risk of rare 
genital cancer in men a study has found 
those who get high doses of the treatment known as puva face 
300 times the usual risk of squamous cell cancer of the penis and 
scrotum 
the research suggests that men exposed to any source of 
ultraviolet light including tanning booths should protect their 
genitals from the rays 
puva short for psoralen and ultraviolet a has been used 
since the early 1970s to treat severe psoriasis patients take 
pills that are activated inside their bodies by exposure to intense 
ultraviolet a 
while the treatment is highly effective it increases the risk 
of skin cancer the latest study suggests that mens genitals are 
especially susceptible to this unwanted side effect 
the increased risk makes it prudent for men to use genital 
protection whenever they are exposed to puva or other forms of 
ultraviolet radiation for therapeutic recreational or cosmetic 
reasons the researchers wrote 
they noted that tens of thousands of americans receive puva or 
ultraviolet b therapy for treatment of skin disease and more than 
1 million get ultraviolet radiation from tanning devices 
the study directed by dr robert s stern of bostons beth 
israel hospital was published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine 
the doctors based their conclusions on a 12year follow up of 
892 men who received puva for psoriasis that typically covered 
onethird of their bodies fourteen of the men or just under 2 
percent developed genital cancers among those with high puva 
exposure 6 percent got this kind of cancer 
the men were five to 15 times more likely to develop cancers on 
their genitals than on other parts of their bodies 
because patients stand during therapy mens genitals are 
exposed to the light rays but womens are not only one cancer of 
the external genitals occurred among 488 women in the study 
dr john h epstein of the university of california san 
francisco said the results indicated that the male genitalia 
should be completely protected during puva and ultraviolet b 
therapy if they are not involved with psoriasis and they should 
receive a reduced dose if they are

a study supports the widely held belief that poor 
patients are more expensive for hospitals to treat than are more 
affluent people 
although earlier research has come to conflicting conclusions on 
the point the medicare program already pays more to hospitals that 
take care of large numbers of poor people 
in a study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine doctors reviewed the cases of 16908 people admitted to 
five massachusetts hospitals in 1987 
poor patients remained hospitalized 3 percent to 30 percent 
longer than betteroff patients depending on the hospital and 
their bills were 1 percent to 18 percent higher 
the researchers said their work suggests that all hospitals 
not just those with large numbers should get extra payments for 
their poor patients 
the medicare program pays flat fees for specific illnesses but 
it does not give hospitals more money if patients are unusually 
sick and need longer stays 
the study was directed by dr arnold m epstein of brigham and 
womens hospital in boston the researchers did not attempt to 
learn why the poor needed to stay in the hospital longer

an experimental cancer drug that works after a 
single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine 
yet for a rare form of leukemia according to a study 
the drug called 2chlorodeoxyadenosine or 2cda has 
produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia 
patients treated and none has relapsed so far 
researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it 
may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell 
leukemia 
the drug also has been used successfully against chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia it like hairy cell leukemia is a cancer of 
the white blood cells which produce diseasefighting antibodies 
the latest study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine was directed by dr lawrence d piro of the scripps 
clinic and research foundation in la jolla calif scripps recently 
made an agreement with johnson amp johnsons ortho pharmaceuticals to 
produce and distribute the drug once its approved by the us food 
and drug administration 
in the published work doctors gave the drug to 12 patients as 
far back as four years ago in 11 the disease disappeared and they 
remain disease free 
in all the scripps doctors have treated 24 patients with almost 
complete success however they caution that longer follow up will 
be necessary before they can be sure they have actually cured the 
disease 
two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed 
in recent years they are interferon and deoxycoformycin a drug 
that is similar to 2cda however interferon is less effective 
and both of those treatments produce serious side effects 
by contrast the only unwanted effect of 2cda was a few days of 
fever patients experienced no nausea hair loss rashes or other 
symptoms typical of cancer therapy also unlike other treatments 
this one appears to work after a single sevenday course of therapy

kidnappers holding three american 
professors said today they would release one within 48 hours as a 
goodwill gesture and that the freed hostage would carry a message 
for president bush 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine also 
threatened to escalate its actions unless the release is 
followed by an unspecified reciprocal response by the united states 
the group demanded that us assistant secretary of state for 
near eastern affairs john kelly fly to the syrian capital 
damascus within the same period 
the arrangements for the release should be accomplished by the 
arrival of john kelly in damascus to coordinate some final steps to 
guarantee success within 48 hours the handwritten statement 
said kelly is a former us ambassador to lebanon 
in washington a white house official said weve seen the 
reports were not commenting on them 
of course we would welcome the release beyond that we dont 
think it would be useful to speculate on anything said the 
official who asked not to be identified 
the state department said it had no immediate comment and a 
spokesman refused to discuss kellys whereabouts when asked if he 
would travel to syria 
the kidnappers statement was delivered to the independent 
beirut newspaper annahar and a western news agency in beirut along 
with an instant picture of kidnapped educator jesse turner one of 
18 western hostages held in lebanon 
turner 42 was abducted along with professors alann steen 50 
and robert polhill 55 from the campus of the usaffiliated 
beirut university college by gunmen posing as riot police on jan 
24 1987 
the arabiclanguage statement did not say which of the three 
would be freed it came four days before steen marks his fourth 
birthday in captivity 
a fourth professor kidnapped with them indian mithileshwar 
singh was freed oct 3 1988 he held an american residence permit 
turners mother estelle ronnenburg of boise idaho told the 
associated press today that she had spoken with us government 
officials 
i do feel full of hope but i talked to the state department 
and they told me that they are checking things out and not to let 
myself get too worked up because we have had rumors like this 
before that have not worked out so we want to be sure its going to 
work out before we get too hopeful 
the kidnappers statement said the decision to release a us 
hostage came in response to behests from iran and syria adding 
we have decided to move the hostages affair forward by 
releasing an american hostage within 48 hours on the basis of 
reciprocal moves to accomplish what is required to accelerate the 
happy ending 
we want the humanitarian move to be balanced between both 
sides this is a condition to move forward otherwise there is no 
meaning for a onesided movement 
we have responded to the behests hoping to reach a solution 
as proposed and on the basis of the verbal message that will be 
conveyed to president bush we are ready to reciprocate or 
escalate the other side has to choose 
the statement appeared to indicate that an exchange was involved 
in the release and that the hostage would be carrying a message to 
president bush 
the group previously had offered to trade the three american 
hostages for 400 arab inmates held in israeli jails israel 
rejected the offer 
iranian newspapers associated with iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani have urged that the western hostages be released on 
humanitarian grounds more radical elements in iran have said 
holding the hostages was a means of confronting the west 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine was last heard 
from march 15 when it threatened to kill the three americans unless 
the united states met its unspecified demands it also threatened 
to attack airlines carrying israeli emigrants from the soviet union 
to israel 
that statement was accompanied by a photograph of steen 
the group is comprised of shiite moslem zealonts loyal to iran 
there are 18 westerners held hostage in lebanon including eight 
americans four britons two west germans two swiss an italian 
and an irishman most are held by proiranian groups 
the longestheld hostage is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
earlier today friends and relatives of kidnapped british 
journalist john mccarthy addressed messages to him and to his 
captors that pleaded for information on his whereabouts 
the messages in arabic and english were published by the 
leftist beirut assafir newspaper as a paid advertisement just a 
day after mccarthy started his fifth year as a hostage 
the advertisement could not have been published tuesday because 
beirut newspapers did not publish that day which fell during 
easter vacation

police arrested three white 
soldiers and are seeking an official of a white supremacist group 
in connection with the theft of weapons from an air force armory 
officials said wednesday 
piet rudolph deputy leader of the ultraright boerestaat boers 
state party is being sought for questioning in connection with 
the easter weekend robbery police spokesman col steve van rooyen 
said the weapons were taken from a safe at air force headquarters 
in pretoria 
rudolph a former member of the pretoria city council already 
faces a court appearance april 28 in connection with shots fired at 
a pretoria savings and loan association branch in december 
police commissioner johan van der merwe said three national 
servicemen white soldiers serving their twoyear mandatory 
military service have been held since the theft was discovered 
he said the weaponry including pumpaction shotguns assault 
rifles a light machinegun pistols and ammunition had not been 
recovered he would not say how many weapons were stolen or give 
other details 
police spokesman maj gen herman stadler described the theft as 
an apparent inside job several newspapers quoted police as 
saying the burglars gained access to the weapons safe with 
duplicate keys 
the boerestaat party believes whites are superior to blacks and 
should live in separate nations it also believes whites have a 
right to use violence to retain their dominance under the current 
south african constitution 
the party was banned in 1987 by former president pw botha when 
he outlawed 17 antiapartheid organizations 
president fw de klerk relegalized the group in february along 
with 59 other organizations most of them black 
he also lifted bothas banning order which had kept boerestaat 
party leader robert van tonder from political activities or 
speaking publicly 
far rightwing parties have called de klerk a traitor for 
legalizing the african national congress freeing nelson mandela 
from prison and promising to negotiate a new constitution ending 
white rule and apartheid 
in a speech for delivery late wednesday in krugersdorp van 
tonder said de klerks promise to submit a new constitution to a 
referendum was merely a way to democratically and 
constitutionally destroy rightwingers 
van tonder said the ultraright could never achieve a majority 
at the polls to defeat a new constitution he said rightwingers 
would have to find alternative means to get rid of the national 
party government 
de klerk is leading the republic of south africa toward a 
civil war and leaves the boere afrikaners and other rightwing 
people with no other option but to use violence to keep their 
land he said 
de klerk sharply criticized the rightwing in a speech to 
parliament on tuesday saying it was encouraging a psychosis of 
violence he also called on anc leaders to stop preaching the 
armed struggle 
senior anc officials are expected to arrive in south africa on 
april 28 to prepare for preliminary talks with the government may 
2 the talks are to pave the way for formal negotiations between 
blacks and whites on changing the constitution

date a judge has ordered her to appear at a may 1 hearing to 
decide whether she has completed community service for slapping a 
police officer 
deputy district attorney elden fox said tuesday that the 
director of a womens shelter where the actress has been working

to municipal court judge charles g rubin on friday

about 50 hours at the shelter and served the rest through guest 
appearances and in planning a celebrity auction at her belair

government officials wary of creating a 
national id card voiced concern wednesday about the idea of using 
social security cards as the sole document for immigrants and 
others to prove theyre legally eligible to work 
the general accounting office last month reported that the 
nations 4yearold immigration law had resulted in hiring 
discrimination by employers afraid of being punished for employing 
illegal aliens 
the agency said discrimination might be reduced by simplifying 
the process for checking work eligibility perhaps by relying on a 
revised social security card or a drivers license with a verified 
social security number 
legislation pushed by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
would require the government to develop plastic counterfeitproof 
social security cards to replace the current paper cards 
moynihan said the new cards could reduce fraud improve 
confidence in social security and provide a more reliable means for 
checking work eligibility but the senators said he would not push 
for legislative action until a government task force considers ways 
to reduce hiring discrimination under the immigration law 
louis enoff deputy commissioner for programs at the social 
security administration said that the agency does not need fancier 
cards to do its job and that there are less expensive ways to 
address employment discrimination 
the administration has always had fundamental concerns about 
the possibility of the social security card and number becoming a 
universal identifier in this country he told the finance 
subcommittee on social security and family policy 
andrew strojny of the justice department said that requiring job 
applicants to present social security cards could create problems 
for people who lose their cards and could allow unscrupulous 
employers to maintain a captive labor force by confiscating 
their workers social security cards 
simply because a singlecard system has the virtue of 
simplicity does not mean it is a simple solution strojny said 
gene mcnary commissioner of the immigration and naturalization 
service said the agency wants to avoid the creation of a national 
id card that raises the image of big brother yet needs to find 
a standard employment authorization document he said the ins 
was awaiting the task forces analysis

safety in the oiltanker industry appears to have 
taken a back seat to profits according to a coast guard report on 
the system used to regulate the huge ships 
the federal agency is faced with formidable problems trying 
to ensure that the ports are not exposed to a high degree of risk 
from tank vessel operations the report says 
problems detailed include increased vessel size aging ships 
reduced crew sizes and limited numbers of coast guard inspectors to 
enforce the rules 
the document criticizes the coast guard for paying too much 
attention to the shipowners desire to make money and too little 
attention to safety 
the coast guard cooperates with the owners and operators by 
allowing ships to be unprepared for inspections by using the old 
excuse that we are facilitating commerce the report says 
the report notes that the giant tanker ships have been built the 
past 20 years with 18 percent less steel than before and 
speculates that may be reason for hull cracks especially in the 
rough north pacific 
it says coast guard training programs for inspectors are 
inadequate and inspectors are overworked 
the report was dated october 1989 it was released after the 
seattle times filed an appeal under the freedom of information act 
the newspaper had asked the coast guard for the document but 
reported tuesday the coast guard refused the request on grounds it 
was an internal working document 
the report resulted from a study by five coast guard officers 
some of its 33 recommendations call for tougher disciplinary 
action against tanker owners and crew members and for further 
studies noting the industry hasnt been thoroughly reviewed for 
more than 10 years

discoverys second launch attempt 
with the hubble space telescope was moved up one day because 
preparations have gone so smoothly nasa said wednesday 
everyone believes were now ready to fly and all of us are 
looking forward to the data the hubble space telescope will produce 
as it begins its exploration of the universe said robert 
crippen shuttle director for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
the launch was now set for tuesday before the change discovery 
had been scheduled to lift off april 25 15 days after the first 
attempt was scrubbed because of a faulty auxiliary power unit the 
unit was replaced last weekend and fired up early wednesday for 
about five minutes 
after nasa verified the unit was operating properly launch team 
members and payload managers agreed to advance liftoff by a day 
safety continues to be our number 1 priority and that is why 
the apu on discovery was replaced crippen said in a statement 
each of the shuttles three auxiliary power units must work 
properly before a launch the units pressurize the orbiters 
hydraulic system which is used in the ships braking and steering 
systems 
discoverys payload bay doors will remain closed until hubbles 
batteries are placed back in the telescope late friday or early 
saturday the six nickelhydrogen batteries are undergoing 130 
hours of recharging at a laboratory 
the batteries will power the 15 billion telescope nasas most 
expensive and complex payload from the time it is disconnected 
from discoverys power system until its energycollecting solar 
panels take over 
the batteries are charging great said charles pellerin jr 
director of astrophysics for nasa weve been a long time getting 
this project to this point everythings behaving real well for us 
now 
hubbles 945inch mirror the finest ever made remains in 
perfect condition despite the twoweek delay pellerin said 
contamination sensors removed from the payload bay last weekend 
showed no evidence of additional dust or debris he said 
all the evidence is that were just as well as if we had 
gone on april 10 pellerin said 
excess contamination would mar hubbles ability to detect 
objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the 
best groundbased observatory the telescope is to orbit 380 miles 
above earth for 15 years 
discoverys new launch date is not expected to hamper launch 
preparations for the next shuttle mission 
columbia originally was scheduled to lift off may 9 with a 100 
million astronomical observatory known as astro that date has been 
pushed back at least a week however to give nasa time to check 
discovery following its fiveday mission in case something needs to 
be changed on columbia

president bush today challenged critics who 
deride him for emphasizing additional research over immediate steps 
against global warming stating that we have never considered 
research a substitute for action 
speaking at the close of an international conference on climate 
change bush acknowledged criticism of his researchoriented 
approach and his emphasis on the need to assess economic factors 
to those who suggest were only trying to balance economic 
growth and environmental protection i say they miss the point 
bush told delegates many of whom have criticized his goslow 
approach 
we are calling for an entirely new way of thinking to achieve 
both while compromising neither by applying the power of the 
marketplace in the service of the environment he said 
above all bush told the government representatives the 
climate change debate is not about research versus action for we 
have never considered research a substitute for action 
bush said the united states has offered four proposals a 
charter for cooperation in science and economics research on global 
change possible creation of an international institutes for 
research on the science and economics of global change an 
international system for exchanging data and a statement of 
principles for international cooperation in scientific and 
economics research on global change 
i call on you to support these suggestions bush told the 
foreign delegates gathered for the conference 
 
the twoday white house conference attended by senior 
government officials from 19 countries has been marked by discord 
over whether specific commitments should be made to reduce 
socalled greenhouse pollutants especially carbon dioxide 
despite the disagreements however senior administration 
officials and many of the delegates suggested the conference likely 
would go along with a us call for broader research into global 
warming and its economic impact 
the conference concludes later today 
president bush told the conference tuesday that more research is 
needed to sort out the science of the greenhouse effect he 
rejected suggestions that specific response strategies be developed 
immediately 
that brought prompt criticism from some of the european 
delegations 
gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide 
inaction declared klaus topfer the west german environmental 
minister later he tempered his criticism of the us position 
saying the call for additional research is not altogether bad 
the west germans today were to outline details of their proposed 
25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions 
the united states has argued it is too early to make a 
commitment on specific pollution reductions instead it has sought 
to focus the conference on gaining international support for more 
research on the scientific questions on global warming and the 
economic costs 
attending the conference were senior environmental ministers 
from the 19 countries as well as cabinetlevel officials on 
economics scientific and energy issues 
allan bromley bushs science adviser and a conference 
cochairman told reporters he hoped the delegates would commit to 
a broadened international research effort and begin to routinely 
consider economic issues in the global warming debate 
president bush does not feel in any sense the research should 
be a substitute for action bromley said 
some european countries have advocated for months that 
industrial nations commit themselves to stabilizing carbon dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000 many environmentalists say emissions 
should be cut by 20 percent 
such pollution cuts would require increased energy conservation 
development of more fuelefficient automobiles and more energy 
efficiency in homes and businesses 
talk about further research and economic considerations should 
not distract us from taking action on carbon dioxide 
stabilization now hans alders the dutch environmental minister 
told the conference during a closed working session tuesday 
we needed love canal before hazardous waste was tackled we 
needed a dying river rhine before waste water was treated my 
country has decided to learn the lessons from the past and act on 
global warming now alders told the delegates according to a 
transcript provided by the dutch delegation 
delegates from france italy and environmental officials from 
the european community also warned against substituting research 
for action 
we didnt come here to argue with the united states or anybody 
else said padraig flynn the irish environmental minister and a 
member of the delegation from the european community 
but while supporting the call for more research flynn added 
research must not be used to put off the problems that must be 
addressed today 
in welcoming the delegates tuesday bush acknowledged the 
disagreements saying i know theres a debate raging out there 
scientists agree that manmade pollution especially the release 
of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is causing heat to be 
trapped and will result in a warming of the globe but the severity 
of the warming and how specific regions of the earth will be 
affected is not as clear 
some computer models have suggested the global temperatures 
could increase by as much as four to nine degrees fahrenheit by the 
middle of the next century causing coastal flooding and a shift of 
weather and agriculture patterns other scientists say the impact 
is uncertain because of a variety of factors such as the uncertain 
effect of clouds

the soviet union has told east german prime 
minister lothar de maiziere that it opposes his plan for quick 
unification with west germany german media said wednesday 
de maiziere received a letter wednesday outlining the soviet 
unions informal positions on unification the west german zdf 
television network said 
the letter said the soviet union opposes quick unification 
because it would allow east germany to be quickly integrated into 
the nato military alliance zdf said 
the soviet union opposes nato membership for a reunified 
germany east germany is now a part of the sovietled warsaw pact 
and west germany is a member of the western alliance 
de maizieres new government chosen by the countrys first 
freely elected parliament last week supports a form of unification 
that would allow east germany to merge with its western neighbor 
accepting the west german constitution as it is 
another form of unification would require dissolution of the 
basic laws of both germanys and drafting of a new constitution 
that would take considerably longer 
the strategic future of a unified germany will be the main 
negotiating point when the soviet union the united states britain 
and france take part in unification talks expected in the coming 
weeks 
the two germanys are to negotiate separately on the domestic 
aspects of unification and the logistics of merging a decaying 
economy with wealthy west germany 
the east german government wednesday released its first detailed 
economic figures they described a grim economic landscape of 
declining production 
industrial output fell by 5 percent during the first quarter of 
this year compared to the same period in 1989 said the 
governments chief statistician arno donda 
donda said supply bottlenecks and production cuts aimed at 
curbing pollution were partly to blame 
but he said the main reason was the drop in manpower the number 
of people employed in industry was down 124000 from a year ago 
while there were 33000 fewer workers in construction donda said 
more than 500000 east germans many of them skilled workers 
have migrated to west germany since january 1989 
as of the end of march more than 38000 workers had registered 
for unemployment he said there were nearly 106000 job vacancies 
35000 fewer than in february 
the figure is the first specific jobless statistic released by 
the government unemployment was not acknowledged under the ousted 
communist regime 
experts predict that reunification will trigger widespread 
unemployment as the former communist countrys outmoded factories 
are closed and its inefficient enterprises are forced to compete in 
a free market 
with the opening of the east german borders in november many 
east germans have begun buying west german products 
east germanys new government has proposed that some of the 
countrys vast social service network be kept intact to ease the 
economic blow 
regine hildebrandt the labor and social affairs minister in de 
maizieres government called wednesday for job guarantees and a 
program to retrain workers so they can have more marketable skills 
in a unified germany 
last week the east berlinbased institute for international 
politics and economics predicted that even with a 5 percent annual 
growth rate 15 million east german workers could be jobless by 
1995

states may make it a crime to possess or look 
at child pornography even in ones home the supreme court said 
wednesday as it imposed new limits on freedom of expression and 
privacy 
voting 63 the justices upheld an ohio law aimed at stamping 
out such material by punishing those who buy it not only those who 
sell it 
conservatives cheered the decision saying it gives states a 
blueprint for tough legislation 
beverly lahaye of concerned women for america said every state 
should take advantage of this decision and immediately begin to 
crack down on this depraved and contemptible exploitation of 
children 
but justice william j brennan in an opinion dissenting from 
the court ruling said the law is so vague and so sweeping that it 
might ban the engravings of nude children that adorn our 
courtroom 
in a separate issue involving children several justices voiced 
concern wednesday that societys desire to protect children could 
deny fair trials to people charged with child abuse 
justice antonin scalia led the questioning as the court heard 
arguments in cases from maryland and idaho on whether defendants in 
childabuse cases are entitled to at least one facetoface 
confrontation with their young accusers 
the maryland case involved accusations against a female day care 
center owner by a 7yearold 
state attorney general j joseph curran jr said the child was 
allowed to testify over closedcircuit television because a social 
worker had said she would be too upset to testify in court 
scalia said a court appearance might well be something of an 
emotional trauma but this woman is going to jail for 15 years 
as for child pornography 18 states besides ohio already have 
laws against possessing such material ohios law has been 
described as the nations toughest 
a more liberal high court invoked freespeech and privacy rights 
in 1969 when it barred states from outlawing athome possession of 
obscene materials 
but the court said wednesday such protection applies only to 
obscenity depicting adults athome possession of sexually explicit 
material depicting children is not protected even if the material 
is not obscene the court said 
the justices in 1982 carved out a major exception to freespeech 
rights when they let states outlaw the sale and distribution of 
material depicting children in sexual performances or poses even 
if not obscene 
the court for over 30 years has allowed states to outlaw the 
sale and distribution of obscene material ruling in a series of 
cases that such material is not constitutionally protected 
justice byron r white writing for the court wednesday said 
ohio legitimately seeks to destroy a market for the exploitative 
use of children by making possession of child pornography a crime 
given the importance of the states interest in protecting the 
victims of child pornography we cannot fault ohio for attempting 
to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain 
he said 
white agreed with prosecutors that the childpornography 
industry has gone underground and the best way to attack it is by 
drying up the market of potential buyers 
he also said ohios law is not too broad because in effect the 
ohio supreme court rewrote it to forbid only lewd depictions of 
children with a graphic focus on the genitals 
having innocuous photos of ones children wearing no clothes is 
not a crime white said 
in the case in question the court on narrow grounds struck down 
the conviction of clyde osborne of columbus who challenged the ohio 
law 
the justices said the jury was not instructed properly they 
ordered a new trial for osborne who had been sentenced to six 
months in prison and fined 100 for possessing nude photos of a boy 
believed to be 13 or 14 
but brennan said the court by upholding the ohio law is 
sacrificing individual rights in its zeal to crack down on child 
pornography 
at bottom the court today is so disquieted by the possible 
exploitation of children in the production of the pornography that 
it is willing to tolerate the imposition of criminal penalties for 
simple possession he said 
mr osbornes pictures may be distasteful but the 
constitution guarantees both his right to possess them privately 
and his right to avoid punishment under an overbroad law 
joining brennans opinion were justices thurgood marshall and 
john paul stevens 
white was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices harry a blackmun sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and 
anthony m kennedy 
osborne was 61 when he was prosecuted in 1985 prosecutors said 
he got the pictures from a florida mailorder business and had 
placed them in a photo album in his home 
the photos were discovered after police searched osbornes home 
on a tip that he had bought the material 
ohios law bans possession or viewing of any material or 
performance that shows a minor in a state of nudity 
exemptions were included for parents and among other things for 
photos with an artistic medical or scientific purpose

legislation to expand healthcare coverage to 
all children and teenagers living in poverty was announced 
wednesday by sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate finance 
committee 
bentsen dtexas is proposing to gradually expand medicaid 
health insurance coverage to an additional 25 million children and 
teens at a cost of 16 billion over the first five years 
beginning in 1991 
under his plan which will be considered by the senate finance 
committee after its introduction thursday children under age 19 
would be guaranteed medicaid coverage if their familys income is 
below the federal poverty line now 12675 for a family of four 
bentsen said his bill the medicaid child health act of 1990 
would give more children access to preventive care and other health 
care services 
were seeing an alarming increase in the incidence of 
childhood diseases that could have been prevented with such routine 
treatment as a timely basic set of immunizations bentsen said 
in 1983 fewer than 1600 cases of measles were reported but by 
1989 there were more than 17000 cases early indications for 1990 
are that the number continues to grow bentsen said 
bentsen said every 1 spent on immunizations saves 10 in health 
care costs later on while every 1 spent on prenatal care saves 
more than 3 in the first year of a childs life 
according to the department of health and human services the 
united states ranks 22nd in the world in infant mortality

federal judges may order local officials to 
raise property taxes to pay for the racial desegregation of public 
schools the supreme court said wednesday 
although ruling unanimously in a kansas city mo case that 
judges themselves generally may not impose such tax increases the 
court voted 54 in empowering judges to tell school officials to do 
so 
the justices said such orders even take precedence over state 
laws imposing limits on school property taxes 
civil rights forces praised the decision its a powerful 
reaffirmation that state laws may not impede the vindication of 
constitutional rights the rights of schoolchildren said paul 
holtzman of the washingtonbased lawyers committee for civil 
rights under law 
through the last three decades the court has given federal 
judges sweeping power to take whatever steps necessary to end 
public school segregation including forced busing of students 
teacher reassignments and even the partial merger of separate 
school districts 
but never had the court authorized judges to bring about higher 
taxes to pay for various desegregation plans 
i cant pretend we got the better of it said benna ruth 
solomon a lawyer for the national governors association the 
national league of cities and the national conference of state 
legislatures 
missouri attorney general william webster said the ruling 
poses new questions that now must be addressed but added we 
find encouragement in the fact that four justices joined in the 
opinion that the remedy imposed by the district court was 
excessive 
in other matters the court 
ruled by a 63 vote that states may outlaw possessing or 
looking at child pornography even in ones own home 
the justices upheld an ohio law said to be the nations most 
stringent aimed at stamping out socalled kiddie porn by punishing 
those who buy the material not only those who sell it 
ruled 72 that an overnight guest in a private home enjoys 
the same privacy protection as the homeowner against unreasonable 
police arrests and searches 
the decision struck down the murder conviction of a minnesota 
man because he was arrested in a home where he was staying by 
police who did not first obtain a court warrant 
heard arguments in cases from maryland and idaho over the right 
of people charged with child abuse to at least one facetoface 
confrontation with their young accusers decisions are expected by 
july 
in the school desegregation case the court said us district 
judge russell g clark abused his discretion when he imposed a tax 
hike for the kansas city school district 
local officials should at least have the opportunity to devise 
their own solutions to these problems justice byron r white 
wrote for the court 
but white said clark could have forced officials to raise taxes 
to pay for the desegregation plan magnet schools and 260 
million worth of renovations he ordered 
missouri law limits property taxes but white said clark could 
order kansas city school officials to ignore that law 
a local government with taxing authority may be ordered to 
levy taxes in excess of the limit set by state statute where there 
is reason based in the constitution for not observing the statutory 
limitation white said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices anthony m 
kennedy sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia dissented 
writing for the four kennedy said todays casual embrace of 
taxation imposed by the unelected lifetenured federal judiciary 
disregards fundamental precepts for the democratic control of 
public institutions 
saying there is no real distinction between a judge directly 
imposing a tax and commanding the school district to impose it 
kennedy said the ruling might be used to justify ordering higher 
taxes to pay for prisons hospitals or a civil rights lawsuit award 
against a city government 
before 1954 missouri law required schools to be racially 
segregated in the following 35 years the percentage of black 
students in kansas citys school district rose from 225 to about 
75 percent 
black parents sued in 1977 over the decline of what had become 
predominantly black schools alleging black students were being 
denied equal educational opportunities 
clark ruled in 1987 that the school districts physical 
facilities have literally rotted and ordered state and district 
officials to upgrade them 
the state was ordered to pay threefourths of the remedial 
costs the school district onefourth 
school district voters had rejected six proposals since 1970 to 
increase taxes for education clark nearly doubled the local 
property tax ordering the school district to raise the tax from 
205 to 4 per 100 of assessed valuation to help finance the 
improvements

independence wednesday with military marches and tribal dancing 
while president robert mugabe said he welcomed an end to the 
britishbrokered constitution 
a nearcapacity crowd joined mugabe seven other african 
presidents and scores of foreign dignitaries at a 60000seat 
stadium outside harare for festivities processions and rallies 
were organized countrywide 
we are here to share our jubilation on this historic and 
momentous occasion said mugabe a former schoolteacher who led 
his country to indepedendence from british colonial rule april 18 
1980 the former whiteruled colony of rhodesia was mired in a 
guerrilla war for seven years before independence 
mugabe said the second decade of independence would witness even 
greater moves toward unity peace and progress 
we can do it yes we can do it together as one united people 
one nation he said 
mugabe carefully avoided referring to controversial issues such 
as his avowed aim to turn one of africas few westernstyle 
democracies into a marxist oneparty state 
mugabe said he welcomed wednesdays expiration of the 10year 
constitution brokered by the british that contained entrenched 
racial provisions protecting the interests of the 90000strong 
white community 
we shall proceed in the name of justice equity and fairness 
to amend these provisions so as to make more land available to the 
peasant population he said 
under the socalled lancaster house constitution 20 seats in 
the 100member parliament were reserved for whites for the first 
seven years of independence legal clauses blocked the seizure of 
whiteowned property 
the formula was intended to stop a mass exodus of skilled whites 
the government says 4000 mostly white commercial farmers still 
own more than onefourth of all land while some 8 million peasants 
occupy about onethird of property the rest is state property and 
wilderness preserves 
but state officials have said that after april 18 they will 
move to buy littleused farmland widescale seizures of farms are 
not expected 
during his anniversary address mugabe acknowledged the role of 
large commercial farms in the economy he said that apart from 
wheat imports this southern african nation of 92 million people 
is selfsufficient in food 
he also praised local industries mainly in the hands of white 
entrepreneurs manufacturers generate nearly 30 percent of the 
gross domestic product of about 4 billion mugabe said 
he said more local and foreign investment in production was 
needed to combat rising uemployment and shortages of essential 
commodities 
flanked by president danial arap moi of kenya and president 
hastings kamuzu banda of malawi mugabe said his people were eager 
for regional peace and an end to south africas system of racial 
separation 
mugabe and moi are mediating efforts to end the 12yearold 
civil war in neighboring mozambique 
hundreds of zimbabweans have died in crossborder raids by 
rebels from mozambique scavenging food and supplies more than 
12000 zimbabwean troops are fighting alongside government forces 
there

of botswana mengistu haile mariam of ethiopia sam nujoma of 
namibia and kenneth kaunda of zambia

dwash the tasks this country has borne for the last 40 years 
have been crowned with great success and it was now time to 
address domestic priorities he said

295 billion in military spending compared to 3033 billion 
proposed by bush the cuts would escalate sharply over five years 
for a total cut of 251 billion compared to what it would be if 
the military budget kept pace with inflation 
of that total 145 billion would go toward reducing the federal 
deficits and 106 billion would go to domestic programs 
other deficit reduction in the plan was unclear wednesday as 
democratic leaders declined to provide details the budget would 
call for 139 billion in tax increases the same total proposed by 
president bush

was proposing no domestic spending cuts deeper than those proposed 
by president bush and in many cases reductions he was proposing 
were rejected

must make from military confrontation to economic leadership 
from a cold war economy to a peacetime economy

fires bombings and poisonings have 
killed more than 280 people in recent days the result of lax 
safety regulations ethnic violence and an overcrowded 
transportation system 
during fire safety week this week a train explosion burned 100 
passengers to death in the east blazes in the capital destroyed 
600 shops 1300 shacks and the capitals only convention center 
in faraway assam state a wildfire ripped through 1000 houses 
and three saw mills 
a food poisoning outbreak during a marriage engagement party 
killed 150 people near lucknow in the north another outbreak near 
rajkot in the west hospitalized 400 
the connection between them all said the respected indian 
express newspaper in an editorial wednesday they were eminently 
avoidable 
these events reflect a general attitude the express said 
we heed no law we abide by no norm 
the paper added another item to the list a recently banned 
carcinogenic chemical that it says is still being used to 
manufacture soft drinks 
the string of disasters has set india wondering asked one 
leading social scientist bhabani sen gupta what is going on 
with 880 million people on a land mass about onethird the size 
of the united states india is prone to major disasters population 
density reaches more than 1600 per square mile in new delhi and 
five times that in the slums of bombay and calcutta 
more than 10 million people ride trains every day and passenger 
cars are jammed with people often perching on the roofs colorful 
buses their cabins dedicated to any one of a pantheon of hindu 
gods also move millions a day 
the weight this number of people places on indias railway and 
road network is a recipe for trouble the two national wire 
services press trust of india and united news of india routinely 
move stories of buses careening down ravines killing scores 
add ethnic violence to this overtaxed infrastructure and the 
formula can become explosive 
in the far northeastern state of assam last thursday extremists 
from the bodo tribe bombed railway lines a road and a major 
bridge killing 25 people and cutting the already isolated state 
off the indian heartland the bodo tribe which worships spirits 
believed to inhabit rocks and trees wants a separate homeland 
a day earlier a bomb exploded on a crowded commuter train in 
the bustling western metropolis of bombay and injured 31 a 
militant moslem group mujahedeen kashmir fighting for the 
secession of kashmir from india claimed responsibility more than 
250 people have been killed in that fight since the government 
launched a crackdown in january 
on friday a bomb blew up a crowded bus in new delhi killing 
six people and wounding dozens more a bomb blast killed a woman in 
a village 70 miles north of bombay on tuesday there were no claims 
of responsibility in either incident eight bombs were found 
planted on a northern railroad track tuesday 
i think the educated indian has to ask himself whether were 
not going mad said sen gupta in an interview 
most of this weeks disasters appear unrelated to terrorism but 
that he said could give even more cause to worry 
we have only ourselves to blame then he said life has 
become cheap in india 
the train disaster in patna that left 100 dead was apparently 
triggered by a leaking gas cylinder but after the fire started 
none of the passengers could stop the train because the alarm chain 
had been removed media reports said 
in india transporting explosive substances on passenger trains 
is against the law but as the national herald newspaper observed 
if the passengers are able to violate the laws with impunity it 
is because of the indifference of the railway authorities 
the times of india blamed pesticides in the food for the food 
poisoning deaths near lucknow it said stringent regulations 
controlling the use of the deadly substances were routinely 
ignored problems were compounded by a physicians strike in the 
area 
in new delhi the fire in the governments main convention 
center which broke out during a conference of police chiefs came 
two years after the fire department declared the building unsafe 
nothing had been done to repair it 
firetrucks rushed to the scene still draped in bunting that 
read fire services week april 1521 a week dedicated to fire 
safety nationwide 
the blaze in the sardar bazaar which gutted 600 shops occurred 
in a crowded area whose residents and merchants had long demanded 
better water pressure so had the inhabitants of the shantytown in 
badola village just outside new delhi 
on wednesday all major newspapers called for reforms but one 
chief editor reported that none of his colleagues were really 
optimistic much could be done 
said the express no disaster however terrible seems to make 
a difference

heres a look at what is at stake economically for 
lithuania and the soviet union if the baltic republic is isolated 
 
in the soviet economic arsenal 
lithuania receives all of its oil gas and diesel fuel from 
the soviet union paying subsidized prices at world market prices 
lithuania would run a deficit of 700 million for oil alone 
it also receives all of its metals cotton tractors and 
automobiles from the soviet union 
it receives 58 percent of its sugar from cuba via the soviet 
union 
it receives 37 percent of its concentrated fertilizer from the 
soviet union cotton 100 percent 
it received 400000 tons of grain from the soviets in 1989 
it has only four to five days supply of newsprint and the 
soviets could cut off the supply thus shutting down its newspapers 
 
in lithuanias economic arsenal 
the republic sends to the soviet union 15 percent of the 
nations total production including household electrical meters 
100 percent television set components 70 percent and tractor 
components 30 percent 
it produces much more meat 530000 metric tons in 1987 eggs 
12 million metric tons in 1987 milk 31 million metric tons in 
1987 and other dairy products than it consumes so it could cut 
off the rest of the soviet union from its surplus 
textile products are shipped to factories in the soviet union 
including one plant in leningrad that employs 18000 workers 
if the soviets shut down an oil pipeline to a major refinery 
in the town of mazeikiai that would also mean the republics of 
estonia latvia and byelorussia would be cut off a shutdown of a 
natural gas pipeline also would interrupt the flow to kaliningrad 
part of the russian republic west of lithuania 
lithuania might demand world prices for exporting oil gas and 
other products through its baltic ports including klaipeda

extent for the sake of defense preparedness said lothar spaeth 
the christian democratic governor of badenwuerttemberg state 
which includes karlsruhe 
the government of chancellor helmut kohl who heads the

on the 84th anniversary of the great quake 
folks who live in the earthchurning san francisco region had 
plenty reason to pay close attention to the pulse of the san 
andreas fault 
they got a chilling reminder when a series of earthquakes 
rumbled through northern california on wednesday shattering nerves 
but little else 
the tremors along the san andreas hit about 90 minutes after 150 
survivors of the 1906 quake and subsequent inferno gathered in the 
predawn darkness to talk about the time the earth shook and the sky 
glowed 
the group has held a reunion every year since 1924 at lottas 
fountain on market street where they observe a moment of silence 
at 513 am when the estimated 83magnitude quake struck on 
april 18 1906 
some survivors were just a few days old 84 years ago others 
were old enough to remember camping in city parks while fires raged 
throughout the city 
one man recalled how he was tossed from the first floor window 
of the orphanage he lived in as the children were evacuated 
the reunion organizer taren sapienza said some survivors 
werent bothered by wednesdays earthquakes they were en route to 
paint gold a fire hydrant that continued to work after the 1906 
quake and helped save a neighborhood 
one or two of the survivors commented that it didnt faze them 
at all as they had experienced the big one said sapienza 
the great quake killed hundreds perhaps thousands destroyed 
about 30000 buildings and left 225000 homeless 
about 400000 square miles were believed rattled when a 270mile 
zone of the 650mile fault slipped in a titanic shrug of the 
plates that separate the north american continent from the pacific 
basin the western side of the rupture moved north while the 
eastern side moved south 
one geologist said it was as though san francisco and los 
angeles were being drawn closer together 
for decades it was believed that about 700 people died in the 
quake but in recent years research by san francisco city 
archivist gladys hansen documented at least 2500 deaths and she 
indicated the real toll may be much higher 
mrs hansen reached her conclusions by examining public records 
obituaries and clippings from old newspapers and letters from 
people telling her of relatives who died she found many quake 
victims died in other cities after an estimated 250000 people 
evacuated san francisco on boats and trains within three days of 
the catastrophe 
nearly every city from eureka near the oregon line south to 
salinas near monterey sustained damage 
all over the city refugees fled with what belongings they could 
gather whole families harnessed themselves to wagons to haul their 
household treasures to safe areas soup kitchens fed the homeless 
in union square 
in a new york city newspaper a reporter wrote that the 
gayest lightesthearted city of this continent is no more 
opera singer enrico caruso was in san francisco at the time 
booked at the grand opera house in the role of don jose in 
carmen he was asleep at the palace hotel when the quake hit 
he got to the street in his night clothes 
i run into the street he said later i see buildings 
shaking that night i sleep on hard ground 
caruso fled the city vowing never to return

the sixth amendment to the constitution 
guarantees that a person accused of a crime may see his accuser 
facetoface now the supreme court is debating whether that 
applies when the accuser is a sexually abused child 
in two cases argued before the court wednesday the justices 
focused on the rights of the defendents more than on the rights and 
possible traumatization of children 
in a 1986 case in which a maryland daycare center operator 
sandra ann craig was convicted of abusing a 6yearold girl the 
child testified by closedcircuit television that is the practice 
in many states 
the conviction and 10year sentence were overturned by a higher 
state court on grounds that the judge should have questioned the 
girl and other children in mrs craigs presence however briefly 
the state court stopped short of invalidating the maryland law 
that allows young children to testify by closedcircuit tv outside 
the presence of the defendant 
this woman could be sentenced to 15 years on the basis of the 
testimony of a child she wasnt even in the room with justice 
antonin scalia said about mrs craig 
scalia noted that the judge permitted the televised appearance 
on the basis of testimony of a social worker that the child would 
be upset 
maryland attorney general j joseph curran jr argued that a 
social worker had told the trial judge that if the child were 
forced to testify in front of mrs craig she would probably stop 
talking withdraw and curl up in a ball 
thats something of an emotional trauma but this women is 
going to jail for 15 years scalia said 
justice sandra day oconnor said i suppose its possible a 
rape victim or a victim of a mafiatype crime would be so 
terrified the same argument could be made 
but william h murphy representing mrs craig suggested that 
substituting a television appearance for live testimony was an 
experiment at the expense of his client 
this is a bad experiment he said the truthseeking 
function is not served 
we take the position there is much more to the right to 
confrontation than was permitted in this case murphy said 
adding that televised testimony acts to deprive a defendant of 
one of the tools of his defense 
in the second case the issue was whether the right of laura lee 
wright of boise idaho to confront her accuser was violated by the 
testimony of a pediatrician who had examined a 2yearold girl 
allegedly abused by the girls father robert giles 
mrs wright and giles were convicted of sexually abusing mrs 
wrights two daughters the 5yearold child was not giles 
mrs wright was sentenced to 20 years in prison but the idaho 
supreme court threw out her conviction in june and ordered a new 
trial the state court ruled that the trial judge wrongly allowed a 
doctor who examined the 2yearold to testify about what she told 
him giles case was not addressed by the supreme court 
idaho attorney general jim jones told the high court that the 
girls older sister testified about sexual activities and that her 
statements were corroborated by the doctors testimony 
the 2yearold told the doctor daddy does do this with me 
but a little more with my sister than with me the girl was 
referring to giles according to court documents 
during that argument scalia interjected i wouldnt want to 
be a defendant in such circumstances i get no shot at the child 
decisions are expected by july

a coroner admitted wednesday he 
mistakenly identified the remains of a pet rabbit as a yearold boy 
killed with his mother in a fire 
it was the body of something said dr c dupha reeves 
wayne county coroner because i was told a mother and child died 
in the fire i assumed it was the body of the child i 
misidentified it 
gary rotondo discovered his sons body last week when he 
returned to his mobile home after the feb 28 fire he had thought 
the remains of his livein girlfriend vickie lee evans 18 and 
their son john had been cremated 
police have reopened their investigation into the deaths 
reeves who is 80 and was first elected coroner 26 years ago 
said he did not go to the fire scene on the day of the blaze 
he saw the bodies later at the newarkwayne community hospital 
but did not do an autopsy or try to identify the remains through 
records or fingerprints 
he said it would have been impossible to make an accurate 
identification because there was nothing left of them 
rotondos father paul said police told him an autopsy would 
now be performed on the remains even though only a badly burned 
torso was found 
he said the boys xrays and records were on file at the 
hospital 
autopsies are not required by new york state law but several 
pathologists say they should be performed in fire cases 
once you have burned charred remains distinguishing between 
animals and humans superficially externally can be difficult 
said dr michael baden codirector of the state police forensics 
unit 
wayne county is about 15 miles east of rochester

a human rights group said wednesday that us 
border patrol agents have mistreated and even killed mexicans 
trying to illegally enter the united states 
but border patrol representatives said the agents are defending 
themselves along an increasingly violent usmexican border where 
they facndits and aliens who try to force their way 
into the united states 
violence along the border was the subject of a hearing sponsored 
by the house foreign affairs subcommittee on human rights and 
international organizations it is clear that somete attack from bahing 
is wrong 
on our borders said rep gus yatron dpa the subcommittee 
chairman 
i wish i could say that violent confrontations between 
americans and undocumented immigrants are isolated but 
unfortunately they are not rep jim bates dcalif said 
he said the american friends service committee a quaker 
humanitarian organization has documented 20 people in the last 
four years who were shot and killed near san diego by the border 
patrol an arm of the us immigration and naturalization service 
the committee also released a report on 380 cases of alleged 
human rights violations between may 1988 and may 1989 they 
occurred near san diego rio grande texas tuscon ariz el paso 
texasp a childrens advocacy group said wednesday it 
wants the government to investigate whether a longrange microphone 
marketed in a line of hightech toys is an illegal eavesdropping 
device 
part of it is just a pretend spy kit said peggy charren 
president of action for childrens television the problem is 
that the listening device works it is not then a toy it is an 
eavesdropping device 
tyco industries inc manufactures the spytech toy line 
which includes the microphone an undercover vest binoculars an 
intruder alert periscope fingerprint kit walkie talkies and a 
hidden camera the toys each sold separately are designed for 
children 8 years and older 
charren said act this week would ask the federal communications 
commission and the federal trade commission to investigate the 
microphone which picks up sound up to 100 feet away that group 
wants the ftc to investigate tycos print and broadcast 
advertisements for the product 
we find this criticism so amazing said jim alley senior 
vice president for marketing at tyco weve developed a toy line 
that is totally nonviolent its safe its fun and 
nonviolent 
alley said there was only a remote possibility the 
microphone which sells for under 20 could be used for 
eavesdropping because it only works in line of sight it 
wont work through walls it wont work through windows and it 
wont work through doors 
alley said the fullsize handoperatied red boom mike cant be 
concealed 
the television advertisements for the microphone show two 
children honing in on the sound of a mans whistling but charren 
warned it could be used for other listening 
that message of listening to somebody when he doesnt know 
youre listening is one anybody can get from the advertisement 
she said 
rudolph brewington a privacy advocate and washingtonbased 
freelance journalist said in an april 10 letter to tyco president 
richard grey that sale and advertisement of the toy amounts to 
gross corporate irresponsibility 
the company is providing the means and encouragement to young 
children to surreptiously spy on their unsuspecting playmates 
friends families and neighbors brewington said 
he contends the device violates both us criminal law and 
postal regulations that prohibit the manufacture distribution or 
sending through the mail devices that are primarily useful for 
the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire or oral 
communications 
an aide to rep ronald dellums said the device would be illegal 
under a bill proposed by the california democrat 
if a child was listening in on three of its playmates across 
the playground that would be illegal said george withers 
legislative director for the congressmans capitol hill office 
the proposal the privacy assurance act of 1989 would require 
that all participants in a conversation consent to its interception 
by listening or recording devices in instances not involved in law 
enforcement cases 
the bill which has been referred to the house judiciary 
subcommittee on crime would also require that sound or 
voiceactivated recorders emit an audible beeptone to alert a 
speaker that his communication is being recorded

wheat production could rise sharply this year 
and help replenish dwindling us stockpiles an agriculture 
department report said wednesday 
the wheat inventory on march 1 was the smallest in 15 years and 
could be down to 442 million bushels by the start of the new 
marketing year june 1 according to usda estimates that would be 
the smallest june 1 wheat reserve since 1975 
analysts said that despite the tight supply situation 1990 
wheat prices through midmarch dropped about 10 percent reflecting 
prospects for a larger harvest this year 
winter wheat acreage seeded last fall was up nearly 4 percent 
from a year earlier and 71 percent of the crop was reported in 
good or excellent condition as of midapril the report said 
farmers who normally plant spring wheat indicated in a survey 
announced by usda on march 30 that they intend to reduce their 
acreage this year 
as a result the new report said the total wheat acreage may be 
up only 12 percent from last year 
but some of last years wheat area was counted twice because 
farmers reseeded damaged winter wheat acreage with spring wheat 
the report said thus this years area increase is understated 
additionally the report said winter wheat states say that 
this seasons winterkill has been lower so harvested area may 
post larger gains than planted area 
the larger harvested acreage assuming peracre yields recover 
points to a 1990 us wheat crop substantially larger than last 
years 204 billion bushels production dropped to about 18 
billion bushels in 1988 largely reflecting drought losses 
wheat market prices in the 198990 marketing year that soon will 
end are forecast by usda to average in the range of 370 to 375 
per bushel compared with 372 in 198889 and 257 in 198788

development near yellowstone national 
park is taking bites out of an ecological cookie and an 
apocalyptic groups giant fallout shelter is biting a critical 
section a park manager says 
in addition to the church development where 31000 gallons of 
fuel leaked last week a gold mine recently opened just north of 
yellowstone and a large platinum mine operates 30 to 40 miles north 
of the park there also is talk of another gold mine opening near 
the parks northeast corner and in the summer of 1988 forest 
fires scorched about a third of yellowstone 
if we cant hold the line in yellowstone national park on 
these kinds of issues im not so sure we can save these kinds 
of islands said stu coleman chief of resource management for 
americas oldest national park 
the fuel spilled at the church universal and triumphants 
12500acre ranch and gardiner officials worried there may be more 
spills 
the church whose members are preparing for a global nuclear 
catastrophe has brought in heavy machinery to build the huge 
underground shelter complex in a high mountain meadow a few miles 
north of yellowstone 
park managers and local residents learned of the construction 
last summer and immediately expressed fear about potential 
environmental consequences 
those fears were realized last week when diesel fuel and 
gasoline spilled from three of 35 tanks buried next to the shelter 
state officials fear the remaining 32 tanks also may have been 
damaged by shifting ground during the spring thaw 
church officials have brought in more equipment to clean up the 
spill state health officials said tuesday they will seek a court 
order to halt construction at the site the department plans to 
file its lawsuit on friday 
the spill occurred near a yellowstone river tributary that is a 
spawning stream for cutthroat trout but the tributary enters the 
yellowstone downstream from the park so any pollution would not 
directly affect park waters 
of more concern is the impact of the complex and the cleanup on 
the wild forest that stretches from the 2 millionacre park past 
the shelters and far north into montana 
the southern gallatin range is considered critical habitat for 
the federally protected grizzly bear it is home to elk moose 
deer bald eagles and other species that inhabit the park 
but increased human activity like the extensive construction at 
the shelter site and the intensive cleanup will drive the bears 
away coleman said 
grizzlies dont like to be in areas where people are he 
said 
coleman said the shelter is a prime example of potentially 
damaging private development near park boundaries nibbling away at 
a protected ecosystem 
i kind of liken development to taking a bite out of an 
ecological cookie he said when someone wants to take a bite 
out of the most important part of the cookie then thats reason 
for concern 
the church bought its ranch from publisher malcolm forbes in 
1981 since then it has bought 18000 more acres moved its 
headquarters here from southern california and sponsored several 
housing developments 
hundreds of followers have moved into the area and many have 
built fallout shelters at housing developments near emigrant a 
ranching community 30 miles north of gardiner 
the church is led by elizabeth clare prophet who claims she 
receives and passes on to members messages from a group of souls 
known as the ascended masters she warned her followers that march 
and april would be dangerous times 
the group owns some of the areas best winter range for elk 
deer bison and antelope coleman said during winter these 
animals migrate out of the park into lower valleys and rangeland 
north of gardiner 
its kind of hard because we dont own all that pasture and 
were trying to take care of the animals on that pasture coleman 
said 
in late 1986 church developments near gardiner were halted when 
the state conducted a twoyear environmental review as part of the 
review the church agreed to mitigate the impacts of its projects 
on wildlife 
but construction of the shelter was not included church 
officials said they didnt decide to build the shelter until after 
the review was completed in march 1989 
state officials said theyd been duped and decided earlier this 
year to reopen the review 
church officials have said they wont occupy the fallout shelter 
area except in case of emergency and so dont expect to have a 
significant effect on wildlife 
they have often labeled park officials comments as 
hypocritical pointing to six major developments in the park 
including hotels 
two wrongs dont make a right coleman responded he said 
park officials have tried to adjust the placement of developments 
in wildlife areas

lithuania refused wednesday to bow to mikhail s 
gorbachevs ultimatum that it rescind independenceoriented laws 
but offered to pass no more such measures if the kremlin starts 
immediate talks 
there were no signs that gorbachevs threatened economic 
sanctions against the baltic republic had been implemented with 
critical oil and gas supplies flowing normally at its refineries 
and pipelines 
soviet deputy oil and gas minister aklim mukhamedzyanov told the 
tass news agency that reports of an energy cutoff to lithuania 
are completely groundless he said the soviet council of 
ministers issued no such orders 
after lithuanias supreme council legislature approved its 
official response to gorbachev lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis warned him that an oil and gas embargo would hurt other 
republics as well as lithuania 
an economic blockade would influence latvia estonia and the 
kaliningrad region of russia landsbergis was quoted as telling a 
news conference 
that would resemble an angry man beating himself eduardas 
potasinskas of lithuanian tv quoted landsbergis as saying 
but anticipating a possible soviet embargo the supreme council 
urged lithuanian factories and consumers to prepare themselves 
for spiritual endurance and strict economy on all consumption it 
did not annouce specific conservation measures 
at the end of two days of sometimes heated debate the supreme 
council drafted a letter to gorbachev promising that if talks began 
before may 1 it would not pass any more measures to implement its 
march 11 declaration of independence 
that offer represented an effort to compromise with moscow but 
was unlikely to be accepted by the soviet leadership 
in their resolution titled on the expansion of relations 
between the republic of lithuania and the ussr members of 
the supreme council reaffirmed their declaration of independence 
and also appealed to gorbachev not to use violence against 
lithuanians or impose the economic sanctions he threatened on 
friday 
gorbachev said that unless lithuania rolled back several laws 
supporting the declaration of independence he would impose an 
embargo on key supplies to the baltic republic of 38 million 
residents 
he did not spell out what materials would be cut off saying 
only that they would be those goods the soviet union sells abroad 
for hard currency meaning oil and natural gas 
lithuania is entirely dependent upon the soviet union for all 
its oil and gas and petroleum products are the soviet unions most 
profitable export 
lithuanias energy minister leonas asmantas said wednesday 
that oil and gas were being delivered as usual 
the day before asmantas reported receiving unofficial 
information that crude oil supplies and natural gas would be 
reduced wednesday in addition lithuanian gas officials said they 
received a telegram from a regional soviet energy official stating 
that supplies of natural gas would be curtailed sharply on the 
orders of the government 
lithuanian tv reported that residents saw soviet troops in 
several armored vehicles stopped wednesday morning near a pumping 
station at the mazheikiai refinery in the northwestern part of the 
republic but there was no interruption of service potasinskas 
said the presence of soldiers at the site was unusual he added 
sales of gasoline to lithuanian motorists have tripled this week 
as residents reacted to gorbachevs threat with panicbuying but 
stocks were adequate and no rationing was anticipated asmantas 
said 
gorbachevs 48hour deadline passed sunday night amid the 
threeday easter holiday in the heavily roman catholic republic 
the supreme council did not convene until tuesday although 
landsbergis and other leaders held an emergency meeting monday to 
assess the impact of an economic embargo 
it was the latest in a series of ultimatums gorbachev has issued 
since lithuanians declared their independence in most cases such 
as a demand that they surrender their private firearms he has not 
reacted when they refused to give in 
in addition to the threats the kremlin has sent tanks and 
military vehicles through lithuanias capital vilnius rounded up 
lithuanins who deserted from the red army seized buildings and 
barred western journalists from lithuania 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said action 
by moscow against lithuania could doom commercial relations between 
the soviet union and the united states 
its very difficult to see some of the commercial aspects of 
our relationship surviving the use of force or coercion against 
lithuania baker said 
in a separate letter to gorbachev the lithuanian legislature 
expressed regrets on the position and methods chosen by the 
ussr 
on our part as earlier we are prepared to discuss any 
issues taking into consideration all justified interests of the 
soviet union foremost those of its citizens and those of a 
strategic nature the letter said 
legislators said they were forming a delegation led by bronius 
kuzmickas vice president of the supreme council to travel to 
moscow for possible talks a previous delegation met with gorbachev 
adviser alexander n yakovlev but made no headway toward settling 
the dispute 
lithuania picked up support wednesday from neighboring poland 
with the solidarity delegation to the polish parliament adopting a 
resolution expressing concern over the growing pressure being 
exerted by moscow 
the delegation also suggesting that warsaw assist in 
negotiations between the republic and the kremlin

a chemotherapy combination that includes a 
drug used to deworm farm animals was endorsed wednesday by a panel 
of experts as a standard treatment after patients in a late stage 
of colon cancer undergo surgery 
twelve cancer specialist assembled by the national institutes of 
health recommended that all physicians offer the drug combination 
of 5fluorouracil or 5fu and levamisole to patients who have 
been surgically treated for stage iii colon cancer 
the recommendation in effect endorses as standard treatment a 
chemotherapy that was tested in a national institute of cancer 
clinical trial that ended in october 
that national trial among 1300 patients found that 5fu and 
levamisole reduced death and cancer recurrence by up to a third 
levamisole is a drug widely used to remove worms from the 
intestinal tract of cows horses goats sheep and even elephants 
5fu is a standard cancer drug that has been used for about 30 
years 
the battle has not been won in colorectal cancer said dr 
glenn d steele jr a harvard professor who chaired the panel of 
specialists 
many many answers still need to come in before we are even 
close to winning the battle once someone is diagnosed with colon or 
rectal cancer 
one of the unanswered questions he said is how exactly 
levamisole works to reduce the recurrence of colon cancer the 
precise action of the drug in cancer treatment is not known 
its a little disquieting to not understand why it works 
said committee member dr david p winchester a chicago physician 
and a director of the american college of surgeons 
but steele said the consensus panel said it felt there was 
enough clinical evidence to merit recommending the combination for 
stage iii colon cancer 
the panel also recommended that surgery alone be used to treat 
patients in stage i of the disease suggesting the use of both 
chemotherapy and radiation for stages ii and iii of rectal cancer 
the experts also called for more clinical drug trials to better 
define treatment combinations for patients at all disease stages 
after surgery 
postsurgical therapy for colorectal cancer patients has been an 
area of intense study among physicians worldwide for decades but 
clincial drug trials have failed until recent years to show the 
additional treatment to be of any benefit 
because of poor results and severe toxic reactions to some 
chemotherapies many patients are treated only with surgery for 
late stage patients the cancer almost invariably returns 
colon and rectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer 
death in the united states there are more than 150000 new 
colorectal cancers diagnosed annually 
of the new cases the panel said about 55000 colon cancer 
patients and 20000 rectal cancer patients are defined as high 
risk about half of that high risk group will die within five years 
in its report the committee said that 5fu and levamisole 
appears to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence by 41 percent and 
lower the overall death rate by 33 percent 
overal survival percentages at 3 years were estimated to be 
71 percent vs 55 percent for the control group the report said 
the control group received no chemotherapy 
side effects from 5fu and levamisole the committee said 
were well tolerated 
the panel said it found that patients at stage i of colon cancer 
had a survival rate of 80 percent to 90 percent after five years 
with surgery alone thus the experts said postsurgical therapy 
for this early stage of the disease was not recommended 
levamisole is available for human consumption in the united 
states only from the national institute of cancer the nci started 
providing the drug free to the physicians of stage iii colon cancer 
patients in october after ending the national trial of the drug 
the drug manufactured by a belgium company is expected to be 
available for general prescriptions this summer said nci spokesman 
dr mike hamilton he said the delay is caused by a manufacturing 
problem with packaging 
steele said the consensus panel recommended that physicians 
adopt a standard scale for evaluating the stages of colorectal 
cancer 
the scale uses the size and spread of the primary tumor the 
involvement of lymph nodes and the presence of metastasis or 
spread to distant organs to classify the disease stage the scale 
ranges from stage zero to stage iv

the soviet union has a significantly 
decreased capability of winning a conventional war against nato 
because of moscows eroding confidence in its warsaw pact allies 
the joint chiefs of staffs said wednesday 
the chiefs in their first international threat assessment since 
the berlin wall was opened in november said the likelihood of a 
conventional war escalating into a nuclear one continues to 
decline 
the annual study prepared by gen colin powell the chairman of 
the joint chiefs is supposed to present a big picture for the 
military in planning defense strategies and budgets 
congress was given a classified version of the report last month 
the report comes amid calls from lawmakers for sharp cuts in 
pentagon spending in light of reduced superpower tensions and 
repeated warnings from defense secretary dick cheney that caution 
should be used as fiscal constraints force changes in the nations 
defenses 
the study expresses a restrained sense of optimism about the 
revolutionary changes that have swept across eastern europe and the 
soviet union 
a dramatically different security environment is emerging that 
is principally characterized by a diminished soviet threat reduced 
defense resources and an increasingly complex world the study 
stated these realities imply a reshaping of us security 
policy strategy force posture and capabilities 
but the study also tempers such observations with warnings that 
the united states must be wary and ready in case soviet reforms 
are reversed or us security interests are challenged by threats 
from other sources such as drugs terrorism regional conflicts or 
third world nations armed with ballistic missiles 
the challenge is to reconcile enduring objectives and tasks 
with repostured and restructured forces without foreclosing options 
for hedging against new or renewed threats concluded the study 
which is formally titled the joint military net assessment 
the report says that while the transformation of domestic and 
foreign soviet policies is incomplete and may be reversible 
there is a broad agreement that the soviet leadership has decided 
to reverse a 20year pattern of growth in military spending and 
force posture 
the study notes that while the soviet union and the warsaw pact 
have significant force advantages unilateral force reductions 
and political change in eastern europe are eroding the soviets 
capability to conduct successful sustained conventional operations 
against nato additionally their confidence in the reliability of 
nonsoviet warsaw pact forces is diminished 
thus the study states the soviets have to consider the 
prospect that they would have to conduct a theater offensive 
against nato primarily on their own consequently their 
capability to accomplish theater strategic objectives is 
significantly decreased 
in the unlikely event that such a war did occur the potential 
for termination of such a conflict on terms favorable to the united 
states is much improved the study said 
it also said that the probability that nato would need to 
resort to the use of nonstrategic nuclear forces is assessed to 
decrease as conventionalforce reductions produce a better 
balance between the armies of eastern and western europe 
but the foundation of the us strategy of deterrence remains 
its triad of nuclear weapons the study said 
investment in a ballistic missile defense system is needed as 
a minimum to counter the possibility of a soviet missile attack 
against the united states and the potential caused by the 
proliferation of advanced missile systems among third world 
nations the report said 
yet in the same paragraph the study added in any case the 
risk of nuclear deterrence failing is assessed to be low and at 
this moment to be decreasing

after being plagued for years by a shortage of 
controllers chicagos air traffic control center has enough 
people but members of the controllers union said wednesday theres 
another problem not enough chairs 
during one shift last week at the chicago air route traffic 
control center in suburban aurora one controller sat on a wooden 
box because no more chairs were available said union chapter 
chairman jim poole 
the center handles more than 2 million planes a year including 
crosscountry flights and flights into and out of ohare 
international the nations busiest airport 
the lack of chairs poses no danger to air safety and no 
controllers have been injured said officials with the federal 
aviation administration and the union the national air traffic 
control association but faa spokesman mort edelstein said theres 
a nationwide problem with broken chairs 
we bought 10000 of these chairs from 1985 to 1986 five 
percent to 9 percent are considered not usable today and about 20 
percent are considered broken but usable edelstein said 
the agency has had difficulty getting replacement parts for 
broken chairs he said they have to go to oklahoma city for 
the parts and theres a backlog of orders 
ron downen a union representative at the aurora center said 
there were at least 12 broken chairs among the 121 chairs he 
counted in the control room on a shift this week when 143 people 
were on duty the center employs about 400 controllers said faa 
spokesman mike ficocello 
not all the controllers on the shift were handling planes 
because of lunch breaks rest breaks and training sessions so all 
working controllers had chairs downen said 
but bad weather or computer troubles could require more 
controllers at radar screens at once threatening a chair shortage 
he said 
we need more chairs before the thunderstorm season hits 
said kevin christy another union area representative 
the faa believes the center has enough usable chairs said 
spokesman bob buckhorn in washington 
we do have a problem in maintenance and were expediting a 
program to ensure those broken chairs are either fixed or 
replaced buckhorn said anywhere we find a shortage of chairs 
were taking steps to correct that its not interfering with the 
operation of the center he said 
the chairs were designed to reduce fatigue and aid posture and 
were the best chairs available that met controllers requirements 
buckhorn said 
but christy said the chairs arent as sturdy as the ones they 
replaced 
they get hard use because theyre sat in 24 hours a day 
rocked back and forth rolled across the aisles christy said 
but the chairs werent built to last they dont even look sturdy 
the arms are falling off the wheels are getting stuck and the 
backs break off theyre comfortable but they replaced chairs we 
had years ago that were comfortable too and could stand a lot of 
abuse 
the faa has had trouble in the past filling vacancies at the 
center because it is one of the busiest in the air traffic control 
network but a program giving controllers at busier centers extra 
pay has largely eliminated the problem

bush administration officials challenged 
presidents of historically black colleges and universities 
wednesday to inspire 10 percent of their students to seek 
collegiate teaching careers 
weve got to do something about faculty members in higher 
education institutions said leonard haynes iii assistant 
education secretary for postsecondary schools 
if you would just put a target of 10 percent of your student 
body and cause them to want to go on to get a masters and 
doctorate we will solve the shortage of black phds in a period 
of five to seven years said haynes alluding to statistics that 
show only four blacks nationwide received doctorates in mathematics 
in 1988 
haynes told the conference that too many of our students now 
are from the now generation 
they want everything right now they dont want to pay for it 
they dont want to work for it they just want thats going to 
kill us unless we correct it 
education secretary lauro cavazos said black institutions now 
graduate 40 percent of all black americans receiving baccalaureate 
degrees 
black colleges have produced tens of thousands of outstanding 
minority teachers over the years and can help to develop new 
programs for effective teaching in americas culturally and 
ethnically diverse classrooms said cavazos 
a 1988 education department survey of faculties in higher 
education institutions found that whites accounted for 89 percent 
of the 489164 fulltime regular faculty members and 90 percent of 
the 175589 parttime regular faculty members 
asians comprised 4 percent of the fulltime faculty blacks 3 
percent hispanics 2 percent and american indians 1 percent

families of the 47 sailors killed in the uss 
iowa explosion last april 19 began arriving here wednesday for a 
memorial service and some voiced support for the navys handling 
of the disaster a year ago 
at a news conference family members said they believe the 
navys controversial conclusion that the battleship explosion was 
likely caused by sabotage by a disgruntled gunners mate who died 
in the blast 
im in total agreement with the report i think the navy did a 
thorough job i dont believe there was any coverup said 
john hague whose stepson lt jg philip buch died in the 
explosion 
the news conference was attended by five people representing 
three families other families of the victims have said they 
disagree with the navys findings 
according to the navy gunners mate clayton hartwig was 
suicidal and disgruntled at his treatment by the navy that 
assessment was based on a psychological profile done by the federal 
bureau of investigation 
the navy theorized hartwig slipped a chemical detonator between 
the bags of powder in the center 16inch gun in gun turret no 2 
seconds before the turret was scheduled to fire a training salvo 
off the coast of puerto rico the explosion occurred sending a 
fireball racing down the six decks of the turret the blast 
instantly killed most of the men inside the giant gun 
hartwigs sister kathy kubicina has crusaded to clear her 
brothers name she has been joined by other family members of 
victims and some legislators in questioning the navys 
investigation 
earlier this year a subcommittee of the house armed services 
committee issued a report saying the navys conclusions were not 
supported by the facts 
i found it deplorable that the navy would stretch the facts to 
force a conclusion that blamed it on a sailor said former 
secretary of the navy john lehman lehman brought the world war ii 
battleship out of retirement as part of the buildup to a 600ship 
navy under president reagan 
kathy miller whose son todd miller died in the explosion said 
she was upset that ms kubicina appeared to be speaking for all the 
parents when she challenged the navys report 
she does not speak for all of us youre going to have 47 
different opinions about what might have happened but the point is 
not to rehash it any longer we cant be hostage to our grief 
she said 
the families were to meet privately wednesday night and again 
thursday after a private memorial service 
hague a resident of las mesa nm said one item on the 
families agenda is a request that the navy to donate the ship for 
a museum 
we need to do something positive to help us deal with our 
grief this has been my therapy he said

president bush responding to criticism of his 
global warming policy told an international conference wednesday 
he has never considered research a substitute for action 
the presidents remarks at the close of the 18nation white 
house conference were warmly received by many of the same delegates 
who a day earlier criticized the administration for failing to deal 
directly with global warming 
we came here to find common ground and weve found common 
ground that research and action are inseparable padraig flynn 
environnment minister from ireland and an official of the european 
community told reporters 
bush opened the conference tuesday saying more research is 
needed before costly programs are set up to fight global warming 
but he closed the conference by challenging his critics many of 
them european delegates and environmentalists observing the 
conference over global warming 
he said the united states is leading the search for response 
strategies and working through the uncertainty of both the science 
and the economics of climate change 
but there is one area where we will allow for no uncertainty 
and that is our commitment to action to sound analysis and sound 
policies he said 
above all the climate change debate is not about research 
versus action for we have never considered research a substitute 
for action bush told the senior government officials from around 
the world 
to those who suggest were only trying to balance economic 
growth and environmental protection i say they miss the point 
bush said we are calling for an entirely new way of thinking to 
achieve both while compromising neither 
the twoday conference was marked by discord over whether there 
should be specific commitments to reduce socalled greenhouse 
pollutants especially carbon dioxide the united states maintained 
the conference was aimed at focusing on the need for additional 
research into global warming and its economic impact not on 
developing action plans 
but after bushs remarks many of the european delegates 
expressed hope that the us position emphasizing research had 
shifted closer to their own views that industrial nations along 
must reduce the manmade pollutants such as carbon dioxide which 
scientists fear are causing a warming of the earth 
hans alders the dutch environment minister and one of the 
strongest critics of the us policy said he was heartened by 
bushs closing remarks 
at the beginning there were remarks only about the need for 
more scientific research and economic knowledge said alders 
now you get the impression he is saying we need action now and we 
need more information and i agree with that 
rafe pomerance an environmentalist observing the conference for 
the world resources institute said the administration got a very 
strong message from the european governments 
senior administration officials called the twoday conference a 
success because it allowed a frank exchange of ideas on the 
scientific uncertainties about global warming and the question of 
economic cost of both action and inaction was discussed 
but disputes over the narrow focus of the conference agenda and 
other matters prevented agreement on a conference summary report 
and left a us proposal for an ambitious international research 
effort including creation of a special institute for global 
warming not even considered 
a draft of the us proposal was briefly circulated wednesday 
morning but then quickly withdrawn when it raised the ire of many 
of the delegates michael deland chairman of the presidents 
council on environmental quality and a conference cochairman said 
the document was distributed by mistake 
that was a complete misunderstanding said allan bromley 
the presidents science adviser and another conference cochairman 
but bromley prior to the conference had said the united states had 
hoped such a proposal would win the endorsement of the conference

general motors corp is expediting development 
of an electrically powered car in recognition of consumer demand 
for a cleaner environment chairman roger b smith said wednesday 
the nations largest automaker intends to be the first to 
massmarket the vehicle smith said in a speech to the national 
press club gm unveiled a prototype vehicle the impact in january 
he refused to say when or where the car would be built or to 
reveal technical information about the vehicle saying he did not 
want to tip off competitors in the 1970s gm announced it would 
produce a 1985model electric car but it dropped that project long 
before production 
smith said the goal is to manufacture a car that would match 
todays safety and performance standards without the air pollution 
of an internal combustion engine generation of the electricity of 
course would create other pollution if fossil fuels were used in 
the power plant 
we have set an aggressive schedule for ourselves in order to 
pull along the technological developments that we still need 
smith said 
still needed is a better battery and smith said that may 
require joint development by automakers utilities battery 
manufacturers and the federal government 
though obstacles remain when we look at the strict cleanair 
legislation thats now being proposed for many areas of the 
country were convinced that the impact has a bright future 
smith defended the automobile industrys environmental record 
the average vehicles weight has dropped by 27 percent aerodynamic 
efficiency has improved by onethird transmissions and air 
conditioning are more efficient engines are electronically 
controlled and burn less fuel while emitting 75 percent to 96 
percent less pollution than the cars of 1970 the year of the first 
earth day 
the truth is that no one understands the importance of the 
environment better than we smith said 
his remarks were sharply criticized by environmental groups 
for him to come here today and declare himself an 
environmentalist is the height of hypocrisy said bill magavern 
staff attorney for the us public interest research group at a 
news conference after smiths speech 
many of the improvements smith mentioned resulted from laws and 
regulations that the industry fought said robert dewey of the 
environmental action foundation 
the companys ceo says one thing and their lobbyists say 
another dewey said 
automakers lobbied against new tailpipe standards sought by 
environmentalists in a pending update of the clean air act the 
industry also is gearing up to fight a senate bill to boost cars 
minimum fuel efficiency from 275 miles per gallon to an average of 
40 mpg 
smith said we do oppose things that are not practical things 
that are not environmentally sound overregulation and things that 
do not add to the welfare of our people

a man sentenced to death 12 years ago as a 
teenager is to go to the electric chair on may 18 a judge decided 
after the us supreme court rejected his latest round of appeals 
dalton prejean a twotime killer who has been on death row 
longer than any inmate in louisiana is to die for the 1977 murder 
of state trooper donald cleveland 
prejeans case has been championed by death penalty opponents 
who say he should be spared because he is nearly retarded with an 
iq of 76 and because he was a teenager at the time the trooper 
was killed prejean is now 30 
the us supreme court granted a stay last november but on 
monday the high court rejected his most recent appeal state 
district judge hugh brunson set the execution date tuesday 
prejean has been in prison since the death of cleveland who had 
stopped an automobile in which prejean was a passenger because of a 
broken taillight prejean was 17 at the time and already had served 
time in a reform school for murdering a taxi driver when he was 14 
defense attorneys claim that prejean suffered mental retardation 
from beatings he received as a child they also said he feared for 
his life when cleveland stopped the auto 
prejean told the louisiana pardon board last november that he 
regretted shooting cleveland and that i cant give back a human 
life that was very valuable but to kill me will not solve the 
problem 
the board voted 32 to spare prejeans life but gov buddy 
roemer rejected the recommendation 
some people who served on the jury at prejeans 1978 trial said 
this week the execution should go on 
william sayre of monroe said he was galled by the numerous stays 
of execution granted prejean over the years 
we voted that he should die for what he did said sayre 
he shot that officer in cold blood 
several jurors said they didnt know during the trial that 
prejean had killed a taxi driver at age 14 he was released from a 
juvenile detention center six months before the trooper was killed 
eugene koontz of monroe another juror said it was unfair that 
the jury didnt have the information about the earlier crime 
its time for this to end said koontz

secretary of state james a baker iii appeared 
to welcome on wednesday reports that a proiranian group would free 
an american hostage but the white house rejected the groups 
demand that a senior us diplomat fly to damascus to take part 
diplomatic sources also said an american would be freed on 
friday in the syrian capital 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine which is 
believed to hold three of the eight american captives demanded 
that assistant secretary of state john kelly hurry to damascus to 
coordinate some final steps to guarantee success within 48 hours 
but baker said at the present time the middle east is not on 
his agenda 
and presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said we 
would not anticipate him becoming involved in hostage release in 
any way 
fitzwater said that kelley was in bonn west germany on other 
business hes expected to return to the united states in a day or 
two 
kelly who heads the bureau of near east and south asian 
affairs is attending a conference of us ambassadors in bonn he 
is a former ambassador to lebanon where all eight americans are 
believed to be held 
of course were always hopeful baker said while reiterating 
a longstanding us demand that all eight americans held in lebanon 
be released unconditionally 
at the white house fitzwater said of the reports weve had 
this happen before weve gone right up to the moment of supposed 
release and it never happened so weve long since learned not to 
be too optimistic 
like fitzwater baker said weve seen reports like this 
before 
in this case he added i dont want to say anything that 
might adversely affect any chances there are for release of any 
hostages 
a us official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
when we see this hostage walk out well believe it 
the islamic jihad did not say which of the three americans it is 
holding would be freed its statement was accompanied by an instant 
photograph of jesse turner of boise idaho 
the group also is believed to hold alann steen and robert 
polhill all were abducted from the grounds of beirut university 
campus on jan 24 1987 they are among 18 westerners including 
the eight americans believed held by proiranian groups in lebanon 
earlier wednesday david denny a state department spokesman 
called the unconditional release of all hostages in lebanon an 
important humanitarian issue he said he could not predict any 
release at this point and said nothing would be served by 
speculation 
the spokesman added we would of course welcome the release 
of any hostage as we continue to urge the release of all of them 
us officials in making statements about the hostage situation 
usually rule out any us negotiations with the abductors for 
release of their captives baker and denny made no reference to 
this point in their remarks 
meanwhile a senior us diplomat said the bush administration 
would respond to positive actions by iran regarding release of 
the hostages but would not reward the tehran government for using 
its influence to free the captives 
iran is understood to have considerable influence with the 
islamic jihad 
we are prepared to deal with the islamic republic without 
nostalgia for the past said deputy assistant secretary of state 
edward gnehm we remain willing to talk directly to authorized 
iranian government representatives he said 
gnehm did not refer to the reports about a possible hostage 
release 
the united states gnehm said at a seminar on the persian gulf 
believes iran has significant influence over the hostage holders 
and could do much more than the recent statements by iranian 
officials regarding the need to free the hostages were looking 
for actions not words he said

the bush administration is seeking to defeat 
proposed legislation that would impose economic sanctions against 
iraq a top state department official said wednesday 
nonetheless the united states has real doubts about recent 
iraqi actions including alleged attempts to buy nuclear bomb 
detonators and to assassinate government opponents said deputy 
assistant secretary of state edward gnehm 
we would like iraq to take action to allay our concerns 
gnehm said at a seminar on the persian gulf 
usiraqi relations have been strained in recent weeks by a 
series of events among them a warning by iraqi president saddam 
hussein that his country would use chemical weapons against israel 
if attacked the administration has criticized saddam for making 
inflammatory statements 
anger at iraq prompted calls in congress for economic sanctions 
rep howard berman dcalif is about to introduce a bill denying 
iraq any economic and military assistance the draft legislation 
has drawn considerable support from house democrats but several 
leading senate republicans have voiced reservations and suggested 
the administration talk to saddam but not threaten him 
gnehm said the administrations policy on sanctions is to 
oppose them he added our objective will be to see that it 
the bill doesnt pass the administration is particularly 
opposed to a provision in the draft bill that would ban credits and 
loans by the governments exportimport bank for iraqi agriculture 
he said 
the administration is also concerned about a resolution expected 
to be adopted thursday by a house subcommittee condemning human 
rights violations in iraq the measure was prompted by the hanging 
last month of an iranianborn british journalist accused of spying 
for israel and the united states 
last fall the united states and iraq held highlevel talks to 
discuss expanding and improving their ties which have been 
strained at times since their renewal in 1984 after a 15year 
break since then a series of disappointments have raised real 
doubts in our mind about iraqi intentions gnehm said 
in particular he cited last months exposure of an iraqi ring 
allegedly trying to smuggle nuclear triggers for atomic bombs an 
alleged plot by an iraqi diplomat at the united nations to kill two 
political opponents and saddams threat to israel 
iraq is an important country with an important role to play 
in the region gnehm said but they cannot flout our laws 
without us reassessing our relationship 
he said the united states is improving its methods for tracking 
countries that violate us exportcontrol laws including allies 
like israel and egypt who have also been accused of trying to 
smuggle devices to enhance their nuclear and ballistic missile 
capabilities

the medical director for planned parenthoods 
state chapter said wednesday he resigned the post because a 
prochoice amendment to the massachusetts constitution goes too 
far 
dr stanton goldstein said he left the job because he could not 
join the group in backing abortion rights at any time in cases of 
rape or incest or to protect the life and health of the mother 
i cannot support an amendment that legalizes destructive 
procedures of a healthy fetus in the third trimester he said 
i was in an administrative role in an organization that stood for 
something politically that i could not agree with 
goldstein stepped down tuesday but will remain a staff doctor 
with the prochoice organizations two massachusetts clinics whose 
administration he had overseen during the past five years 
the longtime prochoice activist said he believed many people 
would find the proposed amendment broader than acceptable 
it goes too far for me he said i as a physician believe 
that a destructive procedure in the third trimester is either 
unethical or immoral and therefore i am entering the public 
debate 
nicki nichols gamble executive director of the state office of 
planned parenthood said she expected debate and disagreement but 
regards the proposal as a fairly moderate one that captures the 
status quo 
she said the organization would stand behind the proposed 
amendment which must be approved by a constitutional convention 
and could go before voters in 1992 
the language was adopted last september after months of 
discussion among members of a coalition for choice which 
included planned parenthood the league of women voters the civil 
liberties union and the national organization for women 
coalition members initially filed seven different versions of 
the amendment proposal some more and some less restrictive a 
compromise was reached after extensive polling to test public 
support for each version 
susan newsom associate director of planned parenthood said the 
language is not the first choice for a lot of people but she 
said the number of abortions performed after the second trimester 
was tiny 
of 38200 abortions performed in the state in 1986 nine were 
late trimester abortions according to the most recent figures by 
the state department of public health 
goldstein however put a different spin on the historically low 
figure 
i have several questions he said if the number of 
abortions performed after the second trimester is so tiny then 
why are we legislating for it is it so tiny because it has not 
been legal up till now

the us navy suffered 1596 accidents 
involving ships submarines and aircraft in the 1980s and nearly 
twothirds of them were not publicly reported according to 
greenpeace usa 
the environmental advocacy group said its study of previously 
unreleased navy records showed that 1989 was ironically one of 
the navys safest years despite the april explosion which killed 47 
sailors aboard the battleship uss iowa and several other 
headlineprovoking accidents in the wake of that tragedy 
greenpeace citing data obtained from the us navy safety 
center under the freedom of information act said the navy 
registered 106 accidents last year the fewest of any year in the 
decade except 1988 when there were 83 the most 248 occurred in 
1981 it said 
the navy did not dispute the figures though a statement from 
cmdr mark baker chief of the navy information office put the 
count of major accidents last year at 69 by major he 
referred to what the navy calls class a accidents involving loss 
of life or property damage exceeding 1 million 
the greenpeace figures according to author joshua handler 
counted class b accidents as well property loss exceeding 
200000 and a few significant class c accidents involving 
property damage of under 200000 
the navy has been unrelenting in its pursuit of safety and 
this has resulted in continued improvement during the decade of the 
80s said baker our goal continues to be to make the navy as 
safe as possible 
a string of accidents last year led the navy to take the 
unprecedented step of ordering a twoday freeze of its operations 
so officers and sailors could concentrate on safety reviews 
inspections and lectures 
the greenpeace report released wednesday said the iowa 
explosion and the sinking of a soviet mikeclass nuclear submarine 
earlier in april made naval accidents a running news story in 1989 
ensuring press coverage of many of those which followed but 991 
us naval accidents went unreported by the news media in the 
1980s almost twothirds of the total for the decade it said 
government secrecy still inhibits a full accounting of the 
naval accident record the report said information is still 
too sketchy to determine the dangers accidents posed to nuclear 
weapons or reactors particularly since direct data about accident 
trends for us naval nuclear weapons and reactors continues to be 
kept secret 
still the us navy provides more information that any other 
country on its accident record greenpeace said despite unusual 
soviet candor over the fire which resulted in the loss of 42 
sailors and their mikeclass sub in the norweigian sea the report 
said the soviet record on disclosure is still horrendous 
greenpeace estimated that the worlds five nuclear navies 
including great britain france and china together suffered 3200 
accidents in the 1980s or almost one a day the guess was based on 
the number of us accidents 1596 compared to the fleet sizes of 
the other nations 
it said about half the 99 ships and submarines involved in 
documented accidents last year were nuclear powered and 
similarly about half were capable of carrying nuclear weapons 
american vessels accounted for 78 percent of the documented 
episodes soviet ships and submarines were involved in 8 percent of 
those cases while those from great britain accounted for 7 percent 
the report while mentioning fatalities caused by accidents 
previously reported did not mention overall death tolls 
but it did say 
the sinking of the soviet mikeclass sub raised the total 
number of nuclear warheads on the ocean floor from 48 to 50 with 
43 of those from the soviet union and 7 from the united states it 
also raised the number of sunken naval nuclear reactors from 7 to 
8 with 5 of those from the soviet union and three from the united 
states 
collisions fires and explosions accounted for almost half of 
the 439 accidents involving us surface ships in the 1980s with 
the largest portion occurring in the atlantic ocean 
forty percent of the us naval accidents during the decade 
involved submarines

another convoy left for the war zone in 
northern ethiopia with emergency supplies for thousands of people 
threatened with famine a relief worker said wednesday 
it was the second such convoy heading to tigre province in two 
days 
eighteen trucks carrying eight tons each left dessie the 
capital of wollo province in the morning for mekelle capital of 
neighboring tigre province said ahmed baghet the deputy director 
of the catholic relief services in ethiopia 
another convoy of 55 trucks which left dessie on monday was 
reportedly unloading in mekelle and was expected back in dessie on 
thursday baghet said in a telephone interview from nairobi 
those in mekelle are among up to an estimated 6 million people 
threatened with famine mostly in tigre and the northern province 
of eritrea 
the rebel tigre peoples liberation front has controlled mekelle 
and the entire tigre province since forcing government troops to 
withdraw in february 1989 
mekelle is 170 miles north of dessie and 320 miles north of 
ethiopias capital addis ababa 
a consortium of three ethiopian churches recently began 
delivering emergency food to northern wollo and tigre after the 
government and the rebels agreed on safe passage for relief convoys 
behind the battle lines 
most of the trucks used in the operation however belong to the 
usbased catholic relief services and the lutheran world 
federation 
the emergency food is donated by the united states and other 
western aid agencies 
mondays convoy which baghet said passed through the war zone 
without incident delivered the first emergency supplies to mekelle 
since the rebel takeover 
bhaget said the convoy was not in touch with addis ababa or 
dessie 
but we heard from another truck that ours were unloading and 
we consider the information reliable yes report it he said 
recently the tigreans accused relief officials of citing bad 
road conditions to delay the distribution of food in northern 
wollo contested by the government and the rebels and in tigre 
bhaghet said the road conditions prevented trucks from using 
trailers and forced them to carry half their maximum load 
the tigreans took up arms in 1975 seeking president mengistu 
haile mariams overthrow and the establishment of a government 
patterned after that of albania the last of the hardline marxist 
states in eastern europe 
the government is battling a larger rebel group the eritrean 
peoples liberation front in northern province of eritrea 
the eritreans captured the red sea port of massawa in an 
offensive in february forcing donors to divert all emergency 
supplies to assab port also on the red sea but much farther south 
the eritreans said in a clandestine radio broadcast monday they 
had repaired damage caused to the port in the fighting and appealed 
to international donors to resume emergency shipments through the 
port for distribution in eritrea and northern tigre 
massawa is ethiopias only deep sea port and the united nations 
had hoped to ship through the harbor 11 million tons of emergency 
food to those threatened with famine 
the rebels from eritrea a former italian colony on the red sea 
have fought the government since ethiopia incorporated it as a 
province in 1962

although american officials are calling the 
twoday white house conference on global warming a success it did 
not occur without some embarrassing glitches 
a copy of a white house talking points document on the 
conference made its way to some of the environmental activists 
monitoring the sessions they quickly provided copies to reporters 
and charged the white house was trying to put a false spin on 
the global warming issue 
the guidelines presumably for administration officials 
attending the conference included a section on debates to 
avoid 
it was not the first embarrassment for conference organizers 
on the opening day the soviet union was omitted from the list 
of participants to the 18nation conference which was held at a 
downtown hotel a few blocks from the white house 
a soviet official sought out epa administrator william reilly 
and wanted to know if it was an intentional slight he was told 
according to one conference organizer it certainly was not the 
soviet union in addition to being a superpower also is one of the 
biggest producers of global warming pollutants 
the talking points document however caused the biggest stir 
when it surfaced wednesday 
it suggested us officials not talk about whether there is too 
much warming of the earth because in the eyes of the public we 
will lose this debate instead officials were advised to raise 
the many uncertainties of the issue 
other things not to do according to the white house guidelines 
dont get into an advocacy position of the merits of the 
various policy proposals 
dont use specific numbers degrees dollars rates etc 
when discussing how the conference is accelerating the 
international discussion and understanding of these issues 
finally dont let reporters position this conference as an 
attempt to delay serious decisions on this issue 
yet much of the twoday conference focused on just such 
criticism as european delegates chastized the bush administration 
for emphasizing research and not enough at the expense of 
strategies to curb global warming 
it wasnt clear who drew up the talking points although 
adminstration officials said they were authentic 
i personally did not review the document and i certainly 
didnt authorize it said michael deland the presidents 
chairman of the council on environmental quality and a conference 
cochairman 
reilly said he frequently talks about many of the forbidden 
subjects outlined in the dont section 
and on wednesday morning an unnamed staffer mistakenly 
according to conference organizers distributed a detailed us 
proposal for a broadranging research initiative to conference 
delegates 
it was circulated inadvertently said deland he said the 
staffer actually should have distributed copies of summary reports 
from the various working sessions that had been underway 
but enough of the european delegates saw the document before it 
was withdrawn to cause another stir the europeans already upset 
because they believed they did not have opportunities to present 
their views in public sessions saw it as another effort to impose 
an american outlook on the conference 
i challenged the status and nature of the document said 
padraig flynn environnment minister from ireland and an official 
of the european community and it was quickly and effectively 
rubbished by william reilly 
it was a complete misunderstanding said allan bromley the 
presidents science adviser and a conference cochairman

bulldozers guarded 
by israeli soldiers leveled an orange grove wednesday to ready a 
new jewish settlement for construction only a short distance from a 
crowded palestinian refugee camp 
in jerusalem a group of jewish settlers who moved into the old 
walled citys christian quarter ignored a court order to leave 
the new settlement activity in gaza drew a protest from soviet 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfilyev he told reporters in 
moscow it showed some circles in israel continue to deliberately 
raise obstacles to a peaceful settlement in the middle east 
us officials have also called the construction of israeli 
settlements a threat to peace efforts they have conditioned a 400 
million housing loan for immigrants on assurances soviet jews will 
not be settled in occupied areas 
in dugit armed jewish settlers from a nearby settlement watched 
as the bulldozers smoothed out sand dunes and uprooted orange trees 
for the trailertype homes of 40 israeli families who plan to move 
in by the summer 
settlers said the orange trees were on stateowned land 
allocated to dugit but the trees were apparently cultivated by 
gazan arabs 
the prefabricated housing is expected to arrive soon according 
to arab workers who operated the earthmoving equipment 
dugits future residents plan a tourist beach and yacht club on 
the beachfront about a mile from their homes the site replaces 
another nearby that military officials rejected 
these people want to bring their yachts build a marina 
attract tourists said datia hershkowitz a settlement activist 
in gaza 
the move was delayed when military officials designated the 
original site the prettiest beach in gaza too close to a 
palestinian refugee camp for proper security she added 
the shati refugee camp a beachside shantytown of 41000 
palestinians is only two miles from the dugit site 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said 
sunday when israel tv reported the final permits had been granted 
for dugit that it was one of eight settlements agreed to by 
shamirs likud and the centerleft labor party when they formed a 
government in 1988 
ahimeir said it was therefore wrong to consider dugits 
establishment part of a new policy 
three settlements were built after the coalition government came 
to power but former defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor 
postponed the groundbreaking of the other five 
leftist parliament member dedi zucker said this week that in 
addition to agreedupon settlement plans the government recently 
authorized construction of jewish housing in the west bank town of 
nablus and expansion of a settlement near hebron 
the daily maariv newspaper said wednesday that shamir aide 
michael dekel had approved a request by settlers to expand kfar 
adumim and in effect to open a new settlement in the west bank 
the fresh settlement activity prompted speculation that shamirs 
caretaker government was trying to accelerate the building effort 
since labor left the government march 13 
shamir aide avi pazner on wednesday denied that shamir knew in 
advance about the plans of more than 150 jewish settlers to 
establish themselves in jerusalems arab christian quarter 
pazner also rejected a charge by leftwing lawmaker yossi sarid 
that shamir had ordered the police not to evacuate the settlers 
when a judge upheld an eviction order tuesday 
the settlers in jerusalem ignored a courtordered deadline for 
them to leave contending the law gives them 21 days to appeal 
as the 9 am deadline expired a dozen paramilitary police 
relaxed outside the four stone buildings that are owned by the 
greek orthodox patriarchate the church maintains that a tenant 
illegally sold the rights to the building to the jews 
david bason a lawyer for the greek orthodox church said the 
order required the settlers to leave immediately and threatened to 
take legal action against the police unless they acted to enforce 
the court order 
the problem is the police are very lazy they want us to make 
the eviction said bason an israeli lawyer 
police spokesman uzi sandori could not be reached for immediate 
comment on whether police would evict the settlers 
the jews move into the 72room complex a week ago set off angry 
protests by palestinians and church officials the move upset a 
delicate balance in which christians moslems and jews live in 
jealously guarded separate quarters 
the dispute has political overtones since the old city is part 
of the land captured from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
israel has annexed the area into its capital but most other 
countries including the united states do not recognize the action

a former official in philippine president 
corazon aquinos government testified wednesday that he gave her a 
package of diamonds found in the official residence of her deposed 
predecessor ferdinand e marcos 
the disclosure came as imelda marcos attorney questioned 
potenciano roque a us government witness called to describe the 
discovery of financial records at the marcos residence in manila 
after she and her husband fled the country in february 1986 
mrs marcos is on trial in us district court on charges of 
using embezzled money to buy new york properties and finance a 
lavish lifestyle 
roque was an aide to joker arroyo a manila civil rights lawyer 
and mrs aquinos former personal secretary from 1986 until last 
year 
the diamonds suddenly came up after a morning of testimony about 
documents prosecutors say will help show that the marcoses diverted 
money to swiss bank accounts and other personal uses 
did you ever give mrs aquino a package of diamonds mrs 
marcos attorney gerald spence asked roque 
after a pause roque replied yes 
how many diamonds asked spence 
six to ten 
did you take a receipt for them the attorney said 
no roque said 
roque didnt tell the jury where he found the diamonds but 
spence said in a conference away from the jury that the witness 
discovered the packet among documents at malacanang palace spence 
was concerned that if he raised that matter in front of jurors it 
could open the door for prosecutors to introduce evidence about 
other jewels 
under questioning by assistant us attorney charles labella 
roque testified that he had given eight to ten diamonds in a 
small plastic packet to mrs aquino in her office and that she had 
instructed her daughter corazon cruz who is also her personal 
secretary to call the central bank 
roque gave no other details about the incident 
however documents newly admitted into evidence refer to jewelry 
purchased by mrs marcos in new york 
spence said tuesday that he believed a government witness then 
on the stand would have testified had she been asked by 
prosecutors that jewelry had been taken from the palace after the 
marcoses left 
and i think we can show that jewelry has since been identified 
and seen on both mrs aquino and relatives he said 
the witness angelita reyes had told how she helped gather 
documents at the palace and later turned them over to the 
presidents commission on good government which aquino created to 
try to recover money allegedly stolen by the marcoses 
judge john f keenan said that since us prosecutors had 
indicated they didnt plan to introduce other evidence concerning 
jewelry he saw no reason to hold reyes for further testimony 
mrs aquinos government is trying to recover millions of 
dollars the marcoses allegedly stole from their countrys treasury 
during 20 years in power

chinese dissident leader chai ling said wednesday 
that resistance to chinas communist rulers is growing in her 
homeland and she predicted it will lead to the fall of the 
hardline leadership

two weeks ago chai held a placard with messages written to chinas 
leaders by opponents 
not even his own relatives will help him said the message 
to prime minister li peng 
chai was a leader of last springs prodemocracy movement in 
china which was crushed by a military crackdown launched the night 
of june 3 after the crackdown she spent 10 months on the run in 
china chai and her husband feng congde reached france this month 
an underground movement against the beijing government is 
gaining strength in china chai told reporters 
even before we left tiananmen square we thought there might 
be a period of terror she said some groups had already formed 
before the massacre we have been helped not by one group but by 
several groups that are everywhere and growing stronger 
she gave no details of how she escaped china but said those who 
helped her included soldiers and communist party members

press gallery and smiled as the news conference began 
a badge of the goddess of democracy the statue raised by the 
demonstrators in beijing last year was pinned to her red sweater

felt in beijing have spread throughout the country chai said 
resistance has taken many forms passive forms like silence 
but more active forms also people were very active in helping us

when soldiers shot their way into central beijing and drove student 
protesters from the citys tiananmen square hundreds of people

the united states will let americans travel to libya 
to help wipe out a deadly parasite that threatens africas 
livestock and wildlife un officials said wednesday 
in january president bush renewed sanctions against libya 
including a ban on american travel the measures date back to 
former president ronald reagan who accused libyas leader col 
moammar gadhafi of sponsoring terrorism 
earlier this year us officials denied requests by the united 
nations food and agriculture organization for permission to send 
american experts to libya and help rid the north african country of 
the screwworm fly 
however in march bush allowed us officials to sell libya 
sterile screwworms in an attempt to wipe out the parasite 
henryk jasiorowski fao assistant director general said the 
united states also has agreed to allow us technicians employed by 
international organizations to travel to libya but only on 
international passports 
the fly settles in wounds or tick bites and in a few days can 
kill its animal hosts by eating away at tissues humans with flesh 
wounds can also invite infestation it was first sighted in 
northern africa in july 1988 
another fao official bjorn sigurbjornsson said an american 
entomologist employed by the fao and the international atomic 
energy agency is working in libya this month 
this is very important because the knowhow is american 
jasiorowski said at a news briefing about the pest 
the united states became an expert on the pest after a 
devastating infestation of livestock in the american southwest 
entomologists developed a patented way of irradiating the flies to 
make them sterile and the parasite was wiped out in the united 
states by 1982 
under the strategy tens of millions of flies are sterilized at 
a facility in mexico then released from airplanes above an 
infested area matings yield no offspring and the insect dies out 
international experts have devised an 85 million twoyear plan 
that calls for the release of treated flies in libya starting in 
1991 a trial program is to begin this summer 
confirmed sightings of the pest have been limited to a swath 
across northern libya but experts say the infestation could 
spread particularly vulnerable they say are libyas neighbors 
tunisia and egypt 
in egypt the fly could move quickly down the nile river valley 
into central africa threatening livestock as well as exotic 
wildlife in central africa the experts said southern europe is 
also considered at risk 
sigurbjornsson said he thought egypt and tunisia helped persuade 
the united states to allow americans into libya us officials 
have traveled to both tunisia and egypt to aid inspection there he 
said 
after talks earlier this year washington was persuaded also to 
allow the american technology to be used in libya against the 
screwworm fly us officials only agreed after receiving 
assurances no resources would be given directly to the libyan 
government 
experts say libyan inspection has so far helped prevent the pest 
from spreading beyond its present area two relatively miled 
winters have also helped contain the fly 
although fao officials praised us collaboration in the effort 
sources have said the timetable for fullscale eradication could 
have been much sooner if it werent for obstacles posed by the us 
sanctions 
the flys appearance in libya was its debut outside the western 
hemisphere it was believed to have entered libya on an infected 
animal probably from latin america

britain said wednesday it is convinced that iraq 
was trying to build a giant gun but that customs officers 
frustrated the project by seizing eight steel tubes last week 
let me make it absolutely clear that the gun itself cannot be 
in operation without all its parts and it is a great success on 
the behalf of this country to have been able to prevent that 
happening trade and industry secretary nicholas ridley told the 
house of commons 
weapons experts have said a gun on the scale of the seized parts 
131 feet long with a bore of 39 inches would have the potential 
to lob nuclear or chemical warheads hundreds of miles or even 
boost rockets into orbit 
the iraqi government and the manufacturer sheffield 
forgemasters have insisted the tubes were designed for a 
petrochemical plant 
the iraqi embassy in london and forgemasters said they had no 
comment on the governments statement wednesday 
ridley said the government believed that iraqs gun project 
followed the designs of gerald bull a canadianborn us 
ballistics expert who was murdered in brussels on march 22 
the financial times reported wednesday that the british and 
belgian governments have evidence that a belgian defense company 
prb was contracted by iraq to help produce a boosterassisted 
shell for the same type of gun prb is owned by the british 
munitions company astra holdings 
astra holdings issued a statement wednesday night saying that 
after it acquired prb last sept 11 it discovered a contract for 
unusual types of gun propellant for very large guns 
although all normal export documentation was in place and 
appeared correct astra immediately reported the matter to her 
majestys government the contract is no longer in force the 
statement said 
astra holdings did not say whether the propellant had been 
shipped to iraq 
ridley confirmed that his own department had cleared the 
production of the tubes two years ago but said his agency had no 
knowledge the goods were designed to form part of a gun until a 
few days ago 
the government is entirely satisfied that these tubes form 
part of a gun and that the customs action was correct he said 
ridleys statement was the first cabinetlevel statement that 
the tubing had military potential 
during her visit to bermuda to meet with president bush last 
weekend prime minister margaret thatcher said more information was 
needed to determine the purpose of the tubes 
gordon brown of the opposition labor party contended the 
government had been deceived and duped on a grand scale 
this government allowed through an order which could have made 
it possible for iraq to operate a weapon whose use could affect 
regional and even world stability brown said 
the customs and excise office seized the tubes on the docks at 
middlesbrough last thursday after a ministry of defense expert 
concluded they could be used as a gun barrel 
sheffield forgemasters said it had already shipped 44 sections 
of tubing to iraq 
but ridley said wednesday i understand that it will not be 
possible to build a complete fullsize gun from parts that have 
been supplied from britain 
ridley said his department was contacted in 1988 by sheffield 
forgemasters asking whether licenses were required for export of 
tubes to iraq for use in the polymerization of polyethylene 
the department was also contacted by walter somers ltd of 
birmingham about a separate order of metal tubes from bulls 
belgian company space research corp 
ridley said the export licenses wouldnt have been granted if 
his department had known at the time that the tubes were designed 
for use in a giant gun 
britain banned arms shipments to iran and iraq when the two 
countries were at war and the ban remains in effect 
western fears abut iraqi arms programs have intensified in 
recent weeks on march 28 british customs officials seized 
usmade parts for atomic bomb triggers that were bound for iraq 
iraq has denied seeking a nuclear capability but has confirmed 
its arsenal includes chemical weapons 
iraqi president saddam hussein recently threatened to use 
missiles armed with chemical weapons against israel if israeli 
forces attacked his country

tugboats on wednesday began towing the 
burnedout hulk of the scandinavian star ferry to denmark where it 
will be examined to see if a fire that killed an estimated 161 
people was deliberately set 
two tugboats towed the disabled 20yearold ferry from the west 
coast port of lysekil to copenhagen 
earlier wednesday a commission of government officials from 
norway sweden and denmark boarded the ferry for the first time to 
evaluate the ships safety standards 
the nordic commission is expected to recommend new safety 
standards for ferries traveling in scandinavian waters 
a separate marine inquiry in copenhagen which this week heard 
testimony from 24 witnesses to the disaster exposed a series of 
safety omissions and blunders that may have contributed to the high 
death toll 
police in oslo norway estimated 161 people died in the april 7 
fire but said the figure was not final because it was still 
uncertain how many passengers boarded the ferry the danishowned 
vessel was on an overnight run from oslo to frederikshavn denmark

parliament refused wednesday to allow prosecution 
of two embattled anticorruption investigators accused of attacking 
communist party privilege in a witchhunt 
the supreme soviets decision not to lift legislative immunity 
from prosecutors telman gdlyan and nikolai ivanov quieted at least 
temporarily a dispute that had aroused the political ire of many 
soviets 
tens of thousands of people rallied in moscow and leningrad on 
tuesday in support of the two demonstrators in leningrad had urged 
a strike if they lost their immunity 
even in the era of glasnost when virtually any political topic 
is open for debate few political issues have aroused such intense 
interest the campaign to protect gdlyan and ivanov has encompassed 
soviet frustration with communist party privilege 
the prosecutors and their supporters say officials have tried to 
silence them to keep the investigation from stretching to politburo 
officials opponents say the two have succumbed to the illegal 
means that were a trademark of the authorities they are pursuing 
gdlyan and ivanov who did not attend the legislative session 
were warned if they continue activity leading to the 
destabilization of the situation in the country the supreme soviet 
will move to lift parliamentary immunity from them the tass news 
agency said 
tass did not report the vote total but the evening tv news 
program vremya showed a picture of the supreme soviets vote 
tally board indicating the measure passed 27584 
the parliament sanctioned an earlier decision to fire them from 
the soviet prosecutors office but also called for the dismissal 
of unidentified officials who failed to supervise their work 
it said the prosecutors office the interior ministry the kgb 
and the supreme court should hold accountable those senior 
officials whose activities caused especially sharp public anxiety 
the officials were not identified but among those subject to 
criticism during the sharp twoday debate on the prosecutors 
activities was soviet prosecutor general alexander sukharev 
demonstrators who rallied near the kremlin on tuesday carried 
signs reading gdlyan and ivanov are our conscience and the 
fate of gdlyan and ivanov is the fate of democracy protect them 
a legislative committee found no grounds to charges by the pair 
that conservative politburo member yegor k ligachev was linked to 
the corruption they were probing or that president mikhail s 
gorbachev was turning a blind eye to the mafia 
the supreme soviet condemned what it called unfounded 
statements which discredit the supreme soviet individual 
peoples deputies and officials 
sukharev accused the two of holding 50 people illegally for 
periods of up to several years they also have been accused of 
threatening detainees and their families in order to extract 
statements 
gdlyan and ivanov were discharged from the communist party on 
feb 21 they rode their populist anticorruption campaign to 
election to the national congress of peoples deputies last march 
the two gained fame uncovering a trail of bribery and corruption 
among top communist party officials in the central asian republic 
uzbekistan that led to the conviction of former president leonid i 
brezhnevs soninlaw in 1988 yuri d churbanov was sentenced to 
12 years in a labor camp

nations will have to impose stronger controls on 
ozonedestroying chemicals if the atmosphere is to be made safe for 
ozone again within the next century a new study suggests 
even if all emissions were stopped in the year 2000 levels of 
ozonedepleting chlorine in the atmosphere would not drop to 
relatively benign levels until about the year 2070 the study says 
the work is presented in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by michael prather and robert watson of the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
scientists are concerned about destruction of ozone at high 
altitudes because that ozone layer shields earth from solar rays 
that can cause skin cancer 
the united states and other nations have signed a 1987 
agreement called the montreal protocol in which they pledged to 
cut production of some ozonedestroying chemicals in half by the 
end of this decade 
since then representatives of 81 countries have called for an 
end to production and use of ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbons 
by the year 2000 
the new study considered not only the compounds covered by the 
montreal protocol but also other ozonedepleting compounds 
including carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform it estimated 
how long it would take under various degrees of regulation of the 
compounds to lower the atmospheric concentration of chlorine from 
more than 3 parts per billion today to 2 parts per billion 
the lower figure was the concentration in the late 1970s when 
scientists first noticed the ozone hole an area over 
antarctica in which a substantial amount of ozone disappears every 
year 
the study found that if emissions were cut to half of their 1985 
levels at the end of the year 2000 atmospheric chlorine 
concentrations would dip only slightly from a starting level of 
just under 5 parts per billion and then rise above 53 parts per 
billion by the year 2100 
if emissions were eliminated in the year 2000 chlorine 
concentrations would reach the 2 parts per billion target in the 
year 2073 researchers said but the target might be difficult or 
impossible to reach by the year 2100 if chlorinebearing 
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons were used indefinitely 
researchers said 
similarly a 90 percent reduction in emissions in the year 2000 
would delay reaching the target until 2175 researchers said 
guy brasseur director of the atmospheric chemistry division at 
the national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo 
called the study important 
it shows he says that at the present time we havent solved 
the problem

sen edward m kennedy on wednesday called for 
approval of a major civil rights bill even if it means overriding a 
presidential veto and blamed the administration for being more 
willing to compromise than to lead 
often as in the current civil rights debate the 
administration waits on the sidelines until its position becomes 
untenable in congress the massachusetts democrat said then it 
rushes onto the playing field with a halfhearted alternative 
he was scornful of a bush administration version of the civil 
rights bill on a surprisingly large number of significant 
issues this administration has shown a willingness to compromise 
but a reluctance to lead kennedy said 
what we expect and need instead is a wholehearted commitment 
to civil rights kennedy said in remarks prepared for delivery to 
a dinner in honor of the 50th anniversary of the naacp legal 
defense and educational fund inc 
kennedy is chief among 40 senate cosponsors of a bill that 
would reverse six supreme court rulings last year that civil rights 
forces call a severe setback provisions range from banning racial 
harrassment in the workplace to requiring employers to provide 
proof if they claim lopsided hiring practices are a business 
necessity 
attorney general dick thornburgh said recently the measure would 
usher in hiring quotas and added that he and other top 
administration officials would urge a veto if the bill reached 
president bushs desk 
kennedy said that martin luther king eloquently taught us 
acceptance of injustice is unacceptable now is always that time 
for civil rights 
and if that means overriding president bushs veto of the 
civil rights act of 1990 i say so be it america is not america 
if we pay lip service to liberty and close our eyes to clear 
injustice 
the administration is pushing for an alternative bill that would 
overturn two of the six supreme court decisions kennedy scoffed at 
that approach

the soviet union shut off oil supplies to 
lithuanias only refinery wednesday as moscow began to impose 
mikhail s gorbachevs threatened economic embargo on the breakaway 
baltic republic lithuanian officials said 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said the move 
represented economic coercion and economic warfare against a 
neighboring country 
truly this is recognition of the independence of lithuania 
he said it is hard to imagine why the people of lithuania 
are being punished what was their crime 
lithuanian premier kazimiera prunskiene went to olso norway on 
a threeday mission seeking alternative oil supplies 
the action was one of the toughest in soviet president 
gorbachevs effort to make lithuania rethink its march 11 
declaration of independence lithuania forcibly annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 is entirely dependent on moscow for its oil 
and gas which it receives at subsidized prices 
lithuanian officials estimated this week that the republic of 
38 million people has enough oil to last six weeks to three months 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said action 
by moscow against lithuania could doom commercial relations between 
the soviet union and the united states 
he said its very difficult to see some of the commercial 
aspects of our relationship surviving the use of force or 
coercion against lithuania 
president bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said we are 
looking into reports of the oil cutoff 
he also said bush received a private letter from landsbergis 
the president has not seen it yet but he will we wont comment 
on the content 
the oil turnoff came hours after soviet deputy oil and gas 
minister aklim mukhamedzyanov told the tass news agency reports of 
an energy cutoff are completely groundless and that the 
council of ministers issued no instructions to stop the flow 
the flow of crude oil to mazhiekiai was cut off at 
approximately 930 pm 230 pm edt said aidas palubinskas 
a spokesman for lithuanias supreme council legislature 
lithuanian gas officials said there was no disruption in natural 
gas and the supply of soviet gas would continue uninterrupted at 
least until morning 
reading an official government statement palubinskas said 
mazhiekiai refinery director bronius vainoras confirmed the single 
pipeline feeding the plant from the russian city of polotsk had 
been shut down 
the statement said a message read earlier by telephone to 
vainoras stated in accordance with the resolution of the council 
of ministers we are halting pumping of crude oil to your 
refinery 
all oil stopped moving through the pipeline about an hour after 
the shutdown said lithuanian supreme council spokeswoman loretta 
stanulis she quoted vainoras as saying the plant would continue 
operating on reserves for now 
landsbergis told a news conference earlier wednesday that an 
economic embargo would resemble an angry man beating himself 
he said it would have an impact on latvia estonia and the 
kaliningrad region of russia eduardas potasinskas of lithuanian tv 
reported 
gorbachev said last friday that unless lithuania rescinded 
several laws supporting the declaration of independence he would 
impose an embargo on key supplies 
he called unconstitutional lithuanias moves to curtail the 
spring draft into the soviet army give residents lithuanian 
identity cards and seize the property of the communist party on 
lithuanian territory 
the kremlin says lithuanian independence can be discussed only 
within the framework of the soviet constitution a law passed april 
4 would let republics secede if twothirds of their residents 
approve secession in a referendum and sets a maximum waiting 
period of five years 
gorbachev did not spell out what materials would be cut off 
saying only they would be those goods the soviet union sells abroad 
for hard currency meaning oil and natural gas 
petroleum products are the soviet unions most profitable export 
the mazhiekiai refinery in northwestern lithuania refines about 
12 million tons of petroleum products a year but lithuania uses 
about a quarter of the output journalists quoted government 
officials as saying 
sales of gasoline in lithuania tripled this week as motorists 
reacted to gorbachevs threat with panicbuying said lithuanian 
energy minister leonas asmantas 
he reported tuesday receiving unofficial information that crude 
oil supplies and natural gas would be reduced wednesday lithuanian 
gas officials received a telegram from a regional soviet energy 
official saying supplies of natural gas would be curtailed sharply 
by order of the government 
but by late wednesday no change in the supply had been noted 
lithuanias supreme council has refused to rescind the laws 
gorbachev wants off the books but offered to pass no more such 
measures if the kremlin starts negotiations by may 1 
that effort at compromise appeared unlikely to be accepted by 
the soviet leadership 
the supreme council in anticipation of a possible embargo 
urged lithuanian factories and consumers to prepare themselves 
for spiritual endurance and strict economy on all consumption it 
announced no specific conservation measures 
in a resolution titled on the expansion of relations between 
the republic of lithuania and the ussr members of the supreme 
council reaffirmed their declaration of independence and appealed 
to gorbachev not to use violence against lithuanians or impose the 
economic sanctions he threatened 
in a separate letter to gorbachev the lithuanian legislature 
expressed regrets on the position and methods chosen by the 
ussr 
legislators said they were forming a delegation led by bronius 
kuzmickas vice president of the supreme council to travel to 
moscow for possible talks gorbachev has issued a series of 
ultimatums since lithuania declared independence in most cases 
such as a demand that lithuanians surrender private firearms he 
has not reacted when they refused to give in 
the kremlin also sent tanks and military vehicles through 
lithuanias capital vilnius rounded up lithuanians who deserted 
from the red army seized buildings and barred western journalists 
from lithuania 
lithuania picked up support wednesday from neighboring poland 
with the solidarity delegation to the polish parliament adopting a 
resolution expressing concern over moscows exerting growing 
pressure the delegation also suggested warsaw assist in 
negotiations between the republic and the kremlin 
japans cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto urged soviets to 
exercise prudence and expressed concern over kremlin threats of 
punitive actions

the first detector of plastic explosives to be 
installed by us officials in a foreign airport is to be set up at 
londons gatwick airport in a few weeks a spokesman for the 
company that built it said wednesday 
the federal aviation administration announced that it signed an 
agreement with the british airports authority for the thermal 
neutron analysis or tna unit in the public area of the airport 
for use by us and other airlines 
the faas decision to use the machines was prompted by the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 in december 1988 over lockerbie 
scotland that killed 270 people 
other neutron analysis units have been installed at john f 
kennedy airport in new york and at miamis international airport 
but both have been put in baggage areas and handle luggage of only 
one carrier 
the faa said baggage destined for the united states aboard us 
carriers will be given first priority for the london machine the 
next prioirty will be other planes bound for the united states 
the machine has been ready and boxed for several weeks said 
hadi bozorgmanesh vice president of science applications 
international corp of california the only manufacturer 
bozorgmanish said in a telephone interview that space for the 
machine is ready at gatwick 
the faa has ordered us airlines to pay for and install nuetron 
analysis units or similar machines at highrisk airports they use 
around the world the london machine however will be operated by 
the airport rather than an airline 
faa administrator james b busey has said he has been frustrated 
by difficulties with negotiations to install the devices in 
airports the agency is negotiating to put the machines in airports 
in frankfurt west germany where flight 103 originated and 
manila the philippines one is also planned for washingtons 
dulles international airport 
tna cannot guarantee security busey said on tuesday but 
it is the latest and best technology that we have and it is a 
needed weapon in what is a growing arsenal in the sturggle against 
terrorism 
the faa said the gatwick machine should be in operation in time 
for the summer travel season

lithuanias prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene came to oslo on wednesday seeking norwegian oil to help 
offset a soviet oil cutoff to the independenceminded baltic 
republic 
this trip is important because of the brutal economic 
blockade she said 
she spoke before reports from lithuania said moscow cut off 
crude oil supplies to lithuania late wednesday in an effort to 
thwart its drive toward independence 
mrs prunskiene called her first visit to the west unofficial 
and informal she told an airport news conference that talks with 
senior norwegian officials will have a lot to do with practical 
problems 
the threeday visit will help determine if norway a major oil 
exporter would help break the blockade she said 
prime minister jan p syse of norway softpedaled the meeting 
he said in a television interview that a nongovernmental body made 
the invitation prior to increased tensions between lithuania and 
moscow he did not expect moscow to see the meeting as meddling 
in the internal affairs of the soviet union 
he said natomember norway has not promised lithuania oil 
supplies the state does not sell oil that is up to the oil 
companies he said 
it is very curious that yesterday we heard promises of 
supplies mrs prunskiene said at the airport without 
elaborating 
norways state oil company statoil has said it was willing to 
sell lithuania crude oil supplies at market prices paid in dollars 
a spokesman said statoil had not been approached 
asked if lithuania had enough western currency to pay for oil 
mrs prunskiene replied we dont expect oil companies to give us 
anything for free naturally we are prepared to pay very much 
depends on what kinds of contacts and contracts are possible 
mrs prunskiene and foreign minister algirdas saudargas were 
invited by norways three governing coalition parties through a 
joint organization called give democracy in the east a chance 
the organization is nongovernmental but was created by 
norways conservativeled coalition to nurture nonsocialist 
political parties in the east bloc 
the lithuanians will meet syse foreign minister kjell magne 
bondevik and members of parliament they will also visit the west 
coast city of stavanger center of norways 15

tonya brooks is often afraid to look out her 
window 
bullets dont have no names on them said the 21yearold 
mother of three who lives in the 50yearold logan fontenelle 
public housing project which has been dubbed vietnam because 
of the drugs gangs and violence 
ms brooks would like to live in a quiet safe neighborhood but 
a plan to demolish the 388unit housing project and relocate its 
residents has stirred controversy in this largely middleclass city 
of 350000 along the missouri river 
the omaha housing authority wants to use a 9 million us 
housing and urban development grant to scatter 194 of the families 
at logan fontenelle around the city a plan rejected 43 by the 
city council in december some opponents said it was too costly 
others wanted more say in where the new housing units would be 
located 
the housing authority then revised the plan so that it didnt 
need city council approval for the scattered site housing but the 
council still must approve the razing of the logan fontenelle a 
grim redbrick project on omahas predominantly black north side 
mayor pj morgan and omaha housing authority executive director 
robert armstrong are determined to demolish logan fontenelle which 
is overrun by los angelesbased gangs the bloods and the crips 
who sell cocaine and crack driveby shootings are commonplace 
no further city council debates are scheduled on the issue 
however as morgan and armstrong try to draft a compromise measure 
that would gain majority council support 
but the mayor said wednesday he would withdraw his support for 
the plan if the logan fontenelle units are only boarded up and left 
standing that brings a greater blight to that part of the 
community morgan said 
to complicate matters four black residents of logan fontenelle 
have filed a lawsuit in us district court accusing the housing 
authority hud and city officials of racial segregation in housing 
policies 
armstrong said he hopes the lawsuit might be dropped if the 
scattered site plan gets the expected approval from hud 
mary clarkson an attorney for the four residents said 
wednesday that in addition to logan fontenelle the lawsuit involves 
claims about section 8 lowincome housing and other housing 
projects she said any attempt or plan that would desegegrate logan 
fontenelle is relevant to the case 
its premature at this time to know whether this plan 
would have that effect because theres little or no information 
about where these scattered sites would be she said 
scattered lowincome housing isnt new to omaha which has put 
195 units around the city since 1980 but it became an issue with 
logan fontenelle because of the projects tough reputation and the 
large number of families who would need relocating at once 
hud doesnt push for scatteredsite housing but its an option 
for local housing authorities said huds director of public 
housing thomas sherman 
sherman said the program often faces community opposition 
its just a feeling not based upon fact if you put 
lowincome people in their neighborhoods property values will 
deteriorate the other reason is purely racial there are still 
communities around this country that dont want to desegrate or 
integrate he said from washington 
he said hud encourages lowincome people to find their own 
housing and use a federal voucher system called section 8 
certificates to help pay the rent 
under the housing authority plan the authority would buy 134 
homes and duplexes over a fouryear period giving the tenants an 
option to buy sixty additional units would be leased through 
section 8 certificates as the plan stands now the 194 units 
emptied by those actions would be boarded up until the council 
approves their demolition 
the authoritys plan has a longterm goal of demolishing the 
remaining 194 units in logan fontenelle by the year 2000 but how 
the tenants would be relocated has not been determined 
some opponents of scatteredsite housing in omaha have said it 
gives lowincome people housing they dont deserve and costs too 
much 
how far do we go in providing homes for people who are 
unemployed city councilman steve tomasek asked are we 
supposed to provide a 70000 home in a neighborhood that is 
otherwise gainfully employed 
armstrong said people in the scatteredsite program would have 
to hold jobs and pay 30 percent of their income for rent an 
average of 67000 in federal money would be available to purchase 
each home 
i guess i hate to see taxpayers providing money for housing 
that is of greater value than the taxpayers said one northwest 
omaha resident walt nabity 
others support the housing authoritys plan 
i think itd give people a better chance to get them out 
of that ghetto homeowner mary barnhart said they deserve that 
chance

former cia agent thomas clines attempted to 
hide from the government hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
profits he made from supplying arms to the contras according to 
court papers filed by irancontra prosecutors 
clines was indicted feb 22 and he is seeking to have the tax 
charges against him thrown out on grounds that the office of 
independent counsel lawrence walsh lacks jurisdiction in the case 
the governments reply was made available wednesday 
facing a may 14 trial in us district court in baltimore 
clines is accused of underreporting his income to the internal 
revenue service and failing to report foreign financial accounts to 
the treasury department 
clines lawyer says the tax case falls outside the scope of the 
irancontra prosecutors jurisdiction 
mr clines has not been charged with committing any crime by 
virtue of his particiption in the purchase sale or transfer of 
arms nor has he been charged with any crime relating to 
support to the contras said his lawyer paula junghans 
prosecutors opposed clines motion to dismiss the indictment 
saying that crimes involving the attempt to hide arms sale 
profits are within walshs authority to investigate according to 
their countermotion 
the government expects evidence at clines trial to show that in 
1985 423000 in profits were distributed to him as a result of 
his irancontra activities according to papers filed tuesday by 
irancontra prosecutors in baltimore and released wednesday in 
washington in 1986 said the prosecutors clines profits from 
irancontra activities amounted to some 459000 
clines reported gross receipts of 265000 and 402513 for 1985 
and 1986 respectively according to his tax returns which were 
filed in the case 
clines assisted the contra resupply network overseen by oliver 
north he helped locate a european arms dealer as a source of 
weapons helped arrange for shipping and lined up crews to 
transport the supplies to the rebels 
he worked with businessman richard secord a retired air force 
major general whom north enlisted to run arms to the contras 
clines also moved that the court suppress evidence arguing that 
documents on foreign accounts which prosecutors obtained under a 
usswiss treaty cannot be used in the case 
prosecutors say that the only swiss records to be used as 
evidence in this case will be those produced by secords business 
partner albert hakim who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the 
scandal and is cooperating with the government

eighteen opposition legislators began a 
48hour sitin wednesday to protest the governments implementation 
of censorship rules without consulting parliament 
the legislators all independents except for one member of the 
main opposition social democrat populist party said they would not 
leave parliaments assembly hall for two days 
the government last saturday adopted a decree sharply 
restricting news coverage in the southeastern kurdish areas and 
increasing the powers of the regional governor in charge of areas 
where kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for an independent 
homeland 
almost 2500 civilians guerrillas and security forces have been 
killed in clashes in the southeast since 1984 
ethnic kurds make up about onefifth of turkeys population of 
55 million 
the decree banned the turkish press from carrying stories or 
analyses that might harm security operations it ruled that 
publications carrying reports threatening law and order would be 
banned throughout the country or their printing plants closed 
two leftist weeklies 2000e dogru and sokak which gave wide 
coverage to the kurdish insurgency in the past failed to appear at 
newstands this week as printers canceled their contracts to protest 
the new rules 
the decree also empowered the regional governor to ban strikes 
that threaten law and order and expel from the area residents 
threating public order 
fehmi isiklar a spokesman for the protesting deputies demanded 
the decree be brought before parliament as soon as possible 
the constitution requires the government to submit such decrees 
to parliament for approval but does not specify the timing 
opposition parties have been demanding decrees go into force after 
and not before parliament approves them

yugoslav authorities lifted a 
yearlong state of emergency wednesday in the ethnically troubled 
southern province of kosovo belgrade television reported 
it said the federal collective presidency acted at the request 
of serbia following a serbian police takeover in the region 
serbia the largest of yugoslavias six republics administers 
kosovo 
serbias communist authorities announced last month they were 
abolishing existing police autonomy in kosovo because local 
security forces failed to act during unrest there by ethnic 
albanians demanding selfgovernment 
ethnic albanians make up 90 percent of kosovos population they 
have staged numerous protests and demonstrations to back up their 
demands since the yugoslav government introduced at serbian 
request a state of emergency in the province in march 1989 
the presidency said in a statement that security has been 
stabilized to a certain degree in kosovo making it possible to 
lift the state of emergency in the province it said it was 
convinced that easing security measures will improve the overall 
situation in kosovo and the country as a whole 
about 60 ethnic albanian protesters were killed in kosovo and 
hundreds more imprisoned after federal authorities deployed serbian 
police units and army contingents to curb the unrest 
serbian officials claim the measures were needed to prevent what 
they describe as harassment of kosovos 200000 slavs by 
terrorists and separatists of albanian origin they say ethnic 
albanians are trying to secede from yugoslavia to join neighboring 
albania 
human rights groups from yugoslavias liberal northern republics 
of slovenia and croatia international rights monitors and several 
western governmental organizations denounced the crackdown in 
kosovo

scientists say they have identified the sex of 
3dayold embryos in the test tube and that two women implanted 
with tested embryos are expected to delthis summer 
further research might provide a way to screen out embryos that 
would develop serious genetic diseases removing the prospect of 
abortions in those cases researchers said 
the study was aimed at producing female babies in cases whiver twin 
girls ere a 
male could inherit a serious genetic disease said researcher alan 
handyside 
while the technique also would allow choosing the sex of a child 
without any medical reason handyside said he would consider that 
unethical 
the new work is reported in thursdays issue of the british 
journal nature by handyside and colleagues at the royal 
postgraduate medical school at hammersmith hospital in london 
laboratory techniques have been used before to determine a 
babys sex in 1986 a new orleans fertility institute announced 
the birth of a boy whose sex had been selected during in vitro 
fertilization which is done in the laboratory that case involved 
selecting sperm to produce a boy 
but sperm ich only a 
risk rather than a certainty can be predicted diseases that appear 
only after decades of normal life and childhood diseases with 
which people can live into early adulthood she said 
some might consider it to be socially very undesirable for a 
woman to take a 50 percent chance of having a child who is going to 
be obese since those children are likely to get into more 
medical problems and cost the society she said

necessary so damage was kept to a minimum duffie said if 
thousands of gallons had been poured onto the flames the results 
could have been disastrous

the united states in february recorded its 
smallest trade deficit in more than six years a 649 billion 
imbalance that reflected a sharp drop in oil imports the 
government reported wednesday 
the bush administration hailed the dramatic narrowing of the 
deficit but later in the day released a new forecast which 
pessimistically predicted that further trade improvements this year 
were likely to be at best very modest 
the administrations trade forecast required by congress said 
that any further narrowing of the trade deficit this year is likely 
to be much smaller than in the past two years and that a modest 
widening of the deficit could not be ruled out 
the commerce department said februarys trade gap was down 30 
percent from a 932 billion january deficit it was the best trade 
showing since december 1983 when the deficit was 568 billion 
imports fell by 76 percent to 3812 billion while us 
exports totaled 3163 billion a modest 1 percent decline from an 
alltime high for exports set in january 
michael boskin president bushs chief economic adviser called 
the trade figure very good news indeed while cautioning that 
we cant tell yet the extent to which it is a temporary or 
permanent phenomenon 
some private economists remained pessimistic contending that 
februarys good showing came primarily from a huge 20 percent drop 
in oil imports thats not likely to be sustained 
with us domestic oil production at 25year lows many 
economists look for americas dependence on foreign oil to continue 
rising thus holding back improvements in the trade deficit 
last years trade deficit totaled 109 billion and many analysts 
are looking for the figure to deteriorate this year reflecting a 
higher oil bill and weaker export growth because of the strength of 
the us dollar 
a stronger dollar makes us goods less competitive in overseas 
markets 
its nice to have a low number for february but it would 
certainly be a mistake to conclude that our competitiveness 
problems have disappeared and everything is now terrific for us on 
international markets said lawrence chimerine senior economic 
adviser at the wefa group an economic consulting company in bala 
cynwyd pa 
but bruce steinberg senior economist at merrill lynch said he 
believed the trade deficit would shrink further this year falling 
below 100 billion for the first time since 1983 
he said americas trade fortunes were being helped by strong 
demand in western europe the primary market for us exports 
while the trade balance with japan worsened in february rising 
to 312 billion the united states ran a 1 billion trade surplus 
with western europe 
we have gone from running big trade deficits with western 
europe to being in rough balance and everything is in place to 
start running big surpluses steinberg said 
the administrations trade outlook held out some hope that the 
dramatic changes occurring in eastern europe would narrow trade 
differences at least in europe 
the report said that the unification of west and east germany 
should act to lower west germanys huge trade surplus because the 
united country will need to import more from abroad to meet 
increased demand 
the deficit with japan which accounted for half of februarys 
total imbalance is coming as the bush administration applies heavy 
pressure on the government of prime minister toshiki kaifu to open 
japanese markets to more american products 
regardless of their view about future trade prospects 
economists agreed that februarys improvement would significantly 
boost overall economic growth for the first three months of the 
year 
steinberg predicted that the overall economy as measured by the 
gross national product expanded at an annual rate of between 25 
percent to 3 percent with more than 1 percentage point of that 
gain coming from a smaller trade deficit 
in the final three months of 1989 the gnp grew at a sluggish 
11 percent rate 
oil imports which surged by 44 percent in january fell in 
february by 20 percent to 471 billion reflecting a drop in the 
price per barrel and the number of barrels imported 
the big swing in both months was weather related with cold 
december temperatures pushing up demand and an unusually warm 
january cutting back on oil imports in february 
in addition to the drop in oil shipments imports of consumer 
appliances and other durable goods fell by 75 percent while 
imports of clothing and other consumer nondurable goods dropped by 
10 percent primarily reflecting sluggish us demand analysts 
said 
however imports of foreign cars were up by 25 percent to 256 
billion in february 
on the export side there were small declines in a variety of 
areas but these were offset by a doubling in sales of aircraft 
which climbed to 227 billion reflecting a spurt in shipments by 
the seattlebased boeing co which was idled by a strike late last 
year

the tombstone of the rev ralph david abernathy 
the civil rights leader will carry the twoword epitaph he chose 
before his death i tried 
that was more or less his motto but in my eyes he did more 
than try he made a difference said abernathys son state rep 
ralph david abernathy iii 
the elder abernathy who was a friend and confidante to the rev 
martin luther king jr but was spurned by civil rights colleagues 
last year for discussing kings alleged infidelity in his memoirs 
died tuesday at crawford long hospital he was 64 
abernathy who suffered strokes in 1983 and 1986 died of 
coronary arrest brought on by a blood clot in the lung hospital 
spokesman mendal bouknight said wednesday abernathy had been in 
the hospital since march 23 for treatment of a sodium deficiency 
the younger abernathy in an interview tuesday night with the 
atlanta journal said his father would want to be remembered as a 
man of god or better yet a soldier of god first a man of peace 
and a man of love 
i serve in the georgia house of representatives because of the 
work my father did but he always told me i wouldnt be free until 
everyone was free the son said 
former president jimmy carter following a speech at a private 
college in williamsburg ky said i thought ralph abernathy was 
a great man i think that as the years go by abernathy is 
going to get more and more credit from people who look at his 
actual accomplishments 
friends and family came and went quietly wednesday from the 
singlestory white brick abernathy home in southwest atlanta a 
fulton county policewoman stationed inside the house for security 
said abernathys wife juanita would make no comment 
the funeral was scheduled for noon monday at west hunter street 
baptist church where abernathy had been pastor since 1961 
a memorial service was to be held at 730 pm sunday at west 
hunter street baptist church following the service the public may 
view the body 
abernathy shared 17 jail cells with king marched with him in 
selma and cradled his bloody head when king was killed in memphis 
but civil rights leaders who had worked with abernathy during those 
years criticized him in 1989 following publication of his 
autobiography and the walls came tumbling down 
in the book abernathy wrote that king had spent time with two 
women and had argued with a third in the 24 hours before his 
assassination 
among those criticizing abernathy for the book was jesse 
jackson but on wednesday jackson was among those who praised 
abernathy for his role in the civil rights movement 
the benefits of his service to the common people of america 
and the world will never be lost jackson said in a statement 
issued from washington dc 
i have marched with him i have debated with him i have 
argued with him i have disagreed with him i have learned from 
him jackson said 
from his office in los angeles former president ronald reagan 
issued a statement calling abernathy a man of great courage and 
totally unselfish dedication to the most just cause known to 
mankind ending discrimination

president bush signed legislation wednesday 
amending the tafthartley act and clearing the way for a boston 
hotel workers union and other employees across the country to 
negotiate for housing benefits 
wednesdays signing affects not only the boston local but every 
union and employee association in the country 
its much more than just a housing trust for a handful of 
workers said dominic bozzotto president of the hotel workers 
local 26 in boston it says that there are employers out there 
who understand that they have to stabilize neighborhoods and 
communities in order to have a workforce 
without ceremony or fanfare bush signed the bill at the white 
house according to bruce marks local 26 housing director 
it was local 26 that in 1988 negotiated an unprecedented 
agreement with nine boston hotels requiring the employers to put 
money into a housing trust fund that could be used to finance 
housing purchases and rentals the 5000member local needed a 
technical amendment to the tafthartley act before the agreement 
could be legal 
were going to be able to provide housing assistance within 
the next month marks said 
tafthartley the nations overriding labor relations law for 43 
years includes anticorruption provisions that prohibit management 
from making direct payments to unions except for certain purposes 
such as employee education health care and retirement the 
amendment adds housing to that list 
an unusual political coalition developed around the legislation 
it included the boston area employers who support the measure 
because it will enable them to retain a stable workforce in a 
costly housing market reagan and bush administration officials who 
backed the bill because it accomplished a social goal without 
involving tax dollars and massachusetts democrats including sen 
edward m kennedy and house rules committee chairman joe moakley 
longtime backers of the labor movement 
what the whole exercise proves is that you can get a broad 
coalition to come together around social responsibility bozzotto 
said it shows that the idea of the large community where the 
strong take care of the week is alive and well in our society

spunk is an apt title for george c wolfes 
stage adaptation of three short stories by zora neale hurston 
the playlets which opened wednesday at offbroadways new york 
shakespeare festival are gutsy gritty and often very funny 
examinations of black life both in the south and up north during 
the 1920s 
wolfe author of that satiric look at black history called the 
colored museum uses song mime dance and story theater 
techniques to make hurstons stories come alive under his 
direction they have made the leap from page to stage with an 
irresistible theatricality 
the first play sweat is a familiar tale of a woman done 
wrong by her man delia a religious hardworking laundress is 
increasingly battered by her philandering husband her revenge is 
positively serpentine danitra vance personifies the womans 
sweetness while reggie montgomery portrays her doomed helpmate 
with a stylish sense of evil 
style also carries story in harlem slang an uproarious 
confrontation between two harlem dandies who work hard at doing 
nothing at all if their dialogue is often incomprehensible the 
meaning is very clear as they attempt to cadge free meals from 
passing women montgomery and k todd freeman play the preening 
roosters who dont miss a word or a beat as they strut their stuff 
and the theater program contains a glossary of the more arcane 
terms for audiences who have to know every word 
the longest play the gilded sixbits forms the second half 
of the evening it meanders a bit and the story it tells is also 
one of love betrayed but this time the victim is a husband whose 
wife falls for a wealthier man and unlike the curtainraiser 
the gilded sixbits is a plea for forgiveness that succeeds 
the three sories are punctuated by some wonderful music mostly 
blues written and performed by the oddly named chic street man he 
is assisted by ann duquesnay a woman who can sing and sashay with 
the best of them 
hurstons stories are testaments to the human spirit her people 
are more than just survivors they thrive in adversity in 
spunk wolfe has managed to document the way they flourish with 
grace good humor and affection

the national centers for disease control on 
wednesday effectively shut down the importation of research monkeys 
into the united states until importers present plans to combat a 
potentially deadly virus 
the cdc announced that no rhesus cynomolgus or african green 
monkeys may imported into this country or distributed out of 
quarantine unless accompanied by a special permit issued by the 
cdc director 
the decision came amid concerns over an ebola virus strain 
detected in shipments of laboratory monkeys from three philippines 
importers 
the permits must be issued at least 30 days prior to 
importation which effectively suspends all imports for one month 
even by those animal dealers not affected by the suspension of 
three major importers in march 
at least one of the three suspended facilities charles river 
primates corp of port washington ny was reinstated earlier 
this month 
these three species of monkeys are capable of being an animal 
host of human disease the cdc said in announcing the new 
restrictions on importing the three species 
the cdc reported earlier this month that four animal handlers 
have become infected with a presumed ebola virus carried by 
philippine lab monkeys although none have become ill thats in 
contrast to patterns of infection with african ebola virus which 
typically attacks suddenly and produces serious and often fatal 
illness 
importers wishing to deal in laboratory monkeys must now submit 
to the cdc director a written plan outlining measures to prevent 
exposure of persons and animals during the entire importation and 
quarantine process the cdc said 
researchers believe that as many as 10 percent of the lab 
monkeys coming into the united states have been infected with a 
filovirus the family of viruses including ebola virus

about 75 earthquakes jolted northern 
california on wednesday the anniversary of the catastrophic great 
quake of 1906 the temblors were aftershocks of the october quake 
that killed 67 geologists said 
there were no reports of injuries or major damage from wednesday 
mornings quakes the largest measuring up to 54 on the richter 
scale eight others registered at least 33 
the temblors on the san andreas fault were felt from san 
francisco to king city 150 miles south the san andreas also 
caused the 1906 and oct 17 quakes 
all the memories came back to the kids this one 
especially darrell daniels said with his 4yearold daughter 
eleth on his lap 
she wont let me go 
the family is living in a mobile home because their home in 
downtown watsonville was condemned after the october quake 
wednesdays aftershocks were centered about four miles east of 
watsonville 60 miles south of san francisco octobers 
71magnitude quake caused major damage to the farming community 
the temblors began at 638 am shortly after a group of great 
quake surivors gathered in san francisco to commemorate the 1906 
disaster the strongest quake wednesday struck at 654 am in all 
about 75 were recorded according to pat jorgenson a spokeswoman 
for the us geological survey in menlo park 
nine quakes of 33 or larger were recorded the usgs said 
including the latest temblors the number of aftershocks from 
the october quake registering 30 or more grew to 115 of those 38 
had magnitudes of 40 or larger 
the university of californiaberkeley seismographic station said 
the strongest quake wednesday had a preliminary reading of 54 on 
the richter scale allen lindh of the usgs also issued a 
preliminary report of 54 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number for example from 
magnitude 55 to magnitude 65 means that the ground motion is 10 
times greater 
we are considering them aftershocks they occurred in the same 
location of other aftershocks of loma prieta said david 
oppenheimer a geological survey seismologist loma prieta was the 
name given to octobers quake 
he said aftershocks from a magnitude71 quake can continue for 
two years 
we figured it was all over said robert holleson a former 
watsonville resident who was visiting wednesday but the powers 
off the phones dead helicopters are flying all over its like 
its starting all over again 
early damage reports from the watsonville area were light with 
some dishes broken and small rockslides on highway 152 into 
watsonville san francisco police said many worried residents 
called but no damage was reported 
ron rutkowski spokesman for pacific gas amp electric co said 
about 11000 customers in the watsonville and santa cruz area lost 
power all service was restored by noon 
wednesday marked the 84th anniversary of the 1906 quake which 
struck at 513 am on april 18 although the richter scale didnt 
exist then it was later determined that the quakes magnitude was 
83 
for decades it was believed that about 700 people died in the 
1906 earthquake but in recent years research by san francisco 
city archivist gladys hansen documented at least 2500 deaths and 
she has said the real toll may be much higher 
about 150 people gathered wednesday at lottas fountain in 
downtown san francisco by 513 am some were heading to another 
commemoration when the first tremor occurred 
one or two of the survivors commented that it didnt faze them 
at all as they had experienced the big one said organizer taren 
sapienza 
the october quake caused more than 7 billion in damage and 
rattled residents who used to shrug off small temblors that quake 
caused a doubledeck section of interstate 880 in oakland to 
collapse killing 42 people parts of three freeways that were 
damaged remain closed 
on tuesday exactly six months after the quake more than 100 
people mingled at an earthquakepreparedness rally at san 
franciscos justin herman plaza a few yards from the ruined 
embarcadero freeway 
around the plaza people manned display tables where pamphlets 
and disaster checklists were handed out pictures of the october 
earthquake destruction also were on review 
at watsonvilles mobile home park jimmie henson said even 
though wednesdays quakes were smaller than octobers they were 
more destructive for her the tremors caused cracks in the walls of 
her home and broke dishes and other small objects 
im more upset today than i was from the big one much 
more she said

an international ban on trade in ivory 
has sent prices plummeting on most traditional markets the world 
conservation union said wednesday 
in several countries shrinking demand also has led to reduced 
poaching a study by the group said poaching was blamed as a major 
factor in reducing africas elephant population from 13 million to 
about 610000 in the past 15 years 
the treaty to protect the dwindling herds took effect jan 18 
following a 103nation meeting in october of members of the 
convention on trade in endangered species 
it bans trade in ivory and all other elephant products five 
southern african nations which regularly cull their elephant 
populations botswana malawi south africa zambia and zimbabwe 
filed for exemptions china has declared it will continue to import 
the tusks 
the world conservation union study says ivory prices in africa 
europe and africa fell significantly although they rose somewhat in 
japan where high internal demand remains 
the study cautioned however that with stockpiles rising 
because of natural mortality and confiscations there is growing 
danger that much of this ivory will enter trade through nations 
that did not sign the treaty 
it said the large quantities of stockpiled ivory at least 250 
tons in africa and another 580 tons in consumer countries thus 
may foster new markets which will be difficult if not impossible 
to control

secretary of state james a baker iii warned 
wednesday that action by moscow against lithuania could doom 
commercial ussoviet relations as the administration sought 
details on reports of an oil cutoff 
its very difficult to see some of the commercial aspects of 
our relationship surviving the use of force or coercion against 
the independenceminded baltic republic baker told the house ways 
and means committee at a hearing on east bloc economic reform 
baker spoke just hours before lithuanian spokesmen said the 
soviet union shut off the supply of oil to lithuanias only 
refinery imposing part of mikhail s gorbachevs threatened 
economic embargo 
weve seen the reports said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater we dont have any independent verification we are 
looking into it we want to analyze the situation and i dont 
expect any response tonight 
president bush in an interview with the world monitor 
television show sponsored by the christian science monitor 
broadcast wednesday night on the discovery channel of cable 
systems declined to answer a question about whether the united 
states would supply oil to lithuania he said the question was 
too hypothetical 
prodded that an aswer would be a message bush said i 
understand that i have a chance to send messages every single 
minute and i dont elect to do that 
bush said he had not spoken with lithuanias president and had 
not spoken with soviet president mikhail gorbachev since the soviet 
oil threat last friday 
fitzwater also said that the white house had received a private 
letter from lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
the letter was delivered to the state department and forwarded 
to the white house the president has not seen it yet but he will 
we wont comment on the content fitzwater said 
lithuanias us representative stasyas lozoraitis jr said 
the letter was written march 19 about a week after the lithuanian 
parliament declared independence and brought out of the country by 
a traveler because the lithuanian government did not trust soviet 
handling of its mail 
the letter simply explains the situation to bush and said 
we ask your political support without making specific requests 
for help lozoraitis said 
it was followed by letters to pope john paul ii and french 
president francois mitterrand and others the envoy said 
he said he expects landsbergis to write again 
baker reading a carefully drafted statement at the 
congressional hearing made it clear that us action in response 
to any crackdown on by gorbachev would be dictated by us 
interests 
he then listed areas of ussoviet cooperation that are in the 
interest of the united states including ridding former stellite 
countries of soviet military presence conventional and nuclear 
arms control and economic reform in the soviet union 
but some of our bilateral commercial contacts with the soviet 
union may be more directly in their interest than in ours baker 
added inserting the word commercial which did not appear in 
his written text 
and those contacts are being put to risk by soviet actions in 
lithuania he said our willingness and ability to take steps 
that benefit perestroika economic and political restructuring in 
the near term is to be sure affected by soviet behavior 
perestroika glasnost and democratization cannot be divisible 
the reform process wont go forward and succeed if it is applied in 
some republics but not in others 
asked by reporters to clarify what commercial relationships 
would be endangered baker declined 
elsewhere in his testimony baker described ongoing talks on a 
ussoviet trade agreement which coupled with codification of 
emigration reform could lead to mostfavorednation trading status 
for the soviet union 
he also referred to future possibilities of lifting restrictions 
on us lending to the soviet union and to a bilateral investment 
treaty and a revised tax treaty 
gorbachev threatened last week to impose an embargo of critical 
supplies unless lithuania rescinded within 48 hours several laws 
meant to bolster its march 11 declaration of independence 
lithuanian leaders have made no move to meet gorbachevs 
demands but say they are willing to negotiate gorbachev refuses 
to meet with them until they rescind their declaration of 
independence 
in his testimony baker said it was time for the soviets to 
begin a dialogue with the lithuanians about how to resolve the 
question of independence 
the lithuanians want such a dialogue he said it seems to 
us that is the answer to the problem dialogue not economic 
boycotts and not threats to invoke presidential rule 
members of the tax and trade panel generally welcomed the 
administrations cautious approach to the lithuania problem a 
typical comment came from liberal rep tom downey dny 
some would love an excuse to jumpstart the cold war downey 
said adding that the measured response you have given to date is 
going to prove to be the correct one in the long sweep of history

two former drug counselors who were fired 
for eating psychedelic peyote as part of their religious practices 
expressed dismay that the us supreme court ruled against them 
but one said he wont give up 
maybe a battles lost but the wars not over said al 
smith 70 of glenwood ive lost battles before 
in arizona leaders of the hopi and navajo tribes on wednesday 
criticized the decision tuesday by the nations highest court the 
ruling upheld oregon officials decision to deny unemployment 
benefits to smith and galen black of cottage park 
justice antonin scalia writing for the 63 majority said it 
would be courting anarchy to let a few do what is illegal for 
everyone else 
dissenting justices said the ruling permits religious oppression 
of indians a view supported by indian spiritual leaders 
black said the ruling went beyond a cultural slap and 
dehumanized everyone involved in the case 
im astounded theyve taken the people out and the lawbook 
mentality is the only thing they know he said tuesday they 
cant see that these people who eat peyote are searching out for 
something those people are searching for a little peace and 
tranquility within themselves 
smith a klamath indian and recovering alcoholic said he 
frequently attends native american church meetings and uses peyote 
a small buttonshaped cactus containing the hallucinogen 
mescaline smith said the substances effect in a church setting is 
spiritual rather than recreational 
black who is not an indian also has attended church meetings 
black and smith were fired after breaking a policy of adapt the 
nonprofit rehabilitation organization they worked for in douglas 
county ore by eating small amounts of peyote as part of a native 
american church sacrament 
smith said the effect of state attorney general dave 
frohnmayers case against him is cultural genocide in oregon 
and conflicts with the ideals of the framers of the us 
constitution 
its very important smith said if the first amendment 
doesnt protect me how the hells it going to protect you 
the native american church is an umbrella group that claims at 
least 250000 members belonging to 70 church chapters that practice 
the peyote ritual in 23 western states 
in window rock ariz on wednesday interim navajo chairman 
leonard haskie said the ruling would affect many in the 
200000member tribe who belong to the church 
the ruling indicates the need to educate the us government 
state governments and society in general of the beliefs and 
practices of the native american church haskie said in a 
statement issued in the navajo reservations capital 
haskie said church members believe peyote use as a sacrament is 
as old as the origin of the navajos 
he said the navajo government would do whatever was necessary to 
ensure that legal exemptions allowing religious use of peyote will 
continue in states surrounding the reservation the reservation 
which covers an area the size of west virginia sprawls across much 
of northeastern arizona and into new mexico and utah 
haskie also called on members of congress to strengthen 
safeguards against governmental encroachment on individual rights 
in the hopi capital of kykotsmovi ariz tribal chairman vernon 
masyesva called the supreme courts decision unfortunate 
masayesva said religious rights should be inviolable by any 
considerations but national interests

the colombian defense ministry said 
weapons sold by israel to a caribbean islandnation mysteriously 
ended up in the hands of the powerful medellin drug cartel 
newspapers reported wednesday 
the weapons were originally sold by israel in early 1989 to the 
tiny country of antigua and barbuda according to a communique 
released tuesday by the defense ministry the communique signed by 
defense minister oscar botero was published wednesday in daily 
newspapers 
soldiers found 232 israelimade weapons in february during a 
search of ranches seized from gonzalo rodriguez gacha a major drug 
trafficker who was killed in a december gun battle with police 
botero said 
a feb 2 search of one ranch owned by rodriguez gacha turned up 
more than 100 of the israeli weapons and 32 million in cash 
botero said 
the weapons found at the drug traffickers ranches included 
assault rifles machine guns submachine guns pistols 
shoulderfired rockets and infrared night scopes the communique 
said 
the defense minister said the seized israeli weapons originally 
were sold to antigua and barbuda but authorities have not been 
determined how the weapons wound up with medellin drug traffickers 
he said authorities in israel and the caribbean nation were 
investigating the matter 
a spokeswoman for the israeli embassy in bogota anna cecilia de 
nieto said the embassy would have no comment on the communique 
on feb 5 colombia privately complained about the weapons to 
the israeli government 
the israeli government told colombia last month that the weapons 
discovered at rodriguez gachas property had been sold by israel to 
antigua and barbuda last year botero said 
the minister said colombia issued a formal protest to antigua 
and barbuda on april 3 since the two countries do not have 
diplomatic relations the protest was issued through the 
organization of american states 
the complaint against the island nation was not made public at 
the time 
the mystery over the israeli weapons follows a scandal that 
broke last year concerning the alleged involvement of israeli 
mercenaries in training the medellin cartels private armies 
the colombian government has formally charged two israelis yair 
klein and arik afek with complicity with the medellin cartel 
colombian authorities have requested the extradition of klein a 
former israeli army lieutenant colonel who is in israel 
afek was discovered dead on jan 24 in the trunk of his parked 
car at miami international airport in what police describe as a 
gangland slaying 
colombias secret police have identified at least five other 
alleged israeli mercenaries who were in the country in 1987 
klein has said he was told he was training colombian ranchers 
and peasants to defend themselves against leftist guerrillas 
but colombian authorities said the israelis were actually 
training the medellin cartels gunmen 
investigators determined the cartel had also hired british and 
australian mercenaries to train and equip its army which is 
believed to have as many as 4000 gunmen

the louisiana pardon board on wednesday 
recommended that wilbert rideau a convicted murderer who became an 
awardwinning journalist behind bars be set free after 29 years in 
prison 
the final decision will be made by gov buddy roemer who has 
cited the viciousness of rideaus crimes in refusing to commute his 
life sentence in the past after wednesdays decision roemer said 
he had no plans to do so now 
its difficult i wish i had an easy answer but my 
inclination is not to accept their recommendation the governor 
said 
rideau said wednesday in a telephone interview from louisiana 
state penitentiary in angola that hed be a free man now if hed 
spent his time in prison making license plates instead of writing 
ive become distinguished because i did some good over the 
years ive been in here he said the problem with doing good 
and being productive is that you acquire notoriety and that goes 
against getting out 
the fivemember board voted unanimously to reduce the 
48yearold prison magazine editors sentence to 55 years which 
defense attorney julian murray said would qualify him for immediate 
release 
this is the same recommendation this board made in 1988 
said board chairwoman yvonne campbell it was based on his prison 
record his accomplishments and he has only had one writeup in his 
29 years in prison 
two board members also recommended that rideau be required to 
leave the state permanently contribute part of the earnings from 
his writing to the victims reparation fund and be ordered to 
perform some community service 
rideau said i appreciate the board of pardons having once 
against expressed their belief in my worth and potential as a human 
being 
they have also expressed their continued belief in the 
american principle of equal justice judging me the same way they 
judge every other person in this state who has been convicted of 
murder and then released 
rideau didnt attend the hearing but about 30 friends and 
supporters did 
it was the seventh time he has applied for clemency after being 
sentenced to death for the 1961 murder of a bank teller in an armed 
robbery his sentence was commuted to life in 1973 when the us 
supreme court overturned the death penalty 
murray henderson former warden of the state prison at angola 
told the board hed known rideau for 20 years 
i have seen a man who has changed who has grown who has 
developed into a mature hardworking person henderson said 
he should have been released 15 years ago or at least 10 i 
dont know what more he can do 
certainly no useful purpose could be served by his continued 
incarceration henderson said you could send him to harvard 
cheaper than you could keep him there 
former state secretary of corrections paul phelps also urged 
that rideau be released 
others however argued against clemency 
frank salter one of the prosecutors at rideaus trial noted 
that because of appeals rideau won he was tried three times and 
sentenced to death each time 
the vote was 360 for the death penalty salter said 
wilbert rideau has had his clemency 
rick bryant an assistant prosecutor in calcasieu parish called 
the premeditated robbery and murder one of the most heinous ever in 
the parish 
ive spoken with people who are still terrified of wilbert 
rideau bryant said we do believe mr rideau has received his 
clemency hes not dead 
the parole board has recommended clemency for rideau three times 
since 1984 and governors have refused to grant clemency each time 
the last time was in 1988 under roemer 
rideau said wednesday he was dismayed that the governor appeared 
to make a decision after only listening to a survivor of his crime 
everything else the hearing the pardon board decision 
everything else is a hollow finality he said 
rideau was sentenced to die in the electric chair for the murder 
of gulf national bank teller julia ferguson after the 1961 holdup 
in the southwest louisiana town of lake charles 
rideau then 19 forced two tellers and the branch manager all 
of whom he knew into a car at gunpoint drove them to a deserted 
road and shot all three 
when mrs ferguson begged for her life rideau cut her throat 
and stabbed her in the heart she was the only one who died 
rideaus prison prose earned him and his magazine the angolite 
national honors including the robert f kennedy journalism award 
the american bar associations silver gavel award and the george 
polk award for special interest reporting 
it also has allowed him to travel with guards two weeks ago 
rideau went to the american society of newspaper editors meeting 
in washington to speak about prison journalism 
rideau says he has offers of journalism jobs if he can get out 
of prison but he worries that his case attracts so much attention 
it puts extra pressure on the governor

the cleanup of environmentally 
sensitive areas of prince william sound fouled by the exxon valdez 
oil spill may resume as early as friday exxon corp and government 
officials said wednesday 
a boat carrying exxons first 1990 cleanup crew will be ready to 
begin work then said andy teal coordinator of exxons shoreline 
cleanup assessment team 
the crew may initially begin cleaning sea bird rookeries and 
areas where seals and sea lions congregate teal said in order to 
minimize disrupting nesting activities in may 
the need to clean those sites is not yet certain however he 
said the first sites to be cleaned will not be determined until the 
federal coordinator on the scene gives the goahead 
the coordinator rear adm david ciancaglini is expected to 
begin approving site cleanup recommendations soon said coast guard 
spokesman ernest del bueno 
the general cleanup of remaining oiled shorelines in prince 
william sound and the gulf of alaska begins may 1 exxon officials 
said 
the 1989 cleanup was halted sept 15 in anticipation of winter 
hundreds of miles of shoreline in prince william sound were 
covered with an oily goo when the tanker exxon valdez ran aground 
on a charted reef on march 24 1989 spilling nearly 11 million 
gallons of north slope crude oil countless fish otters other 
mammals and sea birds were killed 
exxon says it spent more than 2 billion in last years cleanup 
hiring more than 10000 workers and leasing more than 1000 boats 
for the operation the company says it plans a greatly reduced 
cleanup this year 
a technical advisory group composed of representatives of the 
coast guard the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
the alaska department of environmental conservation and exxon has 
been meeting for a week to determine cleanup methods for about 600 
shoreline sites 
recommendations include simply picking up tarladen mats coating 
rocky shorelines and raking shoveling and using backhoes or other 
equipment to remove deepseated oil from rocks and soil 
proposals also include spraying fertilizer or chemicals on 
beaches to break down the remaining oil 
certain cleanup methods have created some controversy and state 
regulators have not yet said whether they will approve the use of 
fertilizers on shorelines or the introduction of large machinery 
exxon and a subsidiary exxon shipping co are scheduled to go 
on trial in us district court in anchorage on june 18 on two 
felony charges and three misdemeanors in the spill 
the skipper of the exxon valdez capt joseph hazelwood was 
convicted last month of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge 
of oil into state waters but was acquitted of more serious charges

a lawyer for united press international told a 
federal appeals court wednesday it could go out of business if 
reuters is allowed to terminate a photo exchange agreement 
three judges of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals reserved 
decision on upis request for an injunction barring reuters from 
terminating the contract 
the judges however extended an earlier stay that keeps the 
agreement in effect until they issue a written decision 
the contract between the news services was made in 1984 and 
called for upi to supply reuters with pictures from the united 
states and for reuters to provide upi with pictures from other 
countries it was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985 
we will immediately lose customers the minute reuters cuts us 
off upi lawyer mitchell karlan told the court if we are 
unable to get pictures from reuters upi is going out of business 
upi is appealing a decision by us district judge peter k 
leisure that the agency had not shown it would be irreparably 
harmed if the arrangement was discontinued 
the injunction request stemmed from a counterclaim by upi to a 
reuters lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange agreement 
reuters said the agreement was not living up to expectations 
robert sugarman an attorney for reuters argued against the 
injunction on the grounds that upi had not shown how many customers 
it would lose without foreign photos from reuters 
sugarman pointed to testimony from upi chairman earl brian that 
upi had negotiated to receive foreign photos from the french news 
service agence francepresse for a threemonth period in the 
event the reuters contract is discontinued 
in a statement brian said we will continue to pursue upis 
rights by confronting reuters erratic and unwarranted behavior we 
take further encouragement from todays hearing and continuation of 
the order against reuters 
we at upi consider photos and graphics a strategically vital 
component of our business today and in the 1990s he said

a federal judge ordered the government 
wednesday to carry out an agreement to repair or replace more than 
2200 units of rental housing for people who were displaced by last 
octobers earthquake 
us district judge eugene lynch rejected arguments by the 
federal emergency management agency that the agreement was signed 
under a misunderstanding and should be cancelled or changed to 
limit femas obligations 
legal aid lawyers said fema was trying to eliminate more than 
twothirds of the aid it had promised to provide 
now we can get on with implementation of the agreement 
attorney stephen ronfeldt of the legal aid society of alameda 
county told reporters femas job is to address an emergency not 
to back out of an agreement 
he said fema is required to make money available to local 
government to repair the housing units build new housing or 
provide the former residents with housing vouchers by midjuly the 
agreement covers alameda san francisco and santa cruz counties 
assistant us attorney george stoll said local fema officials 
were awaiting instructions from washington 
the units were in residential hotels and other singleroom 
rentals that were made uninhabitable by the oct 17 quake 
fema was sued by poor people who were denied housing aid because 
they had not lived in their last residence at least 30 days or 
because they lived in housing shared with others who received aid 
in the settlement signed feb 23 fema agreed to make funding 
available to replace all lost lowincome housing units in the three 
counties but a month later the agency said it did not consider 
itself required to replace housing for displaced people who had 
found new homes and were receiving temporary cash help from the 
government 
lynch ruled however that fema was bound by the agreement 
which required replacement of all the housing units

120footdeep pacific waters three miles south of the resort the 
us southern command said 
the search was suspended wednesday night and will resume 
thursday morning said panamas director of civil aviation jaime 
fabrega 
the americans were listed as anita heck karl heck lisa larglow 
and richard poux according to panamanian civil aviation sources 
no hometowns and ages were available and late wednesday the state 
department in washington said it had no details on the plane crash 
or the americans on board 
asked if other survivors had been located fabrega said for 
now no 
he told reporters since we havent reached the plane it 
would be foolish to say anything more 
a statement by the airline blamed the crash on the failure of 
the right engine after a group of birds flew into it at takeoff 
aviation experts say that in such incidents the impact of the 
birds causes the engines turbines to stop forcing the plane to 
stall 
the statement added that those rescued and taken to panama city 
were frederick pirot jr 14 and mrs ana jury the passenger 
list shows two others with the name of pirot presumably related 
to him 
mrs jury of switzerland suffered a broken vertebra and 
pirot of france suffered a broken arm the airline said 
the rest of the passengers and two crew members were 
panamanians the civil aviation office said 
the plane was en route from contadora about 50 miles southeast 
of panama city to the capital 
the pacific resort island is where former panamanian leader omar 
torrijos gave refuge for several months to the shah of iran 
mohammad reza pahlavi after the shahs 1979 exile 
it also was the site of a 1981 meeting by four latin foreign 
ministers mexico venezuela colombia and panama to negotiate the 
first attempts at peace in central america

greece on tuesday warned it would expel a 
syrian diplomat unless he gave a satisfactory explanation to a 
statement that appeared to support terrorism 
foreign minister antonis samaras summoned syrian ambassador 
shahine farrah and asked him to explain a statement made by the 
embassys economic counselor mohamed el sayed in a press release 
last week 
the newspaper apogevmatini said last week that sayed had said in 
a release that i am an educated and religious man and naturally 
i do not rule out absolutely any form of violence in political 
activity 
sayed said the statement was incorrect and that his typist had 
added a single letter to its greek text changing the meaning of 
what he said was intended to be a rejection of violence 
government spokesman vyron polydoras said the foreign 
minister warned that the diplomat in question will be classified 
persona non grata with all that that implies in the event that 
the explanations are not deemed satisfactory 
in a telephone interview sayed said we have sent our 
explanation of the mistake to the newspaper tomorrow the embassy 
will forward it to the foreign ministry 
in his press release sayed also denied an april 8 report in 
apogevmatini claiming that he was involved in the assassination of 
conservative lawmaker pavlos bakoyannis on sept 26 
bakoyannis spokesman of the conservative new democracy party 
and soninlaw of newlyelected premier constantine mitsotakis was 
killed by unidentified gunmen 
the shadowy november 17 leftist terrorist group claimed 
responsibility for the murder the group has killed 14 people since 
it first emerged in 1975 none of its members have been arrested

diets with about twice the amount of fiber and 
vegetables now consumed by most americans can reduce the risk of 
colon cancer by about 40 percent a government study shows 
a research report published today in the journal of the national 
cancer institute reviewed 37 studies conducted since 1973 and found 
what it called a great deal of evidence that diets rich in 
fiber and vegetables protect people against colon cancer 
the data suggest a reduction in risk of approximately 40 
percent for persons consuming diets high in fiber and vegetables 
the report said furthermore there are undeniable cardiovascular 
benefits and little likelihood of adverse consequences associated 
with this data 
bruce trock a researcher at fox chase cancer center in 
philadelphia said the evidence is powerful and very clear

imagine a life in which youre banned from 
practicing your profession teacher you cant teach painter put 
away those brushes playwright you will never see your work 
performed in your own country 
worse the government will incarcerate you for defying those 
rules and when youre not in prison it will find you work as a 
cab driver and a brewery worker 
this was the life of vaclav havel the dissident czechoslovakian 
playwright who now leads a country still hungover from the 
intoxicating revolution that has rewritten its history 
to get a gut feeling for what havels life has been like lately 
watch havels audience with history on pbs friday 
hosted by paul newman the documentary chronicles the first 
public performance of a havel play in czechoslovakia 
it is january and havel has been president for two weeks the 
play titled audience is 15 years old and the new 
czechoslovakian leader is in the emotional audience his disheveled 
manner makes him one of the worlds most unlikely presidential 
candidates 
the play premiered jan 8 at the cinoherni club just off 
wenceslas square the site of czechoslovakias mass demonstrations 
the fact it debuted at all was due to two new yorkbased 
documentary producers who thought god weve got to do this 
robert kanter and michael wolkowitz first saw audience 
performed in new york by newmans actors studio that was december 
and czechoslovakias velvet revolution was in full tilt 
what if kanter and wolkowitz thought we took this production 
to prague in 47 days they arranged the financing secured havels 
blessings lugged a crew onto a transatlantic flight and completed 
filming 
we never stopped to question it said kanter 37 in a phone 
interview from new york from the beginning we thought this was 
something we had to do 
but seeing it become a reality was overwhelming 
i cried michael cried it was probably the most incredible 
theatrical experience of my life he said 
foreign correspondent dan fisher who covered the velvet 
revolution for the los angeles times also was in the 
audience audience 
to actually see it done in public is something else fisher 
said in a phone interview from london 
audience laden with obscenities and chockfull of 
absurdity showcases a sodden conversation between a sleazy 
communist brewmaster and the blacklisted playwright forced to work 
for him 
havel molded the playwright after himself the brewmaster is a 
composite of brewery workers he was ordered to work with 
the country prohibited its publication but czechoslovakians 
typed the play and passed it through the underground it was so 
wellread that hitchhikers could recite it verbatim 
kanter and wolkowitzs production ran four performances two 
were in english featuring the actors studio cast and two in 
czech starring czech actors 
in the czech version of the twocharacter oneact play exiled 
actor pavel landovsky a longtime friend of havels walked onto a 
czechoslovakian stage for the first time in 12 years 
in the documentary alongside outtakes of the audience 
performances interviews and film clips chronicle havels long and 
torturous battle as playwright and dissident 
the new president is lefthanded writes at night and cant chop 
wood worth a darn we learn from his wife olga 
childhood pal and lifetime friend film director milos forman 
says that in school havel was the most shy inconspicuous kid 
that is obvious while watching havel address the cinoherni club 
audience which was double the theaters capacity and spilled out 
onto the street where television monitors had been mounted 
the president alternately stared at his fingernails and picked 
at his moustache while talking to theatergoers that included new 
heads of state us congressmen and american ambassador shirley 
temple black 
to get to the cinoherni club havel drove himself 
the irony of havels work is perhaps best summed up by forman 
who notes during the pbs documentary 
the good news is that vaclav havel is the president of 
czechoslovakia the bad news is that he cant ever write plays 
again

elsewhere in television 
whole lot of havel if youre interested in seeing more of 
havels work tune in early friday pbs will broadcast havels 
largo desolato starring oscarwinner f murray abraham phoebe 
cates and sally kirkland this play also draws on havels life 
focusing on two days in the life of a dissident writer who is 
waiting for the knock at the door that may send him to prison

jack kemp according to jack kemp is a 
bleeding heart conservative supply side progressive suburban 
republican and never mind the commas that compound description 
comes in one burst 
kemp is an activist in a relatively passive administration and 
glad to be there he says on the team not the pitcher or the 
catcher but nevertheless fielding an important position in the 
george bush lineup it is a politically delicate position because 
he inherited a republican scandal 
im not the republican national committee chairman as i tell 
anybody who wants me to come in to speak in their district kemp 
says im the secretary of housing and urban development 
as the boss of the cabinet agency that bequeathed this 
administration a reaganera scandal over political 
influencepeddling and federal grants kemp says he has rationed 
his role in the 1992 congressional campaign 
do i go yes he said over his rapidly cooling salmon lunch 
am i careful yes i dont want this to be confused with the 
republican committee as it was in the past 
nor kemp said should he be confused with the candidate he was 
in the past 
not now anyhow 
he is purposefully vague about the political future saying that 
he likes what hes doing sees it as an opportunity for republicans 
to demonstrate that they care about the cities and the poor and can 
improve the lot of both 
kemp waves off the observation that the republican 
administration wants to spend less not more on the construction 
of housing for the poor he says thats not the way to do it that 
tax and other incentives will spur private investment while the 
prospect of owning their homes will help the poor break out of the 
welfare and project housing cycle 
its the same supplyside theory kemp advanced as the house 
sponsor of the tax cut that eventually became the centerpiece of 
reaganomics now he argues for president bushs proposal to cut the 
capital gains tax rate saying it will benefit low income americans 
by creating jobs and opportunities and for the enterprise zone 
plan he pushed as a member of congress 
that program would waive the capital gains tax altogether and 
provide other tax breaks to attract investment into economically 
blighted districts 
critics call it trickledown republican economics kemp told 
congress it would open a niagara falls of economic growth in 
depressed neighborhoods and he tells republicans that if they show 
a real and lasting commitment to dealing with the problems of 
lowincome americans theirs will become the majority party 
kemp is pushing that mission and not quietly he says he wants 
this administration to wage war on poverty with different methods 
but about the same goals as the one attempted by lyndon b johnson 
that slogan isnt popular with everyone around the cabinet table 
but kemp isnt deterred 
i try to be pithy in my advice he says smiling 
kemp is not in a job he sought but now that he has it he tells 
audiences he was born for it his first choice of course would 
have been the presidency he sought the 1988 republican nomination 
with conservative backing but limped in the primaries and quit the 
race early he was on the list of vice presidential prospects and 
would have relished the nomination dan quayle got in the cabinet 
he would have preferred treasury 
but hud is working out for all the headaches that go with the 
earlier ethics and influence scandals those problems made it an 
agency in need of change reform and repair and that makes kemps 
role more visible 
while he wont speculate on a possible next step kemp said it 
is no secret that he would not want to stay at the department 
through eight years of a bush administration then he quickly adds 
that i want to stay on the team for as long as the president 
wants him 
kemp says hes a team player part of what he describes as the 
outer circle of the bush administration i dont expect to be on 
the inner circle he said the real insiders were with bush 
before his nomination in those days kemp was an opponent 
he said he harbors no thoughts about running for president again 
an obligatory disclaimer for a political figure in his situation 
ive had three great careers said kemp 54 a professional 
football quarterback then a nineterm new york congressman before 
he joined the bush cabinet i have absolutely no thoughts of 96 
ill be 61 or 62 he said ill be too old 
bush was 64 when he was inaugurated

it may be true that it never rains on investors 
in money market mutual funds but every now and then in moneyfund 
land the rumble of distant thunder can be heard 
that message was driven home afresh a few days ago with the news 
that a prominent firm that manages a group of funds had dipped into 
its own pocket to protect its money fund against the threat of a 
loss 
t rowe price associates of baltimore which runs a 28 
billionplus stable of investments that includes 30 mutual funds 
said it had bought 646 million in securities of mortgage amp realty 
trust from portfolios it manages 
the market price of mamprts commercial paper or shortterm ious 
appeared ready to suffer a drop after the real estate investment 
trust filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy law 
though t rowe price said it hopes and expects mamprt eventually 
to pay everything it owes on the paper the firm acted to stave off 
even the possibility of a small and temporary dip in the net asset 
value of its prime reserve fund and unspecified other pools of 
money 
price wasnt the only fund manager caught in that bind erick 
kanter a spokesman for the investment company institute a trade 
group said there were about half a dozen in all but declined 
to identify any of the others 
in no case apparently did money fund shareholders lose any 
money since the fund sponsors followed a precedent that is fast 
becoming the customary practice in cases like this 
when a fund is sitting on an investment that is losing market 
value because of a drop in the issuers credit standing it can be 
made whole through the sale of that security to the separate 
entity with different owners that sponsors the fund 
still the fact remains that fund managers typically are under 
no legal obligation to do this and conceivably could find 
themselves unable to take such action in some future instance 
involving large multiple defaults 
money funds however safe their records may be remain 
securities subject to at least theoretical risks without any 
backing from federal deposit insurance or any other government 
guarantee 
but that basic disclaimer doesnt answer the question of what 
further responsibilities if any should fall on the industry as in 
continues the growth that has brought it nearly 400 billion in 
assets in just two decades of existence 
right now the chief response of many fund advisers seems to 
have been to upgrade the safety of their holdings especially in 
commercial paper where they are already forbidden to venture 
beyond issuers with high credit ratings 
from the point of view of moneyfund investors and of a 
financial system in which the funds play an increasingly important 
role is that enough 
even the highest rating is no absolute assurance of safety in an 
investment like commercial paper which normally is not secured by 
any particular asset of the corporation that issues it 
says james grant financial newsletter publisher and frequent 
critic of many credit practices of recent years now that the 
corporate credit risk has been positively identified in the 
junkbond market perhaps it is time to look somewhere else for 
it 
at the same time officials in the industry dismiss recurrent 
conjecture that they might have set up or be planning to create 
some unpublicized rainyday reserve to help cope with any future 
crisis 
perhaps some day money funds will have a backup system analagous 
to deposit insurance in banking but it could prove a painful error 
for investors to suppose that any such thing exists today

corporate management is maturing and it 
probably means a more competitive industrial america in the 1990s 
it is very good news says professor eugene jennings 
jennings assessment is based on research of corporate and 
managerial data an endeavor now into its fifth decade making it 
the longest existing and continuing study of business by the same 
researcher 
it began in the 1950s with the curiosity of a young man seeking 
to make his mark in university circles it continues with the same 
intensity but the man is now a professor emeritus adviser to 
corporate chairmen and a prolific author 
in writing the manuscript for a new book to be called 
chiefs jennings professor emeritus of management at michigan 
state universitys graduate school of business found that american 
corporate management now blends some of the best of the new ideas 
with those proven in the past 
it leads him to conclude industrial america is probably 
better positioned for competition now than ever before judging 
from the qualities of chiefs selected in the past decade 
the comparisons of various measurements of corporate chiefs are 
consistent each tending to support the other 
first jennings compared the ratios of what he calls natives and 
immigrants in his lexicon a native is a chief who grew up within 
the company and an immigrant is one appointed from outside the 
business 
in pre1960s days corporations were inflexible chiefs almost 
always were named from within the company in the 1960s the ratio 
became 5050 meaning just as many were brought into the company as 
were nurtured within 
in the 1980s however the ratios shifted back to a middle 
position now three times as many chief executives are appointed 
from within as from without it indicates says jennings that 
boards are being more selective in their search for the best no 
longer are they blind to the possibilities of outsiders but they 
also recognize the importance of promoting from within 
he made another comparison in pre1960s there was no such 
thing as an early arrival or a person appointed chief executive at 
age 49 or younger in the 1960s 40 percent were early arrivals 
now it is down to 25 percent 
the blend of old and new continues in another test in the 
prewatershed days of the 1960s socalled late arrivals age 58 or 
older made up 30 percent of appointments in the 1960s late 
arrivals dropped out of sight companies wanted young blood but in 
the 1980s the percentage rose to 21 percent 
at this point says jennings some people might think of the 
1960s as irresponsible at any rate he said they had very poor 
screening of the top executives the antiestablishment attitude 
it seems rose to the very top 
a fourth test underscored the consistency of old to new to 
middle ground 
in prewatershed days almost nobody was named chief executive 
who didnt have his hands on the product such as in sales and 
manufacturing these people are often said to have online 
experience 
in the 1960s that old way changed more than 50 percent were 
named who had no hands on experience but in the 1980s screening 
committees rediscovered the old ways the percentage without hands 
on experience dropped to 27 percent 
still another test showed similar results migrant chiefs or 
chairmen appointed from outside were uncommon before the 1960s 
but all at least had experience within the industry 
in the 1960s however only a slim majority of those named chief 
had experience within the same industry but that too changed in 
the 1980s the vast majority of migrants had experience within the 
particular industry 
same trend with another test this one age before the 1960s it 
took 33 years to produce a chief in the decade of the 1960s it 
took only 215 years then in the 1980s it rose to 26 years as 
industry opted for more experience 
to jennings it means that today american industry wants and is 
getting seasoned and surefooted executives preferring them to 
the younger vital exhuberant types 
in a sense he says screening committees are seeking better 
corporate health just as all america does when it seeks better 
nutrition and care in handling drugs and arteryclogging foods 
business is choosing good blood over fresh blood he says 
industry he says is getting a better balance of proteins and 
carbohydrates rather than fresh blood hyped with vitamins

the united nations had a major success 
in guiding this vast arid land to independence from south africa 
and learned important lessons for future operations in troubled 
aearlong effort was one of the world organizatioreas 
the yns largest 
and most expensive the un mission overcame several crises that 
threatened to derail independence for namibia after 75 years of 
south african rule 
as the united nations withdraws it is being praised by namibia 
and other countries local residents gave farewell parties for the 
personnel of un offices around the new country sometimes 
slaughtering sheep and oxen for the occasion 
untag will forever be remembered by our people foreign 
minisy matters dealt with by field workers had nothing to do with 
independence 
the local untag stations became a place to bring ones 
problems eckhard said people even sought help for marital 
disputes 
south africa threatened to cancel the elections days before the 
scheduled date in november claiming un radio traffic was 
reporting an infiltration by swapo guerrillas south africa 
withdrew the allegations but suspicions remained 
seven political parties led by swapo won constituent assembly 
seats in an election that attracted 97 percent of the eligible 
voters 
we effectively trained hundreds of un personnel for 
politically delicate field missions and learned quite a lot about 
how to respond in tense situations eckhard said 
the un took over social services that had been provided by 
namibias territorial army he said such as health care teaching 
school and delivering food to remote villages 
he said the namibia operation was being reviewed and future 
electionmonitoring operations probably would be run largely by 
policemen and civilians with fewer soldiers 
five hundred policemen and 4650 soldiers were in the original 
un contingent for namibia but 1000 more police were sent when 
it became evident they were best equipped to monitor elections 
eckhard said 
by the time independence day arrived march 21 political parties 
had unanimously agreed to a democratic constitution and joined a 
call for national reconciliation after 23 years of war 
i would like to make this country a kind of a model of what 
all african countries all developing countries should be un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said at the independence 
celebrations 
the namibian operation cost 373 million 40 million below the 
budget estimate

the tide of democracy sweeping eastern 
europe is being felt in black africa but oneparty rule still 
predominates and three of the major states have publicly committed 
themselves to it 
tanzania has had only one party for 26 years and said this month 
the policy will not change kenya did the same and zimbabwes 
leader robert mugabe declared his intention to install oneparty 
rule 
if we have many political parties we will have chaos as 
different tribes rush to form theirs president daniel arap moi 
of kenya told trainee teachers at laikipia in central kenya 
tribal inclinations and consciousness is still paramount in the 
minds of many kenyans 
for now i say no to the multiparty system at least until we 
are cohesive enough as a nation he said 
kenya has 40 tribes in a population of 22 million ethnic 
feuding is common in parliament at public rallies and in the press 
moi a 66yearold a former teacher from the minority kalenjin 
tribe inherited the oneparty system in 1978 from the late 
president jomo kenyatta the nations founder kenyatta had banned 
opposition parties nine years earlier 
kenyatta created a de facto oneparty state by locking up his 
political opponents moi made it constitutional in 1982 
the presidents statement was his first on the subject since 
some other african states began considering more liberalized 
political systems this year 
he spoke after weeks of debate in nairobi newspapers about 
whether kenya should restore the style of democracy bequeathed to 
kenyatta when he led the former british colony to independence in 
1963 
writers supporting the status quo argued that kenya had 
prospered under the current system without tribal strife they 
said a return to the old order might cause ethnic violence and 
drive away tourists and investors 
those who wanted change said kenyans were politically mature 
enough for competition that recent reforms in eastern europe 
should be used as an example and that a parliamentary opposition 
would help check official corruption mismanagement and nepotism 
neighboring tanzania a nation of 100 tribes also was a british 
colony until independence in 1961 under julius nyerere 
unlike its wealthy capitalist cousin tanzania followed 
socialism based on eastern european models both nyerere and ali 
hassan mwinyi who succeeded him as president in 1985 have 
admitted the policies were flawed 
mwinyi 65 has adopted radical economic reforms prescribed by 
western lenders but has rejected suggestions that they be 
accompanied by political change 
while a multiparty system would be suitable for europeans it 
might not be the same with tanzania mwinyi told reporters in dar 
es salaam 
what africans want is a fair return for their sweat through a 
new international economic order this cannot be solved by the 
creation of 100 parties which can bring chaos instead of 
progress 
he said tanzanians had voted consistently for a single party as 
a way to guarantee national unity he did not mention a statement 
nyerere made in february that multiparty democracy now may be 
possible 
nyerere still chairman of the ruling chama cha mapinduzi party 
remains a powerful political figure five years after he resigned as 
president 
only a few of the 50 member nations of the organization of 
african unity have westernstyle democracies 
zimbabwe is one but president robert mugabe declared after an 
overwhelming victory in recent national elections that he will 
transform the former british colony of rhodesia into a oneparty 
state 
mugabe who led zimbabwe to independence 10 years ago said the 
elections were a mandate from the 48 million registered voters to 
get rid of the opposition 
his opponents accused mugabe 66 of seeking a dictatorship 
they noted that only 54 percent of the electorate voted and 
opposition parties got 20 percent of the votes although they won 
only three of the 150 parliament seats 
benin a former french colony is pledged to eliminate oneparty 
rule gabon is debating the question and there is pressure in the 
ivory coast for a freer political order 
cameroon and niger scenes of recent political upheavals have 
rejected multiparty politics 
significant signals of change are coming from unlikely quarters 
ethiopia and mozambique have abandoned their hardline marxist 
ideologies and the marxist leaders of angola have committed 
themselves to peace talks with usbacked guerrillas that if 
fruitful could lead to open elections

when the lawsuit began sophie and milos 
malesevs daughter was in high school when it ended their 
daughters youngest son was in high school and milos had been dead 
for 17 years 
i thought they were waiting for me to die said mrs 
malesev who waited nearly 25 years to settle claims over damage 
her house sustained when a water tunnel was built through her 
neighborhood 
large urban courts typically are backlogged but wayne county 
circuit courts civil system was branded as among the nations 
moststalled in 1978 and 1984 studies by the national center for 
state courts 
now four years into a makeover that included a new computer 
system and method of assigning cases to judges the court is being 
hailed as a model 
we had a lousy caseflow management system it placed total 
responsibility everywhere and individual responsibility nowhere 
and as you see in the collapse of the communist world that doesnt 
work well said richard kaufman chief judge since 1986 
judges impatience with delays and embarrassment over the low 
ranking in the two studies spurred the changes 
perjudge caseloads have been whittled from 1900 to 1400 
nineteen of the courts 35 judges are handling fewer than 700 cases 
each and 15 of those carry fewer than 600 each 
on jan 1 1986 the court had about 60000 pending cases of 
which 17000 were old dogs more than 2 years old now just 
are 29000 pending including 2700 old dogs 
its certainly a major triumph said ken pankey of the 
national center for state courts 
wayne county is the major success story said barry mahoney 
of the denverbased institute for court management a branch of the 
national center for state courts in williamsburg va 
mahoney is planning a workshop for managers from other courts in 
detroit next year to show off what wayne county has done 
one problem with the old system was paperwork with more than 
100 cases filed daily it was hard for keypunch operators to keep 
up said terry kuykendall a deputy administrator the first change 
was a new computer system and a review of existing cases 
another help was the michigan supreme courts coincidental 
adoption of a rule that required discovery the pretrial gathering 
of information about a case to be completed in 12 months instead 
of 26 
the most important change how cases were handled evolved after 
long planning sessions with judges staff consultants and experts 
from the american bar association and national center until 1986 
incoming cases were assigned to one judge for pretrial matters and 
transferred to another for trial 
under the individual docket cases are assigned to one judge 
from the moment theyre filed hearings and other deadlines are 
scheduled automatically and the judge retains responsibility for 
every phase of the case 
kaufman picked seven judges to go on the new calendar in october 
1986 it worked every october since seven more judges have gone 
to the new system 
judge marianne battani was in the first group 
she hears her own pretrial motions and sets her own trial dates 
cases that waited three years under the old system now are finished 
in 12 to 18 months she said 
i love it battani said 
however she wonders if it will become tempting to push cases to 
settle out of court r transfer to another jurisdiction to get them 
off the books 
i think sometimes we get bogged down with statistics she 
said i think theres an urge to handle cases quickly because of 
numbers 
gerald thurswell a detroit lawyer for 22 years remembers how 
under the old system he sometimes pleaded for an accelerated trial 
date for fear his client would die before the case came up judges 
rarely granted such requests 
there were so many excuses to get a fast trial clients used 
to wait years he said 
under the new system lawyers in his firm are handling fewer 
cases at one time because of the quickened pace 
weve had to hire more attorneys thurswell said they 
move so fast judges are in competition with each other its 
better for the whole system 
its good said chris andreoff another attorney the 
advantage is you know where youll be the judges have more grasp 
because of the continuity 
detroit court officials now are hoping to meet within a few 
years aba processingtime standards that call for 90 percent of 
all civil cases to be completed in a year 98 percent to be cleared 
up within 18 months and 100 percent within two years 
currently no urban court meets that standard although a few 
come close said doug somerlot of the abas lawyers conference task 
force on the reduction of litigation cost and delay nationwide 
figures on civil delays dont exist because states use different 
data making comparisons impossible he said 
the national center is studying whether the wayne county project 
can be applied to other courts pankey said 
somerlot said persistence might be the key to wayne countys 
reform 
the most important thing he said is that they agreed it was 
a problem and worked on it

in the dim light of a supersecure 
command bunker army lt col john w wilson paced chin on chest 
listening to an intelligence report on a soviet submarine off the 
california coast 
an instant later as he glanced up at an illuminated global 
chessboard of us and sviet military forces wilson stopped 
short a voice near him cried bsts alert an earlywarning 
satellite was signaling the launch of a nuclear missile 
wilson had the comfort of knowing this was only a war game 
simulation but voices in the control center carried a serious tone 
from the moment a us surveillance plane over the pacific reported 
spotting a missile booster surging toward the surface 
for wilson it was time to start thinking about doomsday and how 
to escape 
he sent word to the white house we have a detected launch off 
the west coast 
then nearly as abruptly as the attack had begun it was 
over minutes after the count of incoming soviet missiles reached 
15 and before the warheads could hit their targets in the 
southwestern united states all were destroyed in a space and 
landbased rocket barrage orchestrated from wilsons bunker 
the crisis was a computersimulated nuclear attack it was 
not the allout assault that america has spent trillions of dollars 
trying to deter throughout the cold war but a smallscale launch 
by a rogue soviet submarine commander 
the scenario played out for reporters recently at the armys 
strategic defense command dramatizes the new rationale being 
promoted by the bush administration for investing billions in a 
star wars missile defense at a time when even the pentagon 
acknowledges that the threat of world war iii is the lowest in 40 
years 
instead of the impregnable worldwide shield against a massive 
wave of soviet missiles as originally envisioned by ronald reagan 
seven years ago promoters of the strategic defense initiative say 
a more modest defense is needed one that still would put weapons 
in space at a cost of about 55 billion but would be capable of 
knocking out only half of the soviets main intercontinental 
ballistic missile force 
the new rationale also stresses a need to protect against an 
accidental or unauthorized soviet launch or a limited missile 
attack by a third world country 
gone is reagans talk of making nuclear weapons impotent and 
obsolete the aim now is to improve the traditional role of 
offensive nuclear forces as a deterrent to war by making the odds 
of a successful first strike even more uncertain 
gone at least for the remainder of this century are ideas of 
using exotic and futuristic weaponry such as the xray laser and 
particle beam weapon that originally gave sdi the star wars 
nickname the new emphasis is on more downtoearth rapidly 
maturing technology such as kineticenergy warheads that kill 
their targets in space by ramming them at high speed 
gone too is much of the interest in congress for financing the 
project last year for the first time the sdi budget was lower 
than in the year before today its an easy target of politicians 
looking to harvest a postcold war peace dividend 
sdi is public enemy no 1 on capitol hill sen john warner 
rva said recently 
says rep charles bennett dfla who supports a scaleddown 
sdi research budget but not deployment congress hasnt voted to 
produce it and probably never will 
bush has told the pentagon he wants to be able to decide by 1992 
whether to deploy a star wars defense but he probably wont get 
the chance by then officials and scientists working on the project 
say theyll need a healthy increase in funds well above what 
congress seems likely to grant next year and in 1992 to lay a 
sound technical foundation on which bush could base his decision 
lt gen robert d hammond commander of the strategic defense 
command that handles about onethird of the star wars research 
told reporters recently that he believed bush could meet his target 
date for a deployment decision only if you have good growth in 
financing beyond the 38 billion authorized for this year 
bush has requested a 1 billion increase for next year but it 
appears unlikely hell get anything close to that he and the 
pentagon may have to live with less 
from the start more than seven years and 19 billion ago the 
project was designed as a longterm effort with little prospect 
for payoff before the turn of the century but political pressure 
to show results grew as policymakers wondered can it work is it 
affordable will the soviets find a way around it 
all three are still open questions 
the main pieces of a star wars system as currently envisioned 
are sensors to detect and track enemy missiles from their launch 
silos land and spacebased rockets to attack the missiles in 
flight and computers to manage the battle 
of those three elements the computer technology is perhaps the 
most problematic 
at the strategic defense command in hunstville where wilson and 
his team of specialists test their responses to simulated nuclear 
attacks engineers are still experimenting with computer programs 
that would be used to orchestrate a star wars response to a real 
attack 
lawrence tubbs acting chief of battle management at the 
strategic defense command said the key questions about the 
computer software are can it be adequately tested and would it 
work 
some scientists say the answer to both is no 
the problem of developing trustworthy software for the sdi is 
not a problem that will be solved in our lifetimes or those of our 
children the computer professionals for social responsibility 
wrote in an open letter to congress on feb 16 
the scientists group urged the abandonment of sdi arguing that 
a single error in the systems software could cause a complete 
system failure under unpredictable circumstances 
it appears unlikely star wars will be killed any time soon if 
only because of its economic lure about 28000 people are working 
on the project at defense contractors national laboratories 
universities and military installations in every state in the 
nation and in five foreign countries 
two aerospace companies boeing co and lockheed corp together 
have taken in 22 billion in star wars contracts over the life of 
the program according to pentagon figures that is more than 10 
percent of all star wars spending altogether more than 1000 
military contractors have a piece of star wars action 
the projects supporters say the american public will support 
more research if they get the message that the goal of ballistic 
missile defense is attainable 
lt gen george monahan director of the sdi project 
acknowledged in testimony to a house panel april 4 that much more 
work was needed to put the star war pieces together but he said 
many scientific question marks have been erased 
there is no doubt in my mind that the technology is here 
sufficient to develop and deploy such a system he said

months later sheriffs deputy bill beard 
could recall nothing unusual about his chance meeting with bruce 
parker that gray sunday morning 
the two friends shared coffee and conversation at daunas store 
a favorite gathering spot in this tiny hill country community and 
parker seemed in high spirits 
beard knew of parkers problems with members of his family and 
that his friend had returned only recently to rejoin the ranching 
clan 
like everyone else in town beard also knew the rumors of bad 
blood among the parkers an imposing family tracing its ancestry 
back to the alamo 
and finally he knew only too well the familys history of 
violence 
before nightfall that sunday last autumn parker 42 lay 
mortally wounded on a bluff overlooking big rock a scenic and 
secluded area along the little devils river in the heart of parker 
ranchland 
in just six incredible months three parkers were dead and a 
fourth was charged with murder 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to some the parker family seemed larger than life proud and 
private linked by blood to comanche chief quanah parker and by 
legend to bandit queen bonnie parker 
and certainly they were as one claimed old west big ranch 
james henry parker arrived in the rolling brittle woodlands of 
the texas hill country in the early 1870s accompanied by his young 
bride matilda a grandniece of davy crockett a name as famous as 
the alamo itself 
soon the couples original 160acre tract grew to 12000 acres 
and jim and tildy produced 11 children including a son named jess 
who in 1913 married lorena milam a relative of ben milam another 
history book hero 
in the late 1930s jess called big daddy and lorena big 
mama moved into the remote family homesite now known as old 
ranch and raised five children 
the four boys doyle cecil raymond and aubrey chose to 
ranch with their father who set aside land for each but even 
then life was not as harmonious as big daddy would have liked 
friends said the relationship between doyle and cecil was 
severely strained and everyone suspected the feud involved land 
after cecil parker died in 1968 his widow and family which 
included bruce and his two sisters were all but banished from the 
ranch it was big daddy himself who reluctantly urged them to 
leave before something bad happens according to bruce parkers 
elder son bart now 24 
but at big daddys death the old mans will restored a 
parcel of parker land to his grandchildren and bruce returned with 
a new wife and a new outlook on life 
a carpenter by profession but a cowboy by preference bruce 
parker looked and lived the part of a man born and raised on a 
sprawling texas ranch 
handsome hardworking and easygoing parker rarely dressed in 
anything other than boots jeans western shirts and cowboy hats 
only 19 when his father died and his family was ousted bruce 
bounced around the hill country working at an assortment of jobs 
but always he was drawn back to kimble county 
it wasnt that the land was so important but this is where 
his home was said linda whose 1983 marriage to bruce was the 
second for them both being away was like a great big empty hole 
in him 
in the fall of 1986 shortly after inheriting his ranchland 
bruce guided linda to a hilltop commanding a regal view of the 
countryside below 
producing blueprints of a twostory house he embraced her and 
asked how would you like a house like this built right here 
i remember telling him i would never love him as much as i did 
at that moment she said 
bruce himself built the house a spacious country home 
constructed in part with native rock not unlike what his 
greatgrandfather used more than a century ago 
early one morning as they sipped coffee and watched their 
horses grazing below bruce told linda he was never happier but 
still was troubled by something 
im afraid somebodys going to come and take this away she 
recalled him saying 
nobody can take this away from you she replied its 
yours 
in both good times and bad linda said bruce was always very 
proud to be a parker 
they are wonderful honest hardworking people she 
said there is nothing superficial about them theyre either for 
you or against you there is no inbetween 
and she said most were supportive after bruces death 
on that fateful weekend last october the couple attended a 
friday night football game at harper high school where bruce once 
played quarterback 
bruce spent much of the weekend working on his uncle raymonds 
ranch where he had leased the hunting and fishing rights he drove 
along little devils river where years ago the parker clan 
gathered under shade trees across from big rock 
they would barbecue steers and goats at the rivers edge and 
sing and dance to live music often until dawn 
this was bruces favorite spot in the whole world linda 
said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the parkers worked and played hard and though they kept a low 
profile they seemed eerily doomed to uncommon and often violent 
tragedy some real bad luck according to kimble county 
sheriff pat davis 
one of big daddys brothers and his wife died in a double 
shooting in 1935 no motive ever was uncovered but a note 
indicated the couple formed a suicide pact 
five years later jim parkers granddaughter was slain by her 
husband who cut her throat and in 1962 one of parkers 
greatgrandsons was shot and killed in a dispute over a girl he was 
dating 
but it was an episode last summer that set the tone for the most 
recent violence 
jesse jett parker another of big daddys illfated 
nephews was gunned down on parker ranchland june 10 an apparent 
robbery victim 
investigators said a warrant was issued for a fugitive from 
mexico but no arrest has been made 
no one professes to know who or what lured bruce parker to the 
bluff above big rock that sunday last october 
there was not a hint of trouble linda said and if there had 
been renewed friction between bruce and any of his relatives i 
think we would have known it

she last saw her husband alive down at the camphouse where he 
was working that afternoon when she returned from an errand he 
was gone 
the phone call from big mama the aging matriarch of the 
parker clan came at dinnertime lorena parker told her something 
had happened to bruce 
a sizable crowd already had gathered atop the bluff when linda 
arrived her husbands lifeless body face down in a pool of blood 
was sprawled along the dirt road on the drivers side of the pickup 
deputy bill beard the first officer at the scene spotted a 
powder burn about the size of a halfdollar on his friends chest 
he privately concluded that bruces death was a homicide 
there were too many things that didnt add up to a 
selfinflicted wound beard said 
bruces western hat was on the hood of the truck which kimble 
county sheriff pat davis considered significant 
they said when he was mad and about ready to fight the first 
thing he did was take his hat off and set it down davis said 
it looks like there might be some sort of altercation 
linda would not totally accept that premise but never did she 
embrace the theory her husband killed himself 
the motive behind the slaying 
jealousy and greed she snapped 
would she explain 
no she replied all of this will come out in court 
an investigator speaking despite a judicial gag order may have 
struck close to the truth 
the family got larger and larger he drawled and the land 
smaller and smaller

in midnovember a steady stream of parkers clattered across the 
bridge spanning the llano river and rolled up to the old 
brickandstone courthouse in junction 
for two days they and others appeared before grand jurors to 
answer questions about the events of oct 29 
among the witnesses subpoenaed were doyle parker 75 and his 
brother raymond 66 the uncle who owned the land where the 
shooting occurred 
friends knew doyle as a man with a fondness for cigars and a 
dedication to ranching and family he spent his entire life on 
parker land and had acquired holdings beyond what he inherited from 
big daddy 
unlike doyle raymond left the parker conclave for san antonio 
and spent 17 years in business before returning to the ranch in his 
later years 
after hearing two days of testimony grand jurors returned a 
murder indictment accusing doyle parker of intentionally and 
knowingly killing his nephew 
he was arrested but quickly freed on 25000 bail a trial date 
is pending 
ron sutton the district attorney calls his case 
circumstantial and complicated but says he is eager to 
prosecute despite doyle parkers advanced age 
his mothers in good shape at 92 and his father lived to be 
97 sutton said these people live forever down there unless 
they get shot 
the frostladen northers that usher in a hill country winter 
were no match for the chill that penetrated the parker compound in 
the days following the indictment 
according to investigators and others big mama indirectly 
blamed her son raymond for bruces death even though doyle stood 
legally accused authorities said she felt the tragedy occurred 
because raymond had granted his nephew hunting and fishing rights 
to sacred parker ground 
raymond said nothing at least publicly 
on a sunday night in early december he picked up his 
22caliber automatic pistol and disappeared into the bathroom of 
his ranch home without a word or a note he blew his brains out 
he left behind only his grand jury testimony secret by law

sandra bullock was visiting los angeles when 
she heard on television that the nbc sitcom working girl was 
seeking a new leading lady 
shed had only a few jobs as a new yorkbased actress and was 
hoping to find regular work in the larger market for performers 
here 
nancy mckeon had just left the show and i heard on a news show 
they were looking for someone bullock said i knew a lot of 
people who auditioned for it they were seeing a bunch of people 
and my agent sent me finally it got down to about five people 
and we went to the network i think it was my begging that got me 
the job 
working girl a spring tryout series is based on the hit 
comedy movie starring melanie griffith harrison ford and sigourney 
weaver griffith was nominated for an academy award for her role as 
tess mcgill the character bullock plays 
tess is a young secretary from staten island who becomes a 
junior executive in manhattan and the series draws on contrasts 
between her home life and life in the corporate world 
it also stars george newbern as a preppie coworker nana 
visitor as her harddriving boss tom orourke as a selfmade 
corporate powerhouse edye byrde as the seenitall temp 
anthony tyler quinn as a neighborhood romeo and judy prescott as 
tess best friend from childhood 
tess is a very stubborn woman but in a good way bullock 
said shes a little more daring in her choices than i am shes 
headstrong but she would not sacrifice her beliefs or her family 
to get ahead 
in the first show shes a secretary again then she has to 
adjust to becoming a junior executive she doesnt quite fit in and 
her accent doesnt quite fit in 
the concept has undergone changes to adapt it from a movie to a 
sitcom and tess character has been altered somewhat since melanie 
griffith is softer while bullock has more of an edge 
nancy mckeon formerly of the facts of life had been set to 
portray tess but left the show because of creative differences 
before working girl bullock had worked mostly in small 
films 
i had a few lines in the abc movie the preppie murder she 
said i was in the bionic showdown with lee majors and lindsay 
wagner in new york i did a lot of small independent films the 
kind you find through the trade papers 
two of those movies that will be coming out are who shot 
patakango about racial gang violence and religion inc a 
satire in which she plays a bythebook lawyer 
bullock was born in germany her mother was a german opera 
singer and her father was an american voice teacher who had been 
in the us army there 
once in a while id come down with one of my fathers voice 
students and hit high c she said ive never had a desire to 
sing i guess because my parents did it so well i wanted to do 
something else 
i loved acting i was a ham i was good at goofing off i 
didnt know if i wanted to do acting permanently when i started in 
college but i did love goofing off because i was no good at math 
bullock attended east carolina university in greenville nc 
one of the first things i did out of college was no time 
flat she said they were looking for a southern belle 
although im certainly not southern its a comedy about a vietnam 
vet who looks up his old girlfriend and i answer the door im her 
daughter and i go along with him 
bullock said she had a difficult time auditioning for roles in 
new york because nobody could put a label on her 
nobody knew what to make of me she said i was too 
offbeat i auditioned for two soaps but they said whered you 
come from they were looking for the girl next door id try to 
put a little humor in it ashley i didnt know i had any 
children i couldnt get a line like that out of my mouth without 
laughing 
to pay bills she worked as a bartender and cocktail waitress 
i learned a lot of accents as a bartender she said a lot 
of girls came in looking for rich husbands i learned to imitate 
them

it was one of the most widely quoted oneliners 
in wall streets insider trading scandal your bunny has a good 
nose but there was nothing funny about it for robert freeman 
the former head of arbitrage for goldman sachs amp co was 
ordered tuesday to serve four months in prison and pay a 1 million 
fine for trading securities after hearing the comment which helped 
him conclude that a takeover deal was in trouble 
us district judge pierre leval said he imposed a prison term 
to send a message to wall street that insider trading and other 
whitecollar crime cannot be treated lightly 
these practices seriously undermine the integrity of the 
marketplace he said later adding it is perhaps one of the 
consequences of enormous power and wealth that there are 
downsides 
leva sentenced freeman to one year in prison but suspended the 
last eight months of the term the judge said he rejected a lengthy 
term because freeman was shown to be a good man who was chastened 
by his crime freeman faced a maximum of five years 
the sentence capped one of the longest and most contentious 
episodes in the governments crackdown on insider trading stemming 
from the confessions of former stock speculator ivan f boesky 
freeman 47 pleaded guilty last august to one count of mail 
fraud for using illegally obtained inside information to trade 
securities in connection with the proposed takeover of beatrice 
cos by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
he admitted getting information from former kidder peabody amp 
co investment banker martin siegel who has pleaded guilty to two 
counts and is awaiting sentencing kidder represented kkr in the 
proposed takeover 
the case turned on a comment made by siegel after freeman called 
him on jan 8 1986 to try to confirm rumors that the beatrice 
takeover was in jeopardy 
freeman told siegel he had heard about problems in the deal from 
a prominent new york stock exchange trader bernard bunny 
lasker siegel responded your bunny has a good nose freeman 
said in an account of the episode 
after taking the call freeman reduced goldmans stake in 
beatrice he admitted to a felony crime for the action but defense 
lawyers said it did not merit prison the government had requested 
prison time 
mr freeman is a good man who made a mistake that he has 
admitted for which he has been punished extraordinarily defense 
attorney paul curran said citing the agony that mr freeman and 
his family had to endure beginning with his arrest on false charges 
three years ago 
freeman was arrested in february 1987 along with two other wall 
street executives on charges the us attorneys office in 
manhattan called the tip of the iceberg 
but the government dropped the original indictments and last 
year called off its investigation of the two others timothy tabor 
and richard wigton wigton was arrested on his trading floor and 
hauled away in handcuffs the nature of the arrests and their 
disposition provoked outrage on wall street 
leval said the conversation with siegel who implicated freeman 
after he was linked to insider trading by boesky was illegal and 
deserved prison 
although the answer was couched in veiled language it 
constituted the illegal transaction of inside information leval 
said there is no question he knew full well he was breaking 
the law 
the 1 million fine was about twice the trading loss avoided by 
goldman freeman and his clients by selling the beatrice holdings 
the maximum penalty under the law leval said freeman has 30 days 
to pay 
freeman who lives in the new york suburb of rye also was 
placed on two years probation and ordered to serve 300 hours of 
community service freeman asked to serve his sentence in a 
minimumsecurity prison camp in pensacola fla he must surrender 
to the government june 19

the chicago mercantile exchange hopes its newly 
proposed curbs on dualtrading will convince federal regulators to 
stop considering more drastic bans 
members of the exchange voted tuesday to approve a 
managementbacked plan to ban the controversial practice for 
twothirds of the mercs trading volume 
the merc said 76 percent of the 1561 ballots cast favored the 
restrictions which were drawn up by an exchange committee and 
approved recently by board of governors the exchange has 2500 
active members 
dualtrading is the longstanding practice of floor brokers 
trading for their own accounts and for customers 
a government probe of the merc and the chicago board of trade 
zeroed in on dualtrading and other practices as key factors in 
trader abuse 
despite the potential for abuse the merc and the board of trade 
argue that dualtrading brings an added level of liquidity to the 
market helping guarantee that at any moment someone wanting to 
sell or buy a contract will find someone with whom to do business 
the proposal approved by merc members would ban dualtrading in 
contracts that have a proven record of liquidity 
contracts in which there isnt much business usually those for 
delivery in distant months still would permit dualtrading 
the lightly traded contracts also are more easily monitored for 
abuses said merc spokesman andrew yemma 
the commoditiy futures trading commission has proposed a trial 
reform in which dualtrading would be banned for all delivery 
months for one financial future and one agricultural commodity 
the merc said it will ask the cftc to approve the exchanges 
proposal in lieu of the agencys pilot program 
the cftc is expected to make a final determination late in the 
summer 
congress also is considering dualtrading restrictions that 
would be potentially more severe than those proposed by the merc 
the mercs proposed restrictions were recommended by a committee 
that reviewed trading practices in light of the government 
investigation in which 48 people mostly traders have been 
indicted 
even before the investigation was revealed last year the merc 
banned dualtrading in 1987 for 90 percent of the trades in its 
standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures pit 
there was a feeling among members in the pit that there were 
abuses of dualtrading that needed to be addressed said yemma 
the board of trade also believes the cftc proposal goes too far 
said cbot spokesman michael oconnell 
there currently are no restrictions on dualtrading at the board 
of trade and officials there want to keep it that way oconnell 
said dualtrading accounts for a great source of market 
liquidity he said

bank of new england corp says it plans to make 
the company smaller but stronger by stripping its troubled real 
estate loans from its main banking business 
the strategy unveiled tuesday will create a separate 
collecting bank to deal with a mountain of troubled loans and 
use advertising to allay depositor fears 
the plan also calls for the bank to sell its rhode island and 
maine subsidiaries and eventually cut its assets to about 20 
billion assets currently stand at 25 billion and were 32 billion 
just last fall 
solving the banks problems will require major financial and 
business restructuring which while challenging will allow us to 
rebuild a strong regional bank chairman lawrence fish said 
fish who succeeded ousted chairman walter j connolly last 
month said the company will focus on businesses including retail 
and commercial banking and real estate lending 
were going to keep it simple fish said in a statement 
were going to take deposits and were going to make sound 
loans 
the bank which has been operating under government orders for 
more than a month lost more than 1 billion last year it recently 
announced plans to cut 5600 workers or onethird of the payroll 
through a combination of layoffs attrition and the sale of assets 
much of the banks trouble has been blamed on shaky construction 
loans that were exposed during a downturn in the northeast real 
estate market but analysts warn that the bank could face more 
trouble as the new england economy continues to worsen 
deteriorating the banks assets further 
some analysts had suggested that the bank separate the bad loans 
from the rest of the assets in order to alleviate the burden from 
the solid operations 
the bank said steven e wheeler a former morgan stanley 
executive would serve as executive vice president and oversee the 
new collecting bank 
this operation will restructure the troubled real estate assets 
and possibly offer them for sale the bank said wheeler has 
experience in the new england real estate market having served as 
president of first winthrop corp a bostonbased real estate 
syndication and investment firm 
the bank also is trying to improve its capital levels and reduce 
borrowings from the federal reserve bank part of the plan is to 
use advertising campaigns to stem the fears of depositors who have 
pulled billions of dollars from the company 
bank of new england said it would adopt a new organizational 
structure that would change management processes and emphasize 
accountability 
as part of its sale of assets the bank also announced tuesday 
it had reached an agreement to sell all the securities activities 
handled by its discount brokerage unit new england discount 
brokerage inc to charles schwab amp co inc for an undisclosed 
cash price

nike inc plans to spend 17 percent of its 30 
million basketball shoe advertising budget this year on public 
servicetype messages encouraging youngsters to stay in school 
the campaign comes at a time when some critics have blamed 
highpriced athletic shoes for triggering crime in poor urban 
areas some children wearing the shoes have been attacked by other 
youngsters who covet them as status symbols 
we know people that are in our ads are role models and kids 
pay a lot of attention to our ads said liz dolan a spokeswoman 
for nike we felt this could be a real contribution that we could 
make 
the beaverton orebased athletic shoemaker said tuesday it 
plans to spend 5 million to buy time for these messages and will 
run them along with its regular product ads so they wont be 
consigned to the leastwatched times 
nikes public service messages would feature pro basketball 
stars michael jordan who has appeared for his own line of nike 
shoes and david robinson who is about to turn up in a new ad 
campaign for nikes force line 
robinson who plays center for the san antonio spurs told a 
news conference he thought it was unfair to single out the makers 
of athletic shoes for causing crime 
kids are attacking kids over a lot of things not just 
shoes he said 
he said the new ads give him a chance to become a positive role 
model for children who may not have one 
prices for the force line of shoes run from 58 to 135 a pair 
with the major share of sales coming in the least expensive shoes 
ms dolan said 
nike brand marketing manager ron hill said the force line 
accounts for about 60 percent of nikes 250 million a year in 
basketball shoe sales 
in the 15 million ad campaign for the line which debuts in 
late april on the nba playoff telecasts robinson is the amiable 
focal point in his own mr robinsons neighborhood an apparent 
takeoff on the childrens public tv show mister rogers 
neighborhood 
in one ad spurs coach larry brown talks about the words for 
that day transition game 
brown repeatedly admonishes robinson to run back down the court 
after the opponent misses a shot as clips of robinson playing 
basketball flash on the screen 
i dont think well have coach brown on the show anymore 
robinson tells viewers as the commercial ends 
another ad in the series called kick butt is being held 
until fall when the new inflatable nike force shoes are on the 
market the shoes have a builtin pump to inflate the collar around 
the ankles the shoes replace nikes air pressure shoes that 
required a separate pump 
nikes arch rival reebok international sells a shoe called the 
pump that is inflated by pressing a marked spot on the tongue of 
the shoe 
in the ad robinson demonstrates how to tie them mr 
robinson likes double knots and to inflate them mr 
robinson likes six pumps 
then mr robinson likes to take his special nike shoes onto 
the court and kick some butt the athlete says in an innocent 
voice 
can you say kick some butt he asks as the words flash on 
the screen interspersed with more shots of robinson in action on 
the basketball court 
ms dolan said nike feels viewers will understand that robinson 
is talking about playing agressively and doubts youngsters will 
read more into it 
i think everybody will get the joke she said

united telecommunications inc said it 
will buy the remaining 199 percent of us sprint and change its 
name to sprint corp to cash in on the high profile of the nations 
no 3 longdistance carrier 
united telecom on tuesday also reported a 41 percent rise in 
first quarter profits but it said revenue growth was slower than 
expected at us sprint and that competition was intensifying from 
rivals atampt and mci 
us sprint was formed in 1986 as a joint venture of united 
telecom and gte corp and has grown to control 8 percent of the 
longdistance market 
united telecom bought a controlling interest in 1988 and was 
given an option to buy the remaining 199 percent 
the company will notify gte by the end of may that it is ready 
to exercise the option and take full control william esrey 
chairman and ceo told telecom shareholders at tuesdays annual 
meeting in this kansas city mo suburb 
the agreed selling price is about 500 million telecom 
spokesman jerry cosley said 
esrey said united telecoms name would change july 1 when the 
transaction with gte is expected to be completed shareholders 
approved the name change at the meeting 
its obviously not without some mixed emotions retiring 
chairman paul henson told shareholders we think that sprint 
corporation tells the financial community more clearly what we are 
about in addition it has very high public recognition 
the company also will shorten the longdistance subsidiarys 
name to sprint reflecting its attempts to expand overseas esrey 
said telecoms local telephone service subsidiaries such as 
united telephone of kansas will remain unchanged 
sprints revenues were 12 billion in the first quarter vs 
984 million in the same quarter last year an increase of 22 
percent but revenues increased only about 2 percent from the last 
quarter of 1989 less than the 4 percent to 6 percent forecast by 
company officials cosley said 
this is an area that we are somewhat disappointed in and that 
we are addressing esrey told stockholders 
cosley said some revenues from contracts already won by sprint 
simply did not materialize during the quarter as expected because 
equipment wasnt installed but those revenues will show up down 
the road he said 
esrey told shareholders sprint will introduce about 55 new 
products this year as competition in the longdistance market heats 
up he noted that both american telephone amp telegraph co and mci 
communications inc are developing fiberoptic telephone networks 
similar to the one sprint built a few years ago and now touts in 
its advertising 
daybyday that advantage tends to shrink on us esrey 
said we must now use our system to help us develop new 
products 
he said the company would consider buying smaller longdistance 
companies as mci did recently when it bought telecom usa inc of 
atlanta the fourthlargest us longdistance carrier but esrey 
said telecom would proceed with caution 
certainly if we can acquire customers by buying them cheaper 
than we can through other ways we will do it he said 
united telecom said it earned 1076 million or 51 cents a share 
on revenues of 202 billion in the first quarter compared with 
764 million or 36 cents a share on revenues of 177 billion a 
year earlier 
the companys stock closed 25 cents lower at 3987 on the new 
york stock exchange 
also at the meeting henson who had announced his retirement 
more than a year ago officially stepped down after 31 years he 
came to the company in 1959 as a vice president was named 
president in 1964 and chairman in 1966 he is given much credit for 
helping to form sprint in the mid1980s

early april sales of north americanmade vehicles 
skidded 112 percent and analysts say auto dealers may not get the 
usual spring surge of buyers on their lots 
while we think weve seen the worst its not clear when its 
going to get any better said steve girsky auto industry analyst 
for painewebber inc we see it muddling along for another month 
or so 
chrysler corp on tuesday reported the biggest decline a 
292percent drop in car sales from levels of last april 110 when 
the no 3 automaker offered interestfree financing on some 
vehicles 
ford motor cos car sales slid 207 percent and general motors 
corps were down 136 percent from the yearearlier period the 
companies said 
sales from japaneseowned plants in this country continued to 
grow however 
the latest figures were measured against a strong yearearlier 
period when sales rose more than 28 percent along with chryslers 
interestfree loans gm and ford announced interest rates as low as 
29 percent just before the earlyapril 1989 surge 
this year the big three have been offering various combinations 
of rebates and lowinterest incentives the lowest rates currently 
available are 69 percent on some gm vehicles and 29 percent on 
some ford and chrysler models 
but the incentives have lost impact and with inventories 
trimmed by firstquarter production cuts the companies have little 
reason to spend more money on them said analyst harvey heinbach of 
merrill lynch amp co inc 
we think that sales are going to remain at these levels for 
some time he said 
everybodys gotten used to the incentives they ask whats on 
this month said len gossman sales manager at blackwell ford 
inc in plymouth 
gossman blamed his dealerships 10percent drop partly on the 
midapril easter holiday that had people planning vacations rather 
than buying cars the cold spring also repelled shoppers he said 
gm ford and chrysler said their cars and light trucks sold at a 
combined average daily rate of 29832 in the april 110 period 
down 146 percent from a rate of 34931 vehicles a day in early 
april 1989 
total us sales of north americanmade cars were down 133 
percent and light truck sales slid 75 percent 
all but one of the eight japanese companies that make vehicles 
in this country reported stronger sales in early april american 
honda the biggest maker said sales were up 17 percent at 9455 
cars toyota usa and mazda usa which are gearing up production 
from a lower base doubled and tripled their sales respectively 
nissan usas car sales fell 6 percent in early april but its 
light truck sales were up 142 percent 
for the year to date us sales of north americanmade cars are 
down 24 percent and light truck sales are off 04 percent from 
last year combined domestic car and light truck sales are down 17 
percent for the year so far 
gm said its light truck sales edged up 22 percent for early 
april for the year the no 1 automaker said car sales were down 4 
percent while light truck sales were up 38 percent 
ford said its early april light truck sales sagged 93 percent 
ford said car sales were down 10 percent and light truck sales were 
down 35 percent for the year 
chrysler reported a 249 percent drop in early april light truck 
sales for the year chrysler said its car sales were down 14 
percent and light truck sales were down 15 percent

like many people in rural america david 
armour has trouble doing his banking 
its 15 miles from my office to the bank said armour sales 
manager at a ford dealership in the heart of west tennessees 
rolling farm country 
if something comes up and i cant get loose its tomorrow 
before i can deposit my check he said 
starting next month the bank will come to armour and other 
rural residents of madison county thats when the first national 
bank of jacksons mobile bank a converted armored car 
appropriately enough hits the roads 
the office of the comptroller of the currency notified the bank 
on monday that it had approved its request for a mobile branch 
the new rolling branch office will have two teller windows in 
its side customers will be able to cash checks make deposits and 
buy certificates of deposit from the tellers who will park the 
truck at grocery stores truck stops and other gathering spots 
its gonna be great armour said theyre saying they 
might pull in here once a week and let the mechanics and salesmen 
deposit their checks 
eventually first national bank president ernest vickers iii 
said customers will be able to apply for loans or a mortgage or 
drop off valuables for their safe deposit box those plans may 
require a converted motor home though he said 
we felt there was a large segment of county that is not 
adequately served by traditional banking vickers said 
i figured if federal express can come to your door who are we 
as banks to tell customers youve got to come to us 
vickers says the idea was born more from his marketing and sales 
background than his 14 years of banking experience but he says 
service is the name of the game whatever the industry 
many agree 
it sounds like a real good idea to me said nathan pride a 
madison county attorney and spokesman for the national association 
for the advancement of colored people in jackson 
ive talked to people who have trouble getting into the bank 
and they said theyd like it if it would come to their neighborhood 
just once a week he said 
whether vickers and first national can meet the countys demands 
is another matter vickers says the rolling banks schedule is 
being worked out 
moveable bank branches have been approved before said j 
michael shepherd senior deputy comptroller for the officer of the 
comptroller of the currency in washington 
but mr vickers plan is quite rare he said i approved 
one in arizona that was used at concerts football games and big 
events it was kind of a rolling automatic teller machine 
shepherd said vickers plan was laudable because it would 
provide a banking service to people who otherwise must drive long 
distances to make a deposit 
approving the banks plan was easy once the comptrollers office 
determined tennessee law was silent on the question of banks on 
wheels 
industry analyst henry coffee of jc bradford co in nashville 
applauded the move 
anything that brings in more deposits at a lower marginal cost 
is positive he said it sounds like this will be cheaper than 
building a branch

donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
agreed to pay back 56 million to customers for stock sold in 
partial tender offers without prior client approval federal 
officials said 
the new yorkbased securities firm and a managing director 
michael dreitlein agreed to settle without admitting or denying 
wrongdoing an administrative action alleging they violated 
securities and exchange commission antifraud and recordkeeping 
rules the settlement was disclosed tuesday 
the action brought by the secs new york regional office 
accused donaldson lufkin amp jenrettes pershing division of making 
43 million in tender offer profits from the unauthorized and 
undisclosed sale of shares from customer accounts 
a tender offer is an offer to buy a corporations shares often 
as a means of acquiring the concern usually at a premium price 
according to the sec the pershing division thenheaded by 
dreitlein tendered shares belonging to customers who had not given 
any instructions to do so the shares were later replaced usually 
with stock bought at a lower price after the tender offer dlj kept 
any profits from the difference between the sale and repurchase 
price 
the alleged activity known as overtendering took place between 
january 1982 and april 1988 the sec said 
securities transactions are predicated on trust dlj misued 
that trust when it confiscated customers securities for its 
benefit said martin a kuperberg the secs associate regional 
administrator in new york 
kathryn ashbaugh brokerdealer enforcement branch chief in new 
york explained that while the misappropriated securities were 
replaced with no quantifiable loss to customers the increased 
number of shares dlj sold in 104 partial tender offers effectively 
dilluted the number shareholders could sell to the acquiring 
company 
in a partial tender offer the acquirer isnt seeking 100 
percent of the corporations stock and therefore not every 
shareholder can sell stock 
as part of the settlement with the sec dlj agreed to pay 43 
million plus interest for a total of 56 million to customers 
whose shares were used in the overtendering 
dreitlein consented to a 45day suspension from any 
secregulated securities operations and an 18month ban from 
supervising any department that handles partial tender offers 
these are practices that date to the early and mid 1980s 
said catherine conroy a spokeswoman for the jersey city 
njbased pershing division she noted that dlj has instituted 
several steps to upgrade and strengthen the division and this 
brings the matter to a satisfactory close

those fearful predictions of 20 years ago that 
environmental demands would cause unemployment and economic 
stagnation have turned out to be overstated a business leader says 
experience has shown that combating pollution is compatible with 
economic growth said alexander trowbridge a former secretary of 
commerce and chairman of the national association of manufacturers 
industry coalition for the environment 
environmental improvement has been a corollary to economic 
growth and has not come in spite of it trowbridge told a news 
conference tuesday 
he said the dire predictions about environmental improvement 
coming at the cost of jobs and national economic strength and high 
prices have proven to be exaggerated 
at the same time he said environmentalists warnings that 
lake erie would be dead urban dwellers would be wearing gas masks 
rivers would be reaching a boiling point also were overdrawn 
trowbridge said he was not contending there will not be 
tradeoffs between jobs and the environment 
but he said the record since earth day 1970 indicates that 
economic growth moderate but real has taken place in these 20 
years and environmental improvement has also taken place 
my judgment is that weve made progress both in the economy 
and the environment and i think well continue to do so he said 
trowbridge presented a report that said production of six major 
pollutants has dropped sharply since 1970 while employment 
productivity per capita income industrial production and the 
overall size of the economy have grown steadily 
environmentalists said they suspected that trowbridge had made 
an earth day conversion earth day is being commemorated on sunday 
with events scheduled nationwide 
talk is cheap and action is not cheap said david gardiner 
legislative director of the sierra club its the 
dontworrybehappy message at the same time the nam and their 
members are spending millions of dollars lobbying against changes 
in law which would do a better job in improving the environment 
what were seeing from industry is earth day earthhype 
it is an encouragingsounding message but just in the last 
month and a half weve seen from the business roundtable and other 
industry groups the most apocalyptical hype about how the clear air 
act is going to kill the economy added david doniger senior 
attorney for the natural resources defense council 
it will be interesting to see if next time there is a piece 
of legislation to be acted upon the nam will take a more

if your car is made by american workers in 
michigan tennessee kentucky indiana california illinois or 
ohio that makes it allamerican right 
not if its japanese 
more than 15 million 1990model hondas nissans toyotas 
mazdas mitsubishis subarus and isuzus will be made in the usa 
and a new study says the japanese plants have brought significant 
changes to an industry once dominated by detroit 
the growing automobile transplant industry is making it more 
difficult to determine the true nationality of cars on the american 
road or on the japanese road 
in japan the ford probe is made by mazda which is partially 
owned by ford in a michigan plant using both american and 
japanese parts its sold as an american car 
to add to the confusion over automobile nationality you can buy 
a chrysler product made in japan or a pontiac or ford made in south 
korea and some japanese transplants are starting to export their 
usmade japanese cars to japan 
in a study financed by the import auto industry researcher 
robert z lawrence said tuesday that expected growth in direct 
foreign investment in us auto manufacturing will create 110000 
jobs and lower the usjapan trade deficit by between 93 billion 
and 152 billion below what it otherwise would be at the end of 
1992 
lawrence said assembling foreign cars in the united states 
benefits consumers by increasing competition and spreading auto 
manufacturing beyond detroit 
in less than a decade the us auto industry had been 
transformed from a virtually selfcontained highly concentrated 
sector with limited competition from imports into an 
internationalized industry with japanese and us producers 
competing head to head lawrences study said 
the commerce department projects that more than 15 million 
foreign cars will be made at seven plants in the united states this 
year and 225 million passenger cars will be imported newcar 
sales are expected to exceed 85 million 
lawrence who performed the study while on leave from the 
washingtonbased brookings institution said he fears the 
advantages of us manufacturing may decrease if the value of the 
dollar continues to climb in japan 
what began as an effort by japanese automakers to head off us 
protective measures against imported vehicles became more 
economically viable with the decrease of the dollars value in 
recent years lawrence said 
he cited studies showing that when the dollar dips below 140 
yen automakers can make more by building in the united states than 
in japan but when it goes above 150 the us operations may 
become less viable the rate on the tokyo foreign exchange market 
on tuesday was 15983 yen to the dollar 
complicating the analysis is the fact that some us automakers 
have a partial interest in japanese companies 
honda started japanese assembly of motorcycles in the united 
states in the late 1970s and cars in 1981 todays plants do more 
than just assemble japanese parts however lawrence said 
some build engines and other components for export and the trend 
is to use more usbuilt parts with some japanese parts companies 
also setting up us operations 
the study notes the following arrangements 
chrysler buys the conquest dodge colt vista and eagle summit 
from mitsubishi and markets them as chrysler products 
general motors markets the geo prizm built in partnership with 
toyota in california the geo tracker built in canada with suzuki 
and the geo storm built in japan 
gms pontiac lemans is built by daewoo korea 
fords festiva is built in south korea 
the mazda miata was conceived at a mazda design faility in 
california 
nissan and ford plan vehicles developed by a nissan operation 
in ann arbor mich to be built by ford in ohio with parts 
supplied by a nissan plant in tennessee and to be marketed by both 
nissan and ford 
by 1992 lawrence said toyota and honda are expected to export 
50000 cars each from the united states to japan in addition 
20000 usbuilt toyotas will go to taiwan which has resisted 
increased japanese imports

the failure of the 22 billion silverado banking 
savings and loan was brought on by fraud and abuse not a 
struggling colorado economy according to federal documents 
documents obtained by the denver post through the federal 
freedom of information act said the failed denver thrift repeatedly 
violated federal banking laws the paper said in a copyright report 
in todays editions 
regulators said that the december 1988 failure resulted from 
massive amounts of poorly underwritten loans imprudent loan 
concentrations and excessive compensation to senior 
management 
authorities had alleged that the thrift paid its top executives 
millions of dollars showed false profits hid loan problems and 
schemed to deceive regulators 
silverado has suffered due to violations of laws rules and 
regulations the depressed condition of colorados economy has 
served to exacerbate the losses incurred but it is not the reason 
for silverados insolvency the regulators said 
officials said the situation illustrates the nations 325 
billion thrift crisis 
there is a similarity that has emerged at all these failed 
thrifts said tony adamski chief of the fbis financial crime 
unit in washington in each case rules and good management were 
simply abrogated 
reports show that silverados troubles began in 1980 just a year 
after chairman michael wise took control and changed its name from 
mile high savings 
regulators warned then of increasing problem loans conflicts of 
interest regarding an insider loan and deficiencies in internal 
control 
the next year regulators said silverado was in danger of 
falling below minimum required levels of capital then from 1983 to 
1985 silverado doubled in size each year pouring loans into real 
estate projects seemingly without regard for the quality of the 
loans regulators said 
during that time the thrifts apparent profits almost entirely 
came from fees generated from making loans not the loans 
themselves regulators said 
typically such a reliance on fee income is a red flag for 
regulators said ronn carr of the federal office of thrift 
supervision in topeka kan it indicates there isnt an ongoing 
source of income from loans 
in 1985 foreclosures rose 10 times to 177 million and 
nonperforming loans quadrupled to 88 million regulators said but 
instead of setting aside reserves which would have produced a 20 
million loss that year silverado reported an 8 million profit 
in 1986 worried regulators set limits on silverados expansion 
other reports then followed until the failure in 1988 of 
imprudent business practices and even attempts to hide 
escalating troubles in its loan portfolio the documents said 
in a cashraising effort silverado issued 45 million in 
silverado stock to its senior officers telling regulators they 
bought it the reports said in fact silverado accountants just 
issued the stock free of charge and recorded the purchases as 
future pay the reports said 
silverado also lumped all bad loans and real estate it acquired 
through foreclosure into a 11 billion pool of major assets and 
then reported to regulators the loan pool was a health asset 
reports said 
the effect was to manipulate financial statements to report a 
more favorable condition regulators said in the documents 
when federal marshals moved in in 1988 losses had reached 1 
billion officials said

with lightning speed the norton co received a 
weapon today to help fight a hostile takeover bid from a british 
firm 
gov michael s dukakis signed a bill this morning designed to 
stall a proxy fight for control over nortons board of directors 
the bill which takes effect immediately was signed in worcester 
the home of norton 
the measure sped through the senate and house on voice votes 
tuesday hours after a legislative committee endorsed the bill 
we must do all we can to protect our best corporate citizens 
and their workers and families from having their livelihoods wiped 
out dukakis said in a statement this bill gives companies a 
welldeserved fighting chance against hostile raiders 
john nelson the chairman of norton told an enthusiastic crowd 
of workers that the company will continue to fight to remain 
independent 
norton faces a proxy fight at its annual shareholders meeting 
currently scheduled for april 26 but norton is asking a federal 
appeals court to allow the company to delay the showdown until june 
26 so executives have more time to plan a defense strategy 
norton last month rejected a 16 billion 75ashare offer 
from btr but the british conglomerate says it will try to take 
control of nortons board at the shareholders meeting 
the new bill attempts to stall that strategy by requiring 
massachusetts companies to elect their boards of directors over 
staggered terms a company however could opt out of the 
requirement 
under the bill only onethird of the directors would be elected 
at a time which means btr would have to wait at least a year 
before it could place a majority of directors on the board 
currently a twothirds vote by shareholders is needed for a 
company to change to a staggered board 
the united shareholders association based in washington issued 
a statement saying the bill would strip the right of shareholders 
in massachusetts companies of their ability to vote on the board of 
directors annually 
state sen lois pines the committee cochairman acknowledged 
that norton would have trouble shifting to staggered board terms 
under current law because approximately 70 percent of its 
shareholders are big institutional investors 
but she insisted the bill protects shareholder interests 
it is important for a company that has served the community 
like norton has to have the opportunity to make its own judgments 
as to how to move forward within a reasonable amount of time 
pines said 
btr officials have vowed to continue their takeover bid even if 
blocked from wresting immediate control of the norton board 
with the collapse of the junk bond market and other sources of 
takeover financing bidders increasingly are turning to proxy 
fights which makes the new legislation necessary legislators said 
the bill also includes an amendment that would protect worker 
severance benefits if norton succeeds in defending itself but is 
forced to lay off employees 
the measure guarantees that the additional protection afforded 
to the board of directors would not be misused at the expense of 
workers who have most at stake pines said 
under current state law workers would receive severance 
benefits if the takeover fight is successful and a new owner takes 
control of the company but legislators said that if norton 
succeeds the battle could become quite costly and the company may 
have to cut its payroll 
the first round has gone to the workers said state sen 
john houston dworcester

the boeing co and the federal government have 
announced an agreement to resolve a 1984 agediscrimination lawsuit 
filed on behalf of company pilots removed from flight duty after 
age 60 
the consent decree announced tuesday calls for raising the age 
limit to 63 and annual testing of older pilots physical and mental 
condition the us equal employment opportunity commission and 
boeing said in statements issued in seattle and washington 
the agreement also provides 44 million to be distributed among 
29 pilots covered by the case 
with this agreement eeoc is breaking new ground in dealing 
with age discrimination specifically age ceilings for pilots 
said eeoc chairman evan j kemp jr the agreement calls for a 
totally new testing procedure that may provide us with better tools 
to fight employment discrimination based on age 
seattlebased boeing is satisfied with the proposed pact which 
is subject to approval by a us district court in seattle said 
company spokesman paul binder 
under the fiveyear consent decree boeing would conduct the 
tests in coordination with the eeoc until 1995 when the company 
will decide whether the results warrant permanently lifting the 
age60 ceiling 
if boeing decides to reinstate the limit the eeoc reserves the 
right to sue the agency said 
the tests will include enhanced medical and performance 
examinations as well as standard and experimental neurophysical 
examinations used by the federal aviation administration the eeoc 
said 
all company pilots will take the tests at first the agency 
said then they will be given annually to determine flight fitness 
of pilots aged 57 to 63 
eeoc general counsel charles a shanor said he is confident the 
tests will show modern testing and evaluations are a far more 
accurate means of determining pilot competency and safety than the 
use of chronological age 
the older wellevaluated medically cleared pilot brings to 
the job experience and judgment vital to the safety of our 
airways shanor said 
binder said boeing would not have signed the agreement if it 
left any doubts about pilot safety 
a company statement said testing techniques have become more 
proven in the 10 years since the previous age policy was adopted 
and individuals are generally more healthconscious now by 
moving to age 63 and adopting an enhanced medicaltesting protocol 
we will continue our tradition of safe flight operations while 
drawing on the flight experience of our longservice pilots 
in 1986 a us district court in seattle decided the eeoc case 
in boeings favor saying the age60 limitation was justified under 
an occupational qualification exception to the age discrimination 
in employment act that exemption is based on the faa rule that 
commercial pilots must be removed from flight status at age 60 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1988 that the 
policys validity for noncommercial pilots should be decided by a 
jury 
if approved the consent decree will resolve the case which had 
been set for trial this week a fairness hearing on the decree is 
scheduled may 11 in seattle the agreement would go into effect 30 
days after court approval

the us trade deficit shrank dramatically to 
649 billion in february the smallest imbalance in more than six 
years the government reported today 
the commerce department said that the 30 percent improvement 
from a 932 billion january deficit came primarily from a big drop 
in imported oil 
total imports fell by 76 percent to 3812 billion while us 
exports which had hit a record level in january edged down a 
slight 1 percent to 3163 billion the trade deficit is the 
difference between what america imports and what it sells abroad 
the changes gave the united states its lowest monthly trade 
imbalance since december 1983 when it was 568 billion 
the february deficit was significantly better than had been 
expected but economists said the good news was likely to be 
shortlived 
that would be a blow to the bush administration which is 
counting on further gains in us exports to lift the fortunes of 
american manufacturers and provide a boost to a sluggish us 
economy 
but at the white house michael boskin the chairman of the 
white house council of economic advisers hailed the decrease in 
the trade deficit as very good news indeed 
at the same time boskin said we cant yet tell the extent to 
which it is a temporary or permanent phenomenon 
many private economists said that the trade deficit may actually 
begin rising again this year as the united states grows more 
dependent on foreign oil and demand for exports weakens because of 
the strength of the us dollar a stronger dollar makes american 
goods less competitive on foreign markets 
analysts were particularly disturbed by the fact that there were 
widespread declines in a variety of us export categories the 1 
percent overall drop wold have been even larger except for a huge 
jump in shipments of aircraft 
however analysts said that was a temporary surge attributed to 
a backlog in shipments at boeing which was idled late last year by 
a strike 
donald ratajczak head of the economic forecasting project at 
georgia state university said that he was looking for a 1990 trade 
deficit of 105 billion down only slightly from an 109 billion 
imbalance in 1989 
american competitiveness is not improving at the present time 
and that is going to make it very hard to make further gains 
ratajczak said 
in february oil imports which had surged by 44 percent in 
january fell by 20 percent to 471 billion as both the volume of 
shipments and the price per barrel dropped 
the big swing in both months was weather related a severe cold 
snap in december depleted supplies and forced record imports in 
january however unusually warm weather in january reduced oil 
demand in february 
analysts said with domestic oil production now at 25year lows 
they expect foreign oil shipments to resume rising in coming months 
with the price expected to climb as well 
there is no question that we are going to import more oil in 
1990 than in 1989 and it looks like we will import that oil at a 
higher price ratajczak said 
in addition to the drop in oil shipments imports of consumer 
appliances and other durable goods fell by 75 percent while 
imports of clothing and other consumer nondurable goods dropped by 
10 percent 
however imports of foreign cars were up by 25 percent to 256 
billion in february 
that was a primary reason that the deficit with japan rose 
during the month to 312 billion accounting for close to half of 
the overall deficit 
the increased japanese deficit is coming at a time when the bush 
administration is applying heavy pressure on tokyo to make trade 
concessions in order to ease tensions between the two countries 
the february figures showed a 1 billion trade surplus with 
americas other large trading partner the countries of western 
europe 
president bush met with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu in 
early march to discuss trade tensions between the two nations 
since then several trade agreements aimed at lowering japanese 
barriers have been announced 
however many in congress remain unimpressed they are demanding 
that japan be targeted once again when the administration releases 
its list of priority countries for negotiations under a tough 
section of the 1988 trade law known as super 301 
the japanese have been arguing that they should not be cited 
when the administration releases the new target list april 30 
because of the concessions they have already made 
but sen max baucus dmont urged bush on tuesday to target 
japan for a second round of priority negotiations 
the progress that has been made toward opening the japanese 
market has been made because the united states has put on 
pressure baucus wrote regrettably if that pressure is 
removed i believe progress will stop

g heileman brewing co burdened by a 
heavy takeover debt is seeking to negotiate an arrangement to give 
major creditors partial ownership in the company to discourage any 
move toward liquidation 
company spokesman bill eiler repeating statements made by 
heileman president murray s cutbush on monday would not comment 
tuesday on the share of equity the banks might receive cutbush 
also declined to name the banks involved in the negotiations 
he did say that talks between heileman and its debt holders 
started some months ago and that an accord has not been reached 
cutbush told the trade journal advertising age the banks have 
decided their chances for recovering funds are much improved by 
letting heileman continue to market beer instead of selling off 
parts of the company perhaps at bargain prices 
the financial pressures on heileman stem from australian 
businessman alan bonds debt load bond corp bought heileman in 
1987 in a highly leveraged 13 billion deal 
analysts late last year estimated heilemans debt at 850 
million despite the sale of its profitable bakery division and 
other smaller assets 
last summer heileman negotiated a deal with creditors under 
which it does not have to make any principal payments on 
outstanding loans until june 30 
heileman has already begun costcutting measures to keep ahead 
of debt collectors earlier this month the company scaled down its 
advertising operations by consolidating all of its advertising with 
one or two agencies 
cutbush also said the company will take a hard look at making 
corporate sponsorship programs cost effective 
eiler said heileman breweries in st paul minn and 
frankenmuth mich are still up for sale but he added they were 
the only assets heileman planed to put on the market 
beer industry sources put heilemans total worth at 250 million 
to 350 million but jerry steinman publisher of beer marketers 
insights a trade publication said that figure falls woefully 
short of heilemans liabilities which he said may have prodded the 
companys debt holders to come to the negotiating table 
the banks were in a bad position steinman said heileman 
owes over a billion dollars which is more than heileman is worth 
so the banks were in a position where they would lose a lot 
steinman added that any restructuring of heilemans debt would 
be beneficial for the company 
the company certainly comes out ahead if they dont have to 
pay the old loan payments he said 
steinman said preliminary numbers on 1990 sales for heileman 
suggest a 10 percent decline from sales a year ago heileman sales 
in 1989 were down about 97 percent after suffering an almost 
identical decline in 1988 the 1989 decline was the largest of 
americas major brewers

an attorney for eastern airlines fought off 
creditors attempts to have a trustee take over operations saying 
a liquidation of the carrier is likely to become 
selffulfilling if a trustee is named 
lawyer zack clement also told a bankruptcy hearing tuesday that 
easterns unsecured creditors would recover only about 7 percent to 
14 percent of the money theyre owed if the carrier is liquidated 
miamibased eastern is resisting requests by its unions and 
unsecured creditors to appoint a trustee for the financially 
sagging company and take control away from frank lorenzo chairman 
of its parent texas air corp 
judge burton r lifland heard a third day of testimony over the 
proposal and easterns request for release of 80 million from 
escrow to help finance its secondquarter operations the hearing 
was scheduled to continue today 
eastern attorney bruce zirinsky said friday that eastern needed 
the cash by monday or tuesday but he told the associated press 
after tuesdays hearing that theres no immediate need for cash 
zirinsky declined to elaborate but a source close to the 
companies who spoke on condition of anonymity suggested that 
texas air had committed to covering easterns secondquarter 
expenses 
separately tuesday eastern made a pension fund payment of 
around 14 million that was due this week to the pension benefit 
guaranty corp a government agency in addition to its other 
debts eastern has about 830 million in unfunded pension 
liabilities according to the agency 
also tuesday jose smith easterns senior vice president of 
operations resigned from the company eastern spokesman robin 
matell said smith had accepted a job at cocacola co and his 
departure was unrelated to easterns bankruptcy proceeding smith 
who has worked for eastern for 23 years could not be reached for 
comment immediately 
but eastern president phil bakes asked by a reporter today 
about smiths departure said his decision has something to do 
with what is going on here in this courtroom 
bakes declined comment on speculation that texas air could offer 
bakes resignation as a compromise to the creditors theres been 
a lot of negotiations a lot of discussions im not going to 
discuss it he said 
texas air later issued a press statement calling the speculation 
about bakes totally untrue 
smith will not be replaced and his position will be eliminated 
matell said the vice presidents of flight operations and 
maintenance who have been reporting to him will now report 
directly to joseph leonard easterns executive vice president and 
chief operating officer 
at the hearing clement said an analysis by eastern financial 
adviser smith barney harris upham amp co indicated the unsecured 
creditors would receive 67 cents for every dollar owed if eastern 
were liquidated now they would get 143 cents on the dollar if 
eastern were liquidated following completion of the proposed sale 
of its south american routes to american airlines 
eastern owes 980 million to the unsecured creditors who are 
mainly suppliers of equipment such as aircraft and engines the 
group rejected a recent reorganization proposal from eastern that 
would pay them 25 cents on the dollar including 5 cents cash and 
the remainder in notes 
earlier in the hearing easterns top marketing official warned 
that appointing a trustee would shake the confidence of travel 
agents and the flying public in the airline at a time eastern is 
desperate for business 
george brennan easterns vice president of marketing also said 
such a move could prompt many eastern managers to resign 
i know like myself many of them would consider the 
appointment of a trustee the end of the line for that team he 
said 
the unsecured creditors committee has insisted it does not want 
to liquidate eastern but says it might seek a buyer for all or part 
of the airline 
easterns preferred shareholders who are owed 680 million 
still are seeking to liquidate the airline 
lifland reiterated that if he named a trustee that person would 
be charged with operating the airline 
liquidation is not some of the baggage that a trustee 
necessarily carries with him lifland said 
elliot seiden a vice president and associate general counsel of 
texas air said appointment of a trustee also could delay 
government approval of easterns proposed 349 million sale of its 
latin american routes he said such a delay would be nearly as 
serious as a rejection of the sale because eastern is in severe 
need of the sale proceeds 
james l garrity an assistant us attorney told the court the 
department of transportation has not taken a position on the 
trustee issue he said the appointment of a trustee in itself would 
not delay a final decision on the route sale to which the 
department has given tentative approval 
but garrity said if there was a clear indication that 
liquidation would follow the appointment of a trustee approval 
likely would be delayed 
easterns pilots machinists and flight attendants unions struck 
eastern on march 4 1989 forcing the miamibased airline into 
bankruptcy protection five days later the machinists union remains 
on strike

the us dollar fell against most major currencies 
in european trading wednesday despite figures showing a narrowing 
us trade deficit 
gold prices rose 
currency dealers said they were surprised the market reacted 
negatively to news that the us february trade gap had shrunk to a 
sixyear low of 649 billion from a revised 932 billion in 
january 
there was the wildest speculation about the trade figures and 
many people were apparently even more optimistic than the data 
allowed said a trader at a large european bank in west germany 
a lot of the market had heard the rumors of hugely improved 
trade figures and set themselves up with that in mind added 
david brown senior spot foreign exchange dealer for the royal bank 
of scotland 
some dealers said the trade data when viewed against the 
backdrop of recent sluggish jobs growth in the united states 
didnt provide sufficient fundamental support to encourage the 
market to push the dollar higher and encouraged some profit taking 
despite the decline dealers said they expect the dollar to firm 
because of political tensions in the soviet union and weakness in 
the japanese yen 
the dollars general stability hinders any sharp moves said 
the west german trader 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose to a closing 15987 japanese yen from 
15983 yen tuesday later in london it fell to 15915 yen the 
dollar traded at 15875 yen at midday in new york 
in london the british pound rose to 16347 from 16340 late 
tuesday at midday in new york sterling sold for 163725 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late tuesday 
16720 west german marks down from 16770 14876 swiss francs

percent to 2115 million with income from broadcasting operations 
rising 35 percent 
it said the abc television network reported a very significant 
profit in the latest quarter compared with a modest profit in 
the same period in 1989 the company attributed the improvement to 
the networks strong primetime revenue performance

last week cbs inc reported a 52 percent increase in its 
firstquarter earnings to 853 million on a 16 percent revenue 
increase to 851 million

american general corp an insurance company in a 
proxy fight with torchmark corp on wednesday reported 102 
percent growth in its firstquarter earnings 
the company which is based in houston earned 10114 million 
or 90 cents per share on revenue of 104 billion for the three 
months ended march 31 
during the same period last year the company had earnings of 
9717 million or 77 cents per share on revenue of 1 billion 
the improved earnings in the first quarter are the hardwon 
rewards of a very complex and difficult restructuring program we 
believe these results signal the beginning of a new era of progress 
for american general said harold s hooks american generals 
chairman and chief executive officer 
american general with subsidiaries that operate in 50 states 
and canada is in a battle with birmingham alabased torchmark 
best known for its liberty national mutual insurance subsidiary 
torchmark made a surprise 64 billion offer for american 
general last month and a week later withdrew its offer opting 
instead to solicit proxies to elect its own nominees to american 
generals board of directors 
a houston federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that had 
kept torchmark from lobbying american generals shareholders in 
support of theirv slate 
but a threejudge panel from the 5th us circuit court of 
appeals last week stayed the injunction 
american general shareholders are scheduled to elect six 
directors at american generals may 2 annual meeting 
american general mailed a letter to its shareholders tuesday to 
support its nominees and reject torchmarks shareholder resolution 
calling for american general to hire an investment banking firm and 
appoint a committee of independent directors to evaluate 
acquisition proposals

united technologies corp said wednesday 
its firstquarter earnings rose 87 percent citing strong 
performances by its pratt amp whitney engines and otis elevator 
operations 
for the quarter ended march 31 utc said its net income 
increased to 1345 million or 101 a share compared with 1237 
million or 95 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue for the quarter rose 67 percent to 48 billion from 
45 billion last year 
robert f daniell chairman and chief executive said strong 
performance from pratt amp whitney and otis more than offset lower 
operating results at carrier ut automotive and the flight systems 
segments 
utcs business backlog reached a record 212 billion on march 
31 up from a record 182 billion a year earlier in the quarter 
pratt amp whitney announced 31 billion in commercial engine orders 
including options 
quarterly operating income for utcs power segment which 
includes pratt amp whitneys commercial engines government engines 
and canadian operations grew to 251 million from 179 million a 
year earlier primarily due to higher spare parts sales continuing 
cost reduction efforts and lower spending on research and 
development 
utcs buildings systems segment which includes otis earned 
92 million compared to 76 million a year earlier company 
officials said the improvement was due to the strong international 
operations of otis 
utcs flight systems segment reported a loss of 11 million for 
the quarter compared to operating earnings of 12 million a year 
ago the company said sikorsky and hamilton standard two divisions 
in the flight systems segment had lower profits because of less 
favorable product mix and reduced royalty income 
utcs industrial segment also had a profit decline dropping to 
16 million from 53 million the decline was attributed largely to 
production of fewer automobiles and light trucks in north america 
as manufacturers reduced dealer inventories 
united technologies manufactures hightechnology products and 
support services to the aerospace building systems and automotive

the european community on wednesday 
questioned the us commitment to international trade accords and 
cited a wide range of trade barriers 
in its fifth annual report on the matter the ec executive 
commission listed nearly 50 tariff and nontariff barriers to trade 
imposed by either washington or individual us states 
these included quantitative restrictions discriminatory public 
procurement policies unreasonable requirements for product 
testing labeling and certification as well as high customs fees 
export subsidies and tax barriers 
the ec report said these raise doubts whether the united 
states is sufficiently committed to the multilateral system which 
provides the main reference point for resolving disputes 
the report said the us must bring its trade legislation 
fully in conformity with multilaterally agreed rules it 
criticized washington for adopting trade laws that conflict with 
multilateral rules and for adopting clearly illegal trade 
measures 
contrary to popular belief in the united states the us 
government was guilty of the types of trade barriers it accuses 
other nations of erecting the report said 
in addition it accused us officials of tardiness in complying 
with rulings of the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
genevabased international trade body 
the community is concerned by the extent to which nontariff 
barriers to its exports now seem to be more and more at the state 
rather than at the federal level the ec report said 
it blamed state regulations on taxation and on financial and 
professional services among others for creating serious 
handicaps to doing business in the us market

two teams of researchers say they have produced 
genetically altered corn plants capable of passing on their newly 
acquired genes to the next generation an advance that other 
scientists hailed on wednesday as a breakthrough 
the technique should allow scientists to develop new strains of 
disease insect and herbicideresistant corn much more quickly 
than they can using traditional crossbreeding techniques the 
researchers said 
genetic engineering of corn the largest and most valuable us 
farm crop has long eluded researchers despite their success with 
such crops as soybeans cotton tobacco and tomatoes said michael 
fromm a molecular biologist at an albany calif research center 
operated by the agriculture department and university of california 
at berkeley 
fromm headed a research group that also included monsanto co 
scientists and which announced its findings monday at a conference 
in keystone colo researchers from dekalb genetics corp a seed 
company based in dekalb ill announced similar findings wednesday 
at the colorado conference 
both groups of researchers used a gene gun to shoot 
microscopic genecoated bullets into corn cells which were then 
grown into mature plants those plants were then fertilized with 
pollen and produced a new generation of seedlings which were shown 
to have the same genetic traits that had been engineered into their 
parents 
the technology is now here to begin applying genetic 
techniques to corn fromm said in a telephone interview 
the scientists said it would be several years before genetically 
engineered corn products are ready for commercial marketing 
it is the gene transfer technology that is important said 
catherine j mackey director of the dekalb research team in a 
news release 
this development is the result of many years of research by a 
team of scientists she said 
genetic researchers have been successfully engineering new 
strains of soybeans tobacco and some other crops for several 
years using a technique involving bacteria that do not work well 
with corn and other cereal crops fromm said 
he said the invention five years ago of the biolistics gene gun 
at cornell university paved the way for genetic engineering of corn 
in the usdamonsanto project scientists transferred two genes 
one that allows corn cells to grow in the presence of a growth 
inhibitor and another derived from firefly genes that causes corn 
cells to glow very faintly too faintly to be seen with the naked 
eye 
the dekalb scientists transferred a gene that makes corn cells 
resistant to a certain herbicide 
alan kriz an assistant professor crop molecular genetics at the 
university of illinois said the findings did indeed represent a 
breakthrough 
kriz said genetic engineering could produce plants resistant to 
pests and disease and nutritionally superior to todays varieties 
corn grain is deficient in certain amino acids kriz said 
we should be able to begin altering for those traits as well 
now

media general inc on wednesday reported a 
77 percent drop in its firstquarter profit from a year earlier as 
newspaper earnings contracted due to a downturn in advertising 
meanwhile two other media companies cited advertising weakness 
in reporting their quarterly results regardless multimedia inc 
posted a 30 percent earnings gain but mcclatchy newspapers incs 
profit was cut in half 
media general said income in the first quarter of 1989 was 
boosted by a gain but excluding that onetime gain earnings this 
year still were off 563 percent 
total revenue slipped slightly by less than 1 percentage point 
although 1990 revenue growth is expected the uncertainty of 
the economy currently is clouding the earnings outlook said 
james s evans the companys president and chief executive officer 
net income fell to 27 million or 10 cents a share from 119 
million or 46 cents a share in the first quarter of 1989 first 
quarter 1989 net income included an aftertax gain of 57 million 
or 22 cents a share from the sale of a california newsprint 
recycling mill 
revenue declined to 148 million from 1493 million last year 
media general said newspaper profits were 442 percent lower in 
the first quarter than a year earlier the company blamed the 
decline on faltering national retail and classified advertising 
sales caused in part by consolidation within the retailing industry 
in particular a media general spokesman pointed to the 
bankruptcy of miller amp rhoads inc in late 1989 the retailer was 
once media generals largest advertising client a media general 
statement said 
the media company is the parent of the richmond timesdispatch 
and the richmond news leader and other daily newspapers as well as 
several broadcast operations broadcast operation profits increased 
25 percent 
multimedia which is based in greenville sc earned 605 
million or 49 cents a share in the first quarter up from 464 
million or 37 cents a share in 1989 
total revenue rose 33 percent to 10983 million from 10630 
million 
the company said newspaper revenue and operating cash flow were 
behind last year mainly because of a sluggish retail advertising 
environment and a downturn in automotive advertising the easter 
advertising season will be credited to this years second quarter 
rather than the first because the holiday fell in april this year 
instead of march as it did in 1989 
multimedia publishes 13 daily and 49 nondaily newspapers owns 
and operates 4 television and 7 radio stations and operates more 
than 100 cable franchises in 4 states it also produces and 
syndicates television programs including the phil donahue and sally 
jessy raphael shows 
mcclatchy newspapers which is based in sacramento calif 
reported income of 236 million or 8 cents a share in the first 
quarter down from 485 million or 17 cents a share in 1989s 
first quarter 
the major factors causing the deterioration in profitability 
were a weakening in ad linage at most newspapers startup losses 
from a newsprint mill partnership and costs related to the 
acquisition in january of six newspapers bought in south carolina 
revenue rose 94 percent to 951 million from 869 million 
mcclatchy operates 11 daily newspapers eight nondaily 
community papers and several senior citizen tabloids

many japanese have luxury cars diamonds and a 
penchant for some of the most expensive delicacies but find one 
coveted item out of reach land 
property prices have driven up business costs widened the 
wealth gap between landowners and landless and made home ownership 
impossible for the average japanese some banks offer 100year 
loans that can be passed down through generations a mortgage 
unheard of elsewhere 
land inflation has given japan 60 percent of the value of all 
real estate worldwide though it comprises 03 percent of the 
worlds land mass 
its not that theres an acute shortage of land on the island 
nation that became the economic miracle of the 20th century 
rather its a murky combination of bureaucracy tax shelters 
lobby interests and unbridled speculation that has made japan the 
planets priciest piece of real estate 
moreover the enormous value attached to japanese land has 
potential economic consequences that go far beyond the borders 
for example property prices affect the financial strength of 
speculators and other large investors who have used their land as 
collateral to buy stocks as much as half of japans phenomenal 
stock market growth of recent years is rooted in the value of 
japanese real estate 
some economists fear a fall in real estate values could 
devastate the stock market which already has dropped dramatically 
this year for other reasons and send financial shock waves around 
the world but others contend property prices must fall as part of 
a broader reform of japans economy 
in talks on changing business practices that have contributed to 
the longstanding us trade deficit with japan the government 
promised earlier this month to curb land inflation 
besides us pressure there also was recognition that drastic 
measures are needed to control real estate speculation and prevent 
the divide between property owners and nonowners from upsetting 
japans social stability said kisaburo ishii a construction 
ministry official involved in the talks 
land prices in tokyo soared 238 percent in 1987 and 653 
percent in 1988 before the increase slowed to less than 2 percent 
last year the national land agency reported 
nationwide however they jumped 17 percent after climbing 217 
percent in 1988 as speculative inflation spread to other major 
japanese cities last year in osaka japans secondbiggest city 
commercial land prices surged 439 percent and residential prices 
586 percent 
the worlds most expensive commercial property in central 
tokyos marunouchi and ginza business districts is valued at about 
23700 a square foot 
office space in tokyo rents for an average 191 a square foot 
vs 156 in london and 64 in new york with vacancy rates hovering 
around 02 percent its a landlords market 
after touting the my home dream for years newspapers now 
feature tales of families who scrimped for decades only to find 
even a modest home 90 minutes outside tokyo well out of reach 
an averagesize house of about 960 square feet about an hours 
commute from central tokyo costs 316000 inside tokyo prices 
shoot above 632000 for houses and about 378000 for smaller 
condominium apartments 
although mainstream wageearners now earn an average of 50000 
annually many are doomed to a renters life since banks generally 
will lend only four times an annual income for a conventional home 
mortgage 
competition for new homes in tokyos vast suburbs is so intense 
that hundreds apply for each opening many homes are sold by 
lottery before the foundations are laid 
some families giving up on ever owning a home instead are 
spending on cars travel and other luxuries 
nationwide an average of about 60 percent of all households own 
their homes in greater tokyo home to around 30 million of 
japans 122 million people only 40 percent do 
the government must deal with this problem said susumu 
ichihata senior managing director of the urban research institute 
in tokyo now that most japanese live in cities these problems 
could cause political unrest 
while rents on older apartments have been controlled for 
decades newcomers to the housing market face rents prohibitively 
high 
spacious westernstyle apartment rentals fetch 31409500 a 
month a 650squarefoot japanesestyle unit rents for about 820 
landlords customarily demand at least four months rent up front 
part refundable deposit but about two months rent in 
nonrefundable key money paid for the privilege of becoming a

renters find the home scramble a nightmare 
ive just returned to tokyo and we need to move to a bigger 
flat im really in a bind because theres no way we can afford to 
buy a home said tadao aoki a government aide who recently 
returned from a posting abroad 
most real estate purchases in tokyo today are by people with 
property to sell or to borrow against and by brokers buying and 
reselling land to profit from price increases 
real estate investment with its various writeoffs is seen as 
the easiest way for many high income earners and landowners to 
avoid high income and inheritance taxes 
the incentive becomes great for property brokers supported by 
bankers anxious not to miss a fastgrowing market to jack up 
prices 
banks accept the unrealized value of property as collateral 
and provide financing the same way a casino shucks out poker 
chips said tokunosuke hasegawa head of the research institute 
of construction and economy 
real estate lending is so lucrative that banks apparently have 
ignored repeated finance ministry warnings to cut back 
the government also is considering tax reforms aimed at shifting 
about 148200 acres of farmland and underutilized acreage in the 
tokyo metropolitan region to residential use 
farmland owners pay less than 00001 percent of the assessed 
value of their land in taxes compared with 7080 times that rate 
for residential land farmland also is virtually exempt from 
inheritance taxes which can rise as high as 80 percent of 
inherited assets 
tax reforms promised in japanus trade talks however face 
strong opposition from the powerful farm lobby and inertia among 
people accustomed to paying low taxes even if it means living 
without sewer lines 
although many japanese fear falling land prices could hurt the 
economy some economists contend that lower land prices would allow 
the japanese to build bigger better houses a development certain 
to boost the economy in the long run others say a propertymarket 
decline would squeeze out the worst of the speculators who have 
profited enormously from the cycle of land inflation 
this is a bubble economy and its time for the bubble to 
burst said hasegawa the real productive economy wont really 
be hurt land and people wont disappear but phony wealth will

occidental petroleum corp said wednesday its 
firstquarter profit rose 62 percent despite a 96 million tumble 
in earnings from its chemical division 
combined results from oil natural gas and gas transmission 
operations rose by 98 million offsetting the lower chemical 
division profits occidental said 
the big oil chemical and agribusiness company said it earned 
108 million or 37 cents per share compared with 67 million or 
24 cents per share in the same period in 1989 
revenue increased by 2 percent from 51 billion to 52 
billion 
higher worldwide crude oil prices higher domestic natural gas 
and natural gas liquids prices and the resumption of oil 
production in the north sea helped push oil and gas division 
earnings to 100 million compared with 35 million in the same 
period a year earlier 
natural gas transmission earnings were 94 million compared 
with 61 million for 1989 reflecting lower operating costs a rate 
refund and a 12 million benefit from an adjustment to certain tax 
reserves 
the chemical divisions earnings fell from 282 million to 186 
million reflecting lower margins in petrochemicals polymers and 
plastics mainly due to industrywide lower prices occidental said 
the 1990 results also reflected a 36 million pretax gain from 
the settlement of a claim against venezuela stemming from the 1975 
nationalization of occidental operations

oil prices continued to slide wednesday 
despite a vague call by a trio of opec heavyweights for cutting 
back on the the overproduction of crude oil 
on the new york mercantile exchange the nearterm crude 
contract settled at its lowest level in 16 months despite a 
statement from the oil ministers of saudi arabia kuwait and the 
united arab emirates urging production restraint 
its a fairly empty statement said nick antill an analyst 
at county natwest in london 
rumors swept the markets that kuwait and the united arab 
emirates members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries had privately agreed to slash their output 
but lucy mullins an analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in 
london said the market is taking all of this with a large pinch 
of salt 
if they wanted to reduce production they would probably 
have included it in the statement said pierre terzian editor of 
the parisbased newsletter petrostrategies 
moreover mullins said previous promises by persistent cheaters 
kuwait and the emirates to trim supply have not meant very much 
at all 
the two gulf countries have been pumping well above the quotas 
opec sets for each of its 13 members creating a world oil glut 
during the oftenweak second quarter of the year 
analysts estimate opec output at more than 24 million barrels a 
day exceeding the ceiling of 221 million barrels a day in effect 
for the first half of the year 
prices began plummeting sharply last week prompting hurried 
discussions among opec nations about whether to hold an emergency 
meeting 
no session has yet been called but a source close to the 
presidency of the cartel who demanded anonymity said it remains 
an option algerian mines minister sadek boussena is the current 
opec president 
there was no mention of a special meeting in the statement 
issued by the oil ministers who met tuesday evening in jeddah 
saudi arabia 
it seems that the jeddah message is the following do not meet 
for the moment unless prices collapse said terzian 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the 
cartel plunged to 1538 per 42gallon barrel last week well off 
the organizations target of 18 a barrel 
the basket price was 1712 a barrel in the first week of april 
on new yorks merc the contract for may delivery of west texas 
intermediate the benchmark american brand fell 48 cents to settle 
at 1696 a barrel the contract which lost 41 cents on tuesday 
had been off as much as 84 cents during the day 
it had been trading in the range of 20 to 21 a barrel early in 
april 
antill predicted prices would continue slipping in advance of 
the regular opec meeting in late may when the oil ministers are to 
set their pricing and output guidelines for the last half of the 
year 
mullins said the excess of oil will continue to keep prices 
depressed in the next few weeks 
opec officials had been expecting prices to decline in the 
apriljune period when demand for oil normally weakens with warmer 
temperatures in the united states and other consuming nations but 
last weeks sudden fall was a surprise 
in their statement saudi arabias hisham nazer kuwaits ali 
khalifa alsabah and the emirates mana saeed otaiba expressed 
grave concern about the recent developments in the market 
they blamed the fall in prices on increased crude production by 
both opec and nonopec countries 
the solution which would guarantee relative market stability 
is for opec members to commit themselves to respect the production 
ceiling and the individual production quotas set out for the member 
states according to the statement carried by the saudi press 
agency 
analysts estimate that saudi arabia the worlds leading oil 
exporter is producing about 300000 barrels a day above its quota 
of 54 million barrels 
the emirates is pumping about 2 million barrels a day double 
its quota according to the estimates kuwait is believed producing 
about 19 million barrels a day over its cap of 15 million 
barrels a day

house democrats unveiled their own 12 
trillion budget for next year on wednesday a plan that calls for 
8 billion less in military spending than president bush wants 
the package which the house budget committee plans to vote on 
thursday would also increase spending by 6 billion on programs 
that include child care nasa and aid to central america eastern 
europe and africa 
the proposal is the first detailed response by democratic 
leaders to the 1991 fiscal year budget bush requested in january 
at the time democrats complained bushs spending blueprint was not 
a serious effort to reduce the deficit and was too generous to the 
military at a time of lessening tensions with the soviet union 
the world has changed greatly said house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash who outlined highlights of the plan at a news 
conference with other top democrats the united states is 
obviously now in a position to look more intensively at the 
problems that lie within our own country 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
predicted approval by his democraticdominated panel he said the 
package reflects a transition from military confrontation to 
economic leadership from a cold war economy to a peacetime 
economy 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the budget 
panel called the proposal a typical democratic budget without 
discipline gop lawmakers will vote aganst the democratic plan 
he said and continue pressing for talks between congress and the 
administration as the best way to close the budget gap 
the democratic proposal claims to trim the 1991 deficit by 36 
billion to 638 billion that would be just below the 64 billion 
target set by the grammrudman deficitreduction act which 
requires a balanced budget by 1993 fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office has said the 
administration is underestimating next years deficit by 70 
billion it expects the 1991 budget deficit to be 161 billion 
before budget reduction starts 
the democrats would slice 115 billion off the amount the 
military would need next year to stay abreast of inflation that 
would leave defense spending at 295 billion 8 billion less than 
bush wants 
they would shrink defense spending by 251 billion over the next 
five years about a 25 percent cut the democrats would spend 106 
billion of that on domestic programs and count 145 billion 
against the deficit 
the democrats would also cut next years military budget 
authority to 286 billion 30 billion below the total needed to 
keep up with inflation budget authority is the amount of spending 
an agency can enter into over a number of years the reduction is 
crucial because it would signal the start of a longrange decline 
in pentagon spending 
panettas plan would raise taxes by 139 billion the same 
amount bush proposed in january and collect an additional 56 
billion in new government fees 
the anticipated growth of medicare and other federal benefit 
programs would be slowed by 42 billion other savings would 
include delaying a federal pay raise for three months and improving 
the efficiency of tax collection 
the plan would also boost spending in several areas of science 
including nasa improve federal health efforts for children and 
increase expenditures for education road building and anticrime 
intiatives 
the congressional budget process was getting its formal start 
after weeks of closeddoor meetings among democratic budgetwriters 
and party leaders 
they spent much of their time fashioning a compromise on 
pentagon spending which represents onefourth of the budget 
between conservatives seeking levels similar to bushs request and 
liberals who wanted deeper cuts 
panetta and other leaders also had to sound out their members 
about two wellpublicized budget plans released by two top 
democrats earlier this year in the end they decided to ignore 
both proposals 
chairman dan rostenkowski dill of the taxwriting house ways 
and means committee had proposed saving 55 billion next year with 
a wide range of spending cuts and tax increases sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny suggested cutting the social security 
payroll tax by 55 billion to intensify concerns about the budget 
deficit 
because these decisions had to be made congress again missed 
the april 15 legal deadline for completing its budget the 
requirement is routinely ignored year after year 
budget work is also going slowly in the senate where budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn is having trouble 
rounding up enough votes to move a spending plan out of his 
committee sasser favors cutting defense by 15 billion about 35 
billion more than panetta wants 
the budget resolution need only be passed by congress and does 
not need the presidents signature 
it is only a blueprint for spending and savings later bills 
will determine how the government spends its money and which taxes 
if any will be raised

crude oil futures settled lower wednesday but 
bargain hunters on a lastminute buying spree helped lift prices 
from their worst levels 
still traders remained largely bearish amid disappointment that 
a recent meeting of opec ministers failed to produce any tangible 
results 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for may 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude oil slid 48 cents to 1696 per 42gallon barrel after 
plummeting 41 cents on tuesday the contract which traded as low 
as 1660 a barrel hasnt settled as low since december 1988 
but other contract months took far less of a hit june crude was 
off just 30 cents a barrel while the august contract was down 34 
cents 
analysts are reluctant to attach too much significance to 
declines in the may contract since it expires friday as a contract 
nears its expiration its price becomes increasingly more volatile 
the may contract closed 113 lower than the june contract when 
a more typical discount is closer to 30 to 50 cents a barrel noted 
bob baker senior energy analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
refined petroleum products traded on the merc fell sharply after 
finishing mixed on tuesday 
the contract for may delivery of unleaded gasoline lost 089 
cent to settle at 5955 cents a gallon after rising 023 cent on 
tuesday homeheating oil for may delivery dropped 151 cents to 
5269 cents a gallon after losing 052 cent in the previous session 
traders were disappointed that a meeting of three opec ministers 
failed to result in a plan to cut ongoing overproduction by some 
cartel members 
analysts estimate opec output at more than 24 million barrels a 
day exceeding the ceiling of 221 million barrels a day in effect 
for the first half of the year 
after a meeting late tuesday oil ministers of saudi aabia 
kuwait and the united arab emirates issued a weak statement saying 
they were gravely concerned about market conditions the 
triumvirate said the solution would be for members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to hold to 
agreedupon production ceilings 
but the lack of any clearcut plan brought out cynicism that 
opec cant handle their affairs baker said 
the market got nothing more than vague assurances that for two 
months they wont overproduce said peter beutel an assistant 
director at elders futures inc 
theres a great deal of skepticism that that will actually 
come to pass and that it will have that big an effect on the 
market he added 
crude futures prices reflected the pessimism throughout the 
session but about a half hour before the close prices turned 
higher as bargainhunters began to buy 
meanwhile natural gas for june delivery settled at 1583 per 
million british thermal units off slightly from 1585 on tuesday

million or 60 cents a share off from earnings of 14330 million 
or 77 cents a share in the yearago quarter 
operating revenue increased 85 percent to 115 billion from 
106 billion a year earlier 
revenue growth for the quarter amounted to 4 percent when 
adjusted to reflect the acquisition of management science american 
in late 1989 and the divestiture of thomas cook travel usa a year 
ago the company said 
operating income was off 25 percent at 16878 million compared 
with 22482 million a year earlier 
dun amp bradstreet which markets business information worldwide 
attributed the declines in both profits and operating income to a 
decrease in revenue at its us credit services its commercial 
credit information business 
the company also was adversely affected by the expiration of a 
contract with chesapeake amp potomac telephone co dun amp bradstreets

general dynamics corp the nations second 
largest defense contractor reported wednesday that firstquarter 
profits were up 64 percent thanks to a onetime gain from the 
settlement of an antitrust litigation 
without the big boost general dynamics net earnings would have 
slipped 17 percent 
the company headquartered in st louis had profits of 1237 
million or 297 a share for the quarter which ended march 31 
that compares to 754 million or 181 share for the same period 
in 1989 
sales for the quarter were 25 billion up 5 percent from 24 
billion in the first quarter of 1989 
the onetime gain in the quarter of 615 million came march 22 
when general dynamics and american telephone amp telegraph co 
settled a 7yearold lawsuit in federal court in chicago 
the lawsuit alleged that atampt tried to monopolize the market for 
business telephone systems and other equipment with several unfair 
business practices the settlement included a denial of all 
allegations by both parties 
stanley pace chairman and chief executive officer said profits 
declined in every defenserelated segment of the company including 
military aircraft submarines and missiles space and electronic 
systems 
he said that the company had reduced its earnings expectations 
on its f16 program because of higher costs and transfer of 
employees to other projects and in its missiles space and 
electronic systems segment because the company earned fewer 
contracts than expected 
on the positive side pace said the successful market 
acceptance of cessnas citation v business jet was the key factor 
in a dramatic increase in sales and earnings in the companys 
general aviation sector 
cessna delivered 16 citation vs during the first quarter nearly 
half of the total delivered last year pace said cessna holds 92 
additional orders 
the ceo said an increase in interest expense to 194 million 
from 141 million in the same period a year ago reflected the 
higher level of company borrowing the increased borrowing was made 
necessary by accelerated tax payments required by changes in 
accounting methods and for continuing investments in advanced 
programs he said

american airlines parent amr corp 
posted a 193 million first quarter loss wednesday blaming higher 
fuel and labor costs for its first loss in more than two years 
our results can only be called unsatisfactory said chairman 
robert l crandall 
amr whose american airlines is the nations biggest airline is 
the first of the nations major airline companies to report 
earnings for the traditionally slow first quarter analysts expect 
most airlines to report losses or smaller profit than last year 
amrs loss was less than many industry analysts had expected 
amr said it lost 31 cents per share on total operating revenue 
of 269 billion in the same period last year amr had a profit of 
1567 million or 160 per share on revenue of 245 billion 
expenses increased by 4021 million the company said with 
265 percent coming from higher fuel prices fuel jumped from 
3223 million in the yearago quarter to 4287 million this year 
labor costs also rose 85 million while other expenses were up 
2107 million 
american airlines which accounts for almost 94 percent of amr 
revenues lost 236 million compared with a profit of 1584 
million last year the loss wiped out profit from other amr 
subsidiaries which include american eagle commuter airline and 
several subsidiaries related to the travel and information 
industries 
cargo volumes are strong crandall said the growth of 
passenger traffic in the international markets particularly 
europe the caribbean and asia was outstanding but growth in 
domestic markets was weak 
during the quarter american expanded its operations in europe 
and australia the company also agreed to buy the latin american 
operations of eastern airlines a deal which is still pending 
federal review 
amr also has 146 percent more employees this year than last 
year 
the company flew 175 billion passenger miles compared to 162 
billion in the same quarter last year 
when a company is growing like that therere a lot of upfront 
costs said analyst mark daugherty at dean witter reynolds 
theyve invested a lot in planes employees and training for 
the long term the unfortunate result is in the short term it 
involves a lot of expenses 
amr said its revenue yield per passenger mile a key measure of 
performance was unchanged at 1273 cents 
the passenger load factor also was unchanged at 599 percent 
however the breakeven load factor the percentage of seats that 
must be occupied for the airline to break even moved from 548 
percent last year to 606 percent this year

oil traders were unimpressed with a vague call by three opec 
heavyweights for cutting back on the overproduction of crude oil

exporting countries in excess of their opecimposed quotas has been 
cited by some analysts as a major cause of a global oil glut and 
the resulting 22 percent drop in prices since early march

emirates met tuesday evening in jeddah saudi arabia and later 
issued a statement urging production restraint

for more said andrew lebow an energy analyst with ed amp f man 
international futures inc 
traders had little reaction to tuesdays weekly us oil 
inventory figures from the american petroleum institute the trade 
group reported a modest 814000barrel increase last week in us

atampt chairman robert e allen defended his 
company wednesday against protesters who accused it of caving in to 
abortion foes and union members who said it pushed workers out of 
jobs to boost profits 
union workers picketed outside as allen delivered an optimistic 
message to shareholders at american telephone amp telegraph cos 
annual meeting the workers accused atampt of achieving profits by 
unnecessarily laying off 13500 workers in 1988 and planning to 
discharge another 9000 this year while raising some executives 
pay by 35 percent 
jobs with justice the protesters chanted as about 1000 
stockholders of atampt one of the most widely held and largest of 
us companies filed into a huge hall at the los angeles 
convention center 
the demonstrators accused atampt of exporting jobs to countries 
with cheap labor allen said that was done only when absolutely 
necessary to stay competitive or to sell products in the foreign 
countries themselves 
allen also faced questions about atampts cutoff of funding to 
planned parenthood federation of american inc to which atampt had 
given more than 200000 over the past 25 years 
atampt said last month it would not give the group a donation next 
year due to the controversy over abortion this year atampt donated 
50000 
planned parenthood accused atampt of corporate cowardice in 
fullpage ads in new york and los angeles newspapers the group 
said atampts donations have not been used for abortion services and 
that the companys recent contributions have been restricted to 
teen pregnancy prevention programs 
typical of the complaints was a letter from new york city 
comptroller elizabeth holtzman who wrote on behalf of the citys 
employee pension fund which owns atampt stock 
by providing family planning assistance planned 
parenthood helps to reduce unwanted pregnancies and thus the 
incidence of abortion she wrote 
at a news conference before the meeting allen said planned 
parenthood recently shifted its position and became a strong 
advocate of legalized abortion he said atampt could not afford to 
jeopardize its corporate position of neutrality on abortion 
we became tainted and tarnished among a number of our 
constituents he said because we became known as having a 
proabortion stance 
at the meeting shareholders spent about 45 minutes discussing a 
proposal from one stockholder that would have instructed the 
company to refrain from supporting any proabortion organization 
the company recommended that shareholders reject the proposal 
citing its wish to remain neutral 
shareholders overwhelmingly turned down the proposal with 6187 
million shares voted against it to 361 million in favor said atampt 
spokesman dick gray 
as for layoffs allen said atampt has unfortunately been 
forced to cut its work force by 102000 salaried and hourly 
employees since 1984 when it was required to spin off its regional 
telephone companies 
this is not an easy task for any of us but it is necessary if 
we are to compete in any of our markets he said 
atampt and unions representing 135000 of its employees reached 
tentative agreement tuesday on improved pension benefits designed 
to encourage early retirements and thus reduce the need for layoffs 
allen told shareholders that the company had its best year ever 
in 1989 in terms of profits revenues earnings per share and stock 
price 
atampt is moving forward into the decade of the 1990s fleeter 
of foot quicker in its reponse to customers and to changes in the 
marketplace more alert to new targets of opportunity for growth 
he said according to a company statement 
he said the company planned to introduce in about five years 
equipment that would switch phone signals by pulses of light 
dramatically increasing the capacity of the phone network 
currently light is used to send phone signals over fiber optic 
lines but the light pulses must be converted back to electrical 
impulses before they are switched to other lines 
before the meeting atampt reported that its firstquarter profit 
rose 125 percent to 668 million or 62 cents a share compared 
with earnings of 594 million or 55 cents a share in the first 
three months of 1989 revenue totaled 889 billion up 27 percent 
from 866 billion

for an imageobsessed outfit like the walt 
disney co the soiled mickey mouse disposable diapers scattered 
throughout garbage dumps dont exactly proclaim environmental 
activism 
mca inc is making points with a company recycling program and 
earthfriendly television shows movies videos and records but 
some critics say the entertainment conglomerate is mismanaging 
yosemite national park which an mca subsidiary oversees 
industrial giants from exxon corp to union carbide corp 
present fat targets for environmentalists but the reach of the 
green movement has grown so much that even disney and mca home of 
such squeaky clean characters as snow white and et now must 
answer to the ecological accountants 
not long ago the world looked to hollywood for escapism in 
recent years however public pressure has led the entertainment 
industry to reexamine its depiction of alcohol abuse violence 
toward women birth control and bigotry 
now that the environment has become the hot issue hollywood 
once again is trying to set an example 
nbcs alf is among the most environmentally conscious tv 
shows one recent episode had the furry alien battling 
chlorofluorocarbon polluters nbc distributed note pads of recycled 
paper to advertise the show 
the episode reflected well on nbc and its parent general 
electric co but ge isnt ranked too highly by environmental groups 
at ges annual meeting april 25 for example shareholder 
activists have resolutions on the agenda urging the company to 
devise a plan to stop producing hazardous wastes and cut its own 
chlorofluorocarbon pollution 
these days the entertainment industry is not content generating 
ecological programs such as the disney channels presentation this 
month of antipollution shows 
instead many hollywood companies are practicing their own 
environmentalism disney and mca for example say theyre 
motivated by genuine concern 
were not out to publicize our efforts said garrett de 
bell mcas environmental consultant 
last month disney appointed a new environmental czar kym 
murphy who reports directly to company chieftains michael eisner 
and frank wells and says they realize the amazing responsibility 
we have 
our ability to influence is remarkable and the perception 
people have of us is really hard to live up to murphy said 
has disney done so not entirely he acknowledged 
i think if you ask people does disney recycle they would 
say gee they must if anybody does 
in fact disney does not disney is anxious to start a better 
program he said 
one of murphys first chores was contacting the procter amp gamble 
co which buys licenses rights to print little disney characters 
on the adhesive strips that hold disney babies disposable diapers 
to infant bottoms 
disposable diapers are among the fastestgrowing components of 
landfill rubbish about 16 billion are dumped each year 
environmentalists say they can take decades to decompose 
murphy said procter amp gamble researchers are pulling out all 
the stops to make their products more environmentally safe 
his other chief environmental headache has been disneys 
quasicity government that exercises neartotal power over 27000 
acres surrounding the companys florida operations home of walt 
disney world and other fun parks 
for the past two years disney has come under heavy criticism 
from some local community leaders who say it doesnt pay the 
environmental costs generated by millions of tourists 
disney finally agreed to pay 14 million in additional property 
taxes but then angered locals even more by announcing construction 
of seven more hotels 29 new attractions a fourth amusement park 
and 19000 more workers 
they can go out there and pave over anything they want to do 
without going through any kind of environmental review said bill 
donegan an orange county fla commissioner whoss led an effort 
to make disney more accountable 
we dont know the real impact environmentally we dont know 
how many woodpeckers nests have been destroyed how many eagles 
how many ospreys 
mca has been trumpeting its attention to the environment both 
on the universal studios lot and in film and tv at mca offices in 
universal city the company began a companywide recycling program 
using containers decorated with a woody woodpecker logo 
the staff at mca subsidiary universal television met last fall 
with representatives of the environmental media association an 
organization that promotes earthfriendly messages in the 
entertainment industry 
andy spahn ema director said producers asked how recycling 
themes could be incorporated into storylines 
this is not a problem that can be solved by government action 
alone he said through film television and music the 
industry is in a unique position to reach millions of people and 
show them they can make a difference 
others say the real test of a companys commitment to the 
environment is not whether it makes shows about recycling more 
important they say is whether a companys decisions do more for 
the planet than for profits 
high profile companies cannot change the world 
singlehandedly but they can set an example said richard 
branson chairman of virgin records and virgin atlantic airways and 
a longtime environmental activist 
its so often people will talk about causes without doing 
something that actually affects themselves or their business 
said branson 
sleeves for virgins records artists include paula abdul soul 
ii soul are recycled paper virgin atlantic says it will plant a 
tree for every passenger flying between london and los angeles in 
the next 12 months 
at the hard rock cafe chain employees sort waste paper and 
beverage bottles said founder peter morton 
were not suddenly converts to the environmental movement now 
that its fashionable he said noting that the phrase save the 
planet has been part of the companys logo for 10 years 
despite earning millions of dollars at yosemite on a concession 
fee of 600000 mcas yosemite park and curry co is as committed 
to the park as it is to shareholders the company says 
environmental consultant de bell who lives in yosemite said 
that when yosemite switched from polystyrene cups to recyclable 
paper containers it cost mca about 20000 we want to do good 
business and improve the environment as much as possible de bell 
said 
dan jensen executive vice president of mcas curry unit said 
the subsidiary declined an offer worth hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from a automobile maker wanting to call itself yosemites 
official car 
we would have been preying on the name yosemite which is not 
ours to own jensen said 
environmental critics say mca has spent too much marketing the 
california park and doesnt spend enough money maintaining it 
de bell said the criticisms have been blown out of proportion 
because yosemite is a shrine of the environmental movement

do celebrities really care about spotted owls 
the ozone layer and rain forests or are they simply treehugging 
the cause of the week 
the evidence suggests that while numerous entertainers actor 
ed begley jr and singer jackson browne among them have adapted 
environmentally friendly living practices many others are slow to 
practice what they preach 
at a recent beverly hills benefit for the brazilian rain forest 
an array of hollywood celebrities superstars like jane fonda and 
agent michael ovitz were warned of the dangers of global warming 
and pollution 
the 1000 or so guests dined on organic foods they raised 12 
million for the environment then they went for their limos idling 
patiently stretching for blocks exhaust filled the evening air 
it was scarcely an isolated slip when hollywoods blueribbon 
environmental media association held its first organizational 
meeting at producer norman lears house ema founders arrived in 
mercedes bmws rollsroyces and other gasguzzlers 
producer ted field and wife susie who hosted the beverly hills 
rain forest benefit are longtime contributors to the natural 
resources defense council and charter members of ema they also 
have been known to fly to their spacious aspen home in a private 
jet 
its great celebrities are getting involved said bob 
hattoy a lobbyist for the sierra club but its not about doing 
lunch its about changing the way that we live lifestyles of the 
rich and famous are often lifestyles of the wasteful and 
indulgent 
the entertainment industry is symbolic of the values of 
everyone in our culture said bonnie reiss who founded the earth 
communications office eco seeks to add environmental themes to 
television shows and movies 
we have to get the rich and famous to truly examine their 
lifestyles reiss said 
environmentalism has yet to become hollywoods flavor of the 
month all the same the nations trendsetters are catching on 
slowly hollywood has long been the land of excess and tradition 
does not die easily 
at an april news conference for abcs earth day special 
celebrity performers were ferried to the event in you guessed it 
limousines 
tom cruise has visited the amazonian rain forest and is a member 
of the eco so is his next movie about global warming not quite 
cruise stars next in days of thunder a movie about the hardly 
fuelefficient sport of auto racing 
scientists reckon a third of all global warming gases are 
transportationproduced neither paramount pictures nor cruises 
publicist could say how many thousands of gallons of fuel were used 
making days of thunder 
olivia newtonjohn a top environmental activist is damaging a 
stretch of the southern california coastline her malibu neighbors 
have charged in a civil complaint 
newtonjohn and her husband have polluted the ocean with tons of 
dirt and sand removed during the construction of their 6000 square 
foot home overlooking the beach the complaint charges 
its blown way out of proportion newtonjohn said i had 
an environmental specialist look at the property i care about the 
environment 
diehard environmentalists dont wear furs or leather so how 
did people dress at the beverly hills rain forest benefit 
singer don henley who performed at the fundraiser said he had 
visited the cloak room before coming on stage what did he see 
about a quarter of a million dollars worth of dead animals 
actor begley is one of the handful of personalities who has 
reordered his life to save the planet he rides a bicycle or takes 
the bus to work has a compost heap in his back yard and has 
installed 15watt bulbs in his house 
we dont need any more definition of environmental problems 
begley said we need action

actor said the electricity will come from solar cells and all 
water will be heated by the sun 
other leading earth activists include ted danson lloyd bridges 
hart bochner and melanie mayron

days of thunder set lives in a modest house and rides his

us sprint communications co said wednesday it 
will go ahead with a disputed proposal to offer special 800number 
calling for taxpayers seeking information from the internal revenue 
service 
one of sprints major rivals mci communications corp had 
challenged the enhanced tollfree offering saying the service 
fell outside the scope of the contract for the new federal 
longdistance system known as fts 2000 sprint is providing 40 
percent of fts 2000 atampt has 60 percent 
mci lost out in the bidding for fts 2000 estimated to be worth 
25 billion over 10 years and has been ready to pounce when any 
federal agency has sought to add services not explicitly outlined 
under the fts 2000 contract 
after the fts 2000 contract was awarded in december 1988 the 
irs said it needed special callrouting service to handle the huge 
volume on its incoming 800 lines the agency planned to let atampt 
provide the enhanced 800 service but when mci protested it agreed 
to open up the bidding to outside companies 
but the general services administration which oversees fts 
2000 told the irs it could have the service under fts 2000 
because sprints share of fts 2000 system included the irs the gsa 
said sprint could offer the additional service 
mci claimed the gsas decision in favor of sprint amounted to an 
impermissible solesource award but the federal board of contract 
appeals rejected mcis claim on feb 27 
the appeals board action allowed sprint to sign a letter of 
intent with the government for the enhanced 800 service sprint 
spokeswoman janis langley said wednesday 
the taxpayer assistance service handles more than 60 million 
calls per year according to sprint which valued the contract at 
450 million over 10 years 
sprint plans to have all the voice traffic in its fts 2000 
contract switched over to sprints network by the end of the month 
langley said the special 800 service should be in place by the end 
of the year 
mci spokeswoman pam small said the company still was considering 
an appeal on the feb 27 decision in the us court of appeals 
the fbi confirmed in february that it is investigating claims 
that sprint illegally obtained competitors confidential bid 
information to win the fts 2000 contract sprint has denied the 
allegations which were contained in a suit filed in washington by 
two former sprint employees

stores in lowell mass and danbury conn 
cincinnatibased allied and federated department stores which 
own 260 stores nationwide have been operating under chapter 11 
bankruptcy law protection from creditors since jan 15 
because of our chapter 11 status it is incumbent upon us to 
review all contracts all services and all store operations with a 
keen eye jordan marsh chairman richard van pelt said in a 
prepared statement issued tuesday 
he said the lowell store which needed major renovation would 
close on june 20 the danbury store which he said was becoming 
less competitive in the market was scheduled to close by july 15 
van pelt said the 42 fulltime and 40 parttime employees at the 
lowell store and the 60 fulltime and 69 parttime employees at 
the danbury store would be offered jobs at other jordan marsh 
locations 
jordan marsh with 26 stores is new englands largest 
department store chain and employs about 10000 people 
allen questrom chairman of federated and allied issued a 
statement saying that the retailers were reviewing each stores 
profitability and determining which to close 
we can reaffirm at this point however that we expect to 
close only a small number of our 260 stores nationally as a direct 
result of the ability to reject leases under chapter 11 questrom 
said

opened 12 stores in highgrowth markets and closed 10 stores in 
other areas 
store openings and closings are a normal part of the retail 
business questrom said 
the operations review process now underway is no different 
from that of any other year with one exception because this 
years review is being conducted under the auspices of chapter 11 
we have the added ability to reject certain store leases that 
otherwise would have bound us to lowerprofit locations 
questrom said decisions on store closings would be announced as 
they are made

that we intend to take advantage of the additional flexibility 
provided by the filing he said at this time however we have

the cocacola co is marking the fifth 
anniversary of new coke with advertisements thanking consumers for 
rejecting it 
the fullpage ad scheduled to run friday in seven major 
newspapers does not mention new coke by name but notes that five 
years ago consumers responded to the arrival of the reformulated 
drink by demanding the return of cocacolas original formula 
five years ago we learned what back by popular demand can 
really mean the ad says new coke was introduced on april 23 
1985 
meanwhile wednesday pepsicola co announced it has signed its 
latest celebrity promoter in rival cokes backyard boxer evander 
holyfield of atlanta

power of the american consumer and we certainly agree says the

thats why we gathered together all of the cocacola company 
employees in atlanta to salute you and thank you for telling us

shearson lehman hutton inc said wednesday it 
lost 915 million in the first three months of 1990 the biggest 
quarterly loss in wall street history 
merrill lynch amp co reported a 16 percent increase in 
firstquarter profit despite lower revenue as costcutting efforts 
began to pay off for the nations largest brokerage which lost 
money in 1989 
the loss at shearson which the firm forecast two weeks ago was 
attributed to a 630 million charge against earnings to pay for a 
restructuring that included thousands of layoffs and the 
elimination or reduction of several businesses 
the restructuring was implemented after parent american express 
co moved to seize tighter control of the nations no 2 investment 
firm which has struggled during a bad period on wall street 
following broad expansion in the 1980s american express plans to 
acquire all shearson stock it does not own 
shearson also said it took a 157 million charge against 
firstquarter earnings because of an accounting change in the way 
it pays for development of computer software 
excluding the onetime charges shearson still lost 128 million 
for the quarter 
the firstquarter operating loss before the restructuring 
charge stems from a slowdown in overall business activity and other 
firstquarter 1990 events shearson said 
the overall first quarter loss before the accounting change 
equaled 875 per share that compared to a loss of 15 million or 
24 cents a share in the same 1989 period total revenue fell 15 
percent to 26 billion from 3 billion a year earlier 
shearson said it increased litigation reserves by 50 million 
added 32 million to a loan loss reserve primarily related to the 
portfolio of its boston co subsidiary and lost 34 million 
because of fluctuations in the highyield bond market 
shearson said it had 54 million in income related to the 
settlement of litigation in connection with the suspension of 
trading in tin by the london metal exchange in 1986 
merrill lynch said it made 413 million or 34 cents a share in 
the first quarter compared with 355 million or 29 cents per 
share last year revenue declined to 266 billion from 279 
billion 
commissions principal transactions insurance and asset 
management and custodial fee revenue increased while interest and 
dividend investment banking and other revenue declined 
merrill lynch took a 470 million charge against earnings in the 
previous quarter to pay for a major restructuring which gave the 
firm its first annual loss since going public in 1971 merrill 
plans to eliminate about 3000 jobs by the end of 1990 and is 
divesting some product lines and businesses 
merrill shearson and other wall street firms have been 
struggling because of declines in stock market activity and key 
businesses such as stock and bond underwriting and mergers and 
takeovers since the 1987 stock market crash 
were saying that in these weak market conditions firms that 
generate profits are doing pretty well said jeffrey bowman who 
follows the securities industry for standard amp poors corp 
merrill and shearson reported lower investment banking revenue 
as business remained sluggish in stock and bond underwriting and 
merchant banking merrills business fell 267 percent and 
shearsons 25 percent 
brokerage commission revenue was up 42 percent at merrill and 
down 53 percent at shearson 
at shearson revenue from marketmaking and principal 
transactions also fell sharply attributed in part to volatility in 
the collapsed junk bond market shearson is selling its portfolios 
of junk bonds it holds for investment 
merrill chairman william a schreyer said in a statement that he 
expected a previously announced restructuring program which 
includes a cut through sharp staff reductions to positively impact 
earnings for the rest of the year 
merrill said quarterly expenses totaled 260 billion down 5 
percent from 273 billion reported in the 1989 period

cents a share clendenin said

outstanding in the first quarter of 1989 increased that quarters

eastern airlines creditors would receive 30 
cents on the dollar under the latest reorganization proposal 
offered by the airlines parent texas air corp texas air chairman 
frank lorenzo said wednesday 
lorenzo in his first testimony yet before the bankruptcy court 
supervising easterns reorganization spoke at a hearing over 
unsecured creditors request to remove him from control of eastern 
in favor of a courtappointed trustee 
eastern argues that putting an outsider in charge would hurt its 
chances of financial recovery the company has been attempting to 
reach an agreement with the creditors to forestall such a move 
earlier eastern president phil bakes testified that appointment 
of a trustee would spark employee departures hurt business further 
and heighten the chance eastern eventually would have to be 
liquidated 
lorenzo said that under a reorganization proposal made monday 
unsecured creditors would get 30 cents on the dollar about 20 
percent of that in cash and the rest in securities creditors also 
would get about 8 percent of texas airs stock 
creditors recently rejected an eastern reorganization proposal 
that would have paid them 27 cents on the dollar including 2 
cents cash and the rest in securities 
texas air also would guarantee payment of the claims by years 
end regardless of easterns condition at the time if the 
reorganization plan was not confirmed by nov 1 lorenzo said 
furthermore texas air would cover one half of easterns 
projected losses through june 30 up to 40 million 
texas air would be totally responsible for the feasibility of 
the corporation eastern lorenzo said 
the proposal was conditioned on bankruptcy court approval of 
texas airs previously announced sale of 50 percent of its system 
one computerized reservations system to electronic data systems 
corp for 250 million 
it also was conditioned on approval of texas airs payment of 
280 million to eastern to settle potential claims raised by a 
report by bankruptcy examiner david i shapiro the report 
suggested texas air had underpaid by hundreds of millions of 
dollars for eastern and some of its assets 
in addition to the trustee request bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland is considering easterns request for 80 million from 
escrow to finance its operations during the second quarter 
bakes said the money would be needed in the next week to 10 
days although sources close to texas air have said the company is 
committed to covering easterns shortterm expenses 
the creditors who are owed about 980 million claim easterns 
inability to make viable business projections and halt its 
financial losses indicates current management should be replaced 
but bakes said putting a trustee in charge of eastern would make 
it tougher for the company to improve its performance citing 
earlier eastern testimony that such a move would shake the 
confidence of consumers and travel agents in the airline 
i believe that there will be a much heightened risk of a 
liquidation of the company whether intended or not bakes said 
bakes also said many employees particularly in the 
maintenance engineering and flight operations areas would quit 
their jobs if a trustee was appointed 
bakes conceded that eastern had missed on many of its financial 
projections but said much of the airline industry experienced the 
same uncertainty especially in 1989 
theres been a lot of negotiations a lot of discussions 
im not going to discuss it bakes told reporters earlier 
wednesday 
sources have said texas air also has agreed to possibly remove 
some top managers in order to placate creditors 
but houstonbased texas air issued a statement labeling as 
totally untrue rumors that bakes resignation had been offered 
as a compromise to the creditors 
we have made no proposals to creditors which would involve 
phil bakes replacement nor is any such proposal planned 
lorenzo said in the statement phil and his team have done 
admirably under very tough and trying circumstances 
the committee representing unsecured creditors asked texas air 
several weeks ago to inject funds into eastern texas airs refusal 
helped precipitate the creditors request for lifland to appoint a 
trustee 
eastern has been reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection 
since shortly after a march 1989 strike by its machinists pilots 
and flight attendants the company has operated on a much smaller 
scale but has suffered from millions of dollars in business it lost 
and has had trouble regaining since the strike 
bakes who also is easterns chief executive officer reviewed 
in his court testimony the labor strife and financial losses that 
marked his tenure 
bakes took the job at eastern in october 1986 after texas air 
acquired the carrier before that he had been president of 
easterns sister carrier continental airlines which reorganized 
under federal bankruptcy laws starting in 1982 
bakes also said there is considerable debate within easterns 
ranks about the wisdom of the proposed sale of its prized south 
american routes to rival american airlines 
on tuesday one top eastern official resigned apparently 
motivated at least partly by the trustee issue eastern spokesman 
robin matell said tuesday that jose smith the airlines senior 
vice president of operations had accepted a job at cocacola co 
smith who has worked for eastern for 23 years could not be 
reached for comment but bakes asked by a reporter wednesday about 
smiths departure said his decision has something to do with 
what is going on here in this courtroom

first interstate bancorp said profits fell 4 
percent in the first quarter but its troubled texas unit turned a 
91 million profit and losses ended at its arizona bank 
first interstate earned 1272 million or 223 a share in the 
first three months of the year compared with 1322 million or 
281 a share a year earlier 
earnings per share declined sharply reflecting the banks issue 
of 86 million new shares of common stock in february to replenish 
its capital 
first interstate took a staggering 400 million in special 
charges in december mainly to cover losses at its texas bank just 
a few weeks earlier it took a 350 million charge for 
thirdquarter losses in arizona it also began an accelerated 
program to dump its troubled assets in texas 
those moves resulted in a 1245 million loss for all of 1989 
and sent the banks stock price tumbling they also increased 
speculation that first interstate might become a takeover target 
for a big healthy bank because of its 57 billion in assets and 
sprawling system of offices in 21 states 
the bank holding companys actions last year particularly the 
selloff of bad loans in texas were beginning to pay off chairman 
and chief executive joseph j pinola said 
our texas bank is reporting earnings while our arizona bank 
is now slightly above break even and meeting our expectations 
pinola said 
excluding a onetime tax gain in 1989 and accounting changes 
operating earnings were 971 million for the latest quarter up 
from 943 million in the first quarter of 1989 
net interest income fell 87 percent to 5816 million largely 
due to the sale of assets first interstate said 
the net interest margin the difference between what the bank 
earns on its loans and what it pays depositors increased to 476 
percentage points in the latest quarter from 467 points in the 
fourth quarter of 1989 
noninterest income fell 6 percent to 2437 million in the 
first quarter from 2599 million in the 1989 period 
bad loans totaled 205 billion on march 31 down from 208 
billion a year earlier and 211 billion at the end of 1989 
while modest this is the third quarter in which the level of 
nonperforming assets has been reduced pinola said

the dollar slid in early trading against the 
japanese yen thursday and share prices moved sharply higher on the 
tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar started tradingdown 152 yen from 
wednesdays close of 15987 yen it finished at 15812 yen in new 
york overnight down from 15968 yen on tuesday 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues gained 40296 
poin at 15835 yen ts or 137 percent shortly after the market opened 
to move to 
2965202 the index gained 78746 points wednesday 
currency dealers said the dollars slide followed its downswing 
in new york wednesday despite a report of a sharp improvement in 
the us merchandise trade figures for february 
the us commerce department said the nations trade deficit 
narrowed in february to a sixyear low of 649 billion from a 
revised 932 billion deficit in january 
ng like 
those of the past when young workers were housed in unheated 
concrete buildings often four or five to a room and enthusiastic 
supervisors tried to instill company values of group living and 
personal sacrifice 
such privation is no longer tolerated by japanese who have grown 
up in comfort major corporations also are taking on a greater role 
as landlords as workers demand more help to cope with housing costs 
shooting up much faster than average pay levels 
in a recent economic planning agency survey of 1781 of japans 
largest firms 513 percent of the 1211 that responded said they 
intended to remodel or build new dormitories for unmarried 
employees in the next three years 
watabe who has worked three years for sumitomo corp a trading 
company has a carpeted furnished 140 squarefoot room with 
heating and cooling 
the 50 monthly rent is about onetenth the cost of similar 
rooms in the neighborhood moreover those rooms dont offer some 
of the other features of his dormitory a deep hot japanese bath 
ready at all times a billiards room an outdoor tennis court and a 
cafeteria with steak on the menu 
to meet demands for greater privacy and comfort nissan motor 
corp remodeled a university dormitory outside yokohama for the 
staff of its main research facility the nissan technical center 
the brick sevenstory parc vert nissan overlooks a verdant 
country club each of the 165 men and women residents has a single 
room furnished with bed desk dressers and bathroom 
they can use a large kitchen computer room garden patio and 
karaoke equipment a popular entertainment system with recorded 
musical accompaniment for amateur singers who croon into the 
attached microphone 
company dorms formerly were meant to house bachelors or young 
families temporarily while they saved enough to buy homes 
employers structured income scales and benefit policies to permit 
home purchases just as workers were starting families and facing 
greater costs 
now however asahi mutual life insurance co has calculated 
that if tokyoarea land prices continue rising at their average 
annual rate of the last 15 years 96 percent a 20yearold today 
will not be able afford to buy a oneroom apartment before he 
becomes 40 
this has led to a profound shift in company benefit plans 
in the economic planning agency survey the number of companies 
that said they intended to build new company housing rose by 179 
percent from last year but those planning to increase housing 
allowances decreased by 119 percent and those planning to extend 
lowinterest loans for mortgages fell by 89 percent 
toshiya yamamoto manager of nissans employee welfare section 
said his companys compensation system still is aimed at enabling a 
worker to buy an apartment of comfortable size within 90 minutes 
commute by age 35 but yamamoto acknowledged that nissans 
assistance 233000 in lowinterest loans is insufficient to 
buy a home 
under such conditions workers are staying in company housing 
even after marriage at companies that lack housing particularly 
foreign firms japanese are increasingly pressing their employers 
to acquire it 
yamamoto said that in erecting new housing we first consider 
who among our staff is in greatest need and we devise a system to 
fit their needs 
luring new recruits by creating beautiful showpieces is not 
an aim of company housing policy he said 
nevertheless recruiting specialists say that among the growing 
number of japanese changing jobs the housing question is becoming 
more important in choosing new employers 
watabe employed in sumitomos personnel division said many 
college students looking into future employment ask about housing 
conditions 
watabe said he probably wont start thinking about whether to 
buy a home until he gets married standing on the artificial turf 
of his dorms tennis court he pointed to his feet 
if i wanted to buy land right now all i could get would be 
the land im standing on he said

apple computer inc said lower 
component costs success of new products and improved overseas 
sales helped it more than double earnings in the three months ended 
march 30 
the worlds no 2 personal computer maker said wednesday that 
net income for its fiscal second quarter was 1318 million or 
104 a share compared with 564 million or 44 cents a share a 
year earlier 
revenues rose 8 percent to 135 billion from 125 billion 
it was a very good report by any standard it was way at the 
far end of anyones expectations said steven ossad an analyst 
with montgomery securities in san francisco 
john sculley apples chairman and chief executive officer said 
the company was enjoying lower component costs and strong sales of 
computers introduced last year 
international sales also rose representing 47 percent of net 
sales during the latest quarter compared with 40 percent for the 
same period a year ago 
during the quarter the percentage of revenues coming from 
outside the united states reached an alltime high sculley said 
in a statement 
for the first six months of the fiscal year earnings rose 30 
percent to 2567 million or 2 a share from 1968 million or 
154 a share a year ago revenues rose 7 percent to 284 billion 
from 265 billion 
despite the quarters staggering performance the company 
was correct to be cautious in its forecast for the second half of 
1990 ossad said apple told analysts it was unlikely it would 
achieve 10 percent growth in the second half he added 
apple needs to increase the number of less expensive products 
particularly in light of the growing demand for computers among 
consumers and schools ossad said

the air force has agreed to pay as much as 27 
million of the cleanup costs at two hazardous waste dump sites used 
by the boeing co court papers revealed 
in a deposition taken for a lawsuit between boeing and its 
insurers stephen trautwein a local air force contract manager 
said the cleanup was considered part of ordinary and necessary 
business costs 
trautwein said the cleanup costs at the two sites western 
processing in kent and queen city farms in maple valley were 
negotiated as a separate item between boeing and air force contract 
officers 
a pentagon spokesman in washington dc told the seattle 
postintelligencer tuesday that it is not standard procedure 
for the defense department to reimburse a contractor for hazardous 
waste cleanup costs 
however a spokeswoman at the air force contract management 
division in albuquerque nm said the air force agreed to pay a 
portion of the costs at the two sites because the service 
considered the cleanups necessary and normal business expenses 
a boeing spokesman said in general those costs are 
recognized as usual and accepted costs of doing business it was 
something we worked out with the air force the 
postintelligencer reported without naming its sources 
boeing dumped about 24 million gallons of hazardous waste at the 
sites between 1957 and 1977 the company has estimated the cost of 
cleanup at more than 80 million 
boeing signed a consent agreement with the environmental 
protection agency to pay most of the cleanup costs after the epa 
closed the two sites in the early 1980s 
boeing already has spent about 40 million to clean up the 
sites but it was not known whether that amount included air force 
funds the postintelligencer reported 
a federal judge ruled this week that a jury will have to decide 
whether boeing must pay for the cleanups or if it can pass the 
costs on to its insurers 
the insurers claim boeing is liable because their policies were 
designed to cover cleanups from accidents they introduced evidence 
in federal court last week indicating the company failed to heed 
warnings made as early as the 1950s that its dumping would cause 
pollution at the two sites 
boeing has maintained that it did not knowingly pollute the two 
sites 
boeing has told its insurers it could be liable for cleanups in 
13 other toxic waste dumps sites around the united states those 
sites include several that contain waste from its military work
