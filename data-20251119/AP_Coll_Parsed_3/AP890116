a new ncaa rule requiring freshmen receiving 
athletic scholarships to achieve a minimum score on college entrance 
exams has revived an old debate are such tests unfair to minority 
students 
the argument centers on the alleged bias of the scholastic 
aptitude test and the act assessment each taken annually by about a 
million collegebound high school seniors 
georgetown university basketball coach john thompson walked off 
the court saturday night at the start of a game against boston 
college to protest proposal 42 an ncaa rule barring colleges from 
granting athletic scholarships to freshmen who fail to achieve a 
minimum 20 gradepoint average in high school and score less than 
700 on the sat or 15 on the act 
thats a tightening of the controversial ncaa proposition 48 
instituted three years ago which allowed such scholarships to 
athletes if they met either standard 
other coaches have joined in the outcry temple university 
basketball coach john chaney said proposal 42 which is to go into 
effect next year will punish these kids who come from a poor 
background and have a poor educational opportunity 
an associated press survey in 1986 found that nearly one out of 
10 college athletic recruits failed to meet the standards under 
proposition 48 the results were not broken down by race 
critics for years have charged that the sat sponsored by the 
college board in new york and the act assessment sponsored by the 
american college testing program in iowa city are culturally biased 
against women and minorities 
such critics as fairtest a cambridge mass group have charged 
that the only thing the sat and act reliably measure by requiring 
knowledge of such words as regatta or aria is the family 
income of the testtaker 
bob schaeffer public education director of fairtest said monday 
that his organization is sending a letter to the national collegiate 
athletic association protesting the new rule as a blatantly 
improper use of test scores which must be immediately abandoned 
we are convinced that the sat cannot escape cultural bias 
said union college president john s morris nearly two years ago 
when his school became one of about half a dozen northeastern 
liberal arts colleges that have dropped their sat requirement in 
recent years 
the college board and other defenders counter that their studies 
show the sat reliably predicts college success 
officials of the college board were unavailable for comment 
monday because of the martin luther king jr holiday but the board 
has argued the test is fair poor curricula and home factors are to 
blame for the comparatively weak test results by minority youngsters 
and ncaa officials have justified their standards by citing the 
many wellpublicized instances of barely literate athletes who find 
few career opportunities after they have played their last college 
game 
is the ncaa standard unreasonable 
the sat is a twopart multiplechoice examination of mathematics 
and verbal aptitude each consisting of roughly 80 questions the 
highest score on each part is 800 to meet the ncaa standard of 700 
a student must average 350 on the math and verbal sections or 
answer roughly 13 out of 80 questions correctly on the math section 
and 24 correct on the verbal 
in other words even with penalties for wrong answers students 
have a chance of meeting the ncaa standard through sheer guesswork 
whites as a group have outperformed minority students in 1988 
white students averaged a combined 935 on the sat nearly 200 points 
higher than blacks 
but the ncaa standard is well within the grasp of the average 
black student according to college board statistics in 1988 black 
students averaged 384 on the math portion and 353 on the verbal 37 
points above the ncaa guideline 
the ncaa standard incidentally is 204 points below the average 
sat for all students in 1988 904

the agriculture department has been upbeat 
about the prospects for farmers in 1989 but analysts also point out 
there are some troublesome clouds along the horizon 
for example usda economists greg hanson and duane hacklander say 
this years farm financial outlook is favorable in large part 
because of continued strength in crop and livestock sales 
in all gross sales values of commodities are expected to be in 
the range of 148 billion to 152 billion compared with 149 
billion predicted for 1988 
the fundamentals that undergird longterm trends in farm income 
are strengthening the two economists said in the current issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine land markets improved in 1988 and 
the farm balance sheet stabilized excess commodity stockpiles were 
alleviated by the drought 
in 1989 they said costs of farm production items or inputs 
and commodity market prices will be in better balance 
but hanson and hacklander added in their report that three 
negative factors cloud the outlook for us agriculture 
the farm sector will continue to rely heavily on government 
payments in 1989 indicating that it has not fully regained a 
competitive edge 
according to usda estimates about 15000 commercial farms will 
be financially on the ropes because of last years drought 
about 15 percent to 20 percent of the highly specialized corn and 
soybean farms in drought counties are probably under financial 
stress 
excess production which lowers farm commodity prices can occur 
rapidly the 1988 drought slashed crop production drastically but 
history shows that output often jumps sharply the following year 
the livestock sector made a remarkable rebound in the 
mid1980s the report said livestock receipts in 1989 are 
forecast 10 billion higher than in 1985 but high crop prices 
translate into high feed costs that could dampen livestock net 
earnings 
government payments to farmers are expected to decline sharply to 
a range of 10 billion to 12 billion from about 14 billion in 1988 
and 17 billion in 1987 much of the slide can be linked to the 
decline of surplus grain and other products held by the departments 
commodity credit corp or ccc 
more than a fifth of the direct government payments in 1989 will 
be for the conservation reserve program the longterm plan that 
enables farmers to take highly erodible cropland from production for 
10 years 
the 198889 trend to lower commodity program payments is not 
necessarily representative of permanent gains in farm income and 
financial health the report said but livestock receipts and 
earnings have surged as legislation has reduced ccc price support 
loan rates for feed grains 
further the report said the drop in farm debt and land prices 
in the mid1980s and the rapid growth of exports in 198788 suggest 
that agriculture can now better compete in world markets 
as used by the usda economists net farm income includes changes 
in the value of inventories held by producers and their depreciation 
expenses for 1989 net farm income is forecast at 44 billion to 
48 billion up by more than 20 percent from last year 
this range assumes a return to neartrend crop yields plus 
additional production from 25 million to 30 million more planted 
acres the report said 
in contrast net cash income is forecast between 48 billion and 
52 billion down 10 percent to 15 percent from 1988 net cash 
income is the difference between cash expenses and gross cash income 
during the year 
last year despite the drought net cash income held up well 
because many farmers had crops in storage from previous years and 
were able to sell those at rising prices to offset 1988 production 
losses from the drought 
the critical period for many droughtstressed farmers will be 
next spring the report said they will have less corn soybeans 
and spring wheat to sell from storage and will face the prospect of 
larger planting expenses because of higher input costs and an 
increase in planted acreage 
despite government drought aid cash flow and loan repayment will 
be problems for many crop producers in the first half of this year 
in terms of cash flow generated by production farmers in 1989 
will be less well off than in 1988 the report said but in 
terms of wealth generated by production income plus inventory 
growth farmers will be better off

after eight years of unknown adventures 
clem the cat returned to its original owners 
i heard some meowing out on the front porch last friday kurt 
helminiak said when i opened the door there stood a big 
longhaired gray male cat 
he walked into the house checked it out for a few minutes 
then he purred and jumped up onto his favorite chair like he had 
never been gone 
helminiak said his family were incredulous at first but he and 
his wife julie compared the cat to pictures they had taken eight 
years earlier and confirmed clem had come home 
i let him out one cold night when it was about 20 below zero 
and snowing and blowing and he never came back he said 
the family searched for clem throughout the neighborhood and 
listed him as a missing cat with the humane society they also put 
up posters in stores but the cat was never found 
clem is healthy though a bit mangier another difference is that 
clem is now declawed an indication that someone had taken care of 
it at least part of the time helminiak said 
hes so glad to be home he said that he wont even go

george bush is dampening expectations of 
dramatic moves during his first 100 days in the white house tacitly 
acknowledging that he will be busy wrestling with congress over the 
huge budget deficit 
with the house and senate both controlled by democrats bush will 
face a ninemonth siege not a 100day breakthrough predicted 
mitchell daniels a former political adviser for president reagan 
who also worked in the bushquayle campaign 
indeed the incoming president himself said in a recent interview 
that he would feel like a spring colt if it were not for the 
fiscal challenges accompanying his elevation on friday to what he 
called the ultimate job 
even as he struggles with the deficit bush also will give 
priority to refining his strategy for dealing with the soviet union 
in the rapidly changing climate under mikhail gorbachev officials 
said 
moscow has put new pressure on bush by recently promising major 
troop cutbacks and destruction of some chemical weapons 
bushs first major trip will be to japan for the feb 24 funeral 
of the late emperor hirohito 
he has said he would like to see a nato summit as the alliance 
marks its 40th anniversary in april and will gather in paris in july 
with the leaders of six other western powers for the annual economic 
summit of major industrialized nations 
during the campaign bush said he wanted an early meeting with 
gorbachev but after he and reagan and gorbachev got together in new 
york last month bush said there was no pressure for him to see the 
kremlin leader again soon 
bush has promised several other summits a global conference on 
the environment a hemispheric meeting on illegal drugs and a 
meeting of the nations governors about educational problems bush 
may be ready to announce the dates for the educational summit when 
the governors hold their annual meeting in washington in late 
february 
on another front bush has made clear he will move quickly to 
propose new ethics legislation covering administration officials and 
members of congress as one of his first steps bush will name a 
commission to propose ways to strengthen ethics laws and instruct 
the panel to report back within 30 days 
another priority will be attacking the perception that the 
republican party is somehow not interested in the problems of the 
poor minorities and disadvantaged said david beckwith press 
secretary to vice presidentelect dan quayle the deficit sharply 
limits funds for this effort but beckwith said making them a 
priority makes a statement and nothing gets done unless its on the 
frontburner 
along those lines the white house staff will contain a new slot 
filled by gregg petersmeyer to spearhead bushs thousand points 
of light campaign to encourage people to volunteer their services 
to the poor 
typically a new president tries to do something to distinguish 
himself from his predecessor and set a tone for his administration 
yet analysts caution against anything dramatic in the bush white 
house 
i would be surprised if it would start off with a bang said 
stephen hess a brookings institution senior fellow i think it 
will build the pacing seems to be more deliberate 
most of the people in bushs cabinet are government professionals 
who are regarded as pragmatists rather than ideologues we do not 
expect them to make careless mistakes hess said 
daniels the former adviser to reagan who was a top adviser to 
quayles campaign said fast starts are always useful but it is a 
lesser concern in this administration because their 
opportunities are limited the hill is stacked against them 
moreover daniels said theyre also constrained by the budget 
and by the shortage of flagship issues coming out of the campaign 
bush says the change of command also is different now because 
its the first time in 152 years that a vice president was elected 
to succeed his boss 
ive been part of this administration and it isnt like there 
is the need for radical change bush said in an interview its 
the concept of building on what has been done 
bush said he would make his mark by style message people be 
yourself im not vice president im president im the one 
whos calling the shots im the one whos going to set the agenda 
im the one whos going to have to do that which president reagan 
did very gracefully take the heat if something went wrong 
so automatically that happens that happens at the time when i 
put my hand on that bible and hold my right hand in the air and say 
that oath he said it happens 
calling his new job the ultimate bush said the presidency 
is still the place from which to lead and from which to affect 
change hopefully change for the better 
yet his opportunities are limited by the budget deficit pegged 
at 925 billion in reagans last proposal 
if it werent for this deficit looming over everything else 
leave all the rest of the problems in there id feel like a spring 
colt bush said 
one of his first steps after the inaugural fanfare will be to 
name a team of administration negotiators for budget talks with 
congress richard darman bushs budget director already has spent 
many hours on capitol hill exploring possibilities for a twoyear 
plan to cut the deficit 
around feb 9 the new president will send a budget message to 
congress disclosing a formula to add here and take off there 
from the 115 trillion spending plan submitted by president reagan 
on probably the same day bush will address a joint session of 
congress to highlight his spending priorities 
heralding a kinder gentler america bush promised in his 
campaign to increase spending for education for the head start 
program for expanded medicaid payments to lowincome pregnant woman 
and their babies 
on top of that bush faces the problems of a cleanup of the 
nations nuclear weapons complex and the crisis of the nations 
savings and loan industry 
discounting the theme of a big 100day beginning jim pinkerton 
who will be a top bush aide for planning keeps a note on his desk 
that reads all this will not be finished in the first 100 days 
nor will it be finished in the first 1000 days nor in the life of 
this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet 
but let us begin 
it is a paragraph pinkerton notes from john f kennedys 
inaugural address

president reagan who came to washington vowing 
to cut the federal government down to size slowed its growth and 
trimmed its sails but fell short of many of his more ambitious goals 
he hasnt done any of it melvin laird former secretary of 
defense and white house counselor who served for years as a 
republican member of the house appropriations committee said in an 
interview 
he hasnt done much to change the size of the bureaucracy 
said philip buchen white house counsel in the ford adminstration 
he promised more than he could deliver said charles w dunn 
professor of political science at clemson university and a former 
republican congressional aide 
he has punched at the marshmallow and the marshmallow has 
absorbed his punches pretty effectively said dunn he has 
changed the shape of the marshmallow a little bit but obviously not 
as much as he wanted to 
i wouldnt call it a revolution i would call it more of a 
retrenchment said herman belz a neoconservative historian at 
the university of maryland 
that there has been a change and a retrenchment few deny 
from 1958 to 1980 according to figures from the office of 
personnel management the federal civilian work force excluding 
postal workers increased by 420000 or about 24 percent over the 
past eight years it increased by 33000 or about 15 percent 
compared with an average population growth in the united states of 
about 1 percent 
so the change has been in the rate of the growth of government 
which essentially has stabilized in this period said william 
norton director of executive administration for the office of 
personnel management 
i think what you can say about reagan is that the size of the 
domestic government is smaller overall than it would have been 
otherwise said john e chubb senior fellow in governmental 
studies at the liberally oriented brookings institute 
in his 1980 campaign reagan pledged to abolish two cabinet 
departments the department of energy and the department of 
education both are still in place and congress with reagans 
support created a new department by upgrading the veterans 
administration to cabinet status 
government ownership of conrail general revenue sharing and 
urban development action grants were eliminated during reagans 
administration the civil aeronautics board and community services 
agency also fell by the wayside but both these were due to actions 
in the carter administration that took effect after reagan became 
president 
the neoconservative scholar belz said one thing that made a 
big difference was a reagan executive order requiring agency 
regulations to be reviewed by the office of management and budget 
this too however was a legacy of the carter administration an 
outgrowth of the paperwork reduction act that carter signed a few 
weeks before leaving office 
rather than necessarily cutting down the number of agencies he 
has made what exists work better said barbara clay spokeswoman 
for the budget office 
prior to this administration there were something like over 
400 financial accounting systems in the government and they were all 
incompatible she said so what ronald reagan has done is to 
install a governmentwide financial accounting system in order to 
make sure that for instance agricultures numbers are comparable 
to commerces numbers 
overall ms clay said what has happened is that we have 
put in management tools and systems that didnt exist prior to this 
administration 
in addition to such bookkeeping improvements and steps to share 
power with state and local governments reagan gets credit for 
helping along with the staggering budget deficit to make the 
government establishment more costconscious 
everyone who has any say about the purse strings is conscious 
that they have got to curtail the spending said buchen it is 
remarkable it seems to me that he has had so many converts among 
the democrats 
the results are pretty dismal but the talk is much better than 
it used to be the former ford white house aide said congress 
was never even talking like that now at least they pay lip service 
to the idea of cutting back 
brookings chubb said since reagan has been in office the 
agenda has really changed to what i would call an agenda of limited 
government now we are really talking about what the government can 
get out of what the government can use the private sector to 
accomplish what the government can accomplish through state and 
local government and so forth 
by chubbs calculations discretionary domestic programs such as 
education health and transportation have been in real terms cut 
in half and all of the slack has been picked up surprisingly by 
state governments and to some extent local governments 
vaughn davis bornet a professor emeritus of history at southern 
oregon state college who has written extensively on the johnson 
administration said reagan has essentially diminished the power 
of the central government and given a lot of that power back to the 
states exactly what johnson did in reverse 
beyond that said bornet who classifies himself as a 
moderate republican if you look at the fine print expenditures 
war on poverty education and so on it seems to me he has not 
reduced the federal expenditures in this area or the bureaucracy 
very much either 
clemson political scientist dunn however said reagans 
ideology and the symbols of his ideology have helped him shift the 
tone of national debate and that in tandem with the budget 
deficit has forced liberal democrats to be leery of proposing new 
programs 
chubb at brookings said that as long as the budget deficit 
endures the pressures to hold down domestic spending will remain 
and he is not sure it is an accident 
the budget deficit is reagans insurance policy he said i 
dont know whether he took it out intentionally or inadvertently 
but its the guarantee that we wont move in another direction or 
develop another agenda until thats under control 
although reagan spoke out against a washington colony of 
entrenched potomac veterans old washington hand laird said he 
believed the president fit comfortably into that scene himself in 
contrast to carter who remained an outsider through his four years 
in the white house 
i think he has gotten along very well with the people who have 
been around in government the former secretary of defense said 
he always acts as though he wants your help and counsel and 
advice 
as to why reagan did not move further to dismantle the federal 
government he campaigned so hard against laird said i think he 
has found there was a place for it

another presidential inauguration is likely to 
mean another arrest for stacy abney an expatriate texan who is 
routinely carted away by police from a capitol archway whenever new 
presidents and foreign dignitaries appear 
abney has been arrested 21 times for refusing to leave the 
archway where he has slept on scraps of carpet for the past 14 
years 
rain falling on a recent january day sluiced over the edge of the 
archway and kept abney from his usual daytime perch in the middle of 
the capitols main steps where he crouches with a placard listing 
health problems blamed on his world war ii military service 
tourists he says have told him the capitol steps are too 
good for someone like him but as the chilling cold turns each 
word into puffs of mist he declares that he isnt going anywhere 
until the government relents and gives him disability payments 
an arrest at this years inauguration of a fellow texan george 
bush is a given says us capitol police spokesman dan 
nichols as part of his protest he refuses to leave 
abney is cited for unlawful entry when he wont budge for police 
securing the building for special occasions so far hes been 
arrested 21 times nichols said 
he is taken to a district of columbia jail but always comes back 
to the capitol upon his release 
mr abney is never disorderly nichols said hes very 
docile as far as police go he presents no special problems 
nichols who used to patrol the east side of the capitol where 
the 77yearold stages his lone and silent protest says tourists 
sometimes complain that abney ruins their pictures sitting on the 
imposing capitol steps with his roughly scrawled cardboard sign 
nichols says he always explained to the visitors that only in the 
united states would a protester be allowed to demonstrate at the 
foot of the capitol they should be happy thats allowed in our 
country he said 
we consider him a demonstrator not a homeless person 
nichols said he demonstrates every day on the capitol steps and 
at night by being on the capitol grounds 
born a mile from the louisiana border in northeast texas abney 
says he came to the capitol to fight for disability benefits he 
believes he deserves for serving in the military 18 months and six 
days in the united states and 25 months and two days overseas in 
england france belgium and germany 
he said that after his discharge doctors told him not to work on

the record cost of the bush inauguration will 
be matched by a record number of free events open to the public say 
inaugural planners intent on proving they are not preoccupied with 
gold and glitter 
officials estimate 70 percent of their events are free 
including a forum for high school students a childrens festival 
and a public white house welcome that will constitute george bushs 
first official act as president 
those events cost money and dont bring in any but theyre a key 
element in an inaugural schedule designed to foster inclusiveness 
and family feeling say top officials of the presidential inaugural 
committee 
the free events plus inflation 11 inaugural balls and the 
usual galas and glitz are driving bush inaugural costs to the 25 
million range by comparison president reagans 1981 and 1985 
inaugurals cost 155 million and 20 million respectively 
most of the money is raised privately and all of it is being 
tightly monitored according to those who hold the purse strings at 
bush inaugural headquarters 
we are extremely costconscious said stephen studdert 
executive director of the inaugural committee we try and bid 
everything that can be bid we try to get the best bang for the 
buck the dollars are not being spent for gold and glitter they are 
being spent on substantive things 
bush himself said thursday that he is not entirely 
comfortable with the cost of his inauguration but he added that i 
have no apologies for the way were doing it at all because the 
country deserves a celebration every four years 
asked at an inaugural news briefing whether the 25 million 
wouldnt be better spent on the homeless stephen m studdert 
executive director of the inaugural committee said the inauguration 
represented the strength and continuity of american democracy and 
the peaceful transfer of power and was worthy of celebration 
the inaugural committee raised 20 million in interestfree loans 
from 200 corporations who advanced 100000 each the money will be 
repaid from various sources most of it from the yetundetermined 
take from ticket sales 
other anticipated revenues include about 15 million from sale 
of commemorative items some 2 million from sale of tickets and 
advertising time associated with a televised kennedy center gala 
and an estimated 2 million in inkind contributions and corporate 
and individual sponsorships 
asked about the appearance of corporations trying to curry favor 
with the new administration studdert said the transition team 
has no idea who has supported the inauguration 
the committee does not have to disclose its finances however it 
has decided to publish a list of corporate lenders inkind 
contributors and corporations and individuals underwriting 
particular aspects of the inauguration reminded of this studdert 
replied were not distributing copies of it specifically to 
presidential personnel or anything 
even with millions flowing in from sales and contributors 
taxpayers arent entirely off the hook 
first theres the creamy pumpkincolored building the federal 
governments general services administration turned over to 
inaugural committee for its headquarters set in the middle of a 
navy yard in an industrial section of washington the building had 
been used to store machine guns it has been converted with a 
combination of inaugural committee and gsa funds studdert said 
other parts of the inauguration also are being paid by taxpayers 
for example congress appropriated 750000 to the joint 
congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies to take care of the 
actual swearingin ceremony and a luncheon to follow 
congress also earmarked 25 million as the operating budget for 
the armed forces inaugural committee which currently counts 1294 
people at its headquarters and expects to swell to 1500 at the 
inaugural peak 
the military also expects to contribute 8500 people during 
inaugural week to march in the parade drive dignitaries to 
inauguralrelated events and serve in other capacities 
congress tried to stem the government cost of such services last 
year by directing the pentagon to seek reimbursement for all 
personnel participation in nonpublic events but the provision is 
not legally binding and is unlikely to have dramatic impact this 
time around

a hint of revolution is in the air in at least 
some bigcity school systems an apparent readiness at long last 
to stop bickering and start reforming 
the nations largest system new york city continues to generate 
shocking headlines about violence drugs and widespread neighborhood 
school board corruption within the last month an elementary school 
principal and three teachers were picked up on drug charges and 
last week a kindergartner was found with a 25caliber pistol 
but the picture has begun to brighten elsewhere 
in pittsburgh dade county fla and rochester ny teacher 
unions and school administrators have beaten their swords into 
reformminded contracts that boost teacher pay and power while 
making them directly accountable for their students performance 
in detroit where the dropout rate is at least 40 percent fed up 
voters elected a reform school board slate in november they also 
refused to approve new school taxes and bonds aimed at paying off an 
estimated 158 million deficit 
there are even hopeful signs in chicagos schools branded 14 
months ago as the nations worst by us secretary of education 
william j bennett illinois gov james thompson signed legislation 
last month scrapping chicagos central school board next july to be 
replaced by parentrun councils empowered to set budgets and hire 
and fire principals 
that hardly means such cities have solved their school problems 
officials are quick to admit 
chicagos new governing structure may lead to unprecedented 
parent power but the basic problems still fester a 45 percent 
dropout rate and belowaverage standardized test scores 
as rochester teacher union leader adam urbanski put it we have 
set the table we have not served the meal yet 
hopeful signs are scarce in the 960000student new york city 
system 
its true that new yorks state legislature recently passed 
longsought bills clearing the way for desperately needed school 
construction and making new rules to curb school board patronage 
but schools chancellor richard green whose muchheralded arrival 
as an outsider from minneapolis last march raised hopes for new 
approaches has instead found himself tangled in investigations of 
local school board corruption 
to some new york remains a system adrift 
at this point there are a lot of people putting out ideas and 
a lot of people wringing their hands we have to have the 
administration put out a specific plan so that people can get behind 
it said robin willner deputy executive director of interface a 
watchdog group that issues frequent reports on city school issues 
all of which raises the question what does it take to put the 
nations largest school systems on the road to reform 
relative size and the power of the purse are certainly key 
factors says samuel l husk executive director of the council of 
great city schools pittsburgh for example has only 40000 
students and its school board has taxing authority 
new york city has 25 times more students and its school board 
has no authority to tax its size and tangled politics foster a 
feeling of hopelessness some now openly wonder how many 
drugaddicted principals and teachers it will take to finally jolt 
the system 
i think that you need a catalyst i hate to say it has to be 
horrible unfortunately in a school system this size it may have to 
be said willner 
new orleans 80000student public schools have an additional 
disadvantage they must compete with a popular 35000student 
parochial school system that siphons off political support 
but all cities have obstacles to overcome whether they succeed 
in reform or even attempt it usually depends on someone in 
authority willing to lead the charge 
you need leadership at the top those at the top and those in 
the private sector have to see it as an absolute emergency its a 
political problem said ernest l boyer a national spokesman for 
reform and president of the carnegie foundation for the advancement 
of teaching which has produced several reports on urban school 
problems 
in rochester and pittsburgh new superintendents have made a 
difference 
rochesters peter mcwalters named in 1986 signaled willingness 
to form a working partnership with teachers under a contract that 
took effect this year each teacher is directly responsible for 20 
students holding daily meetings and home visits where necessary in 
return top teacher salaries will rise to 70000 and schoolbased 
planning teams consisting of teachers parents students and 
principals will set goals for each school 
when mcwalters came in he shared my sense of urgency and he 
was devoid of the baggage and inhibitions that management often 
has said urbanski his passion proved infectious after our 
collective bargaining agreement we had left little choice for the 
political and business structure but to follow suit to help us make 
it work 
pittsburghs superintendent richard c wallace who arrived in 
1980 as an outsider to a city enmeshed in a bitter dispute over 
school desegregation helped move the school system beyond that 
dispute and establish it as a national model of reform he promptly 
began biweekly meetings with the teacher union established a center 
to enhance teacher skills and attracted millions in corporate funds 
to support innovative programs 
likewise in miamis dade county the teacher union and 
superintendent have stopped fighting and started cooperating to 
devise a reform plan 
but the key factor was leadership said husk the thing to 
remember is florida had an education governor bob graham and he 
made a substantial investment in schools long before other states 
were even thinking about reform 
some feel new york is still waiting for such leadership 
we dont have any one elective official who has made education 
their primary issue said willner in terms of using the bully 
pulpit having an education mayor or governor that hasnt happened 
in new york 
in new orleans meanwhile the bad times keep rolling for a 
school system perennially starved of leadership and tax dollars 
still many are encouraged by the election last year of louisianas 
reformminded governor buddy roemer a property tax increase last 
april and a new expanded school board 
that may not be enough a state report showed that 370 of new 
orleans 4800teacher staff were either uncertified or had 
temporary certificates and despite recent increases salaries still 
average just 26800 about 2000 below the national average 
the new orleans public schools remain a factory for the 
expansion of the underclass said lee gary a private education 
consultant 
boyer sees four elements necessary to move big systems toward 
reform clearly stated goals smaller schools structured so that 
students no longer feel anonymous more schoolbased authority where 
officials are regularly accountable for results and above all 
partnerships between parents civic corporate and educational 
officials 
if you pull these reform efforts apart these cities are making 
progress on governance and partnerships said boyer what i 
dont see is much attention to school climate student alienation 
and the question of educational goals and outcomes

in seven years investigating crimes against 
children the idaho detective had never seen anything like the 
emaciated battered boy found whimpering in a freeway rest stop 
overall it was the worst case of abuse and circumstances 
surrounding abuse that i have ever seen said the detective rita 
rowe he was and i want to choose the word carefully pitiful 
rowe was on duty at the ada county sheriffs office in boise on 
jan 4 when the child pocked with cigarette burns and clad only in 
a tshirt was brought in by a deputy 
for three days rowe and others tried to put a history to the 
mute boy they called johnny doe then a utah mother called idaho 
authorities when her 5yearold son recognized the abandoned child 
on a tv newscast as a former neighbor eddy tuinman age 7 
hours later eddys parents were arrested in central utah on 
charges of felony child abandonment suburban salt lake city police 
had been looking for the couple on a charge that they illegally 
tapped into a natural gas line at their rented home 
deborah tuinman 28 told investigators she awoke from a nap in 
the family car to find eddy gone her husband edward donald 
tuinman a 29yearold itinerant mechanic claimed to have left the 
boy with social services workers in boise she said 
by weeks end the couple had waived extradition and they are 
expected to be returned to idaho by jan 23 after four days in a 
hospital eddy was placed in foster care and three other tuinman 
children were in protective custody 
when eddy was brought in rowe gave him a teddy bear as he 
cowered in blankets on the floor flinching at sudden movements and 
so weakened by hunger he could neither sit nor stand unaided 
he touched it and rubbed it and felt the fur she said he 
had kind of a surprised look on his face his reaction was that of a 
child whod never played with a toy before 
but when rowe tried to help the boy to a bathroom he panicked 
and clung to her making inarticulate sounds of disapproval later 
investigation showed the child may have been locked alone in 
bathrooms for hours with only water from the toilet to drink 
equally appalled was laurie gillis a victimwitness coordinator 
for the county prosecutor and for several hours eddys anchor 
gillis sang to the boy as she held him and he would just close 
his eyes and almost go to sleep rowe said that was the only 
thing he asked for was love not food not anything except the good 
touches 
at st lukes regional medical center eddy refused to let go of 
gillis and the doctor had to examine him in her lap he found the 
child weighed 44 pounds showed evidence of healedover fractures 
and was mentally retarded although further tests were needed to 
determine how retarded 
when he was placed with foster parents jan 8 eddy could laugh 
and seemed to comprehend much of what was said to him said hospital 
spokeswoman rita ryan his temporary parents have experience with 
handicapped children 
but as more is learned about eddy little is known about his 
parents it is known they lived in the salt lake city area for 
several years and in washington state the last three months of 1988 
investigators believe eddy was abandoned as the family traveled 
through idaho on its way to arizona where tuinman who has a 
history of petty offenses was going for work 
the family included an 11yearold girl and two other boys one 6 
years old and the other about 1 while in washington they had lived 
in a ramshackle cabin in buena about 10 miles south of yakima 
cabin owner ralph conners said the tuinmans left jan 3 the day 
before a motorist found eddy at the interstate 84 rest stop 
southeast of boise 
he said the tuinmans got by on a monthly welfare check of about 
800 borrowing food and wood from neighbors when the money ran out 
he said he witnessed no abuse of the children 
but detective patti smalley in sandy the salt lake city suburb 
where the tuinmans faced the theft charges that were dismissed to 
speed their extradition is convinced eddy suffered longterm 
physical abuse 
she speculates eddy took the brunt of punishment in the family 
because the other children were not surprised at his condition 
to them abuse isnt abuse smalley said to them its 
just been normal

the shortest job interview hotel manager 
robert fredy ever conducted took place at a new york city 
intersection as he waited at a light 
something in stephen pearmans voice moved fredy one cold day 
last february pearman had approached fredys car to wash his 
windshield and like many motorists who try to fend off the usually 
insistent beggars fredy flipped on the wipers to indicate he wasnt 
interested 
pearman leaned into the window 
come on mister give me a break i need a job he said 
in the seconds before traffic started moving again fredy 
general manager of the berkeleycarteret hotel here handed pearman 
a business card and told him to call if he was serious 
two days later the 30yearold windshield washer appeared in the 
lobby of the fancy hotel in this old seaside resort in the past 
year he has become a valued member of the hotel staff found an 
apartment and got married 
ive gotten a second chance and took advantage of it pearman 
said with a grin as he sat recently in the hotels restaurant 
eating an omelette on the house 
you know i could have just come here a while eaten up and 
left he said but there aint no future in washing windows 
fredy paid for pearmans bus ticket from new york to asbury park 
and put him up in a motel he fed him three meals a day and loaned 
him pocket money while training him to be a banquet houseman 
pearman now works full time setting up the hotels banquet rooms 
for conventions and business meetings neither man would say how 
much pearman is paid but he said he is saving up for a car 
fredy acknowledged that there is a shortage of labor for such 
bluecollar jobs but said i didnt hire him for that reason 
this was purely impulsive a lot of people hate to get involved new 
yorkers tend to look the other way and say thats not my problem 
but being with the public all the time i have a good sense of 
what people are all about he said it gives me good judgment 
about people 
fredy was not proved wrong about pearman who took his job 
seriously and repaid fredy for his first loans pearman often works 
12 to 14 hours a day fredy said 
he was willing to work hard and listen the manager said i 
never had any problem whatsoever 
the past year has been a happy one for pearman who quickly 
gained 60 pounds always has a smile on his face fredy said 
during the summer pearman learned to love the beach in november 
he was named employee of the month in december he married helena 
white an 18yearold housekeeper at the hotel fredy gave them a 
champagne reception and the bridal suite 
ironically it was pearman who had doubts about fredys sincerity 
my friends told me he was just pulling my leg when he handed me 
the card pearman said but i said no hes a businessman i 
need to give it a shot if theres a chance i should take it 
pearman previously drove taxis limousines and trucks for several 
years and even took some college business courses 
but it got pretty hectic trying to reach a quota all the 
time he said of his driving jobs and all the hustle and bustle 
of new york it was so tiring 
it got to the point where i was out of work for a few months 
and i took up washing windshields to pay for food and a room at a 
boarding house he said 
fredy acknowledged that ordinarily he is wary of new yorks 
street people 
i figure they use the money to get drunk he said but 
stephen seemed so honest and open asking for an opportunity rather 
than just money i dont hand my business card to just anybody 
with fredys permission pearman invited a fellow windshield 
washer to try out for a job at the hotel and it didnt work 
pearman said he didnt want to be tied down 
pearman has since returned to new york several times to hand out 
5 bills and sweatshirts to his old street buddies they didnt 
believe it was me he said

many japanese sense a new era with the death of 
emperor hirohito whose reign spanned depression militarism 
defeat hardship and riches and believe his son akihito may open up 
the imperial system 
while mourning the 87yearold emperor they were relieved to see 
an end to the six turbulent decades of hirohitos showa era and the 
smooth transition to heisei or achieving peace the name given 
emperor akihitos reign 
some stores turned off advertising signs for two days after 
hirohito died jan 7 but japan had been prepared by his long 
illness and it was business as usual for most people a turning 
point rather than a traumatic loss 
until hirohito renounced his divinity after world war ii 
emperors were regarded as living gods polls in recent years 
indicated a small minority of japanese still considered him one 
akihito is seen as an ordinary person which some welcome and 
others regret 
hirohito represented the darker side of japanese history 
said gregory clark professor of japanese studies at sophia 
university in tokyo 
with the appearance of a new emperor theres a fresh start 
going on you can see it particularly in the stock market and i 
think it will spread to other areas 
in the first three trading days after the emperor died the main 
index of the tokyo stock exchange gained 93391 points or 31 
percent 
he wasnt a god but he was somehow different from ordinary 
people said hiroko gotoh 22 i dont think ive changed inside 
because of his death but i have a feeling an era has changed in 
japan 
fears were expressed that rightists would use hirohitos death to 
increase imperial power akihito quickly indicated however that he 
would be closer to the people and perhaps let more light through the 
chrysanthemum curtain surrounding the imperial family which 
uses the flower as its symbol 
in his first public statement the new emperor wore a plain 
western morning suit and spoke in straightforward language instead 
of the classic chinesestyle chokugo his father used on the same 
occasion in 1926 the speech and some other transition rites 
private in the past were televised 
akihito 55 said he would try to constantly be at one with the 
people and would join with them to preserve the constitution of 
japan 
that was widely interpreted as a message to those in the 
governing liberal democratic party and elsewhere who have called for 
change in the document imposed by the united states after the 
japanese surrender which renounces war and gives the emperor no 
real political power 
it was quite significant that he said he would protect the 
constitution clark said normally a japanese monarch would not 
take such a political position 
as the first emperor who never was considered divine akihito 
will have an opportunity to shape the imperial institutions future 
and define its place in society 
cabinet decisions on the transition raised questions about the 
governments attitude toward the imperial system which past 
officials used to foster a sense of japanese racial and cultural 
uniqueness and to rally support for the invasion of much of asia 
opposition parties criticized the government decision to sponsor 
portions of hirohitos funeral scheduled feb 24 and two other 
transition rites linked to the shinto religion they said 
sponsorship might violate constitutional separation of religion and 
state 
several families who protested governmentmandated school 
memorials to hirohito by keeping their children home reported 
receiving death threats 
the shinto origin of the rites illustrates the close ties between 
the former state religion based in nature and the emperor who is 
declared by myth to be a direct descendant of the sun goddess 
polls indicate most japanese support the current imperial system 
which defines the emperor as the symbol of the state and the unity 
of the people but not head of state 
people who want to restore imperial divinity and increase the 
monarchs role as spiritual leader find themselves with a new 
emperor who will never become a living god because he is too 
human said kenichiro sembon senior editor of asahi journal a 
leading liberal news weekly 
why should such an ordinary person become an emperor he 
said now is a good time for us to start thinking about that and 
about all aspects of the imperial system including whether we need 
the system at all 
clark commented i wonder whether the ultranationalists will 
be able to maintain their interest in a pacifist emperor 
groups on both the left and right identify the imperial system 
with militarism and nationalism 
what i fear is that an emperor without hirohitos popularity 
might cause the imperial system to become more remote from the 
people and rightists might use force to try to bring the system 
back into prominence a senior politician of the governing party 
said privately 
akihitos conduct before becoming emperor already has inched open 
the doors of the secretive imperial household agency which oversees 
royal affairs 
his father was tutored by war heroes chosen by court 
chamberlains akihito studied with ordinary students and was tutored 
by american pacifist elizabeth gray vining who is said to have 
given him a sense of the equality of all people 
he is the first japanese monarch to select his own wife and 
chose a commoner with a westernstyle education akihito and empress 
michiko raised their three children themselves ending the imperial 
practice of separating children from parents 
news accounts said akihito and michiko frequently have been at 
odds with the imperial household agency 
reforming the imperial household agency is the most serious 
problem facing the new emperor said takeshi maezawa ombudsman of 
the conservative yomiuri japans largest newspaper japan wont 
be able to move fully into the 21st century under the agencys 
current situation

emperor akihito will get a taxfree annual salary 
equivalent to 2 million the same as his father and another 20 
million for court expenses a finance ministry official said 
he said the government will make a special payment to the royal 
family of 21 million to cover expenses for the funeral of akihitos 
father emperor hirohito who died jan 7 and will be buried feb 24 
the government has decided to spend 74 million on the funeral 
including the payment to the imperial family 
akihitos salary must cover the living expenses of a sixmember 
family including his mother the dowager empress nagako while 
hirohitos was used only for himself and his wife an imperial 
household agency official said 
fifteen other members of the royal family receive a total of 17 
million annually the agency official said 
the imperial household agency which oversees the imperial 
familys activities receives 66 million a year for the salaries of 
its 1130 employees and maintenance of imperial properties 
more than 9 square miles of land one of japans scarcest 
commodities are occupied by the royal family including the 
palace which covers about half a square mile in tokyo and a summer 
residence on nearly five square miles of land in northern japan 
until world war ii the imperial family was the nations 
wealthiest but officials said all its land was transferred to the 
government after world war ii they said us occupation forces 
allowed the family to retain some assets including securities

the gathering of 149 nations to condemn chemical 
weapons showed if nothing else how the world order of a short time 
back has been stood on its head 
the old divisions so familiar to world affairs eastwest 
northsouth first worldthird world have given way to a baffling 
new array of converging interests 
diplomats seasoned by the cold war and the anticolonial winds of 
change watched the fiveday meeting in amazement 
the soviets clear winners in the charm category tweaked the 
americans for a lack of openness the americans aimed their ire at a 
friendly foe west germany 
western allies fought openly over which of their companies sold 
chemicals to iraq libya and syria all regarded as past or 
potential users of poison gas 
romania bolted its bloc taking a position directly opposed to 
the kremlins a soviet official merely smiled philosophically as he 
explained that the romanians refused to follow orders 
while chief soviet delegate viktor karpov beamed benignly at the 
cameras us correspondents aimed barbs at his american 
counterpart retired gen william burns head of the us arms 
control agency admitted not knowing about new chemical warheads 
included in the us budget made public by coincidence during the 
conference 
iran whose representatives spoke eloquent english stood firm 
with the industrial west against middle eastern states one us 
delegate described privately as the whackos 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati echoed points made by the 
united states the great satan demanding in measured terms even 
more sanctions and condemnation of past acts than the americans 
wanted 
although nations of the socalled nonaligned movement expressed 
token solidarity with the arab league hardline arabs had to back 
off linking bans on chemical and nuclear weapons for lack of real 
support 
were not buying that arab league garbage a central american 
delegate said in private you cant talk about a third world and 
mean anything 
black africans walked out again on rf botha the south african 
foreign minister but this time botha tossed away his speech and 
dramatically challenged them to admit in public their secret 
friendship with his country 
botha spoke of vaccines health care research and other aid his 
country provided and asserted my african brothers know this 
he noted that agreements finally had been reached on independence 
for namibia and south african withdrawal from angola black africans 
did not walk when those matters were settled he said 
we say no to hypoprisy commented foreign minister simeon ake 
of ivory coast the only black african to keep his seat at least 
it gave botha a chance to reveal his contacts 
under the ironies were signs of a world turning faster than many 
of its statesmen can measure 
william waldegrave junior minister in britains foreign office 
shrugged off the old distinctions in a chat with reporters i am 
always confused over who is supposed to be first world or third 
world when you start talking about rich middle eastern states 
most political analysts interviewed said the 109 speeches and 
secret negotiations showed oldstyle international dealings are 
poorly suited to a modern world 
countries condemned for spraying nerve gas on civilian 
populations directed the same rhetoric at chemical weapons as the 
those attacked 
everyone knew up to 30 nations at the meeting had chemical 
weapons but only the united states and the soviet union admitted 
having them france the host and arbiter of the moral tone denied 
it firmly despite the intelligence of its allies to the contrary 
the problem one western analyst put it is that you cant 
really say what you think that there are responsible leaders and 
maniacs and no international convention can differentiate among 
them 
several american delegates acknowledged that despite the general 
tone and circuitous phrasing their underlying concerns were 
specific 
iraq had used poison gas to turn the tide of war against iran 
and to terrorize its own kurdish minority some other states seemed 
impressed by their success 
syria had chemical warheads on scud missiles directed at israel 
each capable of delivering deadly gas over a radius of a thousand 
yards 
libya helped by private west german companies among others was 
completing a chemical weapons plant that could deliver toxic 
chemical agents to a broad range of terrorists 
the americans concurrent goal to focus attention on a new 
threat from libyan leader moammer gadhafi backfired by uniting the 
arab league a night of compromises produced a declaration with no 
mention of sanctions export controls or verification 
lessons of the conference extended well beyond the subject at 
hand mainly the old cliches and timeworn roles were falling away 
at one point a us press officer introduced an american 
reporter to an arms negotiator who answered a broad range of 
questions with hardly a pause to consider the implications of his 
remarks 
unlike most americans at the meeting the man was perfectly 
willing to be quoted he was a russian 
later an american negotiator agreed with a point his soviet 
rival had made that the conference declaration was a political 
document with little specific or technical value 
thats what we would say if we could he said but explained 
that statements had to be cleared in washington and some subjects 
were extremely sensitive then he added 
but dont quote me

maotai chinas fiery brew with a kick that would 
make a moonshiner smile has become an allpurpose grease for 
bribing bureaucrats and cajoling cadres a newspaper says 
the china youth news also blames profiteering by government 
officials for maotais high price and criticized chinas tradition 
of special privileges for creating conditions that allow the 
problem to flourish 
in this society even the most righteous of gentlemens 
agreements can be turned into the most vulgar of schemes said the 
article sunday 
the article was significant in that it showed the extent to which 
corruption has entered the life of the average chinese it also 
tacitly acknowledged that price rises instituted over the summer for 
13 name brand liquors had failed to break a black market 
stranglehold on the goods 
just about every major moment in a persons life in china 
requires a bribe of good booze the story said 
entering nursery school starting grade school changing 
schools beginning a career changing jobs getting a license 
helping a loved one to the hospital even sending a corpse to the 
crematorium could all use a few grenades of good liquor the 
story said 
a cartoon of a soldier holding two grenades of maotai as he 
prepared an assault on a government building accompanied the article 
if you have liquor even in a difficult situation problems are 
solved as the bottles are handed over and glasses raised in a 
toast it said if you dont there are many things you will 
never accomplish good liquor indeed has become societys 
allpurpose grease 
the best grease of all the article said is maotai a clear 
liquor made from rice with a taste resembling airplane fuel youth 
news estimated that 90 percent of the maotai purchased in china was 
not consumed by the buyer 
the people are using maotai they are not drinking it it 
said 
in july china freed the price of maotai and 12 other brand name 
liquors in an attempt to break a stranglehold that the black market 
had on the products by making the state price equal to the black 
market price china hoped to put the profiteers out of business 
a fixth of maotai shot up from 540 to 81 but still the 
profiteers havent disappeared sundays article said 
these prices are enough to frighten the people but distillers 
and liquor sellers arent afraid it said 
the reason is that because maotai and other good spirits are 
still scarce only officials with special powers can buy them 
the article said officials never would use their own money to buy 
the goods but would dip into the public till 
it cited statistics that in some counties government officials 
spend 50 percent of their budget on eating and drinking 
some officials buy a case of liquor and put it to use the 
article said but others buy a case and immediately sell it to 
make money money that is created through connections and power 
some officials the report said have taken to making bogus brand 
name liquor again in a ploy to capitalize on the expensive spirits 
in one county in shanxi 60 percent of the 118 distilleries 
manufacture fake brand name booze according to incomplete 
statistics for 1988 more than 20 million bottles of bogus liquor 
have been seized 
fake brand name liquor is becoming so commonplace that liquor 
sellers are getting nervous liquor buyers are getting nervous even 
brown noses who buy liquor to curry favor are getting nervous it 
said 
the article called on the government to enforce a regulation 
issued in october forbidding officials from using public money to 
buy liquor 
but its tone was pessimistic 
this problem is rooted in the ghost of the past it said 
special privileges dependence relations and a stratified society 
their power in china is still very strong

interior secretary donald p hodel is leaving 
washington convinced that leaders of environmental organizations are 
much too partisan and out of touch with their members 
hodel also said in a farewell interview that he believes the 
global warming called the greenhouse effect has been overblown 
and the cost of cleaning up the nations nuclear weapons plants has 
been overstated 
hodel said he was delighted and astounded that the losing 
democratic campaign of michael dukakis argued in hodels words 
that you dont have to choose between an improving environment and 
an adequate energy and minerals supply you can do both his own 
position 
the environmentalists who attacked president reagans first 
interior secretary james watt whom hodel served as deputy were 
the anticandoboth people hodel said 
hodel often has been called a smoother version of watt following 
the same policies but without the rancor asked if he were a watt 
policy clone he replied i hope so because we worked for the 
same man ronald reagan 
watts critics were the people who said we had to choose 
between improving our environment and the lifestyle of the american 
people they were the ones who had foisted the idea off on the 
carter administration that we were going to have to live with less 
that there was a malaise in the country that the united states 
glory days were behind us 
hodel said many leaders of environmental organizations made a 
horrible mistake when they endorsed carter for reelection in a 
white house rose garden ceremony in 1980 
i think if their membership understood how blatantly partisan 
the paid leadership was the membership would demand that something 
be done hodel said 
few environmental leaders made an endorsement in the 
justconcluded campaign though some attacked the record of the 
reagan administration and george bush 
the leaders are singleissue people hodel said but the 
bulk of the membership really does believe we can do both they are 
responsible dedicated supporters of wildlife clean air clean 
water and the environment 
hodels complaint was scoffed at by two environmental 
organizations 
when i joined the wilderness society in january 1981 the same 
month the reagan administration took office we had 40000 members 
we now have 240000 said former sen gaylord nelson dwis the 
societys counselor 
every single environmental organization in the united states 
has significantly increased its membership nelson said 
dave baker political director of friends of the earth said 
our membership votes with their dollars i think our 
membership does believe you can do both enhance the economy and 
protect the environment but i dont think don hodel and the 
administration have done much to promote that 
hodel however insisted that selfstyled public interest groups 
have been taken over by singleissue politicians 
he said that in the early 1980s it was clear that the impending 
release of much natural gas from price controls would mean falling 
prices because demand had fallen below production 
the consumer lobby continued to insist that price controls were 
necessary to protect the consumer and i dont think it had 
anything to do with protecting the consumer it has to do with a 
regulatory frame of mind that these people have which is they want 
the government which they as singleinterest politicians can 
influence in control of the market because then they can skew it 
for their purposes when they need to 
some gas was decontrolled and prices did fall the reagan 
administration has not succeeded in persuading congress to free the 
remaining 40 percent of gas still under controls 
hodel said he believes that nuclear waste cleanup costs faced by 
the energy department probably have been overstated 
when you hear 360 billion estimates or whatever the number is 
that includes cleanup way beyond what is necessary for health and 
safety he said 
the energy department has estimated it needs 81 billion through 
2010 for cleanup and modernization 
hodel also discounts the worstcase scenarios offered for the 
greenhouse effect 
he said he thinks that the global warming is primarily 
occurring because of longrange global or universal or 
solarsystemwide effects and we will find that the human input 
definitely has an effect but that is not nearly so great as the 
initial estimates 
many scientists argue that the global warming produced by carbon 
dioxide results mainly from the burning of fossil fuels they say it 
has increased average temperatures by nearly one degree fahrenheit 
over the past century and is likely to increase temperatures three 
to eight degrees by sometime in the middle of the next century 
raising sea levels increasing droughts and shifting crop production 
zones

while some americans still await word of a 
husband father or son usvietnamese teams patrol the countryside 
in the biggest effort yet to find remains of fallen airmen and send 
them on a final peaceful journey home 
some families an unspecified but apparently small number have 
been told five teams are investigating and excavating sites where 
relatives are believed to have crashed during air strikes between 
1964 and 1972 this is the fourth joint operation since october 
due to privacy considerations of the affected families we 
cannot discuss the specifics a statement from the us delegation 
said however those families have been notified of the 
investigation and will be fully advised of the results 
the two dozen us specialists will be in vietnam until jan 23 
and will leave with 25 sets of remains that are being prepared for 
repatriation and identification at the us army laboratory in 
hawaii 
previously vietnam had allowed only four us teams in at a 
time it has repatriated 63 sets of remains in the past month 
the us government is pleased that vietnam has agreed to 
expand the ongoing effort from four to five teams the american 
delegation said the us government appreciates the initiative 
taken by vietnam to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue 
the increasing joint cooperation to resolve the longstanding 
humanitarian issue 
nguyen can acting director of vietnams office for mias those 
missing in action during the long war that ended in 1975 agreed 
that cooperation has been good and the issue is humanitarian rather 
than political 
we dont want to use this as any kind of leverage because we 
understand the feelings of the american families whose loved ones 
did not come home after the war he said we have our own mias 
more than the united states 
can put the figure at 300000 
we want to solve this question and let bygones be bygones he 
said whats the good of keeping this alive it would only let the 
spiritual wounds of war bleed and that would not be helpful to any 
understanding between the two people 
both governments have sought in public pronouncements to separate 
the human side of the war from politics but the mia issue figures 
into the process of establishing the diplomatic relations vietnam 
seeks 
washington has said all vietnamese troops must be removed from 
cambodia before it will consider an exchange of ambassadors 
economic aid and lifting the us trade embargo 
hanoi has said it will meet the requirement by the end of next 
year perhaps sooner vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 
overthrowing the murderous khmer rouge regime of pol pot and has 
occupied the neighboring country since 
the united states also has sent word to vietnam that its 
cooperation in returning remains would be regarded favorably in the 
past vietnam slowed the search when it was angered by critical us 
statements 
can said some bad elements in southern vietnam were 
trafficking in remains by hiring people to dig in vietnamese 
graves steal the remains and try to pass them off as american 
he said those vietnamese mistakenly believed american remains 
would get them entry visas to the united states or some other reward 
us policy is to accept powmia information from any source 
the american delegation said but we do not view paying for 
remains as helpful to promoting governmenttogovernment cooperation 
on accounting 
paying for remains would encourage scavenger activities at 
crash sites by persons lacking the technical recovery knowledge 
thus enormously complicating the us governments ability to 
recover remains the americans said 
similarly the us government does not provide refugee 
resettlement as a reward for cooperation 
fewer than 10 percent of the remains of americans listed as 
missing in indochina have been recovered since us forces were 
withdrawn from vietnam in early 1973 
vietnam has returned the remains of 172 americans identified by 
the army laboratory another 2383 are missing 1747 in vietnam 
547 in laos 83 in cambodia and six in china 
us officials acknowledge not all cases will be resolved 
because much time has passed and many airmen were lost in jungle 
terrain or at sea 
the united states will continue its efforts to account for all 
missing americans the delegation said 
we still have ongoing efforts to account for americans missing 
from world war ii and korea this solemn commitment to resolve the 
fate of missing americans and to return all recoverable remains to 
their native land will not be abandoned

as president reagan heads back to the ranch 
on george bushs inauguration day he will carry with him a passel 
of perquisites that presidents receive when they become former 
presidents 
for one thing he will fly to california on air force one but 
thats only a oneshot deal the plane will be flown back to 
washington without him and after that will be earmarked for the new 
president 
there will be no need however to pass the tin cup for reagan 
unlike such early presidents as thomas jefferson who had to sell 
his books to make ends meet reagan will like other recent ones be 
quite comfortably off 
he gets two pensions aroundtheclock secret service protection 
an office allowance and the use of a townhouse in washington in 
addition the government will pay to ship his papers to california 
process them and run his presidential library 
reagan already receives a pension of 29188 a year from the 
state of california because of his eight years as governor 
now with eight years as president under his belt he will 
receive a federal pension equal to the annual salary of a member of 
the cabinet this is currently 99500 but will jump to 155000 if 
congress approves a salary increase reagan has recommended 
the secret service protection applies to both the president and 
his wife nancy should reagan die she would receive lifetime 
protection unless she remarried the reagans children will receive 
no protection since they are all adults 
former sen lawton chiles dfla who waged a campaign to scale 
back benefits for former presidents during his senate career 
estimated the cost of the secret service protection at 93 million 
in 1986 this covered former presidents ford and carter but not 
nixon who chose to hire private bodyguards 
i wouldnt be surprised to see that double in the first year 
that reagan is out of office said robert coakley who was chiles 
staff director and is now on the staff of sen john glenn dohio 
coakley said the first year out of office is always the most 
expensive because of equipment purchases 
also although reagan spoke in his final presidential radio 
address saturday of going back to the ranch he and mrs reagan 
actually plan to live in a fashionable los angeles neighborhood and 
continue to use their 688acre ranch north of santa barbara as a 
vacation home protecting both places also will increase the cost 
each former president receives an office allowance of up to 
300000 reagan already has waiting for him a penthouse suite in a 
los angeles office building with offices for himself mrs reagan 
the ronald reagan presidential foundation the secret service and 
press aide mark weinberg 
the washington townhouse on a side street near the white house 
is reserved for the use of former presidents when they come to town 
although they do not always use it president carter for instance 
stayed in the presidential suite of a hotel about a block away when 
he came through town on a recent book promotion tour 
in 1986 the senate passed a chiles bill to limit secret service 
protection and reduce the office allowances but it failed to win 
approval in the house 
chiles did secure enactment of a bill requiring the private 
backers who put up the funds to build presidential libraries also to 
create an endowment to underwrite the cost of running them theres 
a catch though at the insistence of the administration the bill 
exempted the reagan library now being built in simi valley calif 
in addition to the cost of running the library national archives 
spokeswoman jill brett said an estimated 500000 is ticketed for 
moving reagans presidential papers to california and 13 million 
for renovating and equipping storage room for them in the archives 
facility at laguna niguel and in rented space at culver city 
james b mckinney director of the white house military office 
which oversees transportation medical and other services for the 
president said those services will be available to the expresident 
for six months but he will have to pay for them weinberg said 
reagan expects to use only some limited communications support to 
facilitate the transition 
reagans personal finances are hard to measure since most of his 
assets are in a blind trust his latest government financial 
disclosure form which discloses assets in broad categories said 
only that the trust is worth more than 250000 the reagans bought 
their ranch for 526000 in 1974 and made 127000 in improvements 
to it eight years later the new home in los angeles was purchased 
for 25 million by california friends from whom the reagans are 
leasing it for a reported 15000 a month 
both of the reagans plan to write books and make speeches for 
which they are expected to command handsome fees 
all in all if reagans presidential limousine turns into a 
pumpkin at the stroke of noon on friday it certainly should be a 
prize pumpkin

presidentelect george bush said so little 
about his view of the world during the campaign it is hard to 
predict his foreign policy but since winning the white house he has 
dropped some serious hints 
these indicate he will slow down negotiations with the soviet 
union to reduce longrange nuclear weapons while taking a softer 
approach on nicaragua also bush is not a good bet to push the us 
strategic defense initiative very hard 
if the hints turn into facts bush will have diverged 
significantly from ronald reagan on all three points even so the 
change would be one of degree and not a radical shift 
bush and his secretary of state james a baker iii evidently 
want time to reflect and to feel their way they are likely to focus 
at the start on cultivating the north atlantic treaty organization 
allies and improving relations with japan an economic powerhouse 
that increasingly appears at crosspurposes with the united states 
on trade and fiscal issues 
bush has indicated he will continue the recent reagan 
administration policy of firing rifle shot trade sanctions at 
economic allies who discriminate against us goods to show our 
determination to have fair trade and equal access 
reagan started slowly too holding off any serious action on 
arms control for 10 months while damning moscow with traditional 
rightwing rhetoric 
however reagan wound up holding five summit meetings with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and signing a treaty to abolish 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles those that carry from 300 to 
3000 miles 
bush clearly isnt planning to reverse the trend 
i am impressed with what mr gorbachev says and i really think 
he wants better relations bush said in a recent television 
interview i think hes fully committed to perestroika and 
glasnost and i dont think you can put the genie back into the 
bottle once you open it and lighten up a little there 
but the resumption of ussoviet negotiations on a strategic 
arms reduction treaty may be postponed for several months already 
bush has said a detailed pointbypoint program cannot be ready 
by feb 15 the tentative date for negotiators to return to the 
table in geneva 
circumstances may force bush and baker to move quickly in the 
middle east however 
the new israeli government still smarting from the reagan 
administrations decision to talk to the palestine liberation 
organization is rushing to complete a comprehensive proposal for a 
middle east settlement 
bush who said the traditionally soothing things about israel 
during the campaign faces decisions on the israeli initiative what 
to do about the plo and whether to support a state for the 
palestinian arabs 
his aides meanwhile have said the new administration will adopt 
a new approach to nicaragua seeking a diplomatic solution before 
asking congress for more military aid to the contra rebels 
bush has already called on the soviets to lighten up and 
reduce their heavy military aid to the sandinista government which 
is estimated at about 500 million a year 
this suggests bush is in a mood to compromise in central america 
but in a meeting with a group of prominent hispanic republicans 
before christmas he pledged there would be no radical shift in 
direction from the reagan administrations policies toward cuba 
and nicaragua 
norman ornstein a political analysts for the conservative 
american enterprise institute commented recently that two very 
different personalities exist within bush 
one is the tough hardnosed read my lips make my day george 
bush thats the george bush who basically says weve got to take it 
easy with the soviets were not going to rush to judgment on a 
strategic arms limitation treaty with the soviets ornstein said 
the other is the kinder and gentler thousand points of light 
to reach out to congress to jesse jackson to various groups george 
bush the one who writes little notes to everybody hes managed to 
juggle the two personalities very adroitly but im not sure its 
going to be as easy to do once hes inaugurated 
bush who joined reagan in his last meeting with gorbachev in 
december in new york has never made it entirely clear exactly where 
he stands on dealing with the soviet union 
often he registers the caution of a moderate conservative 
occasionally the optimism of an idealist 
the leadership of the soviet union is changing he said in a 
campaign speech last autumn in south river nj but old 
ambitions die hard systems die hard and the leaves may be falling 
but the trees are fundamentally the same 
announcing his selection of baker a day after the election bush 
said he sought progress in ussoviet relations but added ive 
never supported meetings just for the sake of having meetings 
and yet the presidentelect registered his willingness to meet 
with gorbachev if it would promote human rights in the soviet union 
or any one of several us goals

fire officials hope they have doused the 
enthusiasm of two volunteers who rush to brush fires in their 1958 
fire engine and 3000gallon water truck sometimes ahead of the 
regular firefighters 
william myers and mark siebert agreed to recent los angeles fire 
department orders to stop their efforts but they say they have 
earned the right to form a firefighting team because of their 
participation in the los angeles community fire patrol the 
neighborhood watchstyle arm of the fire department 
you might think were eccentric myers said but our 
eccentricity probably does a whole lot of good 
authorities disagreed saying the two have hampered paid 
firefighters 
they just dont understand the dangers to themselves and other 
people said john orr glendale fire department senior arson 
investigator if they are found interfering with our activities in 
glendale again they will be arrested 
orr said myers and siebert blocked a road with their vehicles and 
hampered firefighters at an oct 15 fire 
but joe cohen said the two beat city firefighters to a blaze on 
his property it was all over in five minutes but who knows how 
bad it would have gotten cohen said 
myers a 39yearold building contractor said he and siebert 
who run a fire equipment rental business are not seeking publicity 
and are not trying to form another fire department 
siebert a 30yearold parttime maintenance man said he and his 
friend take their work seriously and have attended community college 
classes in fighting wildfires

loan industry because of the crisis that could cost taxpayers more 
than 100 billion 
sen donald riegle dmich whose committee will have to deal 
with the issue was not specific sunday about what changes he has in 
mind 
riegle appearing on nbcs meet the press said that while 
sampls must put their focus on providing home mortgages it would be 
an enormous shift backwards to require them to limit their 
activities to such mortgages 
riegle said the sampl industrys problems are a shared 
responsibility and he blamed not only the industry and its 
regulators but also president reagan and congress the regulatory

outgoing defense secretary frank c carlucci is 
warning that automatic cuts in the pentagon budget mandated under 
the grammrudman deficit reduction law would be devastating 
there has been speculation that if the bush administration and 
congress fail to reach agreement on reducing the federal budget 
deficit the white house might be willing to accept the automatic 
spending cuts 
it would certainly be devastating to the defense department 
based on preliminary estimates wed have to take something like 
26 billion out of the defense department carlucci said sunday on 
abcs this week with david brinkley 
our force structure is down to about the minimum you can get 
and still maintain our rotation schedules he said so cuts of 
those dimensions would really mean laying up ships getting rid of 
people taking away ammunition

after a march by 5000 opposition 
supporters president daniel ortega said the government plans to 
give the opposition greater political opportunity and those who 
dont want it can look for their democracy in miami 
in his sunday speech ortega also said he would propose severe 
budget cuts that would require extensive government layoffs 
sundays opposition demonstration the largest since a july 10 
rally in the town of nandaime that police broke up with tear gas and 
beatings was called to protest the leftist governments economic 
management and political repression 
the peaceful march through managuas streets was organized by the 
nicaraguan democratic coordinating committee a coalition of 14 
opposition parties and several unions 
we hope to have more demonstrations like this more unity 
theres no reason we cant run a single candidate for president next 
year said coordinating committee president carlos huembes 
he claimed the fragmented opposition parties are united against 
the sandinista government 
ortega did not refer directly to the demonstration or next years 
scheduled presidential elections in a speech hours later to about 
1000 representatives of prosandinista organizations but he said 
sectors that oppose the government would be given a pluralistic 
opportunity 
he said that those who have been dreaming of yankee 
intervention and the defeat of the revolution could look for 
their democracy in miami and stop enriching themselves in 
nicaragua 
it was a sarcastic reference to the thousands of nicaraguans who 
have fled the country in recent months many to find themselves 
homeless in miami or other parts of the united states 
ortega acknowledged that nicaraguas economic condition is very 
critical and said the states budget will have to be cut 
he gave few specifics except to say the police budget would be 
protected but that massive layoffs would be required in most 
departments on dec 31 ortega had said he would cut the defense 
budget 40 percent 
no arrests were reported in the opposition march whose 
participants complained about the economy saying they were not 
earning enough to pay for rice eggs beer or milk 
where is the milk children are dying of hunger said one 
angry construction worker like many he did not want to give his 
name for fear of government retaliation 
others said that a quart of milk costs about 45 cents while a 
worker earns just 90 cents a day 
ortega blames nicaraguas economic plight on the war against 
ussupported contra rebels a us economic boycott and the 
battering the nation received in october from hurricane joan 
they are killing us with hunger but they dont want to blame 
themselves an old man wearing a straw hat said of the government 
he said he was 81 and the only worse time he could remember was 
the early 1930s when gen augusto sandino was fighting us marine 
occupiers 
the 3hour march began with a mass in memory of slain newspaper 
editor pedro joaquin chamorro then wended its way almost two miles 
to the cemetery where chamorro is buried 
everybodys afraid but people are beginning to lose their 
fear the hunger does it said alberto borge 
borge said he was a computer technician a former sandinista and 
a cousin of the powerful interior minister tomas borge 
the government issued a permit for the march the largest 
antisandinista demonstration since the nandaime rally 
more than 40 demonstrators and 10 police were reported injured 
and more than 30 people arrested when police broke up that protest 
the sandinistas claimed washington instigated the demonstration and 
expelled us ambassador richard melton 
few police officers were visible sunday the nicaraguan baseball 
leagues allstar game was given a morning start to coincide with 
the march and drew 4000 spectators 
chamorro was publisher of the newspaper la prensa his jan 10 
1978 assassination galvanized opposition to the dictatorship of the 
late anastasio somoza who was toppled a year later by the popular 
revolution the sandinistas rode to power 
la prensa now published by one of chamorros sons is the 
countrys only opposition newspaper

subtle chaos in heartbeat patterns may be a 
sign of health while monotonous regularity might help doctors 
predict if someone faces an increased risk of sudden death from 
cardiac arrest researchers say 
scientists hope the theory of chaos which says orderly patterns 
can be disguised as disorder also will help them learn how the 
brain works and plan the best time to give vaccines to prevent 
epidemics 
the extension of the mathematical theory into biology and 
medicine was discussed sunday during the annual meeting of the 
american association for the advancement of science 
the theory popularized by james gleicks bestselling 1987 book 
chaos holds that complex and seemingly random events such as 
weather the flow of water in a stream or stock market fluctuations 
really may result from simple equations or rules as a result 
scientists in many fields have rushed to find examples of this chaos 
or orderly disorder in their fields of study 
not everyone accepts the theory university of wisconsin 
economist william brock attacked some of its extensions which he 
didnt specify as really wild stuff that tends to make us look 
like were a bunch of quacks 
normal heartbeats are commonly viewed as regular and periodic 
but the pattern really is more erratic than people assume said dr 
ary goldberger a harvard medical school cardiologist and dr 
arnold mandell a psychiatry professor at the university of 
california san diego 
goldberger said his studies found subtly chaotic variations from 
beat to beat occur in healthy hearts but such fluctuations are not 
found in people who face an increased risk of death from sudden 
cardiac arrest 
existing cardiac monitoring devices listen for average heart rate 
and extra beats but devices designed to detect monotonous 
regularity or the absence of subtle chaos in heart rates might 
help predict who faces elevated risk for having their heart stop 
goldberger said 
mandell said pituitary cells are another example of 
chaosashealth and orderasillness the cells normally secrete 
hormones in irregular bursts to help control growth but mandells 
research found that when such cells turn cancerous they emit 
hormones steadily 
walter freeman a physiologist at the university of california 
berkeley said that by implanting electrodes in rabbits brains he 
discovered subtle but orderly brainwave patterns hidden in the 
seemingly random electrical activity each time a rabbit sniffed and 
recognized a particular odor the part of the brain responsible for 
the sense of smell produced a similar pattern he said 
the discovery gets to the heart of how brains work by 
revealing order in the ceaseless and seemingly chaotic electrical 
noise emitted by the brain as it processes information freeman 
said 
his work could lead to a new generation of computers that more 
closely duplicate human brain function and new ways of diagnosing 
brain disorders by looking for deviations from subtle brainwave 
patterns a university of california news release speculated 
mathematical patterns in the apparently random timing of measles 
rubella or mumps epidemics in new york baltimore milwaukee 
detroit st louis copenhagen and aberdeen scotland recently were 
found by a team led by william schaffer of the university of 
arizona at tucsons evolutionary biology department 
some critics have accused the team of trying to explain too much 
with chaos theory but if epidemics have hidden regularity it could 
help public health officials conduct vaccination campaigns when they 
would be most effective the journal science reported earlier this 
month

president jose sarney has laid off 
60000 government employees frozen wages and prices and revamped 
the currency in a program of national salvation designed to 
combat 933 percent inflation 
no democracy can be preserved in a situation of 
hyperinflation he said in announcing the austerity program to the 
nation late sunday we need to summon our courage to make sure 
that we dont see blood and tears to avoid that we must rely on 
our sweat and sacrifice 
union leaders immediately threatened to call for a nationwide 
general strike to protest the measures which eliminate a system 
that ties wage increases to inflation 
the new program is the fourth major package of economic measures 
imposed by sarney who took office in march of 1985 ending 21 years 
of repressive rightwing military rule 
sarney in his nationwide radio and television address referred 
to it as a program of national salvation and called on brazils 
154 million people to fight a total war against inflation using 
the toughest weapons and most profound measures brazil has ever 
taken 
he said banks would be closed today and tuesday to give them time 
to adapt to the new measures which include a 17 percent devaluation 
of the cruzado and creation of the socalled new cruzado worth 
1000 old ones 
the program also scraps the automatic monthly indexing of 
contracts savings accounts and most financial transactions to cost 
of living increases 
among the measures designed to slash the massive public spending 
deficit were firing about 60000 civil servants the elimination of 
five cabinet ministries and the closing of 42 state companies and 
agencies 
the package also includes a 45day price freeze on about 200 
basic commodities 
sarney said it also aims to spur the economy and reduce a budget 
deficit that now runs at 6 percent of the gross national product 
last year the gnp grew just 004 percent while industrial growth 
fell 223 percent from 1987 government figures show 
union leaders immediately criticized the plan 
we werent consulted about the measures which will once more 
cut into workers salaries said luiz mederos leader of the sao 
paulo metal workers union i have no doubts angry workers will 
react negatively and they will have our support in organizing a 
nationwide strike 
union figures show that in the past two years workers 
purchasing power has dipped by about 40 percent due to inflation 
brazils past measures though initially successful have been 
unable to contain inflation 
brazils inflation rate hit an alltimehigh annual rate of 933 
percent in 1988 substantially higher than 366 percent during the 
previous year 
inflation in december rose to 288 percent well above the 
25percent limit set by business social and government leaders in a 
social pact announced in november 
brazil is the third worlds leading debtor nation owing 115 
billion

an offer of free 40acre parcels for people 
willing to settle in a remote county on the canadian border has 
brought more than 4000 inquiries some from as far afield as west 
germany and guam 
its been mindboggling said jim lemieux a member of the 
bidstead advisory council in international falls county seat of 
koochiching county 
homesteaders will be required to build a home and live there for 
at least 10 years they are expected to be selfsufficient so as 
not to drain the local economy and are subject to an extensive 
credit and criminalrecords check 
the offer received widespread publicity last month and since 
then lemieux said the county has received inquiries from all 50 
states and canada ireland england west germany spain mexico 
japan puerto rico and guam 
the 4000 calls and letters add up to more than a quarter of 
koochiching countys population of about 15700 scattered over 
3120 square miles and eight communities in an area about 300 miles 
north of minneapolis 
the idea of homesteading it boggles their mind people want to 
get back to their roots lemieux said last week the heaviest 
concentration has been from the chicago area new york florida and 
california if youve been to any of those areas you know why 
the countys population has dropped by about 2000 since 1980 
attributed in part to the 1984 closing of a fiberboard plant and a 
trend away from rural areas in favor of metropolitan regions 
the decline prompted county officials to seek approval last year 
for the bidstead and economic development program officials coined 
the term bidstead from the words bid and homestead 
the program is believed to be the first largescale land giveaway 
since the federal homestead program of the late 1800s us 
officials say 
joy lewis 36 of king nc read of the offer a few weeks ago 
in the winstonsalem nc journal and could hardly wait until 
koochiching county offices opened that morning so she could get more 
information 
i do a lot of crazy things she said in a telephone interview 
she said she and her husband wayne a machine repairman have 
always wanted land as something to pass along to their four 
children and they find minnesotas land of 10000 lakes 
appealing for camping and fishing 
but at the top of her list is a sense of adventure she said 
for judybeth hagerty 49 the offer sounds like a chance to put 
down roots and escape the quick pace of life in vacaville calif 
about midway between san francisco and sacramento 
even the weather which earned international falls a reputation 
as the nations icebox a reputation it lived up to last week 
with temperatures dipping to minus 31 degrees and never surpassing 
15 above hasnt chilled enthusiasm for the giveaway 
i just like the openness the kind of pioneering type of 
atmosphere said hagerty a secretary and texas native who lived 
in alaska for five years 
im just fed up with the cities im looking for something 
totally different from this kind of life here she said by 
telephone 
officials have allocated 50000 acres enough for 1250 
homesteaders from woods and farmland taken over by the county when 
owners failed to pay taxes 
we dont want freeloaders lemieux said we want people who 
will contribute to the quality of life and the economy were 
getting some quality people applying but no brain surgeons yet 
some applicants are retirees others are computer programmers 
artists and attorneys who could work out of their homes lemieux 
said 
international falls was founded in 1906 with a sawmill operation 
and took its name from the falls on rainy river that were later 
dammed the areas major industries include wood products tourism 
and the coldweather testing of products including helicopters 
autos and oil 
bidstead program director jerry andre said officials were 
completing contracts for two applicants who applied before the 
recent flood of inquiries at least four more applications are 
nearing the final stage 
my own personal feeling is that if we got 10 percent of the 
respondents to actually participate it would be a godsend for the 
county ten percent would be a real boon lemieux said

when ronald reagan launched his presidential 
campaign in 1976 he started it with a ceremony in his tiny hometown 
and promised to return after he won the office 
its 13 years later and tampico is still waiting 
and residents wonder why the title birthplace of a president 
never translated into tourism and fame for this dusty farming 
community 
the tourists never came because we didnt have billy carter 
sitting here drinking beer said stan headings 49 owner of the 
dutch diner 
headings opened the diner shortly after reagan whose nickname 
is dutch took office in 1981 he figured to cash in on 
tampicos connection with the president 
i thought property values would go up and maybe id buy some 
land and sell it later to make a little money headings said in 
fact property didnt go up and there was no way for me to get my 
money out of it 
he was luckier than other entrepreneurs whose ventures such as 
gift shops and antique stores failed 
headings combined good food with a good gimmick free eggs with 
every 5 purchase 
luckily our business does not depend on tourists 
interested in reagan 
headings restaurant is two doors from the old first national 
bank building where nellie reagan gave birth to ronald wilson reagan 
in an upstairs apartment on feb 6 1911 
the bank closed in 1937 and its facade is virtually unchanged 
except for a sign proclaiming it the birthplace of president 
ronald reagan 
inside visitors can find paul and helen nicely surrounded with 
mementos and guarding tampicos link with reagan 
president reagan set up his national campaign headquarters here 
in 1976 and he spent the day said nicely a 70yearold retired 
teacher who earned a graduate degree for his years of research on 
reagan 
before he left he said hed be back but hes never been back 
mayor roy sigel describes tampico as a proud town saddened that 
its favorite son never comes home 
the perceived snub is magnified because reagan has found time 
during his eight years as president to drop in at his nearby alma 
mater eureka college to his boyhood home of dixon just 35 miles 
away and most recently to davenport iowa about 60 miles from 
tampico 
i feel bad he doesnt come by and see us once in a while 
sigel said but he has different priorities 
hes the most powerful man in the world he cant be bothered 
with us theres no resentment disappointment is the proper word 
three calls to the white house seeking comment were not returned 
although folks here have seen railroads canals farm families 
and industry come and go tampico has changed little since reagan 
cut his teeth here main street is listed on the national historic 
register 
tampico a town of about 950 people still throws a birthday 
party for reagan every february their invitations to the hometown 
boy who made good go unanswered 
president reagan didnt make it but we had a great party 
anyway said the mayors wife pat 
of course when i say that i mean no resentment for the 
president we love him thats why we have a party for him

heart disease remains the nations 
biggest killer taking a life every 32 seconds but researchers have 
made unbelievable progress in taming the disease according to 
the american heart association 
figures released sunday show that deaths from heart and blood 
vessel disease have dropped 24 percent during the past decade 
researchers attribute the improvement to healthier living habits and 
better treatment 
the public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made 
in heart disease over the past 20 years said dr myron l 
weisfeldt the associations presidentelect 
its almost unbelievable there is almost no form of heart 
disease that we cant approach without meaningful treatment 
however weisfeldt a heart specialist at johns hopkins 
university cautioned that much work remains in improving care and 
encouraging people to take better care of themselves 
i believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic 
heart disease in the united states by the year 2000 if we stop 
smoking get cholesterol treated if its above 220 and identify and 
treat hypertension he said 
ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed 
the heart it underlies most heart attacks the single most lethal 
heart ailment 
the association said that in 1986 the most recent year for which 
there are statistics an estimated 978500 americans died from heart 
attacks strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels 
cancer the no 2 killer took 466000 lives 
the associations latest figures show that more than one in four 
americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease and almost 
half eventually die from it 
however the figures also bear out the brightening outlook 
between 1976 and 1986 the death rate from all forms of 
cardiovascular disease fell 24 percent including 28 percent for 
heart attacks and 40 percent for strokes 
the good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the 
death rate from the biggest killer of our population said dr 
bernadine healy of the cleveland clinic foundation the 
associations current president 
those trends are dramatic and dont seem to be reversing she 
said the bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1 
million americans a year and weve got a long way to go 
about 60 percent of the heartattack deaths occur before the 
victim reaches the hospital studies show that about half of all 
heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an 
emergency room 
weisfeldt said a major goal is getting people to go to the 
hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart 
attacks during this period there is still time to give them drugs 
to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks 
this treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart 
attacks 
other major goals he said including finding ways to improve the 
effectiveness of angioplasty which uses balloons to reopen clogged 
heart arteries and finding surgical and medical techniques to 
identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest 
the association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost 
882 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages in 1986 
it estimated the cost at 786 billion 
among other statistics released by the association 
the most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure 
which affects 60 million americans 
about 200000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each 
year occur in people under age 65 
there were 1418 heart transplants in 1987 almost nine times as 
many as in 1983 
about 25 million americans have angina the chest pain 
resulting from clogged heart arteries about 300000 new cases occur 
annually 
up to 15 million americans will have heart attacks this year

communist north korea today agreed to 
rival south koreas proposals to hold the highestlevel political 
and military talks on easing tensions since the korean war 
prime minister yon hyung mok of north korea accepted the souths 
proposal that he and his south korean counterpart kang younghoon 
should head their respective delegations at talks to be held in both 
countrys capitals 
the north and south should remove the state of tension which is 
driving the same people toward disaster yon said in a letter to 
his kang he said the two koreas should prepare a firm foundation 
for peaceful unification 
yon proposed a meeting at the panmunjom border truce site on feb 
8 at which vice ministers would work out terms for fullscale talks 
no date was mentioned for the main talks and the two sides are 
expected to face problems on agreeing on terms 
yon repeated the norths demand for separate talks with south 
korea and the united states on reducing tension on the divided 
peninsula he also demanded an end to annual south koreaus 
military exercises 
it is obvious to everyone that the north and south can not 
fundamentally resolve the question of peace by setting aside the 
united states which is the party responsible for the aggravation of 
tension the letter said 
south korea and the united states have rejected the norths 
demands for separate threeway talks 
seoul agreed last month to the norths call for highlevel 
political and military talks on reducing tension it also proposed 
that the prime ministers head the delegations to make the talks the 
highest since the war 
while agreeing to upgrade talks to that level the north has 
rejected the souths proposal for separate economic and red cross 
humanitarian talks it said economic issues can be resolved after 
the political issues and red cross talks are outside any official 
control 
the two sides have failed to make progress on improving relations 
in scattered talks over the past two decades and a major diplomatic 
breakthrough is seen as unlikely by many observers as long as north 
korean leader kim il sung remains in power 
kim ordered the 1950 invasion of the south that started the 
korean war 
talks between lawmakers from the two sides ran into trouble last 
month after the north suddenly demanded an end to the south 
koreaus military exercises the demand came as the two koreas 
appeared close to agreeing on terms for interparliamentary talks on 
a nonaggression agreement 
the parliamentary delegations are due to meet again in february 
in his letter yon said the proposed prime ministers meeting 
should also focus on halting largescale provocative military 
exercises 
south korean officials have warned that the north wants to use 
talks with the south to secure withdrawal of the 42000 us troops 
based in the south under a mutual defense treaty 
south korean leaders say us forces are vital to maintain a 
balance against north koreas larger forces 
in seoul today sen richard lugar rindiana told reporters that 
annual largescale ussouth korea military exercises will continue 
as long as the south korean government wants them 
if the republic of south korea wants to change them we will 
discuss it but they have not said the indianan ranking 
republican on the senate foreign relations committee the joint 
exercises have been conducted in various parts of the south since 
1976 
the two koreas were created after us and soviet forces ended 
japans occupation in 1945 and divided the korean peninsula 
the two sides have clashed over the years since the korean war 
and keep hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150mile 
border there are no communication links except for a single hot 
line

calendars distributed to 65 mcdonalds restaurants because they 
mistakenly labeled the martin luther king jr holiday as national 
nothing day 
officials at john malmo advertising blame a clerical error for 
the national nothing day notation on jan 16 instead of noting 
the federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leaders 
birthday said spokeswoman cathleen west king was born on jan 15 
1929 but the federal holiday is the third monday in january 
it certainly was not done intentionally or maliciously it was 
a terrible clerical oversight she said 
the managers of 65 mcdonalds restaurants in memphis where king 
was assassinated april 4 1968 received the calendars to help 
remind them when sales promotions begin and end 
it was unfortunately a terrible terrible oversight said ms 
west who handles mcdonalds account with malmo its not 
mcdonalds fault 
the national nothing day holiday has been listed on the calendar 
in past years as a spoof of special days that salute everything from 
pickles to world poetry she said 
the error was not noticed until an annoyed mcdonalds employee 
called to complain the managers have received corrected calendars 
ms west said 
the day before the mistake was discovered the company saluted 10 
black high school students as mcdonalds talented teens black 
history makers of tomorrow the students received plaques and 200 
awards at a banquet featuring black community leaders said steve 
lykins vice president of century management which owns two dozen 
mcdonalds restaurants in the region

as martin luther king jrs message of peace and 
justice is remembered today his widow is fighting boston university 
over 83000 documents left by the slain civil rights leader 
coretta scott king sued her husbands alma mater in december 
1987 seeking return of the papers which include early glimmerings 
of his i have a dream speech a prescribed diet and hate mail 
she insists they belong with the rest of the king archives at the 
king center in atlanta 
boston university in turn sued mrs king the private school 
claims it is the rightful owner of all king papers including the 
100000 in atlanta 
efforts at an outofcourt settlement failed details of which 
neither party will disclose instead both sides want a trial to 
settle the matter but they disagree on what issues the trial should 
decide the dispute is now before state appeals court judge 
christopher armstrong 
king earned his doctorate in theology at boston university in 
1955 it was there he met his future wife a music student 
in 1964 the year he won the nobel peace prize king wrote to 
boston university that on his death the university would be the 
repository of my correspondence manuscripts and other papers 
four years later he was assassinated in memphis tenn he would 
have been 60 on sunday 
the universitys collection represents about onethird of kings 
documents and correspondence and it was in the schools possession 
when he died 
the collection is mostly sermons that king composed on yellow 
legal paper in his thin scrawl and fills 16 file drawers there are 
also letters many unsigned from strangers including hatefilled 
ones one of the few scraps of more personal items is an alabama 
doctors prescription for a strict diet of bread lean meat 
vegetable salad and skim milk 
mrs kings lawyers have argued that her late husbands letter to 
boston university isnt binding being neither a contract nor a 
charitable pledge and in violation of laws governing wills king 
left no will 
melvin miller an attorney representing boston university had 
little to say about the case other than that he was talking to 
witnesses and taking depositions 
nothings happening he said recently 
in august suffolk superior court judge john l murphy said mrs 
king can sue boston university for the papers but must then explain 
why it took her 23 years to seek their return 
murphy said the trial must decide whether the twodecade delay is 
unfair to boston university he also threw out the universitys 
claim to own all of kings papers 
in november boston university appealed that ruling to armstrong 
when judge armstrong does rule we expect to be moving to have a 
trial right away said mrs kings attorney james f obrien 
mrs kings lawsuit also claimed the collection is not properly 
displayed or preserved at boston university some of the documents 
are on display in the library but most is stored in a 
climatecontrolled room

a young dolphin that has refused to 
leave broad bays chilly waters for six weeks despite two federal 
rescue attempts is being trained to survive the winter 
because hes young he would normally be in a herd of dolphins 
and depend on the experience of older animals for guidance joseph 
r geraci a us marine mammal commission veterinarian said sunday 
without that guidance his greatest need as i see it is for 
social contact being in cold water he also needs a lot of food 
dolphin trainer richard l trout has begun school for the young 
animal nicknamed rascal by residents 
trout who has trained the sea mammals for 15 years raps on the 
side of his boat three times to bring rascal to the surface when 
the dolphin surfaces trout tosses him a sea trout or herring 
rather than gobble the treat rascal bounces it on his nose or kicks 
it with his tail 
trout said that is a natural habit of dolphins who consider dead 
fish toys rather than food he must train rascal to stop playing 
with his food 
the decision to help rascal learn to adapt to his new 
surroundings ends six weeks of debate over his fate residents 
became concerned when he stayed in the bay while other dolphins 
headed down the atlantic coast in the fall 
rascal had become a favorite of boaters as he would swim along 
side pleasure boats and entertain residents along the shore 
federal officials approved two rescue attempts but both failed 
because of the dropping water temperatures now in the low 40s 
most of the small fish that dolphins feed on have left the bay and 
geraci said that rascal at about 250 pounds is lighter than 
normally would be expected 
federal law prohibits training or feeding of wild dolphins in 
open water but geraci said rascals circumstances made him a 
special case 
hes got none of the scars that dolphins get by wrestling and 
playing in the herd geraci said hes in good physical 
condition hes brighteyed very alert and responsive 
rascals apparent health and the fact that the animal has adapted 
to cold water in broad bay probably means the animal can survive 
until warmer weather arrives in six to eight weeks geraci said

angel dust protects the brain during 
strokes heart attacks and surgery and a safer form of the often 
abused street drug could be in wide use soon for some stroke and 
cardiac victims researchers say 
the drug known technically as pcp or phencyclidine acts as a 
stimulant and a depressant and poduces a psychological state similar 
to schizophrenia dr edward f domino of the university of michigan 
in ann arbor said sunday 
he said at least seven classes of drugs have now been found that 
have actions in the brain similar to those of pcp 
socalled designer drugs that act like pcp but are chemically 
distinct have been synthesized in illicit laboratories domino said 
at the annual meeting of the american association for the 
advancement of science 
researchers are also busy synthesizing designer versions of pcp 
hoping to find new drugs that will impart pcps beneficial effects 
without its harmful consequences 
you wouldnt give pcp on a routine basis domino said who 
expects a safer form of it could be in widespread use in as little 
as five to 10 years for stroke and heart attack victims and patients 
undergoing surgery 
also sunday dr stephen peroutka of stanford university reported 
that the banned drug known as ecstasy may have longterm 
damaging effects on the brain 
ecstasy has been described by those whove used it as producing 
warm friendly feelings peroutka has found that the drug damages 
brain cells in animals suggesting that it may do the same thing in 
humans conclusive studies in humans do not yet exist he said 
nevertheless he said recreational use should definitely be 
avoided until scientists figure out precisely how the drug works 
ecstasy is an amphetamine derivative known to scientists as mdma 
domino said the potential protective effects of pcp have been 
found in an anesthetic called ketamine which is used rarely in the 
united states but frequently used in developing countries because it 
is comparatively safe 
ketamine produces the same ill effects as pcp but they dont 
last as long and they can be controlled with certain tranquilizers 
domino said some version of ketamine might prove to be a safe drug 
to protect the brain he said 
the loss of blood to the brain even for a short time leads to 
the death of brain cells domino said 
pcp and its relatives including ketamine block the chemical 
changes associated with that nerve cell destruction domino said 
and thus prevent or limit the loss of nerve cells 
the studies of pcp are also leading to a new understanding of 
brain chemistry and may help researchers understand other disorders 
domino said

filipinos sat fixated before their 
television sets as troops poured automatic fire and rockets into a 
military camp was the target communist or moslem insurgents no it 
was the police 
later the hottest topic of newspaper and broadcast commentators 
was a report that hundreds of uzi submachine guns and galil rifles 
were being imported into a country already awash with weapons 
the importer was the house of representatives 
the two episodes illustrate the nature of philippine society 
where a westernized democratic veneer covers an often violent land 
of dodge city social norms 
they also underscore the challenge facing president corazon 
aquino in trying to build a modern progressive nation in a land 
still locked into corrupt and violent ways 
the united states which maintains six military bases in the 
archipelago nation and is committed to helping build democracy in 
the philippines has a substantial stake in her success 
president reagan this month proposed doubling aid to the 
philippines to 6494 million at a time when assistance to other 
nations is being held in check or reduced 
continued weaknesses and shortcomings in the 165000member armed 
forces were highlighted by the threeday takeover of the regional 
headquarters of the philippine constabulary in zamboanga city 560 
miles south of manila 
on jan 5 about 15 moslem policemen and their supporters angry 
over plans to charge them in a 1984 killing managed to seize 
control of the garrison and killed the commander and his chief of 
staff 
the renegades then held out for two days against a furious 
military assault by nearly 1000 troops after the government refused 
further negotiations 
by the time the garrison was secured 21 people all but two of 
them renegades were dead but the renegades leader rizal alih 
escaped to the humiliation of chief of staff gen renato de villa 
who ordered the assault 
meanwhile the regional headquarters was destroyed becoming the 
second major garrison destroyed in 18 months of military operations 
against dissident soldiers or police 
the general staff headquarters in manila was gutted during the 
august 1987 coup attempt by former lt col gregorio honasan no 
major headquarters has been destroyed in clashes with communist or 
moslem rebels since mrs aquino took office in 1986 
most manila television stations which rarely report events 
outside the capital dispatched crews to zamboanga dramatic footage 
of soldiers battling police shocked residents of the capital many 
of whom are largely insulated from violence in the countryide 
the inconclusive result is now viewed by a shocked nation as 
using a sledgehammer to swat a fly wrote columnist jesus bigornia 
in the manila bulletin 
in the aftermath of the zamboanga incident de villa has ordered 
commanders to weed out scalawags from the police and military 
ranks yet many filipinos are skeptical this crackdown on 
lawlessness in the ranks will be any more effective than those that 
came before 
last year cicero campos chairman of the national police 
commision said his agency received an average of 1500 complaints a 
year of criminal activity by some of the countrys 52000 policemen 
he admitted the figure was the tip of the iceberg and few of 
the complaints result in prosecution or dismissal 
what do the authorities do about these criminal elements 
dressed in law enforcement uniforms wrote columnist ninez 
cachoolivares in the newspaper businessworld do they wait until 
these criminal elements storm a building or an army camp before 
moving in on them 
less dramatic but equally ominous were reports in manila 
newspapers that the house of representatives was importing up to 600 
uzi submachine guns and galil rifles to provide security for its 
some 200 members 
rep renato unico a member of the house defense committee 
confirmed the reports and said the israelimade weapons had been 
ordered after the chambers security force ran away during the 
august 1987 coup attempt 
unico dubbed uzico by radio commentators said congressmen 
needed the weapons for protection during visits to remote districts 
where communist and moslem insurgents operate 
but the idea of congressional security guards wielding 
highpowered firearms paid for by tax money raised the specter of 
a return to the private armies which filipino politicians 
traditionally used to intimidate opponents and guarantee their 
reelection 
mrs aquino had promised to disband such private armies 
which were believed to number nearly 300 when she came to power 
lets face it political bouts are settled as much by blood and 
bullets as by ballots wrote the philippine daily inquirer in an 
editorial 
the newspaper malaya said the report ominously suggests that 
despite promises of a new era in philippine politics the 
political warlordism of philippine politics with all its negative 
connotations is here to stay

prime minister edward seaga who badly 
trails socialist opposition leader michael manley in opinion polls 
has set feb 9 for jamaicas first contested general election since 
1980 
seaga the reagan administrations closest ally in the caribbean 
will be seeking an unprecedented third consecutive term 
on sunday the 58yearold prime minister told a nationally 
televised rally in kingston it is time for us to settle our 
future 
during the 1980 election more than 700 people were killed in 
street skirmishes during a ninemonth campaign last august seaga 
and manley signed a peace treaty setting out a code of conduct 
for orderly campaigning 
seaga said sunday that he was calling the election to allow the 
shortest possible campaign under jamaican law 
business leaders had urged a short campaign to minimize the risk 
of unrest at the height of the winter tourist season the industry 
jamaicas main foreign currency earner is still recovering from 
hurricane gilbert which battered the island on sept 12 
manley and his leftist peoples national party boycotted the last 
election in 1983 in a dispute over voter registration that left 
seagas centerright jamaican labor party with all 60 seats in 
parliament 
in a stirring onehour speech sunday seaga berated manleys 
record and took credit for restoring political stablity economic 
recovery and international relations 
holding out his arms he told cheering supports in these 
hands your future is safe 
as prime minister during the 1970s the 64yearold manley forged 
close relations with cuba alarming the united states and foreign 
investors 
he has repeatedly called for a new election since his partys 
1980 defeat but seaga has held out to give his freeenterprise 
exportoriented policies more time to strengthen the nations 
debtridden economy under jamaicas parliamentary system a prime 
minister may call an election at any time before the end of his or 
her fiveyear term 
seaga came to power with a pledge to pull jamaica out of deep 
economic decline there have been recent signs of economic 
improvement but critics say his economic restructuring and 
austerity measures have neglected social services such as health and 
education and his popularity has faded 
opinion polls have put seagas party roughly 13 points behind the 
opposition for the past two years seaga narrowed the gap slightly 
shortly after hurricane gilbert but has since fallen back 
the centurys fiercest hurricane caused 45 deaths and an 
estimated 1 billion in damage seaga has raised 600 million in 
disaster relief from abroad but there been bickering over relief 
distribution 
during his tenure seaga has courted western governments and 
international assistance agencies and has been a staunch supporter 
of president reagan he was the first foreign leader invited to the 
white house after reagan took office in 1981 
manley also has served eight years as prime minister from 1972 
until 1980 earning a reputation as an ardent antiimperialist and 
socialist in recent years he has projected a more moderate image 
and has portrayed seaga as arrogant and lacking in compassion 
no prime minister has won more than two consecutive terms since 
universal suffrage was introduced in 1944 jamaica a nation of 23 
million people 90 miles south of cuba gained independence from 
britain in 1962

break up a banned rally by thousands of people a human rights 
activist said today 
among those detained sunday was former foreign minister jiri 
hajek said anna sabatova of the charter 77 human rights group 
hajek 75 was a leader of the 1968 reform movement that was crushed 
that year by a sovietled invasion 
more than 5000 people protested in prague streets later sunday 
to commemorate a student who burned himself to death to protest the 
invasion 
communist authorities said 91 of the most active instigators 
were detained at least one person was badly injured and several 
others including members of a west german television crew were 
beaten by police 
sabatova said about 20 prominent activists including author eva 
kanturkovs and charter 77 activists ladislav lis and rudolf battek 
were arrested before the rally as they prepared to lay flowers in 
memory of the 20yearold student 
she said they were released after several hours but it was not 
certain whether those arrested during the rally were freed 
the official news agency ctk denounced sundays rally charging 
it was instigated by western subversive centers 
in east germany on sunday police broke up a rally by several 
hundred human rights activists in downtown leipzig witnesses said 
they said police arrested about 80 people 
the demonstrators in leipzig were protesting fridays arrest of 
11 opposition activists the witnesses said on condition of 
anonymity the west german ard television network said about 500 
people took part 
the police action in prague came on a day czechoslovakia joined 
34 other countries in signing a landmark accord on human rights at 
the helsinki review conference in vienna austria 
the us ambassador to the talks warren zimmermann said 
czechoslovakias communist authorities had violated the freedom of 
assembly granted in the spirit of the 1975 helsinki accords 
in prague marchers chanted long live freedom and called for 
the release of political prisoners as they headed toward wenceslas 
square jeering at police 
whitehelmeted riot police wielding rubber truncheons some with 
leashed dogs attacked about 1000 demonstrators who had gathered at 
the square and sang the national anthem 
demonstrators were dispersed into side streets but remained 
there whistling and jeering at police 
several people were injured in beatings by police and one man 
was so badly injured that an ambulance had to be called among the 
beaten was an ard television crew a correspondent of the west 
german news agency dpa said 
ctk reported 91 arrests 
the rally was called as a tribute to jan palach who ended his 
life by setting himself ablaze in the square on jan 16 1969 
the suicide was a protest of the warsaw pact invasion the 
previous year that crushed the prague spring of liberal reforms 
thousands of shocked czechoslovaks attended his funeral 
on sunday a second protest of up to 3000 people in front of the 
school palach had attended was also dispersed activists said 
sunday marked the third time in six months that police used force 
to break up rallies in central prague attending banned rallies the 
other demonstrations took place in august and october 
state television showed brief footage of the rally and read the 
statement issued by ctk two armored personnel carriers were seen 
driving through the streets 
communist authorities on jan 6 said the rally intended by 
dissidents to be a simple and brief commemorative act could not be 
held 
but charter 77 and four other independent groups said they would 
go ahead with it anyway charter 77 plans a vigil next weekend at 
vsetaty 18 miles north of prague where palach is buried 
the body was secretly exhumed in 1973 from pragues olsany 
cemetery however it remains a site of reverence and on sunday 
dozens of people visited the site laying flowers or pressing 
candles into the soft earth that marks the spot

all four blacks on bostons school committee are 
objecting to a plan to end 15 years of courtordered busing by 
letting parents choose the schools their children attend 
the four say that unless the city commits more funds to improve 
its weakest schools the plan could send them into a tailspin of 
declining enrollments lower budgets and loss of motivated students 
and teachers 
this plan is being rushed through just to try to get out from 
under the court order committee member gerald anderson said 
sunday without a commitment of funding its not going to produce 
any real improvement in educational quality 
imposed in 1974 amid fights and rock throwing forced busing 
caused a flight of middleclass students both black and white to 
the suburbs and private schools 
boston spends about 7300 for each of its 55000 students one 
of the highest per capita figures in the nation but its dropout 
rate has doubled to about 14 percent and white enrollment has 
plunged from 60 percent to less than 25 percent effectively 
resegregating the schools 
the reality is there is virtually no middle class left in the 
boston schools said ellen guiney education adviser to mayor 
raymond flynn the overwhelming majority over 80 percent is poor 
students 
we have increased the school budget by 113 million over the 
last five years nearly a 50 percent increase and more than double 
the rate of inflation said flynn a longtime busing foe and chief 
backer of the new plan clearly money itself is not the answer 
giving parents and teachers power at the local level is the 
necessary next step 
the plan devised by two of the states leading minority 
educators would allow parents to choose which schools their 
children attend as long as there is space in the classroom and 
racial balance is maintained it aims to stimulate competition among 
schools and lure back some of the 25000 students who have fled 
the plan which may start in elementary schools next fall calls 
for failing schools to make changes and replace administrators if no 
improvement is shown in two years 
this plan says no child should be locked into a lousy school 
period said michael j alves a hispanic who formerly headed the 
state board of educations desegregation office and one of the 
plans authors he devised the proposal with charles willie a black 
professor at harvard universitys school of education 
black committee members say the plan does not provide for 
bilingual education or special needs students they also contend 
that a clause allowing all students now in special limited 
enrollment magnet schools to remain there would severely restrict 
space available in the most desirable schools 
i cant see what the value is of allowing a parent to choose 
the childs school when all the available choices are inadequate 
anderson said i think the courts have to continue to be involved 
until we can offer parents a real choice 
alves said the complexion of the magnet schools would gradually 
change as new students enter kindergarten each year 
the school committee voted 101 last month to endorse the plans 
concept anderson cast the lone opposing vote and two other black 
committee members abstained 
the one black who voted in favor juanita wade and the two who 
abstained said they would oppose the plan when it comes up for a 
final vote next month unless the mayor provides more funding

every week georgia sets a record for overcrowding 
in its prisons but officials say little relief is in sight despite 
three recent outbreaks of violence in packed cellblocks 
new prisoner totals are tallied each friday by the state 
department of corrections as of friday 18780 inmates were in the 
system 43 percent over capacity 
weve set a new record every week since the first quarter of 
1988 said department spokeswoman kathy drake were not 
expecting to appreciably reduce the problem this year 
riots erupted this month at overcrowded milledgeville prisons 
both of which were originally designed to be wards for mental 
patients at central state hospital 
in december prisoners in hall county rioted at a jail packed 
with twice as many inmates as it was intended to hold many of them 
state offenders assigned there because state prisons are full 
corrections commissioner david evans in a recent speech said its 
easy to cite reasons for overcrowding but difficult to do anything 
about it 
weve just got to address the question who do we want in 
prison because its going to be an expensive operation he said 
gov joe frank harris last week asked the legislature for 342 
million in 1990 for corrections rejecting the department of 
corrections request for 144 million for six new prisons the 1990 
budget request is an increase of 31 million over 1989 
were real disappointed said ms drake we believe the 
need is there and the need is critical with the present jail 
backlog 
harris pointed out that five new prisons and eight probation 
detention centers are scheduled to open in georgia within 18 months 
with space for 3000 prisoners but that would make only a modest 
dent in the overcrowding problem 
state rep carlton colwell a member of the house state 
institutions and property committee said he expected the governors 
1990 request to be modified likely with more money aimed at 
creating more space for prisoners 
i think were going to have to come up with something to get 
more bed space colwell said i think were going to have to 
plan on building again this year just like we have to every year 
for local jails colwell said legislation is in the works to 
provide money that counties could use to build space for prisoners 
they house for the state such facilities would be adjacent to 
county jails but would separate state inmates from local prisoners 
often an explosive mix 
were trying to get the ones counties that have the severe 
problems he said were trying to identify them and start a 
pilot program this would help them get out from under the 
overcrowding 
hall county sheriff dick mecum said such a plan which he 
supports would be a stopgap measure at best the roots of prison 
overcrowding sentencing patterns work release programs high 
levels of urban crime remain to be solved he said

china and vietnam have begun talks on the 
cambodian conflict in the first facetoface meeting of highlevel 
officials from the two countries in more than nine years 
chinas foreign ministry said today that first deputy foreign 
minister dinh nho liem of vietnam was in beijing for private 
consultations with chinese vice foreign minister liu shuqing on a 
political settlement of the kampuchean cambodian question 
neither china nor vietnam would offer further details of the 
visit which both sides apparently tried to keep secret 
liems arrival saturday was not reported by the chinese media and 
his welcoming venue was changed in an apparent effort to evade 
foreign journalists who had learned he was on a commercial flight 
from bangkok 
eastern european sources said the talks would last at least 
several days and cover the timetable for vietnams troop withdrawal 
from cambodia and that countrys political future 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in late 1978 to drive the 
prochinese khmer rouge from power claims it now has about 50000 
troops in cambodia and has set september 1989 as a target date for 
pulling out all its forces 
china says previous vietnamese withdrawals were mere troop 
rotations but has called the recent announcement of the september 
withdrawal a step forward 
the east european sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said discussions of cambodias political future will be more 
difficult 
china has called for a coalition government led by resistance 
leader prince norodom sihanouk and including both the vietnambacked 
faction of heng samrin and the khmer rouge 
hanoi wants heng samrin to have a major role in any future 
coalition government and demands guarantees that pol pot and other 
khmer rouge leaders held responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians during the khmer rouges brutal fouryear 
rule be barred from positions of power 
the sources said china also is not interested in discussing a 
visit by vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach until the vice 
ministerlevel talks achieve positive results 
china a staunch ally of vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s 
launched a 20day border war against vietnam in early 1979 to 
punish hanoi for its invasion of cambodia 
there have been no direct seniorlevel talks since and china has 
insisted vietnam must first pull its troops out of cambodia before 
normal contacts can be resumed 
china is the main arms supplier of the khmer rouge and other 
guerrilla forces fighting the vietnamese 
chinas has said cambodia is the major obstacle to improved 
relations with vietnam and that vietnam must withdraw its troops as 
soon as possible 
in august china opened direct talks on cambodia with the soviet 
union vietnams main financial backer and now says enough progress 
has been made to hold the first sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
previously china said moscows backing of vietnams occupation 
of cambodia was the main obstacle to normalization of sinosoviet 
relations 
china has also given assurances that it does not support the 
return to power of the khmer rouge and said it is willing to reduce 
its assistance to the khmer rouge and other guerrilla forces as 
vietnam pulls out 
sihanouks son prince ranariddh said last week that china had 
agreed to hold direct talks with vietnam at the urging of the soviet 
union which says it favors a vietnamese pullout

a bad situation got worse for local officials coping 
with an already jammed emergency shelter as more central americans 
poured into the city after a texas judge lifted a travel ban 
us district judge filemon velas ruling effectively allowed 
renewed waves of thousands of aliens who cross the usmexico 
border into texas to travel elsewhere while their claims for 
political asylum are being processed 
a majority of them were nicaraguans headed to miami where a 
large alien population and a reputation for helping immigrants has 
resulted in a massive influx including almost 500 since the judges 
decision a week ago according to local officials about 2000 have 
come here during the last two months 
it was a crisis before and the decision by the judge in texas 
was totally unreasonable said dade county manager joaquin avino 
the judge blocked enforcement of a government policy intended to 
curb the backlog of asylum cases in such cities as miami and los 
angeles and reduce aslyum requests from those trying to enter the 
country for economic reasons 
miami officials were quickly dispatched to texas to assess the 
situation and put out the word bobby maduro miami stadium opened 
dec 15 as a shelter for homeless immigrants is full 
elba bustos 65 arrived in downtown miami late last week after a 
31hour bus trip from texas with her granddaughter 
im so happy to be here because the situation in nicaragua is 
so bad ms bustos said wearily while waiting for her daughter 
whom she hadnt seen in three years to pick her up 
at miami stadium julio avendano who fled nicaragua more than 
two years ago waited patiently for three cousins to arrive from 
texas he hailed the texas judges decision as humane because 
immigrants had been sleeping out in the cold there 
when i came i had no one he said the first few nights i 
slept on the street 
avendanos relatives will be able to stay at his apartment but a 
number of immigrants have no family or jobs here and are counting on 
assistance from the city when theyre forced to leave the ballpark 
the stadium was packed with some 280 homeless nicaraguans at last 
count sleeping in locker rooms and underneath bleachers and eating 
donated food in a makeshift dining area set up in a dank corridor 
were booked to capacity avino said and unless they have 
a private place waiting for them we cant take care of them 
community leaders meanwhile worry that the city is being 
overwhelmed at a time when super bowl preparations are in full 
swing and some 1500 reporters were expected for the big game 
i hate to say it but because of the super bowl peoples 
energies are focused in another direction now said tom ferguson 
president of the beacon council a businessmens group 
in tallahassee gov bob martinez has called for help from the 
federal government to avert the potential impact of another 1980 
mariel boatlift which saw some 125000 cubans arrive in the united 
states 
central americans have historically set their sights on miami 
with its large hispanic population and hopes that work permits and 
jobs are easier to come by an estimated 100000 nicaraguans have 
already settled here and theres potential for another 100000 
immigrants in 1989 
still fewer work authorizations are being issued under a 
stricter review process implemented by immigration officials 
a poster taped inside the stadium read were honest people who 
want work with permission we can show you

positive thinking exercise support from 
friends and other ways of reducing stress may help aids victims slow 
the diseases progression researchers said 
but some aids researchers at the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science cast doubt on the theory 
the jury is still out said janice kiecoltglaser a clinical 
psychologist at the ohio state university college of medicine 
we encourage people infected with the aids virus to do things 
that may be helpful and certainly cant be harmful such as 
exercising getting adequate sleep and nutrition and avoiding drugs 
and alcohol said dr karl goodkin a psychiatrist at the university 
of texas southwestern medical center in dallas 
but he said sunday undue optimism that a positive outlook might 
slow progression of aids could spur people infected by acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome to blame themselves wrongly when their 
condition worsens 
within the last decade studies have shown stress can affect the 
development and course of upper respiratory infections 
mononucleosis herpes simplex rheumatoid arthritis and skin breast 
and cervical cancer 
in that light dr ronald glaser chairman of immunology at the 
ohio state medical college said its not surprising to theorize 
that psychological factors may play a role in the progression of 
symptomfree aids infection to aidsrelated complex to fully 
developed aids 
blood and psychological tests on 18 aids patients found that 
those who exercised were assertive and had lower levels of tension 
depression fatigue stress and anger also tended to have higher 
numbers of diseasefighting immune system cells according to a 
study by lydia temoshok a psychologist at the university of 
california san francisco and george solomon a ucla psychiatry 
professor 
aids cripples the immune system leaving people susceptible to 
fatal infections and cancer 
university of miami psychologist michael antoni measured various 
signs of psychological and immune system functioning among 39 
symptomfree homosexual males at various times before and after 
tests revealed if they were infected by the aids virus some of the 
men had been participating in a 10week aerobic exercise program 
while others had not 
among those who turned out to be aidsinfected the exercisers 
had higher levels of certain immune system white blood cells men 
who were better at venting their emotions and seeking social support 
also had better signs of immune system performance antoni said 
and compared with nonexercisers the exercise group suffered 
less depression anxiety confusion and bewilderment after learning 
they were infected 
goodkin studied 40 homosexual men 13 who were healthy 10 who 
were aidsinfected but symptomfree four who had aidsrelated 
complex and 13 who suffered fully developed aids 
the results showed that those who had the virus but had not 
progressed to aids had less stress in their lives more social 
support and had a more confident coping style that either the 
noninfected group or the group that had progressed to aids or 
arc the university of texas said in a news release 
goodkin said his findings suggest aidsinfected people might 
benefit from exercise relaxation training participation in support 
groups and psychotherapy that emphasizes positive thinking to 
reduce anxiety and depression 
it may even help to get infected patients to deny to some 
extent the idea of their eventual disability and death he said 
many follow that philosophy every week about 800 los 
angelesarea people infected with aids have crowded into seminars 
conducted by controversial aids counselor louise hay who preaches 
that love is the most powerful stimulant to the immune system

operators using a newlyinstalled system 
may have given the wrong signal to two trains that crashed headon 
killing at least 110 people and injuring 1000 in the countrys 
worst rail accident officials said 
about 40 people remained in critical condition today according 
to one hospital official who spoke on condition of anonymity and 
the government declared a day of mourning 
the 10car express train and sevencar mail train slammed into 
each other sunday outside the farming village of maizdi khan 
sending cars tumbling and tossing passengers into freshlyharvested 
rice paddies 
the express train was traveling at about 50 mph the mail train 
coming to a halt authorities said 
communications secretary mazurul karim estimated that more than 
2000 people were aboard the trains many of them moslem pilgrims 
he said however that people routinely ride between the cars and on 
the roofs making a precise count difficult 
rescue workers using two large cranes to pull apart the crumbled 
wreckage finished the search for victims early today and reopened 
the track karim said no bodies were found inside 
shortly after the accident senior officials of the staterun 
railroad said they suspected operators may not have known how to 
properly work a sophisticated digital signaling system installed 
five days earlier 
human failure and wrong signaling may have caused the two 
trains to come on the same track leading to the collision said 
one official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
dhaka newspapers on monday blamed the accident on human error 
the sangbad an independent bengalilanguage daily quoted 
unidentified railway officials as saying the express train ignored a 
signal to stop and allow the mail train to pass another 
bengalilanguage daily the khabar quoted witnesses as saying 
either the wrong signal or no signal failed to keep the two trains 
off the same track 
but communications minister anwar hossain disputed their 
suspicions saying more than 200 trains had traveled on the track 
since the system was installed tuesday the track on which the crash 
occurred shares north and southbound traffic so trains often must 
wait on sidings for trains going in the opposite direction to pass 
the government appointed a commission to investigate the 
collision and ordered that the panels findings be ready within two 
weeks 
soldiers fire officials and villagers pulled at least 100 bodies 
from the trains on sunday and another 10 people died at hospitals 
police and railway officials said 
at the scene sobbing relatives tried to look for loved ones 
among rows of bodies laid alongside the single track but were held 
back by police 
oh god bring brother back cried sunil daniel pressing his 
arms against his chest 
hundreds of injured were taken to hospitals at tongi five miles 
to the north and to the capital dhaka 22 miles to the south 
the government offered 3125 as compensation to relatives of the 
dead and 2560 to each of the injured 
the express train was headed north from dhaka to tongi then 
southeast to chittagong the mail train bound for dhaka had just 
stopped in tongi 
officials said many involved in the crash were pilgrims traveling 
to tongi where hundreds of thousands of moslems have gathered for 
biswa ejtema or world congregation islams largest gathering after 
the haj in mecca 
many involved in the crash were pilgrims traveling to tongi 
where hundreds of thousands of moslems have gathered for biswa

it was a big jolt and minutes later i found myself trapped 
inside a tilted coach said kohinoor begum 40 as she waited for 
treatment at dhakas pangu hospital for cuts 
prior to sunday the worst train crash in bangladesh occurred on 
jan 26 1981 near northern chuadanga and killed at least 75 
people

he was unable to swim so 15yearold 
leopoldo castillo spent his last 50 to rent an inner tube on which 
he floated across the rio grande to the united states 
i arrived with nothing with nothing said castillo who fled 
nicaragua in december to avoid being drafted into the military 
hes among the hundreds of central americans who arrive seeking 
temporary shelter and eventually a permanent home in this country 
like castillo they bring little with them but their clothes 
and like castillo theyre often still damp from crossing the rio 
grande 
despite their lack of belongings and uncertain futures sister 
juliana garcia of casa oscar romero where many of them including 
castillo stay said 
they have a lot of hope and where there is hope there is joy 
too 
brownsville and casa romero a nofrills barracks five miles from 
the border are stops on a swelling migration route through southern 
texas which the immigration and naturalization service says was 
followed last year by more than 30000 central americans seeking 
political asylum in the united states 
however the ins maintains many simply want jobs and are not 
fleeing persecution 
like most castillo is bound for points beyond texas many are 
waiting for relatives in florida to send money for bus tickets to 
miami one of the most common destinations for asylum seekers 
most stay about two weeks at the refuge said sister juliana 
the cinder block buildings have separate quarters for men and 
women and since the refuges neighbors filed suit in a bid to have 
it shut down are limited by court order to no more than 200 
residents 
demand for shelter reached a crisis in december after the ins 
adopted a policy to keep immigrants in southern texas while their 
cases were being decided homeless central americans no longer able 
to travel to their us destinations took shelter in primitive 
campsites and condemned buildings 
the largest most squalid campsite was across the street from 
casa romero 
the crisis eased last week when a judge blocked the ins travel 
restriction pending a jan 31 hearing on the policy freeing aliens 
to leave southern texas 
hundreds and perhaps thousands did for the first time in 
weeks casa romero had vacancies 
but central americans continue to flow into brownsville creating 
concern among city officials 
city manager steve fitzgibbons on friday joined florida officials 
in criticizing the federal government for failing to help local 
governments handle the burden of a booming alien population 
i have no reason to believe the people of central america will 
stop coming through here fitzgibbons said 
while many of brownsvilles estimated 100000 residents donate 
food and clothing to the aliens others worry about the changes to 
their city 
and opponents of casa romero say it only encourages illegal 
immigration 
the catholic church started casa romero in 1982 at san benito 
about 20 miles north of brownsville after people there objected 
church leaders built the new casa romero in brownsville in 1987 the 
shelter is named after the rev oscar romero roman catholic 
archbishop of el salvador who was slain in 1980

witnesses on the ground said they saw 
flames spouting from an engine of an american airlines jet that was 
forced to land minutes after takeoff with 91 people aboard 
dallasbound flight 201 took off from baltimorewashington 
international airport at 753 am sunday and returned shortly after 
8 am said american airlines spokeswoman susie robbins the 85 
passengers and six crew members were unharmed she said 
i heard this sound kind of like a cannon going off seven or 
eight times real quick said john entwistle who lives two miles 
from the runway the plane used i saw fire coming from the 
left rear engine with a lot of sparks coming out 
you saw this big cloud of black smoke coming out said dennis 
burford when it went by you saw all that fire coming out of the 
left side of the plane 
a piece of the left engine apparently came loose and a compressor 
stalled in the engine prompting the pilot to shut down that engine 
ms robbins said 
we believe something ice birds was ingested into the engine 
on takeoff she said the tower reported flames coming from the 
engine which happens a lot when something is ingested 
but faa spokesman fred farrar said late sunday afternoon that a 
foreign object being sucked into the engine would not have caused 
the malfunction known as compressor stall which the pilot reported 
as he throttled up the mcdonnell douglas md80 jetliner 
stalls can result from a disruption of air going into the 
engine farrar said and are often caused by the attitude of the 
plane on takeoff with wing position or abrupt changes in wind speed 
or direction altering air flow to the engine intakes 
ms robbins said american airlines crews in baltimore were 
replacing the left engine sunday 
passengers transferred to other flights to reach their 
destinations she said

us ambassador edward perkins 
today unveiled a bronze bust of the rev martin luther king jr and 
said the slain black americans nonviolent civil rights movement 
held some lessons for south africa 
perkins told reporters he did not tend to equate south africa 
and the united states but searching for nonviolent solutions is 
probably something worth thinking about in south africa 
perkins the first black us ambassador to south africa and 
zenos frudakis the philadelphia sculptor who made the bust 
unveiled the work under a tent on a bushy plot where a new us 
embassy is to be built 
the 125 onlookers at the gathering in pretoria included black and 
white south africans prominent in campaigns against the apartheid 
system of legalized race segregation and a lowlevel representative 
from the south african ministry of foreign affairs 
a 30member choir from the roman catholic church of st peter 
claver in mamelodi a black township near pretoria sang several 
civil rights hymns women in red headscarves and conical hats woven 
from grass mingled with darksuited diplomats 
one hymn was senatla martin luther king senatla means leader 
in the sotho language 
enos mabuza chief minister of south africas kangwane black 
homeland told the gathering there were striking parallels between 
the racial separation in south african today and segregation in the 
united states during kings lifetime a major difference he said 
was that the us constitution protects individual rights but south 
african laws protect white privilege and whiteminority rule 
mabuza said the black people in this country have realized that 
the oppressor will never voluntarily give freedom to the oppressed 
the oppressed must demand that freedom 
today was a federal holiday in the united states honoring king 
who was assassinated in 1968 the civil rights leader would have 
been 60 years old on sunday

israeli troops today shot and killed a 
17yearold palestinian during a clash with youths in the west bank 
and another teenager died of gunshot wounds suffered earlier 
military officials said 
troops elsewhere in the occupied lands forced the midnight burial 
of two palestinians slain last week and limited the number of 
relatives allowed to attend an arab reporter said the move 
apparently was designed to prevent unrest 
todays deaths increased to 359 the number of palestinians who 
have died since the uprising in the occupied territories began 13 
months ago fifteen israelis have been killed 
the high rate of casualties eight in the past four days 
brought complaints about army policies from israeli politicians from 
the left and right 
ministerwithoutportfolio ehud olmert a member of the 
rightwing likud bloc who has charge of arab affairs said today 
every arab death caused him personal anguish both israel and the 
palestinians are paying a high price for putting down the uprising 
he said on israel radio 
olmert said he favored tough measures against rioters but did 
not understand the armys policy for opening fire 
i dont think theres a lot of logic or common sense in 
shooting after a boy when hes already finished throwing his stone 
and is running away he said there must be some judgment and 
some restraint 
on sunday olmert and justice minister dan meridor accused 
soldiers of having too light a finger on the trigger the nation 
and hadashot newspapers reported 
hospital officials identified the palestinian killed today in 
hebron as radwan sbeih arab reporters said he was shot in the chest 
when youths stoned soldiers and the troops responded with fire 
a military spokesman who was not identified according to 
regulations confirmed the death and said another 17yearold 
palestinian ahmed mustafa of the khan yunis camp in the occupied 
gaza strip died today after being shot in the head saturday 
at least seven youths were wounded today in clashes including 
four from the hebron area and three in bureij camp in gaza arab 
reporters and hospital officials said military sources confirmed 
two people were wounded in hebron but had no reports of wounded 
from gaza 
masked youths ordered hebron merchants to closed their stores 
after the shootings the youths activists in the uprising called 
for a threeday strike to mourn those killed 
reports of the recent casualties spurred energy minister moshe 
shahal of the labor party to demand a report from the army on its 
use of plastic bullets the bullets were introduced to reduce the 
fatality rate but critics complain that they are doing the opposite 
in the gaza strip the army forced families to bury a 12yearold 
girl and a 17yearold man at midnight and limited the number of 
relatives attending to 15 an arab reporter said the arab reporters 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the 12yearold girl hanadi sultan died in tel hashomer 
hospital near tel aviv where she was flown for treatment after being 
shot in the head during a jan 10 protest the 17yearold ziad

presidentelect bush in a glowing tribute to 
the late dr martin luther king today pledged that as president 
that he will work to fulfill kings dreams of racial equality 
bush called the late civil rights leader an american hero 
saying he lived a heros life he dreamed a heros dreams he 
left a heros indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great 
nation 
in an address to a breakfast of the american bicentennial 
presidential inaugural afroamerican committee bush added we 
pledge once more our nations sacred honor in pursuit of his 
dreams 
noting he will be sworn in as president on friday bush signaled 
to black americans that he will be sensitive to their concerns 
what becomes of martin luther kings dreams is up to us he 
said we must not fail him we must not fail ourselves we must 
not fail the nation he loved so much and gave his life for 
i understand that five days before coming president of the 
united states of america bush added to applause from the 
gathering of some 300 black leaders 
and bush also cautioned that americans must remember not only the 
goals of king but why these were dreams and not reality 
remember the moral stain of segregation the lies it taught and 
the anguish it inflicted on the lives of black americans and on the 
conscience of the entire american people bush said 
bush said that he will work to ensure that bigotry and 
indifference to the disadvantaged will find no safe home on our 
shores and that kings dreams for the children of america will be 
fulfilled this must be our mission together it will i promise 
be my mission as president of the united states 
bush as vice president was part of the reagan administration that 
has been criticized for its civil rights record and what black 
leaders have said is indifference to their cause 
bush however has made a concerted effort to show minorities 
that his will be a much more activist presidency in terms of 
minority needs 
president reagan who has questioned the motives of some civil 
rights leaders during his eight years in office had proclaimed the 
king holiday on dec 23 in a statement that said the civil rights 
leaders work is not done but neither is his witness stilled

creating into law in 1985 and made videotaped tributes to king in 
past years he had no public appearances on his schedule today 
bush returned home sunday after a threeday fishing trip to the 
florida keys 
he caught seven varieties of fish saturday but failed to repeat 
his feat friday of pulling in a 13pound bonefish just three pounds 
off the world record for the hardfighting specimen 
one of his fishing partners fred zeder a former ambassador to

conductor daniel barenboim fired as musical and 
artistic director of the new paris opera house in a scandal of 
operatic dimensions said today his dismissal should come from the 
president of france 
it is for him to choose between my presence and that of the 
international artistic community i have gathered and the program of 
the president of a couture house barenboim said at a news 
conference 
pierre berge chairman of the board of the operabastille and 
president of the yves saintlaurent fashion house dismissed 
barenboim on friday saying he was demanding too much money 
however barenboim said today he was not prepared to abandon his 
duties 
berge responding on french television said he would not bring 
the name of president francois mitterrand into the dispute because 
it would become a political affair it is an affair of big 
bucks 
berge maintains barenboims 7million franc 11million annual 
salary over four years is too much money for the four months a year 
the 46yearold israeli conductor would spend in paris berge says 
the opera house made a counterproposal of 4 million francs 
628570 a year over two years but that it was rejected 
barenboims firing prompted threats from patrice chereau 
director of the operabastilles first production to leave and a 
host of worldclass performers including pierre boulez jessye 
norman herbert von karajan and sir georg solti sent a petition to 
culture minister jack lang saying they might cancel their 
performances 
if daniel barenboim is not maintained as artistic and musical 
director we regret to inform you that the conditions of our 
participation in this project are also subject to question the 
petition read 
boulez announced sunday he would resign his post as vice 
president of the association of theaters of the opera of paris 
headed by berge which helped to get the operabastille project off 
the ground 
i find people have acted in a completely inconsistent manner 
and now there is the most total lunacy he told radio monte carlo 
in an interview published sunday in the paris weekly le journal 
du dimanche berge said he was only 80 percent sure the opera house 
could open jan 10 1990 as scheduled 
he contended the contract dispute is based on a preliminary 
agreement signed in haste before the may elections that chiracs 
conservatives lost and claims the agreement gives barenboim too much 
power 
the government of jacques chirac totally opposed to the 
operabastille wanted to destroy it berge was quoted as saying 
but finally decided to keep it and in haste put the cart before 
the horse 
after the socialist government of premier michel rocard took 
office the opera house made a counterproposal to barenboim of about 
half the salary over two years but it was rejected berge said 
barenboim has said the matter would be settled in court 
chereau speaking on french television sunday said he would not 
participate if barenboim does not chereau is staging the opening 
performance mozarts don giovanni and is committed to two 
other productions 
the operabastille is a multimilliondollar complex on the place 
de la bastille site of the prison whose storming launched the 
french revolution the new opera house is meant to replace the 
ornate palais garnier best known as the paris opera which will be 
reserved for dance 
berge said the house in keeping with its mission of bringing 
opera to the people should provide 220 performances a year instead 
of the 150 envisaged by barenboim

a black police sergeant whose head was 
shoved through a window by a white officer says he was conducting a 
selfstyled sting operation aimed at uncovering police racism 
the encounter was secretly recorded by a camera and sound 
equipment mounted inside sgt don jacksons rental car and by other 
cameras filming from an unmarked knbctv news van and car following 
at a distance 
portions of the encounter which occurred late saturday night 
were broadcast sunday by knbc and additional excerpts were aired 
today on nbcs the today show 
jackson 30 is on stress disability leave from his job in nearby 
hawthorne he insisted that he and driver jeff hill an offduty 
state corrections officer did nothing illegal to provoke police 
you merely have to be black in the wrong neighborhood or even 
the right neighborhood jackson said we were there five 
minutes we had just gotten off the freeway 
jackson who belongs to a group called the police misconduct 
lawyer referral service said he arranged the sting after hearing 
reports of racism in long beach he added that it was fully in 
commemoration of the efforts of martin luther king whose 60th 
birthday would have been sunday 
jackson and hill were stopped by officers mark dickey and mark 
ramsey as they drove on pacific coast highway at martin luther king 
boulevard the officers claimed the 1977 buick was straddling lanes 
jackson said 
i was wearing mechanics coveralls and had intentionally smeared 
grease on my hands and face to look like i had just crawled out from 
under a car jackson said i looked dirty and i wasnt driving a 
nice car so i guess he the police officer figured they could do 
whatever they wanted 
segments of the tape showed the car never strayed over the center 
line the tape showed an officer using profanity during a verbal 
exchange with jackson who initially refused an order to raise his 
hands above his head when he finally did the tape clearly showed 
the white officer ramming jacksons head through a storefront window 
a long beach police spokesman lt mike hill denied that dickey 
who needed six stitches for a gash to his hand pushed jacksons 
head through the storefront however hill said police are 
investigating the allegations 
long beach mayor ernie kell said the arresting officer should be 
fired if an investigation determines he used excessive force 
we do not want police officers running amok in the city of long 
beach he said 
police booked jackson for investigation of interfering with 
police and challenging a police officer they set his bail at 
12000 then reduced it to 250 and finally released him on his own 
recognizance more than six hours later 
hill was issued a traffic citation at the scene and released 
jackson was involved in a controversy last february when he went 
to los angeles trendy westwood village with a group of black 
youths he was arrested after allegedly refusing an officers 
request to move along

reported rocket attack since dec 27 by moslem guerrillas who have 
advanced in the hills ringing kabul as soviet troops pull out ahead

the interior ministry of the sovietbacked afghan administration 
said the rockets landed in the citys qalyszman district an area of 
mainly mud houses 
casualties included women and children the ministry said without 
elaboration 
the guerrillas apparently suspended rocket attacks on kabul 
during the soviet withdrawal but have stepped up attacks on supply 
convoys into the capital 
on sunday soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze ended a 
threeday visit to afghanistan with a pledge to supply arms to 
president najib after the withdrawal of the remaining 50000 soviet

guerrilla news agency they have overrun two key government military 
posts in afghanistans border areas but allowed 200 food trucks 
through to the embattled capital 
combined resistance sources said the military posts were captured 
in the past week and put the guerrillas within three miles of the 
governmentheld eastern city of jalalabad 42 miles from the 
pakistan border 
there was no independent confirmation of the guerrilla news 
agencys report 
insurgents captured six tanks and 3000 weapons the agency 
claimed other guerrilla sources claimed 600 afghan army and 
militiamen surrendered 
guerrillas also claimed they have stepped up attacks near 
southeastern kandahar city the western city of herat and in 
northern provinces bordering the soviet union

trucks through to kabul last week to relieve shortages of 
commodities and fuel in kabul however reports say guerrillas 
still are attacking food convoys on a strategic highway few 
supplies are getting through 
lines for fuel and foodstuffs start in the early morning in 
kabul where prices are rising rapidly and power blackouts last 
several hours each day 
the soviets intervened in afghanistan nearly in december 1979 to 
aid the sovietallied government they later had more than 100000 
troops in afghanistan about half the soviet troops already have 
left under a unbrokered geneva accords 
moscow has been insisting members of kabuls current marxist 
regime have a role in a postwar government but the guerrillas say 
they will not share power with former foes

christian democrat who disappeared saturday as a kidnapping 
mr vanden boeynants had received threats lately and had

with vanden boeynants today he said vanden boeynants secretary 
called his office thursday to say her boss wanted to discuss a 
personal matter

reporters we have no elements to say a direct link can be 
established between the threats to mr vanden boeynants and his 
disappearance 
he said he was treating the disappearance as a kidnapping 
possibly for political reasons 
however johan vande lanotte an aide to tobback said in a 
statement so far the case is a strictly judicial matter there 
is nothing to indicate that a truly terrorist act or politically 
inspired action is involved 
three anonymous phone calls have been received claiming 
responsibility for vanden boeynants disappearance one was made 
saturday to the daily newspaper le soir and the others were received 
sunday by rtbf belgiums frenchlanguage radio network

revolutionary socialists

never entered his residence officials said they said police found 
his hearing aid pipe and one of his shoes in his garage

the reagan administration is weighing whether 
to ease nearly 3yearold sanctions barring us oil companies from 
doing business in libya an administration official said today 
while emphasizing that president reagan has made no final 
decision the official said the administration is concerned that 
continuing the prohibition actually could end up benefiting libyan 
strongman moammar gadhafi 
the official discussed the administrations thinking on grounds 
that he not be named publicly 
since mid1986 several us oil companies have been barred from 
doing business directly in libya but they have kept their assets 
including equipment there under an agreement in which gadhafi 
recognized the firms 49 percent share in the stateowned oil 
company the agreement froze the assets of five american companies 
amerada hess marathon oil wr grace occidental petroleum and 
concoco petroleum 
under that pact libya has extracted oil from the american oil 
fields paying the costs of such operations while also reaping the 
profits 
but the agreement with gadhafi expires on june 30 and some 
people in the administration have voiced concern that if the us 
government continues its ban on the american firms doing business 
there gadhafi might seize the assets thus benefiting from the ban 
the restrictions on the operations of the us oil firms were 
separate from the broad economic sanctions that reagan placed on 
libya in february 1986 in april of that year us warplanes bombed 
tripoli in reprisal for libyas alleged role in a terrorist bombing 
incident that took the life of an american soldier at a west berlin 
discotheque 
there have been new tensions between the united states and libya 
in connection with the construction of a facility that the americans 
maintain is designed to manufacture chemical weapons earlier this 
month american f16 fighter jets shot down two libyan aircraft over 
the mediterranean gulf 
its a catch22 here the administration official said 
today in a telephone interview if things remain the same 
concerning the status of us oil firms they could benefit 
gadhafi 
this official said that if the sanctions against operations in 
libya by us oil companies remain it could result in a windfall 
for gadhafi 
no decisions have been made but there has been discussion 
about easing the sanctions he said there are some problems with 
these sanctions any changes that might be made would not be 
done to ease overall sanctions on libya i can guarantee you 
that 
a lifting of the restrictions by reagan who will leave office 
friday could permit the companies to resume doing business in 
libya perhaps through subsidiaries or to sell their assets before 
the agreement with gadhafi expires 
the new york times reported in todays editions that reagan was 
expected this week to lift some prohibitions on us oil companies 
doing business in libya to prevent them from losing their assets 
there

praising the soviet union for its progress 
on human rights secretary of state george p shultz arrived today 
to wrap up the most ambitious human rights accord of the 1980s 
shultz called for the dismantling of the soviets radio jamming 
transmitters and renewed the us demand that the soviets tear down 
the berlin wall he called action on the wall one of the acid 
tests of kremlin intentions 
the secretary and other foreign ministers are in vienna to sign 
the eastwest human rights and security accord a 35nation review 
of the 1975 helsinki agreements 
the 50page document took more than two years to negotiate and 
was formally adopted on sunday it contains landmark commitments on 
human rights and sets the seal on new natowarsaw pact talks on 
conventional arms control that are due to open in vienna in march 
shultz flew to vienna from washington on his final diplomatic 
mission after 6 years as state department chief he is to speak 
tuesday to foreign ministers reviewing the vienna accord 
listing human rights improvements as his proudest achievement 
shultz credited the soviets and their east european allies with 
adopting much more open societies than they had in 1975 when 
the agreement to foster eastwest understanding was signed 
shultz told reporters as he flew to vienna that real progress 
has been made particularly in the last two or three years 
however he called on the soviets to dismantle the giant 
transmitters that had jammed western radio broadcasts for years 
late last year the soviets and their east european allies stopped 
interfering with radio liberty and radio free europe broadcasts 
jamming has stopped shultz said and we dont want to see 
it reinstituted 
therefore shultz said we think that the facilities by which 
you jam ought to be dismantled so that you cant start it up again 
the helsinki accords signed by the united states the soviet 
union canada and 32 european nations tacitly accepted the 
postworld war ii borders of eastern europe in exchange for this 
concession the soviets pledged to permit more contacts with the 
west and freer movement of people and ideas 
in helsinki shultz said the diplomacy was way ahead of 
the reality gradually the reality has moved toward what we set out 
as the objective it has a long way to go but now we have a process 
of movement 
shultz who leaves office with the reagan administration on 
friday seemed confident the incoming bush administration would keep 
pressure on moscow 
he singled out the concrete and barbedwire wall that surrounds 
west berlin keeping east germans from fleeing as an unfulfilled 
goal 
its more than a symbol it tells you by its very presence 
that you still have a long way to go shultz said 
he seemed taken aback by published reports that senior officials 
in the new administration had questioned president reagans decision 
to hold a human rights conference in moscow in 1991 
the decision taken on shultzs recommendation was based on 
several steps taken by the soviets including the release of more 
than 600 political prisoners the reunification of more than 100 
families and increased jewish emigration 
i certainly havent heard a word from anyone in the bush 
administration shultz said its obviously a question of some 
judgment 
he said that by setting conditions for the soviets to host the 
conference including guaranteed free access by all soviet citizens 
we managed to help along the process quite a bit 
shultz said the conference was a chance to bring the human 
rights message right into the hearts of the soviet union and had 
been endorsed by andrei sakharov the prominent soviet human rights 
activist and physicist

looking for a tax break want to amend the 
constitution find it impossible to sing the starspangled 
banner tired of those truckers who use a radar detector to roar 
unmolested through speed traps 
who you gonna call try your member of congress if the first two 
days of the 1989 session are any indication he or she will 
introduce a bill on just about any subject 
during those two days house members introduced at least 504 
bills and 139 resolutions senators wont start introducing 
legislation until the senate reconvenes jan 20 
the most popular subject was taxes scores of tax bills of one 
variety or another were offered almost without exception they would 
cut taxes the only increases proposed would hit imported oil 
offered by rep glenn english dokla snuff and chewing tobacco 
rep brian donnelly dmass and deductions for corporate 
takeovers rep byron dorgan dnd 
social security bills were offered by the dozens and most would 
restore benefits that congress took away during the reagan era 
several would permit recipients to earn unlimited wages without 
losing part of their benefits 
there are proposed constitutional amendments galore they would 
outlaw abortion allow organized school prayer spell out equal 
rights for women prohibit busing repeal the twoterm limitation on 
presidents limit a president or senator to one sixyear term and a 
house member to three twoyear terms and prohibit a president from 
pardoning a person who had not been convicted 
whats more just about every house member seems to have proposed 
or signed a bill to block the pay raise recommended by president 
reagan for members of congress and other top government officials 
if history is a guide chances are that fewer than a dozen of the 
504 bills will become law its a pretty good bet that the bills 
blocking the pay raise will not be among them 
the bills address virtually every problem that a member of 
congress might have heard mentioned during the recent campaign 
thus they provide a handy guide to what lawmakers are thinking 
about here are some samples

a divorced former public relations executive with neither a 
college nor a seminary degree stands on the verge of giving women 
entry into a twomillenium tradition dating to jesus christ 
the rev barbara c harris who held the cross when the first 
women were illegally ordained priests in the episcopal church in 
1974 is expected this week to gain official approval as the first 
woman bishop elected by a church that believes in apostolic 
succession or that the leadership of the church can be traced to 
the apostles initially commissioned by christ 
its far more than an election its really an embracing of the 
feminine spiritually and that is going to be a monumental change 
said the rev eleanor lee mcgee an assistant professor of pastoral 
counseling at yale divinity school 
but while the other branches of the worldwide anglican communion 
and major ecumenical partners such as the catholic church which 
also believes in apostolic succession weigh the consequences of a 
woman bishop the discussion in the united states has focused on the 
qualifications of the particular woman involved 
i know many people in the church who believe in the ordination 
of women but who are appalled by this and feel it does the 
movement no good said the rev andrew mead rector of the 
episcopal church of the advent in boston 
the episcopal diocese of massachusetts elected harris suffragan 
or assistant bishop in september under church law the election 
requires approval from a majority of standing committees and the 
bishops leading the 118 dioceses in the united states 
after the committees gave their approval ballots were sent 
earlier this month to the bishops a majority are expected to 
approve her election as early as wednesday paving the way for a 
consecration already scheduled feb 11 in boston said the rev 
james solheim a spokesman for the massachusetts diocese 
the episcopal church approved the ordination of women in 1976 
two years after the ceremony in which the philadephia 11 were 
ordained in the church of the advocate where harris was 
associate rector prior to her election in boston other women have 
been candidates for bishop but harris was the first to win election 
harris who has declined interviews until she receives official 
approval said in a sermon last year that her election gives new 
hope and new vision to hundreds of thousands who have felt 
left out of the denomination 
but her election also drew unusual opposition approving locally 
elected bishops normally is quite perfunctory but at least 30 
of the 118 dioceses have already voted against her approval solheim 
said 
while her gender assures harris a place in religious history 
that is only one of many firsts for her 
at least three bishops are said to lack a seminary degree but 
harris appears to be the only bishop without an undergraduate 
college degree in any field 
and in a church struggling to uphold marriage in a nation with 
the worlds highest divorce rate she is thought to be the first 
bishop elected after a divorce though bishops have divorced while 
in office 
in the debate over her election in the united states gender was 
noticeably absent 
some moderate voices within the church such as h boone porter 
of the living church an independent national church magazine 
headquartered in milwaukee objected to harris lack of a formal 
education and fulltime parish experience 
harris was ordained a priest in philadelphia in 1980 after a 
career in corporate public relations in addition to her parish 
work she also recently headed the episcopal church publishing co 
which produces the liberal church magazine the witness she studied 
theology through correspondence courses and with tutors 
the issue that has troubled people in the pews some pastors say 
is her divorce dont we need encouragement by the chief pastor to 
stay faithful mead said his parishioners have asked 
others question the validity of the charges raised against harris 
to put it bluntly barbara was different said the rev james 
lewis director of social ministry for the diocese of north 
carolina where the standing committee twice voted against approving 
her election basically they were reflecting what weve had in 
this church a basic white gentlemans club 
for women who fought the early battles along with harris to 
remove sexual barriers to the priesthood the arguments being raised 
against the pioneer bishop who is also black sound all too 
familiar 
with racism and sexism i always expect there is going to be 
difficulty but im always surprised in the way it surfaces said 
ms mcgee there would have been issues raised no matter who it 
is 
the rev patricia cadwallader took a traditional route to the 
episcopal priesthood attending seabury western theological seminary 
at northwestern university when she went before the standing 
committee of the diocese of ohio seeking ordination she recalled 
one member saying if you were menstruating on the altar then the 
blood would not be only the blood of christ it would be your 
blood 
now she sees the same thing happening to harris 
when you dont like someone or dont like something you grab 
at straws said ms cadwallader who left the episcopal church to 
become a presbyterian minister i think theyre grabbing at things 
not to like about her i think shes a giant of a woman

with a 25 million los angeles mansion 
symbolizing the elegance of comfortable retirement ronald and nancy 
reagan will remain active after his presidency writing memoirs 
making speeches and pushing pet causes 
the reagans have set themselves up for a lifeafterwashington 
that will afford them the luxury of relaxing either at the bel air 
home or a mountaintop ranch in santa barbara county or enjoying the 
attention of friends on the southern california social scene 
reagan will receive an annual pension of 99500 for his service 
as president and around 29100 in a california pension for his 
time as governor there in 196775 mrs reagan receives no 
government pension 
no president since dwight d eisenhower has left washington with 
such a high relative political standing and this ensures that 
reagan will be inundated with requests to appear on the 
mashedpotato circuit as he calls it 
i can assure you he wont be like thomas jefferson and have 
to sell his library to congress for 25000 to keep the farm at 
monticello said milton jaques director of the national news 
speakers bureau here 
reagan has said that hes eager to return to california but has 
indicated that his departure from the nations capital will be 
somewhat bittersweet hes said for instance that he will very 
much miss those who have worked with him 
but the reagans have made no secret of their desire for a quieter 
life with more privacy 
much of the reagans activities aside from planned travels 
around the country and overseas will be in relatively easy access 
of the ranchstyle flagstone mansion in a residential area that is 
home to a host of hollywood celebrities both reagans have offices 
in the fox century plaza office complex which is only about a 
15minute drive 
reagan can look forward to completion of the ronald reagan 
presidential library in simi valley between the los angeles home 
and his ranch in the santa ynez mountains while mrs reagan plans 
to spend time occasionally at the nancy reagan center for drug 
abuse which is to be in the san fernando valley closer to the city 
reagan recently quipped that as soon as i get home to 
california i plan to lean back kick up my feet and take a long 
nap 
but those who know him say that reagan plans to remain very 
active his jokes about retirement notwithstanding he has served 
notice of several specific plans 
i think ill be out on the mashedpotato circuit again 
extolling the virtues of lineitem veto and balanced budget 
amendment he told students at the university of virginia in 
charlottesville last month 
somebodys talking to me about doing a book he said one 
time and there are some backstage stories that i might enjoy 
getting out 
mrs reagan who has bristled over tellall books such as the one 
written by former white house chief of staff donald t regan has a 
contract with random house to publish her memoirs 
the reagans seem sure to be much more visible in retirement than 
their predecessors jimmy and rosalyn carter former president 
gerald r ford gets many speaking invitations and serves on various 
boards of directors but reagan could be even a bigger draw on the 
lecture circuit 
peter flaherty who is in the process of folding the tent of 
citizens for reagan a private group organized early in reagans 
presidency to lobby for reagan programs said the other living 
presidents left office unwillingly reagan goes out a winner 
hell be out speaking to the public and therell be plenty of 
people paying big money to see him said flaherty whose 
organization at its height had some 100000 members 
said larry sabato a political science professor at the 
university of virginia hes going to be inundated with speaking 
engagement requests i suspect hes going to rival presidentelect 
bush as the principal fundraiser for the republican party 
i would say his plate is going to be very full indeed 
sabato said of reagan 
jaques said that bigticket speakers have drawn as high as 
32000 although usually the maximum is 25000 and said that 
reagan will be able to pick and choose 
there is a president who is willing to speak and youve got a 
lot of people with a lot of money who want to impress people he 
said im sure that he wants to enjoy his retirement and take a 
few wellselected engagements

the senate opens a spate of confirmation 
hearings tuesday on presidentelect bushs new cabinet with a tough 
task seeking to pin down secretary of statedesignate james a 
baker iii a master tactician on complex issues from ussoviet 
relations to central america 
democrats on the foreign relations committee will be trying to 
corral baker on how the united states will deal with the problems in 
ceremendous experience in dealing with congress and is seen as 
likely to tiptoe cautiously through his answers without making firm 
commitments 
baker will duck every substantive question predicted one 
democratic aide involved in preparations for the two days of 
hearings who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
but such reticence is unlikely to cause problems with 
confirmation and bakers name is expected to be among the first 
wave of appointments approved when the full senate opens for 
business on jan 25 
baker has made the rounds of committee members in recent weeks 
carefully cultivating members of the committee and telling them 
what they want to hear according to one aide 
for example he has told conservatives to expect no sudden 
changes from reagans policies in central america but has told 
liberals that the new administration will emphasize diplomacy 
rather than military aid to the nicaraguan rebels both sides will 
likely seek to get those pledges on the public record at the 
hearings and to make them more specific 
they also will be looking for pledges of bipartisanship on 
foreign policy the current secretary of state george shultz is 
respected in congress but criticized for his relative lack of 
consultation with key lawmakers its one thing to not want 
congress to lead in foreign policy and to insist on your 
prerogatives but its another thing to ignore congress entirely 
said an aide to one committee democrat 
confirmation hearings for other cabinet nominees will follow in 
quick succession and bushs choices of experienced moderate 
pragmatic figures for most posts means the process should offer 
debate on substantive issues rather than the ideological arguments 
of the reagan years 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has said he is 
impressed with the appointees as a group and expects the senate to 
work well with them 
they are generally experienced hopefully pragmatic people and 
we wont have the rigid ideology of the first reagan term 
mitchell said i am trying very hard to establish from our side an 
atmosphere of cooperation and bipartisanship 
the democrats who control congress are likely to use the sessions 
to force bushs nominees to say how they will carry out their boss 
campaign promises to tend to neglected social programs in a time of 
extreme fiscal austerity and to test the strength of bushs 
nonewtaxes pledge 
they will want to build a record for why new revenues are going 
to be needed said charles cook a washington political analyst 
the democrats are going to let the nominees build their case for 
them 
rejection of a presidential cabinet nominee is rare since the 
birth of the republic just eight cabinet appointees have been voted 
down by the senate which has the power to do so under the 
constitution the last instance came in 1959 when president 
eisenhowers choice for commerce secretary lewis l strauss was 
rejected on a 4946 vote 
the senate labor committee will hold a confirmation hearing on 
thursday for elizabeth dole as labor secretary and the governmental 
operations committee holds a hearing the same day on richard g 
darman as bushs budget director 
with darman senators will be looking for clues about the new 
administrations budget priorities and how it will address the 
deficit specifically they will be probing for whether bushs 
promise not to raise taxes might have loopholes that would provide 
revenues to finance pet programs 
in the next few weeks attention will focus on hearings for 
former sen john tower bushs choice for secretary of defense 
robert mosbacher to be commerce secretary former rep jack kemp 
to head the department of housing and urban development samuel 
skinner transportation louis w sullivan health and human 
services clayton yeutter agriculture former rep edward j 
derwinski veterans affairs former rep manuel lujan jr interior 
and retired adm james d watkins energy 
other appointees of cabinet rank include carla hills who had 
been hud secretary in the ford administration as trade 
representative and former education secretary william bennett as 
drug czar 
three current cabinet members attorney general dick thornburgh 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and education secretary lauro f 
cavazos are holdovers in the new administration and will not 
require new senate confirmation

guerrillas made their first rocket 
attack on kabul in nearly three weeks monday hitting a residential 
district with four missiles that killed four people and wounded 
nine officials reported 
one killed a 15yearold girl who was walking in a graveyard 
residents of the area said 
western diplomats in embassies near the road to the airport said 
they heard eight rockets land it was the first reported attack 
since dec 27 by moslem insurgents who have moved into the hills 
around the capital as soviet soldiers leave afghanistan to meet a 
feb 15 deadline 
an interior ministry statement said the rockets hit the qalyszman 
district a neighborhood where most houses are built of mud it said 
casualties included women and children but did not elaborate 
guerrillas have increased pressure on supply convoys bound for 
the capital 
on sunday foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet 
union ended a threeday visit with a pledge of arms supplies to the 
government after the remaining 50000 soviet soldiers are gone 
shevardnadze implied the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled 
and said his government believes the army of president najib can 
cope with the insurgents on its own 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and use border towns and refugee camps in pakistan to which 
millions of afghans have fled as bases and supply points they are 
supported by pakistan and the united states 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and were 
estimated to number 115000 when the withdrawal began may 15 under 
an agreement mediated by the united nations 
moscow has insisted that communists have a role in a postwar 
government but the guerrillas refuse and broke off talks with 
kremlin representatives jan 6 
an insurgent news agency in islamabad pakistan said monday 
guerrillas had overrun two military posts in the border area but 
allowed 200 food trucks through to kabul 
it said the posts were captured in the past week and put the 
guerrillas within three miles of jalalabad a governmentheld city 
42 miles from pakistan 
there was no independent confirmation of the report which said 
insurgents captured six tanks and 3000 weapons guerrilla sources 
claimed 600 afghan soldiers and militiamen surrendered 
guerrillas also claimed to have increased attacks near kandahar 
in the southeast herat in the west and in northern provinces on the 
soviet burder 
their news agency said about 200 supply trucks were allowed into 
kabul last week to relieve food and fuel shortages reports in the 
capital however said insurgents continued to attack highway 
convoys and few supplies were reaching the city 
lines for food and fuel begin to form in early morning prices 
are rising rapidly in kabul and power blackouts last several hours a 
day

the man who made the pledge of allegiance and 
willie horton frontburner issues in the 1988 campaign will bring 
the same tough style of politics to the republican national 
committee 
as lee atwater describes it its just a matter of making the 
committee more issueoriented 
democrats take a lessbenign view 
lee atwater is probably the most evil man in america said 
democratic rep pat schroeder of colorado shortly after the 
election 
if we have to sink to their level to protect democracy and to 
break them of sucking eggs then im perfectly willing to do it 
said texas democratic party chairman bob slagle the day 
presidentelect bush designated atwater as his choice for republican 
party chairman 
in a recent interview atwater laughed off the opposition jibes 
theyre running around now it looks to me saying theyre 
going to be tougher on me than we ever were he said maybe 
well be the ones complaining the next time 
i think thats their problem he went on they dont 
understand that voters are not concerned with campaign personalities 
and campaign tactics 
atwater was bushs 1988 campaign manager on election day with 
no doubt about the outcome of the race between bush and democrat 
michael dukakis bush and atwater went jogging during their run 
bush offered atwater his backing to succeed frank j fahrenkopf jr 
as party chairman 
that backing is enough to make the choice unanimous when rnc 
members elect their new chairman two days before bush takes office 
at 37 atwater has worked on three presidential campaigns his 
relationship with bush began in 1973 when bush was party chairman 
and atwater was national director of college republicans a 
22yearold from newberry college in south carolina who was wound as 
tight as a mickey mouse watch 
the preppy party chairman who grew up in greenwich conn and 
the raspyvoiced country boy from south carolina hit it off 
atwater recalled that back in those days i thought to myself 
the two things id like to do in politics was manage a presidential 
campaign one day and be chairman of the party one day 
in his temporary office on the 10th floor of the bush transition 
headquarters atwater is a study in motion a leg bouncing up and 
down as he outlined his plans to revamp the rnc 
he said his goals are to sharpen the committees campaign 
capabilities launch an outreach program to attract more blacks 
hispanics asians and handicapped voters to the gop and to promote 
the interests of bush 
bush will be the first president who had experience as his 
partys chairman he served under a republican president richard 
m nixon who regarded the committee as a minor appendage of the 
white house 
that perception is likely to change markedly during the next four 
years 
during the reagan presidency it always was clear that the 
political direction came from white house aides such as lyn nofziger 
and ed rollins not the party chairman 
at one point when the white house wanted to exercise 
extraordinary control over party affairs paul laxalt the nevada 
senator and a close personal friend of reagan was named general 
chairman a post that emphasized the political impotence of 
fahrenkopf 
no such arrangement seems possible under atwater whose political 
ties to bush are stronger than those of any white house aide with 
the possible exception of chief of staff john sununu 
atwater describes himself as a good nuts and bolts 
politician and he intends to bring that skill to the rnc 
weve got to target very early and weve got to be somewhat 
brutal in our targeting he said in elections over the next two 
years 
control of the redrawing of legislative district lines to conform 
with the 1990 census is a major goal of both parties and the 
democrats approach that process with a big edge 
in 28 states democrats control both legislative chambers while 
republicans have total control in only eight party control is split 
in 13 states and nebraska has a unicameral nonpartisan 
legislature 
of the nations 50 governors 28 are democrats and 22 republicans 
atwaters approach will be to identify congressional and state 
legislative districts offering the greatest opportunity for gains 
and concentrate rnc resources there 
we have a bigger cadre of people in our party that have 
downtoearth campaign experience he said and he is recruiting 
them to oversee critical areas 
outreach to minorities was the other high priority political goal 
mentioned by atwater 
i am convinced affirmative action did work over the last 25 
years and we now have a larger black middle class than weve ever 
had he said as it continues to grow thats fertile ground for 
us because we are the party of the middle class 
but what most politicians in both parties will watch is whether 
atwater brings the same slashing tactics to the rnc that he used so 
effectively in the last presidential campaign 
there are clear issues that separate these parties he said 
and i intend to keep those issues in the forefront 
does that mean voters havent seen the last of willie horton a 
convicted murderer who escaped while on furlough and brutalized a 
maryland couple and the pledge of allegiance 
were not going to go back on furloughs or the pledge he 
said then pausing a moment if we could get away with it we 
would

gov michael s dukakis said monday he will order 
an end to excutive branch purchases from companies tied to 
whiteruled south africa 
from this point forward the message will go out loud and clear 
from at least one state government that we are not going to do 
business with people who do business with that government and that 
country dukakis told a martin luther king day breakfast audience 
in a speech to about 2000 activists and community business and 
government officials dukakis recalled king said whatever affects 
one directly affects all indirectly 
apartheid is an affront to humanity everywhere and 
massachusetts will raise its strong proud voice for liberty for 
justice for democracy whenever and wherever we can 
dukakis said he would sign the executive order friday at least 
four other states michigan maryland rhode island and north 
carolina have barred state purchases of goods and services from 
companies with ties to racially segregated south africa 
in 1983 massachusetts became the first state to pass legislation 
divesting its state pension fund holdings in companies operating in 
south africa 
since then members of the legislative black caucus have promoted 
a bill that would also end state purchase of goods and services from 
companies that deal with the south african government the bill 
passed the house in 1987 and 1988 but died in the senate 
while the caucus continues to push for the bill it also sought 
out dukakis support for the executive order said rep byron 
rushing the bills prime sponsor 
im sorry that we havent been able to pass the legislation 
yet but i think this is a good step in the right direction 
rushing said 
the executive order isnt as broad as the legislation affecting 
only executive branch purchases it will not affect the legislature 
the courts or quasipublic agencies such as the massachusetts port 
authority 
it also is subject to withdrawal by dukakis successor in two 
years 
according to the administration the order will not result in any 
significant cost to the commonwealth however it could affect about 
200 companies nationwide with a total of 21 million in state 
purchasing contracts 
companies with south african ties that are sole providers of 
goods and services would be exempt

secretary of state george p shultz will 
mark the end of his 6year diplomatic career with a speech tuesday 
that mixes praise for the soviet union with a call for continuing 
reforms 
shultz is in the austrian capital to mark the end of a 27month 
review of the helsinki agreement a 35nation accord in 1975 that 
proposed to reduce eastwest tensions and promote democracy 
the final document reinforces the human rights message and also 
urges all nations to keep their guard up against terrorism 
shultz praised the vienna accord adopted sunday on his way to 
vienna from washington in turn he earned rare praise from the 
soviet communist party newspaper pravda as one of the architects of 
the recent upswing in sovietus relations 
the often stodgy party daily drew an unusually warm and human 
picture of shultz depicting him as a gourmet father of five who 
enjoys tennis golf and ballroom dancing 
a congressional delegation in vienna to monitor developments 
joined shultz in praise of what has been accomplished in the soviet 
union under president mikhail s gorbachev 
we ought to be optimistic said the chairman rep steny 
hoyer dmd the most optimstic of us would not have preicted the 
progtress that has cpoccurred 
he cited a dramatic reduction in the number of soviet 
political prisoners rising emigration and the reunification of 
families 
still hoyer criticized the gross intimidation of 
demonstrators in prague czechoslovakia on sunday and said the 
congressional oversight group was aware of about 130 cases of people 
held in soviet mental institutions and jails who may be political 
victims of trumpedup charges 
the state department credits the soviets with more than 600 
releases but hoyer said we havent reached zero 
sen mark hatfield rore said the declaration adopted sunday 
adds another step to the recognition of changing attitudes in 
eastern europe 
sen james mcclure ridaho said it would be harder to fend off 
western inquiries into human rights abuses by saying this is an 
internal affair 
the accord sets down for the first time a mechanism allowing 
western governments to raise human rights issues on a bilateral 
level with any east bloc nation at any moment 
shultz praised the soviets for gradually implementing the 
promises held out by the helsinki agreement 
real progress has been made particularly in the last two or 
three years he said 
but shultz also called on the soviets to take at least two 
specific steps to maintain the momentum 
he wants the jamming transmitters silenced by gorbachev last year 
dismantled so that jamming of western radio stations cannot resume 
and he described the berlin wall which fences out east german 
from fleeing to west berlin as one of the acid tests of soviet 
performance 
until that wall comes down its just there shultz said 
and its more than a symbol 
reflecting on his long diplomatic career shultz said the 
things i feel best about had to do with the area of human rights 
he said the one incident that always sticks with me is the day 
i had a phone call from ida nudel saying im home i still tingle 
a little as i think of it 
mrs nudel a longterm jewish dissident emigrated last year 
from the soviet union to israel after shultz pressed her case with 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
these things that have a human scale to them i think probably 
for most people are the ones that you get the greatest and deepest 
good feeling about shultz said 
pravda singled out human feelings in its article on shultz who 
leaves office this week 
foreign policy is made by real people it said and its 
fair to say that one of the architects of the turn in 
sovietamerican relations was shultz 
here the realism of shultz expressed itself as well as his 
sober recognition that in the nuclear age the selfpreservation of 
our two countries could be guaranteed only by the means of 
dialogue 
shultz established working constructive relations with 
shevardnadze pravda noted he did a lot

students who cut class at miriam waltzers 
school could end up behind bars 
the choice is clear learn or go to jail says waltzer a 
criminal court judge who got tired of seeing young defendants who 
couldnt read the legal paperwork in front of them 
her solution turn her courtroom into a classroom 
what i noticed was that the defendants got younger and younger 
and less and less educated i realized that i had the power to put 
them on probation and make education part of the terms of that 
probation the judge said 
since most had been expelled from school she couldnt send them 
back there 
so waltzer started what she calls the probation education program 
pep with classes in her courtroom run by volunteer tutors the 
program which she supervises started in may and now has an 
enrollment of two dozen students ages 17 to 27 
before the students tackle their first assignment each is tested 
to determine how much he or she knows 
most of these people dropped out of school in about the ninth 
grade but what weve found is that most of them are on a second or 
third grade level academically waltzer said 
once class starts the rules are simple study and dont cut 
class 
one unexcused absence means a weekend in jail two and the 
student is off probation and in prison for those who stay out of 
trouble the five years probation ends as soon as the student earns 
a high school diploma 
its tough that lady doesnt let you slip up said charles 
carter 26 who has been a student in the program from the 
beginning sometimes youve been working and youre tired and you 
dont want to come but you have to i like it though i like the 
reading anyway i dont like the division and english but im 
learning it too 
carter convicted of drug possession said he hopes to get his 
diploma this spring and enter barber school 
roosevelt thomas 21 convicted of carrying a concealed weapon 
said he would like to go to college and perhaps become a lawyer 
thats what my mama wanted me to be i got a lot of court 
experience already he joked 
once hes earned a high school degree thomas said he also has 
another goal in mind 
i want to be like these fellows he said nodding toward the 
tutors bent over students around the big courtroom i want to come 
back here and teach some other people i want to help someone else 
learn this stuff 
waltzers program can handle no more than 30 students at a time 
she said although many more could benefit from it 
i could really put people in the program like crazy nobody 
knows how to read or write anymore she said 
the judge said she would like to see the louisiana legislature 
require and fund a program such as hers in the meantime she 
scrounges for the money needed for books and other materials the 
program is funded solely by contributions 
what is so nice is that we can really turn these people around 
we can give them a chance she said its not much but for most 
of them its more than they ever got before

businesses and residents 
have filed 11 million in damage claims against the federal 
government from fires that raged through yellowstone national park 
and surrounding forests last summer forest officials say 
us forest service officials are processing the more than two 
dozen claims which will be passed on to us general counsels 
office said arlene bateman who is handling claims filed through 
the forest services region ii office in missoula mont 
the government attorneys will then review each claim to determine 
whether negligence or nature caused the damage bateman said last 
week decisions on claims could be months away she said 
more than 700000 acres of the 22 millionacre park were 
blackened last summer and fall when a dozen fires burned throughout 
yellowstone the forest services policy to allow fires started by 
nature to burn unless they threatened lives property or historic 
sites generated enormous controversy that has still not been 
resolved 
bateman is processing 16 claims totaling 525000 stemming from 
the storm creek fire which burned south from custer national forest 
in montana into yellowstone residents of cooke city and silver 
gate mont were forced to evacuate 
among the claims are requests for restitution for damage to 
cabins and fences a motel an outfitting camp a water system and 
timber and grasslands said bateman 
similar claims totaling 573000 from fires in shoshone national 
forest are being reviewed in the forest services denver office 
those stem primarily from the loss of 10 mobile homes in a 
subdivision northwest of cody 
one outfitter is claiming 18000 in losses of income and 
supplies said betty chisholm who processes claims for the forest 
services rocky mountain region based in denver

us ambassador edward perkins 
unveiled a bust of the rev martin luther king jr on monday and 
suggested south africa could learn from the civil rights leaders 
philosophy of nonviolence 
perkins the first black us ambassador to south africa 
acknowledged important differences between the two countries but 
searching for nonviolent solutions is probably something worth 
thinking about in south africa he said 
perkins joined zenos frudakis the philadelphia sculptor who made 
the bronze bust in unveiling it under a tent at a pretoria site 
where a new us embassy is to be built 
the event coincided with a federal holiday in the united states 
honoring king who was assassinated in 1968 he would have been 60 
years old sunday 
the 125 onlookers at the bust unveiling included black and white 
south africans prominent in campaigns against apartheid and a 
lowlevel representative from the south african ministry of foreign 
affairs 
a 30member choir from the roman catholic church of st peter 
claver in mamelodi a black township near pretoria sang several 
civil rights hymns women in red headscarves and conical hats woven 
from grass mingled with darksuited diplomats 
one hymn was senatla martin luther king senatla means leader 
in the sotho language 
enos mabuza chief minister of south africas kangwane black 
homeland told the gathering there were striking parallels between 
the racial separation in south african today and segregation in the 
united states during kings lifetime a major difference he said 
was that the us constitution protects individual rights but south 
african laws protect white privilege and whiteminority rule 
mabuza said the black people in this country have realized that 
the oppressor will never voluntarily give freedom to the oppressed 
the oppressed must demand that freedom 
perkins participated later in a ceremony at the us consulate in 
durban where representatives of two feuding black political 
organizations held hands during the singing of we shall overcome 
archie gumede copresident of the banned united democratic 
front held hands with frank mdlalose a member of the inkatha zulu 
political group and a health minister in the kwazulu black homeland 
government supporters of inkatha and the udf have been fighting 
each other in the natal province townships for more than 18 months 
resulting in more than 1000 deaths 
standing in the consulate garden overlooking the indian ocean 
perkins read most of kings letter from a birmingham jail 
blacks in the audience of about 200 murmured sympathetically at 
kings description of police assaults on blacks

an official human rights commission that has helped 
free 400 religious prisoners last year has been unable to break a 
wall of silence around soviet psychiatric hospitals its chairman 
said monday 
fyodor burlatsky a journalist who heads a soviet commission 
reviewing human rights cases was praised by foreign counterparts on 
the eastwest conference on human rights for winning freedom for 
nearly every religious prisoner held in a soviet prison or labor 
camp 
but burlatsky had to admit that despite our exhaustive efforts 
we have failed to receive information on what happened in 
psychiatric hospitals in the past or currently 
lacking expertise his committee helped foreign psychiatrists 
visit the hospitals but they have been unable to draw clearcut 
conclusions he said 
psychiatric hospitals once under the control of security 
officials have been transferred to the ministry of health and 
managers are being replaced he said still his committee is taking 
issue with two entire categories of mental diagnosis social 
delusion and slowgoing schizophrenia 
i think these two can be found in many members of the public 
he said dryly 
just two hours before burlatsky spoke at the news conference an 
editor of the unofficial publication expresskhronika called the 
associated press to report one of its staff members had been 
detained by police and taken to a moscow mental hospital 
vladimir ryabakon said contributor vyatislav dikterov was being 
held in psychiatric hospital no 1 dikterov won government 
attention in august by writing to the defense minister to refuse 
being drafted into the red army on religious and political grounds 
ryabakon said he said he had no idea what prompted the detention 
monday 
last week the head of the soviet psychiatrists society told 
tass there are no patients in mental hospitals in the ussr 
who are there for political reasons georgy morozovs statement 
came the day after moscow dissidents said it was a continuing 
problem 
overall the western leaders of the eastwest conference had 
strong praise for their soviet counterparts 
virtually all of the 400 people on a list of prisoners presented 
to the soviets when the eastwest conference was created a year ago 
have been freed said patrick cormack a conservative member of the 
british parliament cormack said he expects similar results on the 
list of 30 names he brought to this weeks meeting 
we live in a magic time of progress on both arms control and 
human rights said rev theodore hesburgh president of the 
university of notre dame committee members said hundreds of 
thousands of bibles are entering the soviet union unimpeded 
rosalynn carter wife of former president jimmy carter and 
cochairman of the conference with burlatsky said she wants to see 
the soviet union create legal guarantees of human rights and that 
does appear to be happening 
mrs carter said the eastwest conference was unique in that it 
began with each participant criticizing his own nations human 
rights situation she said she pointed to us problems with 
homelessness unemployment and racial discrimination 
as his three priorities for his own nation burlatsky named 
religious freedom first in practice and then in law legal 
protection of human rights and legalization of unofficial citizens 
groups 
burlatsky said he hopes the soviet union will pass a law 
guaranteeing freedom of relgion this year but he added that the 
first draft has a major problem he said it is being written by 
bureaucrats with no contribution from religious believers and 
predicted dozens hundreds thousands of amendments before it is 
finished

paris opera act 2 daniel barenboim insists that 
president francois mitterrand decide whether he should be fired as 
musical and artistic director by a lord of fashion who happens to 
be the operas chairman 
mondays key scene the noted conductor tells a news conference 
it is for him to choose between my presence and that of the 
international artistic community i have gathered and the program of 
the chief executive of a couture house 
i am unwilling to have a chief executive of a fashion house 
tell me who can sing what role decide if pierre boulez is capable 
of conducting an orchestra or whether we have the right to invite 
herbert von karajan 
pierre berge chairman of the operabastille and president of the 
yves saintlaurent fashion house dismissed barenboim on friday on 
grounds he wanted too much money 
barenboim said monday he had not received official notification 
of his dismissal and would continue with difficulty as musical 
and artistic director of the operabastille currently under 
construction 
agence francepresse the french news agency quoted sources 
close to barenboim later as saying a letter from berges about the 
dismissal was handdelivered to the conductor it said the letter 
was dated jan 14 saturday 
berge has said the dispute could delay the first opera production 
at the operabastille scheduled for jan 10 1990 
if barenboim goes so might patrice chereau director of the 
first production along with musical talent including boulez jessye 
norman von karajan and sir georg solti who have expressed 
solidarity with barenboim and threatened to leave if he does 
trouble has been brewing for weeks at the hightech music 
complex it pits barenboim the argentineborn israeli conductor and 
concert pianist who has led the orchestre de paris for 15 years 
against berge the financial wizard behind yves saintlaurents 
fashion empire 
according to berge paying barenboim 11 million a year for four 
months spent in paris is unreasonable he says the opera made a 
counteroffer of 628570 a year for two years to replace the 
original fouryear contract but it was rejected 
berge was appointed by the socialist government formed last 
year barenboim received his post from the previous conservative 
government 
the culture ministry broke its silence monday night and issued a 
statement supporting berge it said his mission is to assure that 
the objectives set by government authorities since 1982 are 
respected to create a modern national opera popular and meeting 
the highest artistic demands 
it said berge acted in the context of two guiding principles 
the independent management of the establishment and respect for 
budgetary constraints imposed by public authorities berge made 
choices that appeared to him to best assure the opening of the 
bastille opera 
barenboim 46 told his news conference earlier it is 
abhorrent to me to treat a cultural problem as a political problem 
but it has become one 
the contract i signed in july 1987 was under a different 
government but the president is the same and thats why hes the 
only person who can make the choice 
i am unwilling to have a chief executive of a fashion house 
tell me who can sing what role decide if pierre boulez is capable 
of conducting an orchestra or whether we have the right to invite 
herbert von karajan 
responding on french television berge said he did not want to 
involve mitterrand it would become a political affair he said 
it is an affair of big bucks 
money said barenboim was not his guiding force and he 
would willingly take a salary cut of 20 percent he also said the 
contract requires him to be in paris seven months a year not four 
these lies and halftruths are unacceptable he declared 
another point of contention involves the number of performances 
each year 
an opera house that will cost more than 400 million and is 
intended for the widest possible audience should provide 220 
performances says berge thats not realistic says barenboim 
you cannot possibly expect a new building to start off 
functioning like a 50 or 100yearold institution barenboim 
said adding that he hoped to get the operabastille up to 
cruising speed in three to five years 
when it opens the operabastille will be the only opera house in 
paris and the ornate old palais garnier the paris opera which will 
be reserved for dance 
carlos ott of canada designed the glassy boatshaped structure 
which dominates the place de la bastille and is one of several 
architectural projects mitterrand hopes will improve the eastern 
part of the city

president reagan is considering executive 
action to relax a prohibition on american oil companies doing 
business in libya an administration official said monday 
this official discussing the possibility of such a move before 
reagans term ends at midday friday said administration officials 
are concerned that retaining the ban would have the effect of 
helping libyan leader moammar gadhafi to eventually seize the firms 
assets 
its a catch22 here said the official declining to be 
named publicly if things remain the same concerning the status 
of us oil firms they could benefit gadhafi it could result in a 
windfall for gadhafi 
in a move that was related to broad economic sanctions imposed 
against libya nearly three years ago but which wasnt a direct part 
of those punitive measures reagan signed an order which forbade 
five american firms from extracting oil in the african nation 
in the wake of that order however the five firms signed an 
agreement with gadhafi in which the libyan leader in effect froze 
the firms 49 percent interest in the libyan state oil company 
while continuing to use the us installations paying the costs of 
operations and reaping the profits 
that agreement with gadhafi expires on june 30 and us oil 
industry officials have said they fear that unless the prohibition 
on american operations is eased the libyan strongman will declare 
the contract violated and seize the us assets 
no decisions have been made but there has been discussion 
about easing the sanctions the administration official said 
there are some problems with these sanctions any changes that 
might be made would not be done to ease overall sanctions on 
libya i can guarantee you that 
the 1986 agreement froze the assets of the five american 
companies amerada hess marathon oil wr grace occidental 
petroleum and conoco petroleum 
don herring a spokesman for marathon said the company had no 
information about the administrations plans 
weve had no word on it from any state department officials 
he said 
herring said company chairman david roderick had said last month 
that marathon would be interested in returning to its libyan 
operations if the oil restrictions were lifted 
a lifting of the restrictions by reagan could permit the 
companies to resume doing business in libya perhaps through 
subsidiaries or thirdparty connections or they could sell their 
assets before the contract expires said the the new york times 
which initially reported the story in monday editions 
reagan recently renewed the overall program of economic sanctions 
imposed against libya in february 1986 in april of that year he 
authorized a us fighter jet attack on tripoli in reprisal for 
libyas alleged role in a terrorist bombing incident in west 
germany an american soldier was killed in the discotheque bombing 
in west berlin 
there have been new tensions between the united states and libya 
in connection with the construction of a facility that the americans 
maintain is designed to manufacture chemical weapons earlier this 
month american f16 fighter jets shot down two libyan aircraft over 
the mediterranean gulf

former ugandan dictator idi amin is 
unwelcome at his homeinexile in saudi arabia arab diplomatic 
sources said monday 
his nagging desire to recapture power in kampala has 
embarrassed his saudi hosts and put his african sympathizers on the 
spot said a riyadhbased arab ambassador who insisted on 
anonymity 
amin 61 slipped out of saudi arabia earlier this month and 
surfaced jan 10 in zaire on a false passport with one of his sons 
ugandas government has demanded his extradition probably to 
appear before a presidential commission investigating atrocities 
under previous regimes 
amins wife and 22 of his children still are in the saudi red sea 
port of jidda but he finally has alienated his hosts by traveling 
to zaire on false documents 
idi amin has gone too far this time stretching the rules of 
saudi hospitality to the limits said the arab ambassador he 
has been quietly looked upon as persona non grata and wont be 
allowed to return 
zaire refused to have amin and sent him to senegal to catch a 
flight to riyadh but saudi officials barred him from boarding the 
plane and the senegalese returned him to kinshasa the capital of 
zaire 
his predicament has drawn no public comment from saudi officials 
the master sergeant who became one of africas most ruthless 
dictators was ousted from his east african nation in april 1979 he 
gained political asylum in saudi arabia in 1980 after libyan leader 
col moammar gadhafi refused to harbor him 
amin emerged from relative obscurity in 1981 to unveil to the 
associated press his plans to conquer uganda he said he was 
grateful to saudi leaders for accommodating him and his family in a 
jidda villa the saudis also gave him a monthly allowance two cars 
and a telephone 
this was on the understanding he keep a low profile shun the 
press and quit politics but according to sources close to amin 
the dream of retaking power has haunted amin 
amin apparently believed saudi arabia would use its oilgenerated 
clout to reinstate him as president of uganda 
saudi arabia maintained cordial ties with successive governments 
in uganda which has known nearconstant civil war since its 1962 
independence from britain 
amins frequent outbursts against ugandan administrations 
obviously embarrassed the saudis 
he abused the telephone and his monthly bills frequently ran 
up to tens of thousands of riyals dollars with calls to his 
followers in african capitals and press reporters in arab and 
european countries said a saudi businessman with government 
connections when the school in jidda complained about amin not 
paying his childrens school fees the saudi government hastened 
to foot the bills 
two years ago the saudis disconnected the telephone 
despite saudi obstruction amin would sneak out of his villa for 
interviews with western reporters at downtown hotels 
he often boasted in interviews of his services to islam and 
claimed he converted more than 6 million ugandans to islam only 6 
percent of ugandas 15 million people are moslems more than 60 
percent are christians and the rest are animists 
some press reports on his eightyear tyranny during which tens 
of thousands of his political opponents and innocent civilians were 
killed alleged the dictator practiced cannibalism the reports 
never were verified 
do i look like a cannibal he once said in an interview 
no i am not im a good moslem and will live and die a good 
moslem im a poor man without any money

george bush is an optimist when it comes to 
domestic matters 
he has pledged to do what needs to be done in the battle against 
aids provide better care for the unborn children of the pregnant 
poor give the homeless a roof over their heads and lead the 
legislative battle against acid raid 
and oh yes he wants to be the education president 
all without raising taxes 
read my lips the man who becomes president friday said in 
accepting his partys nomination last august no new taxes 
when george bush finds a problem demanding solution he often 
looks for answers that spring from his thousand points of light 
the efforts of volunteers plus state and local initiatives or at 
least for ones that dont involve new federal bureaucracies 
the next president who during the campaign named an aids 
researcher as his personal hero has said that if more resources 
are needed for the fight against the deadly virus he will provide 
them 
poor women are bearing babies with little or no prenatal care 
make the states cover them under medicaid with washington splitting 
the bills he advises 
what about the homeless fully fund a twoyearold law to give 
the homeless emergency shelter grants health care programs and 
educational opportunities 
the environment bush calls himself an environmentalist from way 
back has appointed a conservationist to head the environmental 
protection agency and promised to hold a global conference by years 
end on the environment he has said he will send congress tough 
legislation to curb acid rain 
education bush has proposed at least 600 million in new 
education aid including 500 million for a program to reward 
schools that achieve excellence in educating poor children 
beyond that he plans to bring all the nations governors 
together soon for a summit on education with university presidents 
and other educators 
bush has also promised an allout war on illicit drugs vowed to 
name judges with a little more compassion for the victim than the 
criminal and has said the rules governing the admission of 
illegally seized evidence into court should be relaxed 
he also has promised to build more federal prisons doubling 
capacity by the mid1990s at a cost of hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
he has proposed spending 22 billion on tax credits and other 
support for child care primarily targeted at lowincome families 
the next president as he campaigned for the white house pledged 
to help firsttime homebuyers by allowing then to get a federal 
housing administration mortgage with as little as 1000 down 
for the poor bushs choice as secretary of housing and urban 
development jack kemp has promoted the issuance of vouchers 
making private housing more affordable and tenant takeover of 
public housing projects 
rather than expanding medicare to help the elderly meet the 
staggering cost of nursing homes the instincts of george bush the 
optimist will be to tinker with the tax code to provide incentives 
for people to arrange their own longterm care insurance either 
through group plans or by converting their individual retirement 
accounts 
while bush and ronald reagan another optimist share a 
conservative instinct that washington doesnt always know best the 
next president does not harbor the hostility toward government that 
has been a hallmark of reagans political career 
bush the son of a financer who gave up wall street for the 
senate had public service instilled in his genes he walked away 
from the oil fields of texas two decades ago with only a modest 
fortune to pursue that goal first representing houston in congress 
then serving as ambassador to the united nations envoy to china and 
director of the central intelligence agency

hungarian defense minister ferenc karpati interviewed by the 
associated press in budapest after groszs comments declined to set 
a date for the partial withdrawal of the estimated 62000 soviet 
troops in hungary

as part of a worldwide reduction of red army forces by half a 
million men in the next two years 
in prague czechoslovakia on monday soviet ambassador vladimir 
lomakin announced that one soviet division would be withdrawn soon

north korea on monday accepted a 
proposal from rival south korea for their prime ministers to lead 
the highest level military and political talks since the korean war 
the north and south should remove the state of tension which is 
driving the same people toward disaster and prepare a firm 
foundation for peaceful unification north korean prime minister 
yon hyung mok said in a letter agreeing to the proposal from prime 
minister kang younghoon of south korea 
koreas peninsula still faces the threat of war and tension has 
to be defused said the letter 
it proposed a feb 8 meeting of vice ministers at panmunjom truce 
site to work out terms for the talks no date was mentioned for the 
main talks and the two sides are expected to have problems agreeing 
on terms 
observers consider a major diplomatic breakthrough unlikely as 
long as north korean leader kim il sung remains in power kim 
ordered the 1950 north korean invasion of the south that started the 
war 
yons sometimes caustic letter repeated north koreas call for 
separate threeway talks with south korea and the united states on 
reducing tension the north also demanded an end to annual south 
koreanus team spirit military exercises and accused 
washington of planning a nuclear war 
it is obvious to everyone that the north and south cannot 
fundamentally resolve the question of peace by setting aside the 
united states which is the party responsible for the aggravation of 
tension the letter said 
south korea and the united states have rejected threeway talks 
saying negotiations should be between the two koreas the united 
states has 42000 troops based in the south under a mutual defense 
treaty against the north 
south korean officials have warned that north korea wants to use 
the talks to secure withdrawal of the us forces 
in his letter monday the north korean premier said the proposed 
talks also should focus on halting largescale provocative 
military exercises 
talks between legislators from the two sides ran into trouble 
last month after the north suddenly demanded an end to south 
koreanus military exercises the demand came as the two sides 
appeared close to agreeing terms for parliamentary talks on a 
nonaggression pact 
lawmakers are due to meet again next month 
us and soviet forces divided the korean peninsula in 1945 when 
they ended japans occupation at the end of world war ii 
the two nations have clashed since then and keep hundreds of 
thousands of heavily armed troops along the 150mile border the 
frontier is sealed and there are no communication links except a 
single hot line 
south korea agreed last month to north koreas call for 
highlevel political and military talks and proposed prime ministers 
head the delegations to make the discussion the most important since 
the war

president reagans budget planners have 
suggested that states assume some of the cost of fighting fires on 
federal lands a proposal that could cost states millions of dollars 
in forfeited revenue from timber and mineral leases 
it was not immediately clear whether the bush administration will 
adopt the suggestion which was outlined in the interior 
departments proposed fiscal l990 budget releases last week 
the budget calls for the development of a permanent federal 
firefighting fund of 1665 million so that in the years to come the 
department will not have to seek extra money from congress or pay 
the bill in subsequent years 
the departments fiscal 1990 budget for example includes a 
request for 145 million to pay for part of the firefighting costs 
at yellowstone national park last year 
a similar fund would be established in the agricutlure department 
which funds the forest service firefighting programs officials said 
the firefighting would be funded from receipts received by the 
government from timber and mining activities on federal land 
according to estimates the firefighting fund would reduce those 
total receipts in fiscal l990 by about 18 percent 
states and local governments share those receipts with the 
interior department 
to states and local governments the establishment of a 
firefighting fund would mean a loss of more than 84 million as a 
result of a reduction in their share of the mineral and timber 
revenues according to interior department estimates 
the proposal requires congressional approval and is likely to 
meet resistance from some western states whose officials argue that 
the federal government should assume the costs of fighting fires on 
federal land

cambodian rebels have challenged vietnams 
assertions it is removing its forces from cambodia and claimed hanoi 
has sent 40000 more soldiers disguised as local troops according 
to a letter released monday 
in the letter to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
resistance representative thiounn prasith said vietnam had tricked 
the international community into believing it is pulling out its 
soldiers after 10 years of occupation 
the letter was released the same day china announced it had begun 
talks with vietnamese officials in beijing on the cambodian 
conflict they were the first facetoface meetings of highlevel 
officials from the two countries in more than nine years 
vietnam had said it would withdraw 50000 of its approximately 
140000 troops from cambodia also called kampuchea by the end of 
1988 it says it will pull out all its forces by late 1989 or early 
1990 
however thiounn prasith wrote that vietnam instead sent in 
14500 fresh troops in december alone and a total of 40000 new 
soldiers from junedecember 1988 
the hanoi authorities have never stopped sending new 
reinforcements now dressed up as khmer soldiers of the phnom penh 
puppet regime he said 
the sending of these reinforcements shows clearly that the 
hanoi authorities have not withdrawn their troops from kampuchea 
he said their claim concerning the withdrawal of 50000 troops 
from kampuchea is actually a propaganda ploy aimed at deceiving 
world public opinion he said 
the united nations recognizes the threeparty resistance 
coalition called democratic kampuchea as legitimate 
representative of cambodia rather than the hanoiinstalled 
government in phnom penh thiounn prasith is the resistances un 
ambassador 
he said vietnam actually intends to occupy cambodia forever 
calls to vietnams un mission went unanswered many foreign 
missions closed monday to observe the birthday of us civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and the following year 
ousted the khmer rouge government which had led a reign of terror 
that left at least 1 million people dead 
the current resistance is a coalition of the khmer rouge 
noncommunist forces of the khmer peoples national liberation 
front and followers of former cambodian leader prince norodom 
sihanouk 
china has called for a coalition government led by sihanouk and 
including the khmer rouge and the vietnambacked faction of heng 
samrin cambodias president

uprising started more than 13 months ago fifteen israelis also have 
died 
last month the number of wounded palestinians reached a record 
monthly high of 492 and 26 died israel television said it said the

plastic or rubber bullet fire at stonethrowers even when they are 
fleeing 
cabinet minister ehud olmert a member of the rightwing likud

a terrible price from israel 
olmert who is in charge of arab affairs for the government said 
he favored tough policies against rioters but added when i get 
up in the morning and hear an arab boy has been killed i dont get 
up with it well i dont sleep with it well 
he called for troops to use judgment and restraint in putting 
down demonstrations 
israeli newspapers reported that other ministers discussed army 
policy at a cabinet meeting sunday 
moshe shahal of the leftleaning labor party reportedly demanded 
an account on plastic bullets israeli troops began using the 
ammunition in august in an effort to reduce fatalities but the 
bullets have caused a number of deaths 
inquiries at palestinian hospitals monday meanwhile showed that 
four of the 10 most recent deaths were from a new type of rubber 
bullet introduced to halt rioting by stonethrowing arab youths

yunis refugee camp in the gaza strip 
according to arab reports rioting broke out in the camp monday 
over mustafas death and eight people were wounded when soldiers 
opened fire

when masked youths organizers in the palestinian uprising ordered 
a threeday strike to mourn victims of the violence 
in the gaza strip families guarded by a military patrol buried a 
12yearold girl and a 17yearold boy just after midnight an arab 
reporter said he said the army ordered the midnight burials to 
avoid palestinian protests

the bodies of hundreds of iranian 
political prisoners executed in recent weeks have been discovered in 
mass graves the main iranian opposition group said monday 
the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors said more than 
94 people alone had been executed in abhar west of tehran in the 
past few weeks 
the claim came in a statement to the associated press in cyprus 
from the groups headquarters in baghdad iraq there was no 
independent confirmation 
the group has said that more than 12000 political prisoners have 
been executed since august a united nations report in november 
estimated that 1100 prisoners had been executed since august 
the londonbased amnesty international human rights organization 
earlier said it believed more than 300 people had been executed 
since july and that the total could run into the thousands 
iran has denied such reports but has said that scores of 
convicted drug smugglers and unrepentant dissidents have been 
executed in tehran the nations capital and other cities 
the mujahedeen quoted witnesses as saying prison guards dug a 
large trench near a road in the northern province of gilan and in 
one night buried several truckloads of bodies 
the statement accused tehrans revolutionary prosecutors office 
of secretly burying a large number of execution victims near an 
armenian cemetery on a road north of the city the graves were too 
shallow and stray dogs unearthed some of the bodies which revealed 
the site to passersby the statement said 
the group also claimed that a large number of victims have been 
buried in trenchs in tehrans sprawling behshatezahra cemetery 
in the central city of isfahan prison guards have been taking 
the bodies of executed prisoners in batches of 100 60 and 40 to 
a city cemetery for burial in mass graves the mujahedeen said 
to avoid public attention prison guards dressed as cemetery 
employees loaded the bodies on buses whose seats had been removed

research into the link between type a 
behavior and heart disease suggests that the real killer is anger 
not impatience 
in a study to be published in psychosomatic medicine researchers 
described a followup of 118 students who took a personality test 
during law school twentyfive years later 20 percent of those who 
had scored in the highest quarter on the hostility scale had died 
compared with 5 percent of those who had scored lowest 
the research showed that being paranoid or neurotic or avoiding 
social contact were not associated with heart attacks instead 
those at high risk tend to harbor a cynical mistrust of other 
peoples motives get angry often and openly express their 
displeasure rather than holding it in

thirtynine percent of a group of 
professional baseball players were found to use snuff or chewing 
tobacco regularly and nearly half of the users had lesions inside 
their mouths researchers said 
a 16person dental team examined ballplayers during spring 
training in arizona last year and found that of those who used 
smokeless tobacco at least weekly 46 percent had oral lesions less 
than 2 percent of nontobacco users had such lesions 
samples of tissue taken from some of the lesions showed they were 
not cancerous but some are likely to develop into cancer 
longterm use of smokeless tobacco which increases the risk of 
cancer of the mouth also increases the likelihood of high blood 
pressure heart disease ulcers and cancer of the digestive system

blind people may find their growing independence threatened by 
computer graphics scientists said monday 
a gazeoperated computer keyboard that lets paralyzed people use 
their eyes and brain waves to write talk move their wheelchairs 
and turn on appliances also could be commercially available to the 
disabled within a few years the researchers said 
details of several new computerized devices to assist the 
disabled were outlined during the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science so were some problems

positive thinking exercise support from 
friends and other ways of reducing stress may help aids victims slow 
the diseases progression researchers said 
according to a new study blood and psychological tests on 18 
aids patients found that those who exercised were assertive and had 
lower levels of tension depression fatigue stress and anger also 
tended to have higher numbers of diseasefighting immune system 
cells 
some aids researchers cast doubt on the theory saying that undue 
optimism that a positive outlook might slow progression of aids 
could spur people infected by acquired immune deficiency syndrome to 
blame themselves wrongly when their condition worsens

angel dust protects the brain during 
strokes heart attacks and surgery and a safer form of the often 
abused street drug could be in wide use soon for some stroke and 
cardiac victims researchers say 
the drug known technically as pcp or phencyclidine acts as a 
stimulant and a depressant and produces a psychological state 
similar to schizophrenia 
dr edward f domino of the university of michigan in ann arbor 
says the potential protective effects of pcp have been found in an 
anesthetic called ketamine pcp and its relatives including 
ketamine block the chemical changes associated with nerve cell 
destruction and thus prevent or limit the loss of nerve cells 
ketamine produces the same ill effects as pcp but they dont 
last as long and they can be controlled with certain tranquilizers 
so some version of ketamine might prove to be a safe drug to protect 
the brain domino said

a cuban man who inadvertently 
deported himself and his family from the united states on a short 
sightseeing trip nearly a month ago said monday the family may be 
forced to seek refugee status in canada 
us immigration officials refused to allow the family back into 
the united states on dec 23 after they falsely claimed us 
citizenship officials say the family has a record of immigration 
fraud 
if they us immigration officials do not change their minds 
then we have no choice but to apply for asylum said carlos 
fajardo whose family has been stranded in a niagara falls ontario 
motel since dec 23 fajardo said he would apply on behalf of his 
family 
fajardo his wife bermaida 33 and her two children yoandys 
12 and yordalys 9 crossed into canada to see part of niagara 
falls and were refused entry back into the united states 
canada issued the family a tourist visa that expired sunday 
canadian immigration officials now say fajardo will have to apply 
for asylum soon or leave the country 
up until this point the problem has been between them and the 
us government albert opatovsky manager of the canadian 
immigration service office in niagara falls said monday now they 
become our concern 
opatovsky said an immigration inspector was to interview the 
family monday afternoon a date for an immigration hearing could be 
set this week he said 
fajardo 39 said he still wants to return to his home and boat 
building business in miami he said he does not want to move to 
canada he was adamant about not returning to cuba 
benedict ferro district director of the immigration and 
naturalization service in buffalo said sunday that fajardo is 
believed to have illegally entered the country in 1985 from panama 
and mrs fajardo was ordered deported last summer 
ferro said fajardos application for asylum in the united states 
was pending when he crossed the border the application was 
nullified when he entered canada he said applicants for asylum 
must stay in the united states until their status is determined 
ferro said the woman was stopped by immigration inspectors in 
1986 when she illegally entered the united states with false 
venezuelan papers 
she might not have been deported yet but only because this was 
a lowprofile case for us he said 
ferro also raised new questions about the family 
he said fajardo may have an 18yearold daughter and a wife 
apparently his first wife living in the united states mrs 
fajardos first husband also may be living in the united states he 
said 
they both have extended families apparently all in the united 
states and they may be all illegally here and maybe thats why 
nobody can petition for them ferro said 
the couple claims to have gotten married last october or november 
but immigration officials cant find a record of it ferro said 
he said that despite the pleas of hispanic groups and us sen 
bob graham dfla he would not issue a humanitarian parole to 
allow the family to return to its home 
to do that would be a slap in the face to the hundreds of 
thousands of people who are attempting to enter the country 
lawfully he said

dexter the robot hand helps deafblind 
people listen and a talking glove lets deafmutes speak but 
blind people may find their growing independence threatened by 
computer graphics scientists said monday 
a gazeoperated computer keyboard that lets paralyzed people use 
their eyes and brain waves to write talk move their wheelchairs 
and turn on appliances also could be commercially available to the 
disabled within a few years the researchers said 
details of several new computerized devices to assist the 
disabled were outlined during the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science so were some problems 
voice synthesizers and braille word displays gave blind computer 
users full competitiveness within most educational and employment 
settings during the 1980s said lawrence scadden director of the 
electronic industries foundations rehabilitation engineering center 
in washington 
but increased use of graphically displayed information may 
threaten newly acquired independence and productivity for these 
individuals he added 
unlike the code used to transmit letters and numbers the method 
by which sophisticated computers draw pictures charts and even 
text on display screens isnt readily converted into braille or a 
computers synthesized voice said scadden who is blind 
he urged the industry to develop machines to let the blind hear 
or feel such information 
dexter a fivefingered robot hand to help deafblind people 
hear may be commercially available next year for under 5500 
said codeveloper deborah gilden with the smithkettlewell 
rehabilitation engineer center in san francisco 
the mechanical hand is able to translate information 
originating from a keyboard modem computer or closedcaption tv 
decoder to hand and finger motions that correspond to the onehand 
fingerspelling alphabet said david jaffe of the palo alto 
veterans administration medical center which helped develop dexter 
a deaf person listens to dexter by placing his or her fingers 
against the mechanical fingers each of the robot hands positions 
represent a single letter 
stanford university engineer james kramer said he is seeking a 
manufacturer for his talking glove which will cost about 1500 
and let deafmute and deafmuteblind people speak by using their 
fingers to spell 
wires lead from the glove to a microcomputer which match the 
persons finger motions to letters of the alphabet a speech 
synthesizer converts the letters to spoken words that come from a 
small speaker hanging from a deaf persons neck kramer said 
hearing people can respond by typing on a handheld computer 
keyboard which then can send the words either into a braille 
display worn on a blinddeafmute persons belt or into a small 
display screen a sighted deafmute can wear like a wristwatch 
smithkettlewells erich sutter developed the gazecontrolled 
keyboard for people who are so paralyzed or disabled they can move 
little more than their eyes 
with electrodes attached to or implanted in the scalp the 
paralyzed person stares at a screen that is divided into rectangles 
each containing a letter number or common word as the paralyzed 
person stares at the desired letter or word a variety of tiny 
lights also flash in the rectangle for every letter or word the 
lights create a unique electrical wave pattern in the persons brain 
the electrodes feed those brain waves to a computer which 
converts them back into words which then can be displayed on a 
screen synthesized into a voice or used to move a wheelchair dial 
a phone or turn on lights radio television and heat gilden said 
jaffe said a new wheelchair lets the paralyzed steer by making 
slight head motions that are detected by an ultrasound 
distancemeasuring machine the disabled persons head becomes like 
the joystick control on a video game he said adding the 4000 
wheelchair should be in production soon 
a new federal law will provide limited money to help some 
disabled people acquire such hightech machines but they and their 
relatives must work for programs to make the devices more widely 
available said jacquelyn brand of the national special education 
alliance

unless the nation affirms its commitment to 
equity and excellence in education for minorities the american 
dream will turn into a nightmare the national education 
association president warned monday 
mary hatwood futrell leader of the 19 millionmember nea since 
1983 said education reforms should be extended to all students 
regardless of race or economic level 
by 2020 minorities will comprise 35 percent of the students in 
public schools she said 
these are the citizens whose taxes will support us the 
citizens who can make the future tax base of america expand or 
contract the citizens who will determine our place in the global 
economy she said in remarks prepared for delivery to about 75 
educators at a conference on the recruitment and retention of 
minority students in teacher education 
unless we as nation affirm our twin commitment to equity and 
excellence the american dream will turn into a nightmare that mocks 
the ideals of the constitution converting the challenge of reform 
into the tragedy of reform she said 
futrell said an educational system has been created that 
provides one student with an education that can be redeemed at a 
university while another student gets an education that does no 
more than indicate four years of attendance in a high school 
while the minority student population will increase the number 
of minority teachers in public schools is expected to drop from the 
current 8 percent to 3 percent in the mid1990s she said 
futrell said a lack of minority teachers will threaten the 
education system because it deprives minority students of positive 
role models and gives whites a distorted view of the world 
she also said academic standards should not be diluted to attract 
minorities into education calling that belief a residue of 
racism 
futrell noted a study by district of columbia anthropologist 
signithia fordham in which students at a predominately black 
washington high school were found to be limiting their academic 
success so their peers wont think they are acting white 
she said teachers have to do something to ensure that our 
children dont think this way and said schools should develop 
courses and programs aimed at helping build selfesteem 
during a news conference she said disparities in funding for 
rich and poor school districts are a problem nationwide 
most states have put reform on the back burner because of lack 
of funding she said 
futrell said teacher salaries should be increased to prevent the 
drain of talent to other professions she said the nea is seeking an 
average annual starting salary of 25000 compared to the current 
17000

police defused a mail bomb that arrived monday at 
the israeli embassy in london the embassy said officials would not 
say who may have sent it 
foreign office minister william waldegrave returned from a 
meeting with yasser arafat in tunis and said the palestine 
liberation organization should be given a chance to prove its 
peaceful intentions 
relations between britain and israel are under strain because 
israel rejects british suggestions for a new moderate approach to 
the plo since arafat the plos chairman publicly renounced 
terrorism last month 
the embassy press office said the parcel contained explosives 
and was addressed to the ambassador yoav biran 
police were called to the mission in kensington palace gardens 
west london after a small device was received there in the 
mail scotland yard reported but it did not give further details 
it did not say where the bomb was defused 
such attempts on israeli diplomats in london have been rare in 
the 1980s 
in june 1982 ambassador shlomo argov was shot and wounded as he 
left a dinner at a london hotel three arabs of the terrorist group 
led by abu nidal were convicted sentenced to prison 
israel criticized waldegraves meeting friday with arafat the 
first between britain and the plo at such a high level he is to 
visit israel next month 
after his return monday waldegrave said the plo has said it 
wants to lay down its arms and form a democratic civilian state 
and now surely we should give them the chance to prove that what 
they say is sincere 
he said it was vital to calm the totally understandable 
anxieties of the israelis and assure them nobody is going to 
desert or leave them in the lurch 
no attacks on israeli targets by palestinian groups under 
arafats control have been reported since the palestine national 
congress which acts as the plo legislature issued a palestinian 
declaration of independence nov 15 that included implicit 
recognition of israel

a few blocks from the bridge where a national 
voting rights law was born in bloodshed three black men took an 
oath of office monday ending 112 years of white political domination 
of dallas county government 
we bring home to dallas county the harvest of the martin luther 
king voting rights act said us district judge uw clemon the 
first black federal judge in alabama as he administered the oath of 
office to the members of the new dallas county commission 
the three black commissioners erskine minor dl pope and 
perry varner were sworn in along with two white commissioners 
deans barber and doug morrow 
until monday no black had served on the commission since 
reconstruction but under a redistricting plan approved after 10 
years of legal battles blacks won control of the fivemember 
commission in a special election last month 
some 300 people sang the battle hymn of the republic during 
the ceremony in a packed county courtroom 
the ceremony coincided with alabamas state holiday for both 
confederate gen robert e lee and the slain civil rights leader 
who led the 1965 selmatomontgomery voting rights march the march 
took place with federal protection after a band of wouldbe marchers 
were beaten and routed by mounted state troopers on the edmund 
pettus bridge which crosses the alabama river at selma 
bloody sunday drew national attention to the next march led 
by king which helped inspire passage of the 1965 federal voting 
rights act 
that act was conceived on the streets of your town it became a 
national commitment on the edmund pettus bridge said james p 
turner who investigated the violence in 1965 and is now acting head 
of the justice departments civil rights division 
barber a white commissioner said he expected the racially mixed 
commission will move selma and dallas county forward in a 
progressive manner 
the county with a population of 55000 is about 56 percent 
black but blacks had not been able to muster a voting majority due 
to low voter turnout during the old atlarge voting system the 
redistricting plan drawn up by the justice department created five 
districts two of which have large majorities of blacks 
i suspect there is no place on this planet that is more 
identified with dr king and his quest for american justice than 
right here in selma alabama said turner at a reception after the 
swearingin i predict that some day students of modern history 
will point to selma alabama as 20thcentury americas cradle of 
democracy where people of all races began to live dr kings dream 
of brotherhood

three african national congress 
guerrillas including a senior leader were sentenced monday to 
prison terms of up to 23 years for land mine explosions that injured 
eight people 
all three could have been sentenced to death they turned toward 
supporters in the gallery at the pretoria supreme court and gave 
clenchedfist salutes before they were led away 
a 20year sentence for treason was issued to the most prominent 
defendant ebrahim ismail ebrahim 51 who was abducted from 
swaziland in 1986 by men he said were south african agents 
ebrahim of indian descent has been widely described as the 
highestranking official of the mainly black anc to go on trial 
since nelson mandela and several colleagues were given life 
sentences in 1964 the anc is the largest guerrilla group fighting 
the whitedominated government 
one of ebrahims black codefendants mandla maseko received a 
23year sentence for treason simon dladla a swazi citizen 
received 12 years for terrorism he could not be found guilty of 
treason because he did not owe allegiance to south africa 
local newspapers said that after the supporters in the court 
gallery finished singing an antiapartheid anthem a government 
prosecutor was heard saying long live the awb the afrikaans 
initials of the whitesupremacist afrikaner resistance movement 
the three were found guilty in november of laying land mines that 
injured eight people in transvaal province in 1986 at one stage of 
the 16month trial three members of the ancs executive committee 
who faced arrest in south africa gave evidence for the defense at 
a court session held last year in london 
ebrahim along with his codefendants did not testify during the 
trial but he submitted a 17page written statement to the court in 
which he alleged that all three men were tortured by police 
finding us guilty is merely a statement that the state 
considers the struggle for democracy equality justice peace and a 
nonracial society to be morally and politically reprehensible he 
said 
we wish to say to our people we tried to carry out your 
behests ebrahim wrote we did our best to live up to what you 
expected of us as members of the african national congress 
in an editorial monday the countrys largest afrikaanslanguage 
daily newspaper beeld suggested that the government open talks 
with the anc beeld traditionally supportive of the government 
said south africa could reap immense benefits by freeing mandela and 
negotiating with his organization 
president pw botha who has criticized beelds increasingly 
liberal editorial stance in recent months has rejected any talks 
with the anc until it renounces violence 
the anc was outlawed by south africas white authorities in 1960 
and a year later began a bombing and sabotage campaign the 
organization is multiracial but overwhelmingly black 
ebrahim who holds an indian passport left south africa in 1979 
after completing a 15year prison term for sabotage 
south african authorities say ebrahim at one time was the 
companion of helene passtoors a dutchbelgian citizen convicted in 
may 1986 of treason against south africa 
ms passtoors who is serving a 10year sentence is the exwife 
of klaas de jonge a dutchman who holed up in the dutch embassy in 
pretoria for two years rather than face charges of smuggling arms 
for the anc he returned to holland in 1987 as part of a prisoner 
exchange 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain

the speech but spokeswoman sheila tate said monday that he wants 
it short 
she said speechwriter peggy noonan author of some of bushs most 
memorable campaign comments had to go back to the drawing 
boards to shorten and edit the address and was expected to deliver 
another draft monday night bush plans a dress rehearsal thursday 
before a teleprompter 
inauguration week started differently at the capitol hill office 
of the joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies which 
is in charge of the swearingin ceremony and a luncheon to follow 
the very first thing we did this morning was make a checklist 
of what could be forgotten whos bringing the bush bibles whos 
bringing the quayle bibles said executive director mike ruehling 
the bicentennial inaugural ceremony will begin at 1138 am 
friday with bush taking the oath as close to noon as possible as 
the constitution directs ruehling said sen wendell ford dky 
chairman of the committee and the master of ceremonies will have 
both long and short introductions to use depending on how the 
program is going 
one thing you cant take into account is applause ruehling 
said if you build in three minutes of applause and theres only 
30 seconds youre in trouble and we dont have any public service 
announcements to run to fill the time 
the congressional panel is monitoring weather reports from two 
sources the military and nbc home of the network pool producer 
the latest report for friday called for clear skies and temperatures 
ranging from the high 30s to low 40s 
a little nippy but still considerably better than four years 
ago ruehling said then the temperature was 10 degrees enough 
to force president reagans oathtaking into the capitol rotunda and 
cancel the postceremony parade 
outside on the west front of the capitol with its sweeping view 
of the smithsonian museums and the washington monument workers 
prepared monday to install a podium and the bulletproof glass shield 
that will surround it 
ruehlings committee was also finalizing a seating chart for the 
inner platform a select group of 300 who will sit closest to the 
podium 
weve managed to get the immediate families of both the bushes 
and the quayles on the platform plus congressional leaders and 
program participants it was quite a feat ruehling said 
the bushes have five children and numerous grandchildren 
siblings cousins nieces and nephews the quayles have three 
children and mrs quayle has five brothers and sisters ruehling 
said 
the reagans didnt have that large of an immediate family he 
said people that have been on the platform at the previous two 
inaugurals some of them didnt make it this time because of the 
size of the families 
a runthrough of the inaugural program at 5 am sunday went 
about as smoothly as could be expected ruehling said but added 
he expects there will be some wrinkles no matter what when bush 
finally takes the oath 
theres a sign in our office that says four more days 
ruehling said four more days and then what and then its beyond 
our control

a former prime minister kidnapped near 
his home over the weekend had received threats recently prime 
minister wilfried martens said monday 
officials disagreed over whether the abduction saturday of former 
prime minister paul vanden boeynants was political 
about 500 police spent monday afternoon without success 
searching a 75acre wood at baudour near mons about 30 miles 
southwest of brussels after an anonymous caller told a radio 
station vanden boeynants body was there 
mr vanden boeynants had received threats lately and had 
requested to meet with the interior minister martens said on brt 
belgiums dutchlanguage radio network he did not elaborate 
interior minister louis tobback told brt that vanden boeynants 
69 had an appointment with him monday to discuss a personal 
matter 
police reported no new leads in their search for vanden 
boeynants who arrived at the ninestory apartment complex where he 
lives in a posh brussels neighborhood shortly before 6 pm 
saturday but never entered 
police found vanden boeynants car in his garage and his hearing 
aid pipe and a shoe nearby 
three anonymous telephone callers claimed responsibility for the 
kidnapping the daily newspaper le soir received a call saturday and 
rtbf belgiums frenchlanguage radio network received two calls 
sunday 
sundays caller spoke on behalf of a group calling itself the 
revolutionary socialist brigade officials said they had never heard 
of the group 
it was unclear who called le soir the caller spoke to a night 
watchman on behalf of a group of revolutionary socialists 
officials said they were concerned about vanden boeynants health 
because he takes heart medicine 
deputy brussels prosecutor andre vandoren played down the 
reported threats against vanden boeynants 
we have no elements to say a direct link can be established 
between the threats and his disappearance vandoren said he did 
not exclude political motives in the abduction 
but johan vande lanotte an aide to tobback said so far the 
case is a strictly judicial matter there is nothing to indicate 
that a truly terrorist act or politically inspired action is 
involved 
carlo huttisch an aide to vanden boeynants also ruled out 
political motives because a formal communique to that effect had 
been received 
vanden boeynants a christian democrat was prime minister 
between 1966 and 1968 and again for several months in late 1978 and 
early 1979 he also was defense minister in several governments in 
the 1970s 
in 1986 he received a threeyear suspended sentence and was 
fined the equivalent of about 16850 for tax evasion forgery and 
fraud as head of a brussels meat packing company 
vanden boeynants was a brussels city councilor for just more than 
30 years beginning in 1952 and oversaw a drastic urban renewal 
program that made him the bane of urban conservationists 
he was reelected city councilor oct 9 and then made a bid to 
become mayor he abandoned the plan after martens told him he could 
not assume the post because of his conviction 
in recent months vanden boeynants has headed a project to 
develop the atomium a giant structure shaped like an iron molecule 
that towered over the 1958 world exposition

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
hinted of a new stance toward the banned solidarity labor federation 
on monday telling a communist party meeting that all constructive 
forces should join a campaign for reform 
the meeting of the 230member central committee is shaping up as 
a showdown between hardliners and reformers over restoring legal 
status to the trade union movement solidarity remains active 
although it was suspended and then outlawed after a december 1981 
martiallaw decree 
a government source last week told the associated press the 
twoday meeting would end with the party offering to legalize 
solidarity under certain conditions opening the way to broader 
talks with the opposition under the leadership of lech walesa 
solidaritys chief and winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize 
marian orzechowski the partys chief ideologist told the 
fivehour meeting the issue of union pluralism was ripe to be 
solved and said a separate draft position on the topic had been 
prepared for a decision by the plenum 
it seems they will register solidarity said zbigniew bujak 
the former underground solidarity leader when asked about the 
meeting if so formal talks between authorities and the opposition 
could begin soon he said 
but signs of divisions in the party were evident during the 
discussion nine members spoke and the debate was to resume tuesday 
official unions chief alfred miodowicz told the plenum no 
decision on trade unions should be taken until a party conference on 
ideology scheduled for early next month the official pap news 
service reported other speakers offered similar sentiments 
eryka gorajek a forewoman at a northern poland tire factory 
spoke against legalizing solidarity everyone says there should be 
only one trade union at an enterprise she said 
jaruzelski whose remarks were broadcast live on state radio did 
not mention solidarity by name but said political and social life 
should be open to different segments of society 
today we will draw directions of democracy which will include 
some pluralistic solutions jaruzelski said 
the priority goal is radical and irrevocable reconstruction of 
social life so that there is a place in it for all citizens who 
recognize the supreme interests of our country and the unchangeable 
shape of its essential framework 
by supreme interests polands leaders usually mean its 
membership in the sovietled warsaw pact military alliance and 
maintaining a political system in which the communists have the 
leading role 
the general said the party wants pluralism but that it should 
not be confrontational destructive anarchic if there is to be 
any chance to unite poles around a constructive nationwide 
program 
jaruzelski first secretary of the communist polish united 
workers party alluded to public discontent after a decade of 
economic decline and stagnation people have become irritated and 
unsure about the future creating problems within the party he 
said 
what does the party expect what does society expect 
jaruzelski asked rhetorically agreement of all constructive 
forces of the nation in the task of reforms and renewal 
referring to the opposition and the party jaruzelski said we 
are all changing we are going toward new solutions aware of the 
possible dangers but hopeful that the others have also drawn 
appropriate conclusions about the past years that they will 
confirm by their actions the care for the country that they profess 
reconciliation is a great opportunity for poland 
orzechowski also a politburo member said the party has been 
reexamining its role recently in a wideranging internal discussion 
the problem of trade union pluralism is becoming ripe to be 
solved he said 
but he said any lifting of the ban on allowing more than one 
legal trade union should be accompanied by guarantees that there 
would be no repeat of the solidarity era of 1981 when factories 
became arenas of political struggle 
walesa has demanded that authorities agree to recognize his union 
before he will begin talks on polands future meanwhile he has 
warned that the publics patience is thin after years of rising 
prices and consumer shortages threatening a social explosion that 
he might be unable to control 
significant opposition to legalizing solidarity remains 
especially from the leadership of the official trade union alliance 
opzz factorybased party organizations and elements of the army 
and police party sources say

finance minister gerhard stoltenberg 
says the government now believes a libyan chemical factory is 
capable of producing poison gas according to a report published 
monday 
at a news conference stoltenberg again revised the official 
recollection of when bonn first learned of possible west german 
involvement in the plant he also said a government company may have 
aided the construction unknowingly 
belgian prosecutors announced a second arrest involving the 
plant they said jos vleminckx of the nowbankrupt antwerp shipping 
firm sanexomar was charged with falsifying cargo documents the same 
charge brought against jozef gedopt manager of the antwerp company 
cross link who was arrested last week 
a german magazine said a us company provided a computer for the 
libyan plant 
the saudi arabian daily al sharq al awsat quoted ihsan barbouti 
an arab consultant as saying he designed the complex and it was 
heavily guarded but he did not believe it was making poison gas 
west german officials had maintained for three weeks that they 
had seen no proof of us assertions that the plant in rabta libya 
is intended for the production of chemical weapons or that west 
german firms helped supply it libya says the plant is a 
pharmaceutical factory 
die welt newspaper published an interview with stoltenberg in its 
early tuesday edition which was available in bonn monday evening 
we must assume that the factory is a facility in which poison 
gas can be produced he was quoted as saying he said he based the 
assumption on concrete indications and intelligence reports 
die welt also quoted stoltenberg as saying confiscated documents 
opened up a possibility or a suspicion that any west german 
firms involved in the plant could be guilty of illegal transactions 
the documents were seized last week from the nowdefunct ibi 
engineering company of frankfurt 
at the news conference stoltenberg said his ministry had vague 
information on the libyan plant in early august on friday 
chancellor helmut kohls spokesman corrected official statements to 
reflect that intelligence sources linked west german companies to 
the libyan project in midoctober 
stern magazine said it would report in thursdays editions that 
the german chemical company imhausenchemie had obtained from the 
us electronics company harris corp through indirect 
channels the central computer for the libyan chemical plant 
the nationally circulated weekly sent the report by telex to news 
media 
the magazine did not elaborate but said harris based in 
melbourne fla specializes in aircraft and satellite electronics 
and works closely with the us defense department 
harris officials denied the report 
we have made as thorough a search of our records as possible in 
the time available and to the best of our knowledge we have sold no 
computers to libya either directly or through a third party said 
spokesman peter carney in particular we have no record of 
selling any computers to the german company imhausen 
stern also said salzgitter industriebau gmbh a subsidiary of the 
west german governmentowned salzgitter ag made blueprints for the 
plant about 40 miles outside of tripoli 
salzgitter ag denied the report but said in a statement that its 
subsidiary was involved with imhausenchemie identified by us 
officials as a key participant in the libyan plant in constructing 
a pharmaceutical plant in hong kong 
salzgitter ag manufactures steel products and industrial 
equipment and salzgitter industriebau specializes in developing 
industrial plants 
stoltenberg said salzgitter industiebau may have been an 
unwitting participant in the libyan plant 
the developments cast further doubt on bonns handling of the 
matter which has dominated west german news reports for three weeks 
and complicated relations with the united states 
us allegations of a west german hand in the plant were made 
public in late december 
bonn officials said then that they could find no evidence to 
support the accusations after an initial probe of imhausenchemie 
the government cleared the chemical company of any illegal trade 
activity with libya 
last week however kohl acknowledged mounting indications of 
west german involvement and said some firms could face criminal 
charges 
his spokesman friedhelm ost announced on friday that 
intelligence officials had informed bonn in midoctober of suspected 
west german ties to the plant the government had said a week 
earlier that it knew nothing of the case until kohls visit to 
washington nov 15 
a regional prosecutor in offenburg now is investigating the 
export activities of imhausenchemie 
at the news conference stoltenberg repeated the governments 
position that there are insufficient grounds for a federal criminal 
investigation of companies alleged to have been involved 
we are a democracy we have to take care of legal grounds he 
said we cannot act on rumors

new rubber bullets have been blamed for the 
deaths of four arab youths in five days raising concern the 
ammunition may be more lethal than earlier rubber rounds used to 
combat the palestinian uprising 
the victims two girls and two teenage boys were struck in the 
head with the spherical pellets when israeli soldiers opened fire to 
quell demonstrations in the occupied west bank and gaza strip arab 
doctors said monday 
the deaths came during a round of violent clashes between 
soldiers and stonethrowing protesters that have left 10 
palestinians dead since thursday they ranged in age from 11 to 18 
arab doctors said in addition to the four deaths from rubber 
bullets plastic rounds were responsible for two of the recent 
deaths the remaining four were blamed on standardissue lead 
bullets 
the army has confirmed the deaths but does not give information 
on the type of ammunition involved 
the rising toll has prompted israeli ministers to call for a 
review of the armys handling of the 13month uprising against 
israeli rule 
at least 359 palestinians have been killed since december 1987 
most of them shot in confrontations with israeli troops fifteen 
israelis also have died 
energy minister moshe shahal of the leftleaning labor party on 
sunday urged the cabinet to order an investigation of plastic 
bullets which have been used widely in riot control since august 
rubber bullets used during much of the uprising are steel pellets 
coated with rubber a new version introduced late last month is 
marbleshaped has a thinner rubber coating and is heavier critics 
say they are deadlier 
since the rubber bullets do not rotate in flight as do standard 
live rounds and do not fragment on impact they are said to cause 
less damage however the army refuses to release statistics to 
support the conclusion 
minister ehud olmert a member of the rightwing likud bloc who 
is in charge of arab affairs said monday on israel radio that 
israel and the palestinians are paying a high price in efforts 
to put down the uprising 
while favoring tough measures against rioters olmert said he did 
not understand the armys policy for opening fire 
i dont think theres a lot of logic or common sense in 
shooting after a boy when hes already finished throwing his stone 
and is running away he said there must be some judgment and 
some restraint 
in addition to the four deaths since thursday two earlier ones 
were reported from the new rubber bullets 
dr rustom namari director of mukassed hospital in arab east 
jerusalem described the new rubber bullets as heavier and 
harder than the old rubber rounds 
they are killing people especially when they hit in the 
head namari said in an interview the bullet penetrates more 
it breaks bones more 
namari said the hospital had a 17yearold gaza strip boy in its 
intensive care unit with damage to half of his brain from a rubber 
bullet wound 
last month he said mukassed doctors removed six of the new 
bullets from the head of a palestinian teenager two were lodged in 
the brain two in the jaw one in the neck and one under the left 
eye 
i know of only one death from the old rubber bullets and i can 
confirm at least five from the new ones namari said 
a spokesman for the army who cannot be identified under military 
rules said the rubber bullets were introduced because the chances 
of them killing are much less than with lead bullets which are 
lethal per se 
he blamed the recent rise in fatalities on an increase in the 
intensity and number of riots and the composition of the rioters is 
younger these youngsters are much more difficult to 
anticipate 
the spokesman declined to give specifics on the rules for firing 
rubber bullets which generally are shot in a cluster from a 
canister the army has said in the past that the plastic rounds are 
not fatal if fired from a distance of 70 yards 
on monday an officer defended the use of plastic bullets as 
very deterring 
people are very much afraid of them col m who was not 
identified further in keeping with army rules said on israel 
television the moment we arrive and point the guns they 
disappear 
the television also said new regulations allowed troops to fire 
plastic or rubber bullets at stonethrowers even when they are 
fleeing it said the armys attempt to confront each rioter was 
partly to blame for the rise in casualties 
the number of wounded the television reported reached a record 
figure of 492 last month more than in each of the 13 months of the 
uprising 
the earliest reported victim of the new bullets was a 15yearold 
boy killed in a nov 26 stonethrowing clash with troops in a 
refugee camp in the gaza strip doctors at shifa hospital said

four arab israeli women stayed in their 
dormitory monday with fellow students who oppose tel aviv university 
plans to move them away from contact with foreign jews being 
assigned to the dorm 
the young women and about a dozen supporters refused university 
officials orders to leave said yossi shturm of the student union 
he said the union asked a tel aviv court sunday to stop the transfer 
this is a racist decision and it is unacceptable shturm said 
dean of students gideon fishelson said the university has moved 
nearly 50 students to make room for members of a foreign study 
program and fewer than 10 arabs were affected 
but he acknowledged a longstanding university policy of housing 
foreign students exclusively with other jews so they can learn about 
israel and are not influenced by negative arab propaganda 
we mix them up with jewish students in order to attain a 
zionist goal so that after spending one semester here they want to 
return to live here afterward fishelson said by telephone if 
one of them asks to live with an arab student i wont say no but 
we dont arrange them that way 
the women who refused to leave their rooms are citizens from 
northern israel the dean said 
in addition to appealing the transfer order students are 
collecting signatures on a petition that says we will not let the 
university be dragged into apartheid a reference to south 
africas policy of racial separation 
shturm said the foreign students should be explosed to israels 
diverse population students from abroad have to learn to live 
with all israeli students not just jews thats the israeli 
reality he said 
arab citizens make up about 17 percent of israels 42 million 
people they live in israel proper not in territories captured in 
the 1967 middle east war

more than 140 writers unwilling to join a 
union created for them by the government have met to recreate an 
independent group dissolved during the 1981 martial law crackdown 
during the weekend meeting the writers formed an organizational 
committee led by jan jozef szczepanski a novelist and screenwriter 
who was president of the dissolved polish authors union 
the writers said in a statement that their decision not to join a 
governmentsponsored polish authors union shows they place more 
value on independence and personal dignity than clear advantages 
and that the official group denies them appropriate representation 
recreating the group under the title of the polish writers 
society will help the literary community take part in efforts to 
reverse polands economic crisis the writers statement said 
the group will continue signing up members and then apply to 
authorities for registration as a legal association a spokesman 
said 
the group also welcomed with satisfaction the governments 
august decision to lift the ban imposed on the polish pen writers

prime minister edward seaga is taking 
credit for jamaicas recovery from hurricane gilbert and its close 
relations with the united tates but he faces an uphill battle for 
an unprecented third straight term 
opinion polls for two years now indicated the conservative seaga 
trailed his longstanding socialist rival former prime minister 
michael manley by 13 points seaga aides say the caribbean island 
nations striking recovery from the centurys worst storm has not 
yet improved his chances 
ending months of speculation seaga told a nationally televised 
rally sunday night general elections will be held feb 9 
seaga railed against the policies of the 1970s manley government 
before thousands of cheering supporters at kingstons south parade 
traffic quadrangle seaga said that during eight years in power his 
centerright jamaican labor party brought political stability 
reversed economic decline and restored relations with the united 
states 
in these hands your future is safe seaga said 
it will be jamaicas first contested national election since 
1980 when politically related attacks killed more than 700 people 
during a ninemonth campaign 
in august seaga and manley signed a peace treaty and agreed 
on a code of conduct for orderly campaigning 
manleys leftist peoples national party boycotted 1983 elections 
in a dispute over voter registration leaving the jamaican labor 
party with all 60 seats in parliament 
manley a charismatic politician with a strong following among 
the young has called for elections ever since 
business leaders urged a short campaign to minimize the risk of 
disrupting the tourist season seaga said the campaign was the 
shortest allowed under law 
the 600 millionayear tourist industry is the nations biggest 
foreignexchange earner it has bounced back from hurricane gilbert 
which struck sept 12 causing 45 deaths and about 1 billion in 
damage 
visitor arrivals down 427 percent in september hit 1 million 
by december and now are running only 16 percent below last year 
according to government figures 
electricity and water were restored roads cleared and thousands 
of houses and buildings rebuilt or repaired although work 
continues jamaica shows little sign of the devastation 
the bostonborn and harvardeducated seaga 58 claimed credit 
sunday for putting jamaica back on its feet boasting he raised 
600 million in relief funds from the united states other western 
governments and lending institutions within one month of the 
hurricane 
it was possible because the international community trusts the 
government of jamaica he said 
his standing in the polls improved slightly after the hurricane 
but pollster carl stone of the university of the west indies said 
bickering over alleged inequities and delays in relief distribution 
offset any gains 
seaga is seen as president reagans closest ally in the 
caribbean he was the first foreign leader to visit the white house 
after reagan took office in 1981 and supported the usled 
invasion of grenada in 1983 
manley 64 educated at the london school of economics was prime 
minister from 197280 a period marked by sharp economic decline 
his government took over several state industries and embraced cuba 
alarming the united states and foreign investors 
manley now says he learned from mistakes and wants good relations 
with the united states 
but seaga suggested manley and his supporters have not changed 
and that his opponent remains friendly with cuban leader fidel 
castro 
unemployment has dropped from 28 percent to 20 percent and the 
vital bauxite industry has shown signs of recovery from a collapse 
but jamaica still has a 41 billion foreign debt and living 
standards remain poor in this nation of 23 million people 
seaga campaign strategist george ramocan noted that another 
factor in the election would be the traditional desire by jamaicans 
for change no government has served more than two consecutive terms 
since universal suffrage was introduced in 1944

canadians observed martin luther kings birthday 
with a martinsday celebration monday a time of tensions between 
black community activists and the police 
the third annual festival for the slain us civil rights 
leaders birthday at the small harbourfront theater center included 
a forum about police racism 
on sunday about 2000 metropolitan toronto police officers met 
to protest political pressure they blame for the filing of a 
manslaughter charge against an officer who shot a black man 
the unofficial martinsday festival for more than 12 hours 
monday included speeches music and dance and discussions about 
nonviolence and human rights 
charles roach president of the martin luther king commemoration 
committee said the late civil rights leaders birthday was marked 
in canada because the civil rights and human rights movement was 
not confined 
it was a universal movement he said in a brief interview 
canadian police forces still are largely white but what are 
known in canada as visible minorities have grown significantly 
in urban areas 
toronto whose metropolitan population is 35 million is 
especially known for ethnic communities that have increased through 
immigration from asia africa latin america and the caribbean

deviney in the aug 9 death of lester donaldson at a toronto rooming 
house donaldson was one of two blacks killed in police incidents 
over a fourmonth period last year

refusals to carry weapons started immediately after the charge was 
filed 
the police who gathered sunday agreed to stop their protests but 
they demanded attorney general ian scotts resignation scott told 
reporters later that he wouldnt resign and denied a part in 
deciding the criminal charge

the government on monday tightened security 
procedures for airport workers after two journalists posing as 
cleaners exposed major lapses at londons heathrow airport after the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 
earlier the sunday post newspaper in scotland quoted a former 
highranking israeli intelligence agent as saying he believes abu 
ibrahim head of a palestinian group planned the dec 21 bombing 
which killed 270 people 
abc news citing unidentified us and western intelligence 
sources reported monday that several dozen intelligence agents from 
the palestine liberation organization are working with pan am on the 
investigation of the bombing 
plo leader yasser arafat had pledged his groups help in the 
investigation and abc quoted its sources as saying the plos help 
has been exceedingly valuable 
transport secretary paul channon said passes will be issued only 
to airport employees or to outside companies which the airport 
manager is satisfied are reliable and reputable 
clearly some of the firms in this field in the past have been 
far from reliable he said in a statement 
channon said cleaners and other airport workers now will have to 
have held security passes for at least six months before being 
allowed unsupervised access to aircraft and checkedin baggage 
he also praised the swift action of the british airports 
authority in withdrawing access to airplanes from two privately 
owned cleaning companies at heathrow 
graham dudman of the daily express and stewart norris of london 
weekend television working independently told friday how they got 
jobs as airplane cleaners at heathrow using fake applications 
they said that with passes issued by the two cleaning companies 
involved they were able to wander on and off a dozen jets where 
they said they could easily have planted a bomb 
new yorkbound flight 103 was destroyed by a bomb over the 
scottish village of lockerbie killing 259 people on the plane and 
11 on the ground 
the flight originated in frankfurt west germany and baggage and 
passengers were transferred to the boeing 747 at heathrow 
in glasgow the sunday post newspaper quoted former mossad 
officer raphael eitan as saying he had no doubt the bombers were 
ibrahims may 15 palestinian group based in baghdad iraq and that 
the bomb was made there and probably carried on board the plane by 
an unwitting accomplice 
the may 15 group named for the date the 1948 arabisrael war 
started also has offices in syria and libya the newspaper quoted 
eitan as saying 
they are led by abu ibrahim a qualified engineer in the early 
days ibrahim received all his financial support from iraqi 
intelligence who continue to provide him with cash and premises 
eitan was quoted as saying 
may 15 has only 20 to 30 operatives who concentrate their 
terrorist efforts on passenger airlines 
may 15 was the only palestinian group operating that way and with 
the expertise to carry out such attacks eitan was quoted as saying 
ibrahim spent five years designing and perfecting the device which 
exploded over lockerbie 
ibrahims detonator is so small it fits into the lock of the 
suitcase the explosive is made of plastic which is extremely 
thin and looks like computer printout paper so it is easily 
concealed 
in the past four years he has failed several times to carry out 
a similar atrocity in 1984 british and west german intelligence 
intercepted five suitcases packed with explosives which may 15 
intended to plant on unsuspecting airline passengers two were found 
in london two were found in frankfurt 
nothing in the interview attributed a motive to ibrahim

in grand junction before taking a job at the american university of 
beirut

their eyes

mexicos top labor leader said on monday that 
he accepted as necessary actions taken against union corruption by 
new president carlos salinas de gotari 
but 88yearold fidel velazquez head of the mexican labor 
federation also said last weeks crackdown on leaders of the 
powerful oil workers union on weapons charges was without precedent 
in mexicos labor history 
velazquez told a news conference the effect what has happened 
in the oil union could have on public opinion is worrisome it is 
hoped that all will turn out well for the country and the oil 
workers union 
he did not elaborate but the oil workers and others have 
expressed concern over the violence used in arresting joaquin 
hernandez galicia the longtime de facto chief of the oil workers 
though he held only a minor office 
soldiers fired a bazooka to blast down the door of hernandez 
galicias home in the northeastern city of ciudad madero on jan 10 
and with agents of the attorney generals office arrested him in a 
gunfight 
one federal agent was killed fifty other union leaders and 
hernandez galicia associates also were arrested 
velazquez said efforts to wipe out union corruption must be 
accomplished where necessary he did not refer specifically to the 
oil workers union 
but in an informal meeting with reporters after his news 
conference velazquez did indicate some disagreement with the 
tactics salinas used in cracking down on the union 
he said salinas has tried to implant a new politics using the 
maximum force of the law to reform attitudes i dont believe there 
is going to be a clash over the new way of politics although we 
believe that they must use other tactics and strategies 
the mexican labor federation includes the oil workers and claims 
5 million members of a total national workforce of about 25 million 
velazquez also said the man chosen to replace the jailed 
secretarygeneral of the oil workers whose appointment the 
government opposed may serve only temporarily 
he will only be in charge for the moment he said of ricardo 
camero cardiel named to replace jailed salvador barragan camacho 
a special general convention will be held to decide the new 
secretarygeneral 
velazquez said he would do whatever he could to clean up and save 
the union 
the future of the oil union is uncertain but we will fight for 
its unity and to save the organization velazquez said 
government officials last week complained that camero cardiels 
election violated union bylaws they also said he had close ties to 
barragan camacho and hernandez galicia both arrested on weapons 
charges during the crackdown on oil union leaders 
the attorney generals office said 200 uzi submachine guns were 
found inside hernandez galicias home 
barragan camacho pleaded innocent to weapons charges friday in a 
mexico city hospital where he is undergoing treatment for heart 
trouble 
five of the 51 were released for lack of evidence bail was set 
for 28 and the rest remained in a mexico city on monday 
the government news agency notimex said maximum security measures 
were imposed to prevent possible escape attempts by those still in 
custody including stringing wires to prevent helicopters from 
landing 
notimex also said 120 other people including other oil union 
leaders have sought injunctions against arrest 
velazquez said he would not personally support barragan camacho 
and hernandez galicia both old acquaintances 
here there is no friendship velazquez said we will defend 
the union as is our obligation and will continue defending its 
workers 
he brushed off suggestions that the federation was bowing to 
government pressure by not giving camero cardiel his support as the 
oil unions permanent replacement

a group of ultraright jewish settlers announced 
monday they plan to form a new independent jewish state called judea 
in the west bank and gaza strip if the israeli government withdraws 
from the occupied territories 
we will not allow the heart to be torn from the body of the 
land of israel michael ben horin of the committee for the 
foundation of the state of judea told a news conference 
judea samaria and gaza will always remain jewish no israeli 
state will ever be permitted to expel jews from their homes or their 
land the bearded ben horin said referring to the west bank by 
the biblical names judea and samaria 
the west bank and gaza strip were captured by israel in the 1967 
middle east war and palestinians have been rebelling in the 
territories for the past 13 months to demand an end to israeli 
occupation 
ben horin and other committee members belong to new yorkborn 
rabbi meir kahanes antiarab kach movement 
he said the group has some supporters from most settlements in 
the territories but leaders of the mainstream settlement movement 
gush emunim said they do not back the planned state 
i consider this state to be a joke so im not even going to 
waste my time criticizing it said benny katzover a longtime 
settler leader who founded the settlement of elon moreh near nablus 
on nov 15 plo chief yasser arafat declared an independent 
palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip 
about 70000 jewish settlers live in enclaves among the 17 
million palestinians in the two occupied territories 
committee member kutiel ben yaakov said palestinians would be 
allowed to remain in the future judea if they agree to sit quietly 
there like any other nonjew 
but we know they would prefer acts of terrorism against us my 
opinion is there is no room for a hostile population the arabs 
will be allowed to leave peacefully for any other arab state ben 
yaakov said 
ben horin said the settler group was putting into place the 
infrastructure of the future state in preparation for a possible 
israeli withdrawal from the territories as part of an arabisraeli 
peace settlement 
behind him was displayed a newly designed blueandwhite judean 
flag which had a star of david embossed with a menorah and a lions 
head and carried the words the lion of judea lives the settlers 
said the phrase referred to the biblical verse you are a lions 
cub o judah gen 499 
ben yaacov said the committee wanted to make its announcement at 
the west bank settlement of kiryat arba but settlement leaders 
withdrew permission for such a move under government pressure 
the announcement was made instead in jerusalems hilton hotel 
where committee members served cakes and coffee to journalists

soldiers dispersed hundreds of protesters leftwing groups called 
for a nationwide strike 
about 1000 students at phillipe guerrier high school began 
protesting after soldiers showed up at the school apparently 
because unidentified agitators threw stones at the building

to the needs of the poor who are haitis majority 
in another development the government called for a national 
forum next month to discuss creating an electoral council to oversee 
presidential elections 
in a communique released sunday the government said the forum 
would be held feb 9 a date it said was purposely chosen to fall 
after feb 7 the third anniversary of the fall of dictator jean 
claude duvalier 
it the date would signal a new departure read the 
governments release 
in november the government published a draft decree calling 
for the creation of an electoral council and asked readers 
comments but the decree was widely criticized as an attempt on the 
part of the government to control the electoral process

dialogue with the government on how to form an electoral council 
but they have set conditions including the exclusion of former 
duvalier supporters from the forum 
many parties say having a new electoral council would be 
unconstitutional since the constitution already provides for an 
independent electoral council

1987 referendum was suspended by thenmilitary ruler lt gen henri 
namphy after a massacre at the polls aborted the nov 29 1987

angela carparelli who lives in the neighborhood 
one house was leveled following an explosion on thursday and more

found today

residents to worry

deadly fumes from a faulty furnace killed a man 
last week and then claimed the lives of three relatives who stayed 
at his home to plan the funeral but knew nothing of the furnace 
problem authorities said monday 
the death last wednesday of edward g zarnow sr 89 at his 
suburban greendale home was originally blamed on a heart attack 
authorities said they didnt conduct an autopsy last week because 
they had no reason to suspect his death was caused by lethal fumes 
from the basement furnace 
carbon monoxide poisoning caused the deaths sunday of zarnows 
son from australia his granddaughter and the granddaughters 
husband a daughterinlaw from australia was hospitalized in 
critical condition 
milwaukee county medical examiner jeffrey jentzen said monday an 
autopsy of the elder zarnow conducted after his four relatives were 
found showed he had a high concentration of the carbon monoxide in 
his blood 
jentzen identified the relatives as michael martin 38 of 
marshfield wis his wife karen 37 and edward c zarnow jr 57 
of new south wales australia zarnows wife rebecca 56 also of 
australia remained in critical condition at st lukes medical 
center in milwaukee 
mrs zarnow was being treated in a hyperbaric chamber for carbon 
monoxide poisoning officials said 
wisconsin natural gas spokesman paul markovina said investigators 
discovered the gas furnances regulator was maladjusted causing too 
much gas to go into the furnace 
the overburning caused incomplete combustion that filled the 
house with carbon monoxide a colorless odorless and lethal gas 
markovina said 
the elder zarnow suffered from heart and lung disease and 
cirrhosis of the liver causing authorities to assume his death was 
by natural causes jentzen said 
there was nothing to suggest carbon monoxide death at the 
home jentzen said the sequence of the events details of the 
investigation and examination of the body failed to suggest a carbon 
monoxide death 
no medical examiners office in the country would have done 
anything different on this case he added 
jentzen said when zarnows body was discovered investigators did 
not notice anything suspicious or unusual he added that none of the 
investigators at the scene became ill or complained of the common 
symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning 
jentzen said if there was any evidence to suggest that the elder 
zarnow had died of carbon monoxide poisoning an autopsy would have 
been conducted immediately 
jentzen called the incident a very rare and unusual collection 
of circumstances 
authorities said the elder zarnows relatives were staying at his 
home over the weekend while planning his funeral sunday morning 
his niece audrey brennan contacted greendale police because she 
had been unable to reach the four victims on the telephone 
an officer knocked on the door of the zarnow house about 1040 
am sunday but got no response and left the scene 
at 151 pm ms brennan again called police saying she had 
gone to the residence and had seen three bodies lying on the floor

a roman catholic nun who pressured an unwed woman 
to give up her newborn girl may be sued for social work malpractice 
a state judge ruled 
state judge diane lebedeff ruled in the states first such case 
that maureen dunn could sue sister rosalie gilson of hicksville and 
her long island agency the catholic home bureau for dependent 
children 
ms dunn 30 of wellesley mass filed a 5 million suit 
charging the nun and the agency with wrongful deprivation of 
custody 
the judge in a ruling issued friday denied ms dunns attempt 
to add cardinal john oconnor of the new york archdiocese to the 
suit as the effective head of the agency and its employees 
ms dunn gave birth to a girl on april 6 1986 four days later 
the child was placed with mark and diane finnican of hicksville ms 
dunn said she was reassured by sister rosalie that she could get the 
child back within 30 days if she changed her mind about giving her 
up for adoption 
but ms dunn did not regain custody of the baby until march 1987 
when she won a bitter court fight 
a state appeals court ordered the baby kara returned to ms 
dunn after finding that she had signed surrender papers under 
duress and perhaps even fraud in a busy diner on may 1 1986 
the court said agency officials did nothing when the finnicans 
refused to return the child after ms dunn said on may 20 that she 
wanted her baby back 
lebedeff said she found no previous cases of social work 
malpractice in new york state 
but she noted the legislature licenses social workers and that 
under that law that makes the nun and her agency professional 
the judge said practicing ones profession fraudulently 
incompetently or negligently constitutes professional misconduct 
in addition the judge said there could be a custodial 
interference issue because the agency ignored ms dunns pleas for 
return of the baby 
custodial interference is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a 
year in jail and maximum 1000 fine

have anything done in this administration thats illegal or 
unethical it probably would not have happened 
i think its a characteristic in american life that there is

a judge on monday denied a request to 
move the murder trial of noah robinson the halfbrother of jesse 
jackson but said he would reconsider the motion if prospective 
jurors appear biased by pretrial publicity 
jury selection began in the trial of robinson a chicago 
businessman who is accused of hiring members of chicagos el rukn 
street gang to kill leroy hambone barber a former employee and 
a childhood friend of robinsons in greenville three jurors were 
selected monday 
he also is accused of conspiring to murder janice denise 
rosemond a witness to the slaying who later survived a brutal 
stabbing attack five el rukn members also are charged their cases 
are being handled separately 
albert taylor jr an attorney for robinson had asked the trial 
be moved to charleston because of the publicity surrounding the case 
he entered as evidence a tape of news reports by wyfftv in 
greenville and said the greenville news and the greenville piedmont 
had published 137 stories on the case since november 1987 
he said it was inconceivable that any prospective juror did 
not hear or read the news reports 
taylor also accused solicitor joe watson of releasing evidence to 
the media in an attempt to influence prospective jurors 
watson denied the charge i have done everything i could to 
keep down pretrial publicity he told circuit judge james moore 
watson said robinson and his attorneys contributed to the 
publicity because they had sent numerous releases to the media 
moore gave no reason for his decision to deny the motion he 
said however that he would be willing to reconsider the motion 
during jury selection if it appears that the publicity has damaged 
robinsons chance for a fair trial 
jury selection could take several days to complete officials 
said 
the judge dismissed on monday candidates who were related to 
anyone involved in the case medically unable to be a participant 
over 65 and unwilling to serve or already decided about the guilt or 
innocence of robinson 
after cutting the number of prospective jurors from about 150 to 
112 monday afternoon the judge divided them into four groups of 28 
people each people in the first group were questioned by attorneys 
monday and officials were to call the remaining groups 
when a jury is selected that person would be taken home allowed 
to pack and then sequestered officials said 
about 50 people watched the proceedings in the greenville county 
courthouse all spectators had to pass through a metal detector 
before they could enter the thirdfloor courtroom 
robinson has maintained that he is a victim of a political 
conspiracy caused partly by the success of his halfbrother 
robinson and jackson share the same father but the former 
democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no recent 
contact with his halfbrother 
barber was shot in the head on jan 2 1986 while standing in a 
phone booth inside a greenville shopping center owned by robinson 
in a brief arraignment held last week in greenville robinson 
pleaded innocent to the barber slaying he was jailed for about 10 
weeks after his september arrest until a judge agreed to let him 
post 1 million bond

wending their way over the green mountains of 
vietnam through the misty hai van pass six former us marines 
revisited the battlefields of fallen comrades on a sentimental 
journey into the past 
where only heavily armed military convoys dared to go two decades 
ago they rode in a van over the 68 miles of winding roads from da 
nang to hue stopping en route to embrace the beauty of the 
mountains and the serene waters of the south china sea 
this pass was continually harassed said robert dalton a 
54yearold freelance writer from davidsonville md during a stop 
sunday at an old french fort dalton as a captain 20 years ago 
commanded kilo company 26th marine regiment first division which 
patrolled sections of the hai van pass 
this is fantastic the natural splendor said nate genna a 
maintenance man from boston during another stop to look out over 
the bay at a tiny fishing village set off by a steepled church in 
its center 
ive never seen this before said genna 41 the only 
mountains i saw were west of dong ha a former marine base farther 
north 
their odyssey brought them at nightfall to hue the imperial 
capital from the end of the 18th century until the abdication of 
vietnams last emperor bao dai in 1945 it was here that us 
marines fought housetohouse and lost 142 men during north 
vietnams tet offensive of 1968 
the marines on a 10day visit to vietnam arrived in da nang by 
plane from hanoi 
i had butterflies in my stomach just seeing the place the 
mountains around it said frank noe a firefighter from stoughton 
mass i could see the strip from way ahead when we were comimg 
in 
for noe it brought back memories of his first arrival in vietnam 
in november 1967 when he landed in da nang as a frightened 
19yearold kid 
the revetments then were filled with us jets that regularly 
bombed north vietnam and the air base was rustling with military 
activity but this time the 40yearold noe saw only the red noses 
of vietnamese mig fighters between the embankments many of them 
rusting away 
a warmer reception awaited them in da nang which was once a part 
of south vietnam 
theres more of the relaxed atmosphere here than in the 
north said mike wallace a 41yearold farmer from langdon kan 
look at the reception said dalton the people move a 
little bit brighter their faces are a little more open theyre a 
lot less constrained and they know us they know americans they 
smile a little bit more than the people up north do and they just 
accommodate americans a lot more easily 
a lot look mysteriously familiar but at the same time 
something isnt the same said genna i think whats missing is 
my youth you cant go home like the saying goes i was trying not 
to think i was just looking i saw a place i saw a long time ago 
it looks the same but its not the same because im not the same 
im 22 years older 
when william johnson of manchester conn landed in da nang in 
october 1967 he was nervous 
this time i was hoping i could see what i saw the last time 
not a war going on but i mean recognizable things which i dont 
see i never even got into da nang really said johnson 41 
in hanoi the former marines were greeted with mostly stoic looks 
and an occasional forced smile from vietnamese soldiers they once 
fought against 
gene spanos a 39yearold police lieutenant from rosemont ill 
pulled out a map and showed to vietnamese officers the sites of 
former us bases just below what was once the demilitarized zone 
that divided the country at the 17th parallel 
spanos and the former marines all except dalton members of the 
11th marines said they were concerned that land mines their 
engineer battalion had planted were still killing and wounding 
civilians 
in wartime the americans also sprayed chemicals one of the 
vietnamese officers said they shook hands for photographers and 
television cameras in an embrace that was less than spontaneous 
you always had to carry a loaded rifle a helmet and a flak 
jacket and anything could happen said genna i always dreamed 
about returning here just to take a nice slow relaxed walk without 
any fear and i finally did it 21 years later

presidentelect bushs choice of a moderate 
pragmatic cabinet means the confirmation process that begins this 
week will lack the ideological overtones of the reagan years and 
instead offer debate on substantive issues 
the democrats who control congress are likely to use the sessions 
to force bushs nominees to say how they will carry out their boss 
campaign promises to tend to neglected social programs in a time of 
extreme fiscal austerity and to test the strength of bushs 
nonewtaxes pledge 
they will want to build a record for why new revenues are going 
to be needed said charles cook a washington political analyst 
the democrats are going to let the nominees build their case for 
them 
initial reactions on capitol hill to bushs cabinet selections 
have been generally positive the majority of those named are 
veterans of federal government service three are holdovers from the 
reagan administration five others have been previously confirmed by 
the senate for other jobs and four are former members of congress 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has said he is 
impressed with the appointees as a group and expects the senate to 
work well with them 
they are generally experienced hopefully pragmatic people and 
we wont have the rigid ideology of the first reagan term 
mitchell said i am trying very hard to establish from our side an 
atmosphere of cooperation and bipartisanship

a real estate scandal has uncovered 
rampant corruption among the communist elite here in the yugoslavian 
republic of bosnia a former party chief and dozens of officials 
have lost their jobs 
the scandal involved the adriatic fishing village of neum which 
was turned into a chic playground for top communists 
the scandal also may have hastened the departure of premier 
branko mikulic who in december became the first government chief in 
communist yugoslavia to resign 
like other politicians implicated in the scandal mikulic comes 
from bosnia once seen as the countrys most repressive and 
dogmatically communist republic and now increasingly tainted by 
corruption 
neum 75 miles southwest of sarajevo the bosnian capital was 
transformed in just 10 years from a sleepy seaside village to a 
resort of glittering white marble villas 
hundreds of top bosnian officials reportedly built private villas 
with illegal bank loans obtained with the connivance of local bank 
officials 
in return the bankers reportedly received political favors and 
rapid promotions 
the affair has thrown a sharp light on the growth of corruption 
in yugoslavia since the death in 1980 of josip broz tito who 
prevented the staterun media from reporting corrupt practices among 
officials during his time as leader 
bosnian officials deny anything is distinctly bad about their 
region saying that corruption is widespread in yugoslavias five 
other republics 
i dont understand why they are only after us since similar 
loans were taken by almost every yugoslav who had friends working in 
banks said one ranking bosnian official accused of involvement in 
the neum scandal he spoke only on condition of anonymity 
but bosnia and its senior officials have been at the center of 
two of the nations biggest corruption scandals according to a 
sarajevo television report the two scandals have led to the ouster 
of about 2000 leading politicians managers police officers and 
other officials 
in september 1987 yugoslavias vice president hamdija pozderac 
resigned after being implicated in a bosnian agricultural company 
agrokomerc that issued uncovered bills of exchange worth the 
equivalent of nearly 1 billion 
the managers of agrokomerc now on trial reportedly relied on 
their influence with local politicians to persuade banks to issue 
the uncovered bills 
in october milanko renovica national communist party chief in 
198687 resigned from the ruling politburo over the scandal in neum 
according to press reports he used his influence to obtain 
illegal loans that financed a mansion in neum several apartments in 
sarajevo and an opulent lodge near his native village in the bosnian 
mountains 
todo kurtovic the communists top ideologue throughout the 
1970s was expelled from the party in december on grounds that he 
secured seven unusually favorable loans worth the equivalent of 
90000 to build his neum villa 
according to press accounts neither confirmed nor denied by 
authorities most of the villas of bosnian officials in neum were 
built free by bosnian companies and covered in white marble obtained 
at ridiculously low prices 
the realestate scandal first uncovered by bosnian journalists 
and later publicized by the press in belgrade has now led to the 
replacement of almost all of bosnias ruling elite 
they face confiscation of their property and even criminal 
charges press reports say 
mikulic has publicly denied widespread allegations that he was 
implicated in the realestate scandal staterun newspapers 
however published a list of landowners in neum and said mikulics 
wife owns a plot acquired under suspicious circumstances 
in an account similar to previous press reports the head of a 
bank branch in sarajevo dragan djodjic said in an interview 
bosnian politicians qualified for loans by having top bank 
executives order a brief transfer of foreign currency from the 
savings account of a yugoslav working abroad to the applicants 
account 
this he explained would temporarily provide the politician with 
the foreign currency on the books that he needed as collateral to 
secure the loan which would then be immediately approved 
the hard currency funds would immediately be returned to the 
original account making the transaction difficult to trace djodjic 
added 
since the repayment terms of the longterm loans did not include 
the usual adjustment provision for inflation which hit 250 percent 
at the end of 1988 repayments will soon be reduced to what the 
belgrade newspaper vecernje novosti called the value of a pack of 
cigarettes

labor industry and the government 
are joining in a crusade to save the fastdeteriorating environment 
of the netherlands described by a union chief as the trash can of 
the continent 
not only does pollution come from the netherlands own postwar 
industrialization it also flows down the rhine river from chemical 
plants in switzerland and west germany 
the pollution issue has been played down by officials in recent 
years although others have issued repeated warnings about the air 
water and soil but now unprecedented steps for the netherlands 
apparently are about to be taken 
the 900000member federation of dutch trade unions has linked up 
in the savetheenvironment effort with its traditional sparring 
partner the dutch organization of enterprises industrys major 
umbrella group 
premier ruud lubbers joined in on the governments side he told 
a group of foreign reporters one of our major future aims will be 
to establish an economic structure that safeguards the ecological 
balance 
queen beatrix devoted her entire traditional christmas address to 
the environment 
slowly the earth is dying and we think about what was 
previously unthinkable the end of life itself she told her 
subjects 
the new crusade reflects an unease in the netherlands over the 
declining quality of the environment which only a few decades ago 
was virtually unpolluted 
in recent years the dutch media have reported on the pollution 
of drinking water by pesticides and herbicides spilled into the 
rhine river by swiss west german and dutch chemical plants 
acid rain attributed mainly to nitrates rising into the 
atmosphere from manure used in netherlands huge agricultural sector 
and the countrys 5 million cars is rapidly becoming a prime 
environmental threat 
one chemical dump after another is being discovered under housing 
developments built in the 1960s and under new golf courses a recent 
government report estimated that about 9000 heavily polluted sites 
are scattered all over the netherlands leaching noxious substances 
into the ground water 
the netherlands is a prime manufacturer of chemicals petroleum 
products and electronic equipment 
care for the environment is such an essential task that i 
do not hesitate to say that for us it is the top priority said 
jan kamminga the chairman of the dutch association of small and 
mediumsized industries 
dutch companies should accept their responsibility and 
contribute substantially to the solution of the problem 
with 100000 affiliated companies employing 1 million of the 
netherlands 146 million people the association is one of the 
major players in the dutch industrial field 
after kamminga made his remarks in a speech johan van 
stekelenburg of a trade union group and chris van leede of the 
industry group held a news conference to announced their joint 
effort to save the environment 
they said they would include environmental issues in the 
collective bargaining process 
our declaration will not instantly change the world but it 
commits us to take such environmental issues into serious 
consideration van leede said in an interview later it is not 
an empty promise 
we must clean up the netherlands which is rapidly becoming the 
trash can of the continent van stekelenburg said 
given these huge problems the industry and union initiative 
can only be a beginning said marijke brunt a spokeswoman for the 
nature and environment foundation one of this nations most 
influential conservationist organizations if they fail to 
implement a radical restructuring of dutch industry within 10 years 
it will be too late 
such a turnaround of the dutch industrial complex would involve 
huge investments in purification plants research into alternative 
manufacturing technologies and the development of new products that 
are harmless to the environment such as biodegradable plastics 
controversy is brewing however over the question of who will 
pay for a cleaner environment the cost of which no authorities have 
even dared estimate 
premier lubbers told the foreign reporters pollution is not 
the result of activities of the government we will have to pay 
together as companies and citizens 
there is economic growth lets not add it all to profits or 
personal income but use part of it to improve the environment 
industrys kamminga differed he said that for the 
exportdependent dutch industry an unbridled rise in the 
production costs would be attempted suicide 
there must be a substantial government contribution he said

new tighter regulations intended to keep any questionable cases 
out of canada on arrival at airports and border stations took effect 
jan 1 
many people came here making refugee claims to circumvent our 
immigration laws mcdougall said we must restore integrity to 
our refugee and immigration system 
the change does not affect the prevailing immigration system 
which is expected to allow 150000 to 160000 people into canada 
this year through normal channels 
the government clearly believes a significant percentage of those 
claiming to be refugees are fleeing poor economic conditions rather 
than political persecution but the critics say otherwise 
dan heap immigration spokesman for the socialist new democratic 
party says the rising number of refugees can be pegged to the third 
worlds conflicts while the boom in jet travel has made it easier to 
reach canada 
significant numbers of refugee claimants came to canada in 1988 
from such countries as nicaragua iran sri lanka lebanon panama 
somalia el salvador and india 
the determination of refugee status is not an immigration 
question heap said in an interview at his district office its 
a human rights question 
in the house of commons heap represents the heavily ethnic 
trinityspadina district of downtown toronto a traditional 
destination for immigrants and refugees 
his solution is to devote enough staff to refugees hearings so 
their cases can be taken up within three months the hope is to 
remove the incentive for those who come to canada for a few years of 
higher pay checks while their cases drag on 
canada is the worlds second largest country in area but with a 
population of only 26 million much of its vast northern territory 
has limited potential for settlement unemployment was about 8 
percent in 1988 
at a community legal clinic not far from heaps office lawyer 
robert adamson works regularly with refugee claims 
its not as though people suddenly decided canadas the easiest 
place to get to he said there are reasons people leave their 
homes 
in addition to genuine refugee claims adamson said the general 
confusion surrounding canadian policy of the past few years has 
encouraged some to try to reach canada in hopes there would be 
another amnesty 
we see everybody he said if they dont have a refugee 
claim we tell them that 
but adamson said he expects the new system to screen refugee 
claims quickly will bog down before unrealistic timetables for fair 
hearings 
the backlog has built up since the supreme court in 1985 ruled 
that anyone claiming refugee status was entitled to a full hearing 
not just a review of documents as had been the system 
clark at the canadian council of churches said that while the 
government appears to believe canada has reached a level of 
saturation with refugees the churchs view is that we dont think 
were there 
he added that the practice has been good while the laws on the 
books allow the whims of the government of the moment he said 
the church councils goal is to bring the refugee laws into 
agreement with the practice 
canadas record of receiving refugees more than half a million 
since world war ii has been praised internationally 
roger white of the federal immigration department said it is the 
highest per capita level of the industrialized countries he said 
the number of refugee claims rose from 1800 in 1981 to 30000 last 
year 
white in a phone interview from ottawa said the system has been 
reeling in part because of unscrupulous consultants scam artists 
telling tales and basically aiding and abetting these influxes

during a kindergarten showandtell period in 
the occupied gaza strip a pupil told of throwing a rock at an 
israeli army jeep causing it to overturn and kill the soldiers in 
it 
it was all in the childs imagination of course said 
kindergarten administrator mary khas in describing what arab 
educators and psychologists say is a trend of violent fantasies of 
children growing up in the 13month palestinian uprising against 
israeli occupation of the gaza strip and west bank 
the experts said arab children who are 5 and 6 years old will 
become more aggressive as they become desensitized to the violence 
and predicted the israelipalestinian conflict may become more 
brutal as the children grow up 
all the children have these fantasies said khas director of 
the american friends service committees kindergarten program in the 
gaza strip which runs 14 schools for 1500 pupils 
she said the violent behavior also shows up on the playground 
when theyre alone they play a game called arabs and jews 
she said they bang on doors and arrest each other 
i saw one child who played an israeli holding another boys 
head to the sand and screaming yamous yamous lick it lick it 
imitating the hebrewaccented arabic the soldiers speak she said 
bethlehem universitys nadira kvorkian said such hostile feelings 
are spilling over into family life 
the children are learning how to deal with problems in a 
violent way and im seeing more family violence kvorkian said 
from last may to august she studied the effects of the uprising on 
80 palestinian children 11 to 14 years old 
when they have an argument with their brothers the first thing 
they think of is fighting of throwing stones she said 
kvorkian said the children also are becoming alienated from their 
families which they see as incapable of protecting them from the 
israeli army 
children complain that the family cant solve their problems 
and parents are now afraid of their children kvorkian said 
they try to keep the kids inside so they dont throw stones 
but the children want to act like men she said they feel that 
their parents have been sitting in the refugee camps and doing 
nothing for 40 years 
most of the refugees have been living in camps since fleeing from 
what is now israel in the 1948 middle east war others came to the 
camps after israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza 
strip from egypt during the 1967 arabisraeli war 
the generation gap was illustrated in another study in which the 
arab father the traditional role model in palestinian society was 
shown as virtually powerless in the dreams of 11yearold children 
in refugee camps 
in 58 out of 75 dreams involving the arabisraeli conflict the 
father was incapable of rescuing his family from the army according 
to a study by dr shafiq masalha for save the children an 
international relief organization 
masalha said that in a typical dream a child will say the army 
entered our house and tied up my father in front of my eyes i 
screamed god help us our lives are in danger then i woke up 
masalha and a research team of four interviewed 24 children in 
july 1988 for his clinical study 
he said 70 percent of the dreams he randomly collected centered 
on the israeliarab struggle in a similar study in 1982 the 
conflict appeared in 50 percent of the dreams 
in dreams there are more confrontations with the israeli army 
and the children are afraid masalha said but in the dreams i 
analyzed before the uprising the children sometimes panicked in the 
confrontations and the dreams became nightmares 
i see this much less now he said 
masalha said the children are growing less fearful of the 
military and increasingly identifying with the shebab the 
young rockthrowing palestinians who confront the israeli army 
it seems as though the children are relating to the shebab as a 
father figure masalha said 
one of the consequences of this change is that there are more 
confrontations with the israeli army he said 
khas said preschoolers have come to idolize the shebab 
they are the heros the strong people she said they are 
what kids want to be

a new president with an old problem george 
bush knows of no swift stroke that would free the american hostages 
in lebanon but he also knows that a signal to iran could help 
so the presidentelect says he can visualize a day of better us 
relations with iran a statement which in itself is a gesture he 
hopes could help produce keys to unlock the locks meanwhile he 
promises to pursue any path that might point toward freedom for the 
hostages 
eight years after the tehran embassy hostages were freed on 
president reagans inauguration day bush comes to the white house 
with nine americans held captive by lebanese kidnappers 
their plight had not produced the air of crisis that persisted 
while 52 americans were held in the embassy for 444 days until the 
hour reagan took office 
with smaller numbers and no identifiable villains to blame let 
alone televise nightly the case of the lebanon hostages is a 
nagging headache that wont go away 
reagan did not mention the hostages in his farewell address at 
his last news conference he said the united states eventually must 
negotiate with iran because they have control of these people 
bush isnt so certain that iran fully controls the situation 
my view is be alert to opportunity he said in an 
interview i think the cease fire between iran and iraq has 
potential for amelioration of that hostage situation but i think it 
would be improper to assume that iran controls a key to all these 
hostages i dont think we know that 
nevertheless the presidentelect believes improved us 
relations with iran could help im one who thinks its in our 
interest to have better relations with iran and im one who thinks 
that iran can take a handful of steps and demonstrate that they want 
better relations with the united states 
and so to the degree iran holds the key holds most of the keys 
to unlock the locks that could be helpful he said 
he emphasized his message to tehran theyll read this they 
know me i know their views i dont start off with the view 
that we always have to be at loggerheads with iran 
i also dont start off with the naive view that if you have 
some dramatic meeting thats going to result in the instant release 
of hostages who are not held by iran may be held by clients of 
iran 
meanwhile he promised the new administration will seek a way 
out we are not going to leave any rabbit trail unexplored 
the hostagetakers in lebanon do not directly reflect a 
government but instead shadowy groups of shiite moslem extremists 
operating in the turmoil of beirut still they are responsive to 
the will of iran three captive americans were freed while the 
reagan administration was sending secret arms shipments to iran in 
1985 and 1986 
longest held of the captive americans is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press kidnapped on 
march 16 1985 two months after president reagan began the term of 
office that ends on friday in addition to the nine americans at 
least seven citizens of other nations are held hostage 
the iranian hostage crisis was an issue in the presidential 
campaign of 1980 working to reagans advantage in the election that 
ousted jimmy carter but the dilemma of freeing them never became 
his they were released just as he took office the kidnappings in 
lebanon recreated the problem in a different form and led to the 
worst internal crisis of the reagan years the irancontra scandals 
the reagan administration found no solution despite the 
presidents early vow that our policy will be swift and effective 
retribution against hostagetakers there was no way to make 
retaliation work in lebanon 
since disclosure of the iran armsforhostages shipments the 
administration has played down the hostage situation it could not 
resolve 
bush insisted there was no decision to lower visibility and push 
the hostages down the administration agenda because of that episode 
he said that wasnt a matter of policy 
but it certainly was a matter of fact

on the road in from the airport is a 
gleaming new shopping center called galleria after its lookalike 
in houston texas 
the complex includes turkeys first foreign department store a 
branch of the french printemps chain nearby are a kentucky fried 
chicken a pizza hut and a mcdonalds 
the mall is an eyecatching symbol of the economic transformation 
turkey has undergone since premier turgut ozal launched his economic 
liberalization policies after coming to office in 1983 
the economy spurred by massive government spending is the 
fastest growing in western europe with an average annual real growth 
rate of 7 percent for the past three years 
and despite soaring inflation foreign capital is pouring in 
the state planning office authorized 536 million in new foreign 
investment applications in 1987 and 800 million in 1988 bringing 
up total foreign investment in the country close to 3 billion 
although foreign investment is a still a fraction of domestic 
investment it is 10 times what it was in 1980 
arab japanese and west european capital have a share in the 
increase but the most impressive entries have been by us 
companies whose numbers have risen from 16 in 1980 to 100 in 1988 
ibrahim cakir head of the state planning offices foreign 
investment department predicts an injection of at least 1 billion 
of foreign capital this year 
not everyone is so optimistic 
turkeys private sector is being squeezed by the governments 
tight monetary policies designed to combat inflation which averaged 
75 percent in 1988 inflation was 40 percent in 1987 
anticipating lower demand turkish manufacturers have started to 
cut back production with the car industry in the lead 
one concern is that inflation will devalue the original capital 
once it comes in and is converted into turkish lira 
if ozals economic stabilization program is successful in 1989 
and inflation declines confidence in turkey will remain strong 
specialists say 
inflation is a shortterm problem it will not wipe out all the 
gains said attila uras manager of the manufacturers hanover 
trust branch in this financial capital 
an executive for the cocacola co thinks investments undertaken 
so far will lure in additional investments a new investment by 
cocacola of 135 million encouraged american national can co to 
enter turkey with an equal amount for a new bottling plant for the 
softdrink industry 
one main attraction for the foreign investor is the size of the 
domestic market executives say turkeys population is 55 million 
and growing 
turkey is advantageously situated at the crossroads of the middle 
east and eastern and western europe markets where turkish 
businessmen already have made significant inroads 
other attractions include the tourism potential of a country with 
miles of unpolluted aegean and mediterranean coasts a lowwage 
labor force and liberal rules and regulations company executives 
say 
all sectors are open to foreign investment and tax breaks are 
available foreign companies can own all the shares in a turkish 
venture and they can send profits home freely 
red tape has been reduced significantly an application that took 
years for approval is now handled in a month or two said cakir of 
the state planning office 
hopes are also pinned on turkeys bid to become a full member 
eventually of the european economic community although prospects 
for the new future are considered dim 
there have been a series of foreign buyouts among them procter 
and gambles buyout of a local detergent manufacturer and the 
takeover of a paper company by james river of the united states 
the ozal government also hopes foreign firms will buy shares in 
turkish public sector companies 
turkish stocks worth 60 million are expected to be floated this 
year on the new york stock exchange the international finance corp 
is underwriting the project 
one drawback for many turks and foreign lenders is turkeys 
foreign debt which has risen from 16 billion in 1980 to 39 
billion 
at the same time economic growth has yet to benefit turkeys 
masses in real terms annual per capita income has been hovering 
around 1200 for the past 15 years because of the steady 
devaluation of the turkish lira and high population growth rate of 
25 percent

although some pressures have been eased 
restrictive laws and the prosecution of opposition journalists still 
hinder press freedom in chile news executives say 
there is an impending threat that makes many journalists resort 
to selfcensorship said emilio filippi executive editor of the 
opposition newspaper la epoca the situation is serious 
especially because many journalists are being tried by the 
military 
eighteen chilean journalists currently are being tried by 
military courts in 28 different cases all of them on charges of 
offending or defaming the armed forces 
a journalist can be arrested if a military official deems an 
article or broadcast to be offensive to him or his service even 
though the report is true 
a navy prosecutor has requested jail sentences of four and three 
years respectively for fernando paulsen chief editor of the 
opposition weekly cauce and ivan badilla a reporter for the 
magazine it was believed to be the stiffest sanctions ever sought 
in a press trial paulsen and badilla are accused of offending the 
navy in a story suggesting that it agreed to an inflated price in 
the purchase of frenchmade helicopters 
nine other journalists face charges before civilian courts 
a 1988 report by lawyers of the vicary of solidarity the roman 
catholic churchs human rights agency in chile said 34 different 
laws affect freedom of the press 
the report also criticized what the vicary perceived as an 
increased reliance on military courts to deal with the press 
the government in recent years has chosen the military courts 
as an extraordinarily useful deterrant against the media and free 
public information it said 
the military codes were changed twice in recent years to stiffen 
penalities for opinion or press crimes according to jose 
galiano a lawyer who works as an adviser for the chilean 
journalists association 
one change he noted in an interview increased from five years 
to 10 the maximum penalty for any journalist found guilty of 
offending the armed forces or any of their units or members 
making the situation more serious galiano said the law now does 
not require that an article had to be false for it to be a crime if 
it offends a member of the military the journalist who authored 
it can be tried and sentenced 
in other words the lawyer said if you write that the 
secret police tortured a prisoner you can be jailed even if you 
prove that your report was correct because accusing someone of 
being a torturer is certainly an offense 
the result galiano said is that it has become virtually 
impossible to talk in critical terms of the armed forces 
many journalists do take note however that the military 
government has allowed a marked opening to the chilean press in 
recent months especially since the oct 5 referendum in which 
voters rejected a military proposal that the president and army 
commander gen augusto pinochet remain in office until 1997 
after the referendum the government allowed a real opening 
including in television la epocas felippi said but the 
restrictive laws are still there posing a clear danger 
filippi noted that the government announced it is studying a new 
press law to streamline and unify the legislation existing now 
and that is also very dangerous because every time new press 
legislation was passed under this government it was to stiffen 
penalties and impose new restrictions he said 
on new years eve the government said it was ordering an end to 
the prosecution of journalists as a contribution to the necessary 
reconciliation in the country 
it later explained however that the action was limited to 
prosecution initiated by the interior ministry which deals in 
civilian cases only four journalists all tried by civilian courts 
were favored by the decision all other trials including those 
before military courts are to continue 
the government claims it cannot interfere with those trials 
but thats false said jaime moreno president of the journalists 
association we all know that gen pinochet is not only the 
president of the republic but also the commander of the armed 
forces and of the army 
as such he has the decisive word on anything related to the 
military courts moreno said 
what we see here is the lack of a real political will by the 
government to stop prosecution of journalists

greeces new commissioner in the european 
economic community is vasso papandreou a former socialist radical 
who once wanted greece out of the organization 
she and christiane shrivener 63 of france are the first women 
to serve on the 17member eec commission which is made up of senior 
executives and now is charged with preparing for the removal of all 
remaining trade barriers within the 12nation community by the end 
of 1992 
the 44yearold ms papandreou a close friend of but not related 
to greeces socialist premier andreas papandreou was appointed by 
jacques delors the commissions president as with all other 
commissioners she is expected to act independently of her country in 
shaping eec policy she has been assigned the communitys taxation 
and customs union portfolio 
the commission recognizes that social affairs have been left 
behind she said in an interview there is a lot of work to be 
done and success depends both on commission policy and my activity 
a farmerss daughter from southern greece ms papandreou studied 
economics at athens higher school of commercial and economic studies 
and then earned a phd at reading university in england 
she belonged to a generation of young leftists who bitterly 
opposed the 196774 military dictatorship in greece and who were 
inspired by andreas papandreous radical socialist policies 
including pledges to take greece out of the eec and the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
but after leading his panhellenic socialist movement pasok to 
power in 1981 papandreou decided it would be too costly to take 
greece out of the eec 
as one of the trade blocs poorer members greece receives more 
than 15 billion a year in benefits premier papandreou and the 
government are now enthusiastically proeuropean 
asked how she reconciles her radical and marxist past with her 
new job the tall darkhaired ms papandreou said its not me 
thats changed but pasok 
as deputy industry minister while greece held the eec presidency 
during the second half of 1988 ms papandreou chaired meetings on 
streamlining industrial legislation in the community 
in the maledominated world of greek politics ms papandreou and 
culture minister melina mercouri the former actress who starred in 
never on sunday have proved the only female highfliers in the 
socialist government 
in her first government post as director of the organization for 
small and mediumsize businesses for two years from 1981 ms 
papandreou often was assailed by conservative businessmen who 
accused her of trying to impose marxist policies 
but her twoyear stint as deputy commerce minister after winning 
a parliament seat in 1985 impressed even those critics 
ms papandreous portfolio on the eec commission will be a 
sensitive one 
socialist eec membergovernments currently in the majority will 
be seeking to expand labor laws and increase social security 
payments 
but the conservative governments are likely to oppose more social 
welfare legislation that might further complicate the 1992 goal of 
moving services goods and money freely around the community 
ms papandreou says that during her years in government she has 
learned the art of compromise crucial in building community policy 
one always has to compromise she said but im taking a 
positive view and this will be a challenge and a great experience 
she is very intelligent a very good diplomat and knows how to 
maneuver said christos papoutsis a socialist member of the 
european parliament who has known ms papandreou for 15 years

the abusive broadcast host is a recent media phenomenon hence 
talk radio is a timely film it is also a disturbing one not 
fully realized but mesmerizing in its portrayal of a man obsessed 
by his power to command and destroy 
talk radio is the latest film from oliver stone who is 
establishing himself as the sociallyconscious filmmaker of the 
1980s he directed the film and cowrote it with eric bogosian who 
created the role on the stage in his own play such conceptual 
closeness is ideal for this kind of intensely personal film 
barry champlain emerges in all his ferocity playing the hold 
buttons on his console like the phantom of the opera at the organ 
unlike the play the movie affords flashbacks to disclose how he got 
there in the 60s he was a clothing salesman to the elite of 
dallas his only rebellion indicated by shoulderlength hair 
as guest on a talkshow barry sabotages the host by responding 
to callers with his outrageous opinions soon its the barry 
champlain show and his nightly communion with his 
listenervictims dominates his life destroying a seemingly happy 
marriage to ellen green 
most of talk radio takes place appropriately within the 
broadcast studio barrys aides are his concerned assistant leslie 
hope and the patient engineer john c mcginley he is harried by 
the devious studio manager alec baldwin and the radio syndicator 
john pankow who wants to take barry national 
stone inexorably constructs the tension between barry and his 
callers drawing fine performances from unseen actors on the 
telephone line perhaps he was aiming for the claustrophobia of the 
radio studio but constant viewing of the same set does become 
wearing even camera stunts such as the 360degree turn at 
bogosians climactic oration dont help 
bogosians capacity to sustain a portrayal on one shrill note is 
impressive indeed ellen greene and leslie hope offer welcome 
periods of calm and all of the actors perform admirably a hallmark 
of oliver stones films a marvelous bit is provided by michael 
wincott as a bombedout caller who pays a call to the station 
talk radio was produced by edward r pressman for cineplex 
odeon films and released by universal pictures the r rating is 
largely for language and adult subject matter running time 110 
minutes

videos reviewed this week the unbearable lightness of being 
the pointsman the great outdoors 
 
 
the unbearable lightness of being orion home video 
vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
the unbearable lightness of being is yet another triumph for 
philip kaufman a filmmaker of great depth and vision who is able to 
grasp a complex work and distill it for mass consumption without 
losing its spirit or essence he made tom wolfes vast celebration 
of american flyboys the right stuff into one of the industrys 
most original and interesting films 
he faced an even greater challenge with milan kunderas 1984 
philosophical sensual and political novel about deeply troubled 
times in czechoslovakia during the soviet invasion of 1968 
the movie captures the spirit of what filmmaking is all about 
great storytelling compelling characters original and beautiful 
visuals it is epic yet intimate poignant yet funny tragic yet 
inspiring 
tomas daniel daylewis a noted neurosurgeon in prague is a 
hopeless womanizer who simply says take off your clothes and 
women oblige with the speed of a zipper into his life comes tereza 
juliette binoche a shy but sensual country girl and they marry 
but he continues to see his mistress sabina lena olin an artist 
who fears commitment of any kind 
soviet tanks roll into prague just as tensions threaten the 
marriage tomas and tereza join protests and finally flee to 
switzerland rather than succumb to soviet rule sabina also shows up 
in switzerland where the triangle continues however life there is 
a lie and tereza goes home tomas follows knowing he will be 
punished by the authorities for his defection but he prefers the 
heaviness of commitment to the lightness of freedom 
they are not happy in the city and finally flee to the 
uncomplicated rustic life of the farm 
it is good that kaufman takes his time telling the story which 
runs almost three hours there are too many human motivations to 
probe too many underpinings 
it is also good that he chose to cast daylewis my beautiful 
laundrette a room with a view in the lead there are 
marvelous performances by brioche and olin who perfectly balance one 
another and offer sensuality in different ways a scene in which 
they photograph one another in the nude is exceptionally directed 
and paced and celebrates the beauty of women 
the movie has been named best picture of 1988 by the national 
society of film critics and has been nominated for two golden globe 
awards including best picture it is perhaps the best american film 
in a decade and a welcomed diversion for the home screen

the pointsman vestron video vhsbeta 7998 rated r 
 
in europe railway switches are called points and those who 
switch them pointsmen a fact not unknown to seekers of metaphor 
who sometimes wonder in night thoughts what might have happened if 
at some time past they had taken another direction in their lives 
a beautiful elegantly dressed woman sits on a train that moves 
through a forlorn landscape she tears pages from a handwritten 
journal waking suddenly she mistakenly gets off the train at a 
switching station in the middle of nowhere and confronts the 
switchman 
the woman and the pointsman do not speak each others language 
they do not like each other she huddles outside with her luggage 
the train does not come she huddles inside the dank station still 
the train does not come she stays 
seasons change and still she remains she and he work out a modus 
vivendi as domestic as a marriage 
this movie is tough sledding not your typical thrillcrazed 
rental its a demanding eerie densely metaphoric parable about 
men and women and its beautifully photographed and intensely 
wellacted 
its too cold too abstract a movie to love but it can be 
experienced and felt and on a strictly emotional level it succeeds 
brilliantly as huckleberry finn said of another parable the 
statements was interesting but tough

workers playtime elektra billy bragg 
 
electric folkster billy bragg poses the question himself in this 
records signature tune waiting for the great leap forwards 
mixing pop and politics he asks me what the use is so i offer him 
embarrassment and my usual excuses 
excuses hardly what billy bragg has made is a record of 
stinging social criticism but with overtones of hope for humanity 
and even of love 
workers playtime with its hammerandsickle logo and 
collective farm cover looks like it should contain nothing but 
tributes to lenin and marx bragg does sing of revolutions and 
social injustice in his cockney twang but its when he touches the 
common emotions shared by all that he really hits home 
on most tunes bragg strums an electric guitar backed by pianist 
cara tivey sometimes with a full band and sometimes not hes 
capable of spritely pop such as shes got a new spell and the 
price i pay the latter a lament about a lost love in which bragg 
says he would walk a mile with a stone in my shoe to regain it 
relationships and the trouble with keeping them intact are the 
subject of seven of the 11 songs the best must i paint you a 
picture is a tender bass piano and guitar piece in which bragg 
sings the temptation to take the precious things we have apart 
to see how they work must be resisted for they never fit 
together again 
bragg goes solo literally on the a cappella song tender 
comrade about a pair of army buddies trying to decide whether or 
not they were really brave under fire the strong lyrical content 
makes instruments unnecessary 
a pair of country tunes tackle completely different subjects the 
honkytonk life with the lions deals with a man who hates what 
his life has made him become while rotting on remand is a 
steelguitar flavored tale of injustice that ends you dont turn 
criminals into citizens by treating them this way 
the album ends with the rocking waiting for the great leap 
forwards featuring backing vocals by michelle shocked and martin 
belmont on guitar in which bragg wonders whether things ever will 
change in the world in a perfect world wed all sing in tune but 
this is reality so give me some room 
billy braggs music is a delicate mixture of folk rock and 
country with some of the strongest lyrics this side of early bob 
dylan the albums leftist look shouldnt deter listeners from 
finding the heart of gold inside

reputation polydor brian spence 
 
drop the needle on reputation the first song on newcomer 
brian spences album and youll hear some burbling bass 
callandresponse vocals and a pleasant daryl hall imitation keep 
the record going for the second song and youll hear the same thing 
virtually identical so much so youll check your stereo for a 
malfunction 
not a good sign for a new artist trying to establish his identity 
in a competitive music scene spences record is designed to fit 
neatly on increasingly restrictive aor album oriented rock 
playlists 
as such its paintbynumbers rock devoid of personality except 
for the clue of guitars tuned to sound vaguely like bagpipes the 
edinburghborn spence could just as easily have been from illinois 
or california or canada 
there are a couple of breathy ballads to prove to women that 
spence is a sensitive guy theres the roughhousing you got the 
whip to prove to men he isnt reputation and come back 
home the first two songs are extremely radio friendly 
this is all done with reasonable skill although spence is 
annoyingly ungrammatical learn the difference between your and 
youre brian its the kind of record likely to be forgotten two 
minutes after its heard

symphony no 7 leningrad by dmitri shostakovich leningrad 
philharmonic orchestra conducted by mariss jansons emi 
 
in the era of glasnost emi brings us a quintessentially russian 
performance of shostakovichs seventh symphony the leningrad 
a work seized on by soviet propagandists as a patriotic symbol its 
first three movements were written in the summer of 1941 when hitler 
was marching on the composers native leningrad 
but as the composer told solomon volkov in the book 
testimony its not about leningrad under siege its about 
the leningrad that stalin destroyed and that hitler merely finished 
off 
there cant be much argument about this performances 
authenticity mariss jansons who studied with yevgeni mavrinsky 
the first conductor of many shostakovich pieces leads the 
leningraders in a wiry lean performance he paces nicely the first 
movement march theme as it builds slowly from the fragile lyrical to 
the clownish to the terrifying supposedly symbolizing hitlers 
march on the city 
the generally agile strings produce a slightly grainy sound when 
called for and the winds can produce a fine edge jansons is not 
afraid to get ugly when thats appropriate 
a caveat the oboe has a somewhat cloying overvibratoed sound 
balances in the winds are good overall the orchestra sounds set 
back on a stage wih the listener somewhere in the middle of a large 
hall 
speaking of halls the only nonauthentic aspect to this compact 
disk is where it was recorded the konserthus in oslo

eric bogosian always knew he wanted to be an 
actor but he was never convinced that he could become a star until 
he saw dustin hoffman in midnight cowboy 
i must have been around 16 or so bogosian recalled i 
wasnt pursuing acting fullforce by then but i knew i loved it i 
loved it the only problem was there werent a lot of lead actors 
who looked like me in the late 60s 
so heres this guy dustin hoffman blowing the wheels off the 
screen it was such a courageous act he had just done the 
graduate and he didnt care how he looked he was just going to 
throw himself totally into this role that really set the bead for 
me as to what i wanted to do 
it took a while but bogosian at 35 has achieved his goal a 
starmaking role in a movie talk radio he delivers the kind of 
performance that cries out for an academy nomination 
a slender nervous man with blunt features and persianlamb hair 
he should have been familiar with the role of talkshow host barry 
champlain he wrote it played it in the theater and cowrote the 
movie script with director oliver stone 
talk radio has had a fascinating history 
i do a oneman show in which i play about 14 characters in an 
hour and a half bogosian recounted an artist named tad savinar 
saw my show in portland ore and liked it he asked if i ever 
listened to talk radio i said i didnt 
he said im addicted to it why dont you make your 
characters call you up and you can be the radio host so i made up 
this radio host who was pretty obnoxious and fought with people and 
hung up on them 
i had to make a character that people would watch for an hour 
and a half i found that no matter how repellent i made the guy the 
audience in the theater liked him anyway i felt i had hit pay dirt 
you find a bad guy that people love and its a great role 
bogosian wrote a fulllength drama that opened to enthusiastic 
reviews at joseph papps public theater in new york in may 1987 
producer edward pressman true stories wall street signed 
up the film rights to talk radio and assigned bogosian to write 
a script 
pressman also acquired the rights to stephen singulars biography 
talked to death the life and murder of alan berg about the 
denver radio host who was slain by neonazi fanatics the book 
supplied leftwing politics a subplot about an exwife as well as 
other personal matters but many of the callins remain the same as 
in the play 
talk radio now sought a director one applicant said he 
wanted merely to film the play bogosian said no he wanted it to be 
a movie another director told pressman id love to do it how do 
we get rid of bogosian no way said the author he alone would 
play barry champlain 
oliver stone who had been overseeing the scriptwriting for 
pressman finally agreed to direct as a little project while he 
was waiting to do a big one bogosian suggested the film was shot 
for 45 million in dallas on a tight schedule 
oliver loves that kind of stuff bogosian said he moves 
and he has a great crew the same guys who shot platoon and wall 
street they work very very fast and they love to come up with 
all kinds of camera tricks and new techniques the harder it is the 
more they like it 
it was in his home town of woburn mass where bogosian was 
first inspired by viewing the graduate the son of 
firstgeneration armenianamericans he was already appearing in the 
woburn drama guild and he pursued acting at the university of 
chicago and oberlin college which awarded him a degree in drama in 
1976 in new york he and his australiaborn wife lived in a tiny 
apartment while he tried to find an audience with his monologues 
i quit acting a number of times but i would sort of float back 
and start doing it again he said 
bogosian and champlain have been passionately connected for the 
past few years and the actor admits a certain fascination with his 
fictional counterpart hes like on a road to destruction his 
appetite for the audience keeps growing and hes destroying his 
personal life that can only lead to suicide or breakdown or 
something that wont work after a while 
i love playing barry because hes funny hes exciting hes 
energetic he fits me like a glove hes got this voice and i got a 
voice i thought it was a great part there arent great parts 
available for me at least not at the time i started doing barry

one breath on the viewfinder of his camera as 
he photographed a pack of six arctic wolves taught jim brandenburg 
the difficulties of shooting in frigid temperatures when excited 
the warm moist air coated the viewfinder glass with a layer of 
ice 
this must be scraped off with your fingernail which means 
removing your two sets of gloves which means freezing your 
fingers brandenburg recounts in his book white wolf living 
with an arctic legend 
the 160page book which evolved from a may 1987 national 
geographic cover story recounts in words and photographs the 
summer of 1986 when brandenburg and biologist l david mech lived 
among a pack of wild white wolves on ellesmere island 500 miles 
from the north pole 
brandenburg first spotted the arctic wolf pack while 
photographing the historic dogsled journey to the north pole led by 
will steger he persuaded national geographic to let him do a story 
on ellesmere island and asked mech who has devoted the past 30 
years to the scientific study of wolves to accompany him 
mech also wrote a book about the experience the arctic wolf 
living with the pack after deciding against collaborating with 
brandenburg on a single book 
photographs included in brandenburgs book have won many 
prestigious awards including magazine picture story of the year 
and first and second place in the nature category from the national 
press photographers association first place in the nature category 
from the world press photography contest and the no 1 cover for 
1987 in a national geographic survey 
he also was named 1988 wildlife photographer of the year by bbc 
wildlife magazine and kodak for his white wolf photographs 
brandenburg 43 a minnesota native who began working as a 
contract photographer for national geographic society after working 
as a photographer for the worthington daily globe had been 
photographing wolves in their natural habitat for 20 years before 
going to ellesmere island he had photographed wolves in canada 
alaska northern minnesota china and the soviet union 
but its the ellesmere island experience that stands out this 
story was the most important story ive ever done this is the 
highlight of my career brandenburg said 
although there were hardships temperatures ranged from 70 
degrees below zero to 70 degrees above zero and brandenburg 
destroyed the cartilege in his knees kneeling on the ice those 
arent the things that stand out in his memory 
i dont remember one difficult day i just remember a positive 
dream it was wonderful all the way through brandenburg said 
their tolerance of me up there is probably the most profound 
feeling i have 
when brandenburg returned to the island last spring to do some 
followup work for the book he crawled into the wolf den to 
photograph pups a first in nature photography 
i had spent so much time that they werent concerned with my 
proximity to the pups he said i was more concerned about my 
intruding into what was an intimate bedroom i wouldnt have done it 
if i thought there would be a problem 
the mother of the pups came back into the den a few minutes after 
brandenburg left he said and the animals resumed their routines 
sometimes i forget im actually working for a living with this 
i dont think of it as a business its sort of a passion i cant 
stop doing it 
the book with a first printing of 50000 copies and a second 
printing planned is the culmination of that passion 
there is something about a book that is really precious he 
said its a cultural thing its almost like giving birth to a 
child 
craftsmanship isnt the only reason brandenburg takes pride in 
the book 
i think the book is making a difference in peoples attitudes 
toward nature and especially toward wolves he said even if it 
makes 10 people change their ideas about wolves its worth it to 
me those rewards are greater than the financial ones 
brandenburg who studied art in college and has never taken a 
photography course said he considers it important that his 
photographs are both accurate and artistic 
he tries to present work that will attract people who normally 
arent interested in science or the environment i feel with the 
environmental problems we have we are going to have to get into 
peoples hearts rather than their heads 
a small gentle man with haunting pale blue eyes brandenburg 
speaks of nature with quiet reverence 
my god is what i see and what i breathe and what i feel he 
said i know we have something here a certain kind of heaven 
that we are despoiling and thats a sin i think we should live in 
harmony with the environment 
in keeping with that philosophy he is donating some of the 
profits from his book to wolf education and environmental education 
some of the proceeds are going to the wolf ridge environmental 
learning center on lake superiors north shore and the environmental 
group defenders of wildlife 
he is also organizing a benefit concert for wolves which will 
feature musicians paul winter and james taylor 
that is the most satisfying thing of all trying to change 
peoples attitudes toward creatures i love and respect 
brandenburg said

in the early 1980s loverboy dominated radio with 
such hits as turn me loose and working for the weekend 
although their mainstream powerpop music wasnt popular with 
critics corporate rock it was called millions of fans played 
loverboys records loud 
according to guitarist paul dean however the group then went 
soft in 1984 when lead singer mike reno made a duet with hearts 
ann wilson on the ballad almost paradise a smash hit from the 
soundtrack of footloose 
loverboy had been regarded as just another faceless band but 
suddenly renos trademark headband made him famous around the world 
the rest of the group meanwhile remained largely unknown 
dissension set in now dean says were not communicating that 
great 
almost paradise made mike a ton of dough for five hours 
work dean said we went from being a high energy rock band to 
being a ballad band people just got ideas our record company would 
come up to us and say look what journey did with ballads 
on hard core deans first solo album the guitarist 
dispenses with loverboys keyboard sound and delivers nine songs 
that are sure to test the most expensive speaker systems 
i was being buried by a keyboard player and production team 
dean said of his later work with loverboy 
dean put together his own band for hard core from loverboy 
came drummer matt burnette a longtime friend geraldo domenelli 
helps out on guitars and dave watson who played bass for country 
star lee greenwood rounds out the group 
i started rehearsing a trio while mixing the last loverboy 
album dean said i was not involved in the production of that 
album i was in a 35 an hour studio rehearsing and making demos 
also chipping in are some hard core rock n rollers fellow 
canadian bryan adams kiss member paul stanley and jon bon jovi 
who plays harp on the adams composition draw the line 
stanley wrote the albums first single sword to stone a 
song dean originally meant to record with loverboy 
i played it for the guys in the band and they laughed and said 
get serious there are a lot of things that mike cant stand he 
wants to sing good time stuff i guess he felt it was too heavy 
metal 
deans own roots are a combination of country and rock he was 
born in 1946 in british columbia and recalled listening to a country 
music station from spokane wash on radio at night 
johnny cash was an early hero but so were the ventures an 
instrumental group in the early 60s best known for walk dont 
run 
i wore out that record he said i had quarters on the tone 
arm trying to get it to play one more time i had the first 10 
venture albums and learned all the parts i drove my parents mad 
but thats the idea isnt it 
he didnt fare much better with employers after attending the 
university of british columbia he tried holding a job during the 
day and playing in bands at night it didnt last very long 
i worked with the cocacola company as a deliverer for a week 
i was sleeping on the job because i was playing bars until 3 dean 
recalled i also had jobs in warehouses i was good for maybe 
a month or two but i just couldnt handle it 
even playing full time deans career made little progress until 
1978 when he met reno in calgary and the two decided to put a band 
together i was tired of working with front men and putting all my 
energy behind then and getting screwed in the end he said 
dean came up with the name for the group in 1979 i was looking 
through some magazines sitting on the table glamour and cosmo 
just sitting on the table there were cover girls everywhere and i 
thought coverboy then loverboy 
their selftitled debut album came out in the fall of 1980 and 
went platinum in the united states and canada with the release of 
get lucky in 1981 and the smash hit working for the 
weekend loverboy established itself as one of the worlds hottest 
bands 
it was like a magic plan that worked dean said i had been 
in so many bands and thought this is how it should work i was 
always one thing short when it all finally happened i was really 
impressed 
in 1983 loverboy released keep it up another platinum 
seller which yielded the hit singles hot girls in love and 
queen of the broken hearts lovin every minute of it which 
came out in 1985 had three more hits but by the time notorious 
was released two years later the thrill was gone 
i felt i wanted to keep the band together dean said but 
the tunes on notorious were not the best 
so the days of filling arenas with screaming fans are over for 
now dean is back to playing clubs again hoping to build an 
audience for his solo record 
i dont think theyre waiting in line with baited breath i 
dont think anyone even knows about the record to be honest not 
many people are even aware that the band is taking a break from each 
other

as both a devoted scholar and practicing 
mormon the late historian eugene e campbell knew well the hazards 
of challenging the more cherished versions of his churchs history 
in his recently published book establishing zion campbell 
notes the risks and then carefully proceeds to inject a grain of 
salt into popular tales of the mormon pioneers 
published by signature books two years after campbells death in 
1986 the book chronicles the church of jesus christ of latterday 
saints from the colonization of the salt lake valley in 1847 through 
its initial battles with the federal government over polygamy in the 
late 1860s 
the book originally was intended as part of an official 
multivolume history the church the project was scrapped in 1981 
after leaders became uncomfortable with research by campbell and 
others but the historians were allowed to seek independent 
publication of their writings 
the version that was published was a version he was hoping 
would pass by the church censors if he had known it was going to 
signature it might have been a different book said campbells 
daughter mary ann payne he might have been harder on mormon 
founder and leader brigham young 
nevertheless campbell an awardwinning historian and professor 
at the mormon churchs brigham young university gives some of 
utahs most fabled moments a new perspective 
for instance popular lore holds that the first mormon pioneers 
who entered the salt lake valley tamed a harsh barren desert and 
made it bloom drawing from the pioneers own diaries campbell 
notes that many in the intitial company actually described the 
valley as a veritable garden green inviting and wellwatered by 
snowfed streams 
did seagulls miraculously save the pioneers first crop by 
gobbling hordes of ravenous crickets during the summer of 1848 
the gulls did eat a lot of crickets campbell writes and some 
saw the phenomenon as providential but decades passed before the 
episode was hailed by the church as a miracle 
such notable mormons as young eliza r snow and parley p pratt 
made no mention of gulls in their accounts of that critical summer 
despite campbells concern to appease censors the book paints an 
unsparing portait of brigham young 
in a chapters dealing with mormons relations with the indians 
campbell points out that youngs idealistic hope of converting and 
civilizing the indians ultimately gave way to bloodshed and forced 
removal to reservations 
campbell recounts how young influenced by attacks on settlers 
ordered the extermination of all male indians in utah valley 
several days later the militia attacked a band of 70 male and 
female indians camped on the provo river slaying the last few as 
they fled across frozen utah lake 
i think it is by far the most objective books one of the very 
best weve got covering that period said fred gowans a byu 
history professor who assisted campbell with his original research 
in the early 1970s im sure there are people who would disagree 
but i think its very accurate 
campbell also illustrates youngs pragmatic side as an 
ecclesiastical leader young strongly urged mormons to resist the 
temptations of the california gold fields yet when the church found 
itself in dire financial straits young sent missionaries to pan 
to for gold and send the proceeds back to salt lake city 
payne said that after the church abandoned its history project 
campbell begain revising his manuscript toning down critical 
commentary hoping to have the work published by the churchowned 
deseret book or bookcraft a salt lake city company specializing in 
churchoriented books 
she said she completed the arrangements with signature following 
campbells death even though the manuscript was rough and the 
footnotes incomplete 
a quotation from campbells earlier writings included in the 
publishers foreword summarizes the authors own view of writing 
mormon history 
this is the challenge i face how do i bring a fresh new 
approach to a subject that has been heard many times before by 
church members without upsetting their faith or better yet while 
strengthening their faith let me suggest one rule i will never 
knowingly teach my students something they will have to unlearn 
later on

otis blackwell stumbled into a 
songwriting career and ended up composing hit records that have sold 
a remarkable 185 million copies 
in more than 30 years of writing he says hes used no guidelines 
in turning out such rock n roll hits as handy man dont be 
cruel return to sender and all shook up 
i wrote went home and prayed he said about his early years 
as a songwriter when he composed several hit records for elvis 
presley and great balls of fire and breathless for jerry lee 
lewis 
hes written more than 1000 songs that have been recorded by 
performers such as billy joel james taylor ray charles the who 
otis redding peggy lee and dozens of others in addition to presley 
and lewis 
it makes me feel wonderful for other people to do my songs and 
have them still be around and have people still wanting to do 
them blackwell says reflecting on a composing career few can 
match 
his favorite 
i dont know i have fun with all of them 
the 56yearold blackwell was a poor kid from brooklyn ny who 
wanted to be a singer he worked as a young man as a floor sweeper 
at a brooklyn theater and later as a clothes presser while 
recording tunes for a small new york company he was asked to write 
songs as well 
i was thrown into it he says about songwriting 
his songs in the years since have sold 185 million copies with 
presleys dont be cruel one of his first hits cheap trick 
recently had another hit version 
i guess the style was different he says about presleys 
version elvis came out with it and it was new and he was new 
about the cheap trick version he says i loved it it was done 
close to the way it was done the first time i was surprised it was 
so close the performance they did was superb 
another big seller was handy man a hit most recently for 
taylor but a song written and recorded years earlier it was out a 
few weeks before i heard it blackwell says i didnt even know 
who james taylor was it was a little different i had no idea it 
would catch on the way it did 
he wrote return to sender hoping it would be included in a 
movie presley would make 
it wasnt the same type of shuffle songs we used to do 
blackwell recalled i really didnt think he would accept it it 
was different compared to the type songs we had been pitching at 
him 
blackwell often sang the songs himself before they were recorded 
and some music historians believe his style influenced presleys 
i dont know except that we both sound alike blackwell says 
i used to do quite a few demos demonstration versions of songs i 
didnt write songs that were his style it was easy writing for 
him when i would do these things i would figure this is me singing 
and this is the way he would sing them so it came real easy 
he never met presley and feels his relationship with him was best 
kept at a distance we hadecord company and may put a band 
together and perform the songs hes written 
i enjoy singing the songs ive written because the people i 
perform for know the songs and like to sing along with me he says 
he offers few suggestions for writing songs 
what i find out is youve just got to get up and whatever 
comes i just throw the book away whatever that is i dont have 
any guidelines i try to write simple lyrics i try to write clear 
lyrics my lyrics must be simple and can be sung by kids 5yearsold 
on up i just try to figure out something not done before 
i made a lot of money and still do he said ive spent a 
lot foolishly i had my problems with the big house and big car and 
the good times and the government and i guess i had an alcohol 
problem at one time 
the wealth i have is knowing that my songs are still being done 
and ive helped a lot of writers whenever possible

shunned in the classroom and the playground they 
are the kids who are disliked by just about everybody 
some fly off the handle for no apparent reason some just dont 
seem to know how to act with their peers 
socially rejected children comprise maybe onetenth of the 
nations gradeschool classes they run a risk of truancy repeating 
grades becoming depressed and anxious and dropping out in later 
life they show heightened rates of juvenile delinquency and mental 
health problems 
recent research into why some children are rejected shows they 
are a mixed group many children apparently havent learned normal 
social skills others have learned the wrong lessons too well 
researchers are far from solving the problem but they say they 
have found ways to help some children at least temporarily 
were not turning rejected kids into wellliked welladjusted 
kids yet but were moving in the right direction said 
psychologist karen bierman of pennsylvania state university 
rejected children arent those who simply dont attract much 
attention from classmates or who lose battles for status among 
their peers theyre those kids who are at the real bottom said 
ken dodge psychology professor at vanderbilt university in 
nashville tenn 
a key mystery is whether the other troubles are caused by the 
experience of being rejected or stem from other factors and the 
rejection merely indicates a childs peers can identify those 
factors early said psychologist martha putallaz of duke university 
bierman suspects both play a role 
in any case researchers have proposed three major explanations 
for rejection lack of certain social skills aggressiveness and the 
way children of an ingroup treat nonmembers a given rejected 
child may be affected by more than one of these problems bierman 
said 
much research focuses on the idea that children are rejected 
because they lack certain social skills they consistently 
misinterpret peoples intentions for example and dont know how to 
enter groups of children at play or to solve common social dilemmas 
properly 
dodges research has shown that rejected children are less 
accurate than others in reading the intentions of people in 
videotaped vignettes they tend to assume hostility where none 
exists which is important because his work has also shown that 
much peer conflict arises through misinterpreted motives 
if a child bumps another and takes his place in line most 
children at the scene may realize it was an accident but the bumped 
child may misperceive the episode as an aggressive act and retaliate 
aggressively dodge said 
putallaz focusing on another skill found that unpopular 
gradeschool chhildren behaved differently from popular kids when 
they tried to join other children in play unpopular children were 
more likely to be disagreeable as in disapproving of anothers 
behavior or possessions and were also more likely to state their 
feelings talk about themselves ask questions and abruptly change 
the subject of conversation 
in short they seemed to be trying to call attention to 
themselves rather than blending into the activities of the group 
putallaz said the stategy did not go over well unpopular children 
needed more time and more attempts to enter a group than popular 
children did 
dodge said he believes the work applies to rejected children too 
programs that include teaching and practicing social skills can 
help improve some rejected childrens behavior for at least several 
months leading in some cases to improved social standing he said 
but children have not been followed long enough to show whether such 
programs can reduce the risk of later behavioral and psychological 
problems 
a second explanation for rejection is gaining acceptance as 
researchers focus on aggressive behavior of rejected children 
bierman said perhaps half to a third of rejected children are 
unusually aggressive she said 
these children may have learned at home that tantrums and other 
obnoxious behavior can get them what they want then they carried 
that lesson to school 
in this hypothesis the problem is parents who give a lot of 
commands but fail to back them up instead they occasionally give 
up in the face of yelling or tantrums the process escalates as 
parents become angry and essentially compete with their screaming 
children to see who can be more obnoxious 
in the end children learn from the process that anger is the way 
to solve a problem bierman said 
some researchers suspect such children find that if they get 
angry and scream in school situations such as losing an argument 
their peers and even teachers will let them have their way 
reinforcing the idea that aggression is the way to face a problem 
she said 
intervening with this kind of child involves working with 
parents teachers and peers so they no longer reward aggressive 
behavior research suggests such programs can help reduce 
aggression but are difficult to do in school because the children 
are so obnoxious others often hesitate to help bierman said 
the behavioral change often does not lead to better social 
status she said but her research suggests peers may be more likely 
to change attitudes if they are involved in the treatment they have 
a stake in the outcome and they get a chance to find a more 
likeable child beneath the veneer of aggression 
the third overall explanation for rejection deals with how 
rejected kids stay that way essentially it says that allegiances 
form between subgroups of peers and part of such ingroups is 
to identify and criticize nonmembers effectively keeping them out 
of the group 
children in this situation are helped by programs that combine 
them with ingroup members to work for a common goal so that 
ingroup children and the rejected child get a chance to view each 
other in a new light 
this strategy has shown some shortterm success in changing 
behavior but its longrange impact is not known dodge said 
regardless of the theory behind intervention programs for 
rejected children bierman said the programs appear to do the least 
good for the most severely rejected children 
and other key questions remain unresolved 
why do some children lack social skills most kids learn do 
children rejected in school tend to have the same problem in their 
neighborhoods or athletic teams could any support they find outside 
school be used to reduce their risk of the longterm problems 
associated with rejection 
despite the uncertainties and lack of effective treatment in some 
cases bierman said research does offer hope to some rejected 
children 
we know enough to start working with a child and family she 
said we know things to try and for some kids we will have very 
good success

dr vijay maker operates in a hospital his laser 
a magic knife that seals off blood vessels kills bacteria and 
reduces pain 
dr philip morris who works in an outpatient surgery center 
uses a laser to remove cancer from breasts and sends patients home 
hours later with so little pain that they only take one or two 
little pain pills 
the two are among a growing number of doctors who strongly 
advocate using lasers focused beams of light of a single color or 
wavelength for surgery they also illustrate a growing debate over 
what type of laser is best 
maker chief of surgery at grant hospital in chicago uses a 
laser called a yag short for yttrium aluminum garnet its beam 
prevents tissue from bleeding by heatsealing cells as they are cut 
the beam can travel through a flexible cord and in makers model 
of choice a penlike instrument directs the beam through 
crystalline tips that touch the surgical surface that means he 
says that surgeons who learned to respond to feedback from scalpel 
touching tissue make an easy transition 
morris at the surgery center in santa rosa calif uses a 
carbon dioxide laser which heats a thin layer of tissue until cells 
actually explode or disintegrate it also seals off small blood 
vessels 
maker says a carbon dioxide laser where the beam travels only in 
straight lines and must be turned by mirrors and where the beam 
touches skin but the instrument tip has no contact with the tissue 
is far less accurate 
youre shooting pretty much like target practice he said 
its a very crude way of doing a very fine surgery like 
mastectomy 
morris disagrees though he admits that a yag is much more 
precise 
he said a yag beam which reacts with red substances like blood 
is better for coagulation but the beam can penetrate deeper than 
what you can see so the next day a guy might blow a hole out of 
his stomach or colon 
the wavelength of a co2 laser makes it heat water and cells are 
90 percent water he said but even as one cell is disintegrated by 
the beam you dont hurt the tissue right next door 
dr leonard cerullo an associate professor of surgery at 
northwestern university school of medicine and director of the 
chicago neurosurgical center at columbus hospital said you 
really have to match the instrument to the surgical need i think 
its a mistake to say one size fits all 
despite difference over types of lasers maker and morris agree 
that laser surgery in many ways tops traditional methods of 
operating 
dr ellet drake secretary of the american society for laser 
medicine and surgery in wausau wis estimates that more than a 
million surgical procedures were done in the past year with lasers 
but he doesnt envision the scalpel being replaced in the forseeable 
future 
lasers should be used said drake a cardiologist when they 
either do something better or do it exclusively why use a 100000 
apparatus when you can get by with a 10 apparatus 
albert einstein first conceived the laser more than 50 years ago 
but it was 1960 before a usable one was built drake said 
ophthhalmologists were the first doctors to use them widely and 
about 90 percent in that field use lasers to treat ailments 
including detached retinas glaucoma retinitis and some cataracts 
he said most opthamologists use argon lasers which are lower in 
energy than yag or co2 models and the beams can pass through clear 
eye tissue to heat the bloodrich retina 
he said that lasers also are becoming more popular with 
obstetricians and gynecologists with applications from dissolving 
venereal warts to breaking up blockages in fallopian tubes in 
dermatology lasers have proven to be the best tools to lighten 
portwine stain birthmarks in cardiology lasers on the ends of 
flexible tubes can clear blockages from arteries and urologists can 
use them to break up kidney stones or cut out cancer from bladders 
dr francis lesperance an opthamologist at 
columbiapresbyterian medical center in new york city says a new 
laser could be used to reshape the retina and eliminate the need for 
corrective eyeglasses or contact lenses

if it werent for his wifes grandfather 
kent whealy might be just another journalist 
just before he died baptist ott gave whealy the seeds of a 
morning glory a large pink german tomato and a little pole bean he 
instructed whealy to preserve the seeds which had come from bavaria 
in the 1930s 
that was 16 years ago when whealy was fresh out of the 
university of kansas he now is editor and founder of seed savers 
exchange a small group in iowa working to save countless varieties 
of seeds from extinction 
animals just have more cuddle appeal its a lot easier to get 
the concern about an animal than it is to get concerned about a 
plant whealy said adding that the genetic erosion of seeds 
has been dramatic 
the us department of agriculture conducted a survey of the us 
and canadian garden seed inventory in 1903 a comparison between 
that list and the inventory of the governments largest seed 
collection in fort collins colo found that only 3 percent of 
the varieties available in 1903 are still in government 
collections he said 
thats the type of loss that has occurred in the last 80 
years 
genetic erosion of plant seeds is so abstract that most people 
fail to recognize it as a threat but rapidly changing weather 
patterns increased use of pesticides and chemicals and hardier 
insects will ultimately take a toll on the nations food crops 
whealy said 
if you look at the corn around here its just millions of 
acres and billions of plants that are genetically similar he 
said there are only six parent lines that make up all of the corn 
plantings in the us and three of those lines are so closely 
related they might as well be the same 
what im saying is that were in sort of an evolutionary race 
with the plants on one side and weather and disease and pests on the 
other were going to need all the genetic variability that we can 
lay our hands on to breed the crops of the future 
the situation is just ripe for epidemics of huge proportions 
much of the problem is economic 
in 1984 seed savers researched the entire us and canadian 
garden seed inventory and found 230 mailorder vegetable seed 
catalogs three years later 54 of the 230 had gone out of business 
the huge companies generally discontinue a line of seeds if they 
cant sell 500 packets he said 
the seed savers exchange attempts to fill that void it offers 
three publications a year the most important being the winter year 
book through this 250page journal more than 700 members who pay 
15 a year trade their seed collections many of them strains that 
go back generations 
whealy himself has strains of vegetable seeds dating to the 
mayflower 
this is the core of the seed exchange the year book lists 
4000 varieties and almost all of them are not available 
commercially he said a lot of it is very rare material that 
is almost extinct 
whealy lives on an 84acre farm with his wife and five children 
heritage farm as he calls it is an ideal place to plant the 
thousands of seeds he has collected stored in labeled jars and 
recorded on a computer 
out at the farm were keeping 2200 strains of beans 1500 
kinds of tomatoes and probably between 300 to 400 different kinds of 
peppers he said 
also at the farm whealy is raising a type of cattle called 
ancient white park which were hunted during the 12th and 13th 
centuries in england and only number about 100 now he said 
hes also raising iowa blue chickens a vanishing breed once 
prevalent in northeast iowa 
weve also hired an orchard manager who is doing research right 
now on varieties we would like to put into an historic apple 
orchard he said we imagine it would be 400 to 500 varieties of 
19th century apples

tantrums at home and lack of certain social skills a child may be 
affected by more than one 
programs that include teaching and practicing social skills can 
help improve some rejected childrens behavior for at least several 
months leading in some cases to improved social standing he said 
but children have not been followed long enough to show whether such 
programs can reduce the risk of later behavioral and psychological 
problems 
intervening with the overly aggressive child involves working 
with parents teachers and peers so they no longer reward such 
behavior research suggests programs can help reduce aggression but 
are difficult to do in school because the children are so obnoxious 
others often hesitate to help bierman said 
children rejected by ingroups are helped by programs that 
combine them with group members to work for a common goal so that 
ingroup children and the rejected child get a chance to view each 
other in a new light 
other key questions remain unresolved why do some children lack 
social skills most kids learn do children rejected in school tend 
to have the same problem in their neighborhoods or athletic teams 
could any support they find outside school be used to reduce their 
risk of the longterm problems associated with rejection

dr vijay maker operates in a hospital his laser 
a magic knife that seals off blood vessels kills bacteria and 
reduces pain 
dr philip morris who works in an outpatient surgery center 
uses a laser to remove cancer from breasts and sends patients home 
hours later with so little pain that they only take one or two 
little pain pills 
the two are among a growing number of doctors who strongly 
advocate using lasers focused beams of light of a single color or 
wavelength for surgery they also illustrate a growing debate over 
what type of laser is best 
maker chief of surgery at grant hospital in chicago uses a 
laser called a yag short for yttrium aluminum garnet its beam 
prevents tissue from bleeding by heatsealing cells as they are cut 
the beam can travel through a flexible cord and in makers model 
of choice a penlike instrument directs the beam through 
crystalline tips that touch the surgical surface that means he 
says that surgeons who learned to respond to feedback from scalpel 
touching tissue make an easy transition 
morris at the surgery center in santa rosa calif uses a 
carbon dioxide laser which heats a thin layer of tissue until cells 
actually explode or disintegrate it also seals off small blood 
vessels 
despite difference over types of lasers maker and morris agree 
that laser surgery in many ways tops traditional methods of 
operating 
dr leonard cerullo an associate professor of surgery at 
northwestern university school of medicine and director of the 
chicago neurosurgical center at columbus hospital said you 
really have to match the instrument to the surgical need i think 
its a mistake to say one size fits all 
dr ellet drake secretary of the american society for laser 
medicine and surgery in wausau wis estimates that more than a 
million surgical procedures were done in the past year with lasers

if it werent for his wifes grandfather 
kent whealy might be just another journalist 
just before he died baptist ott gave whealy the seeds of a 
morning glory a large pink german tomato and a little pole bean he 
instructed whealy to preserve the seeds which had come from bavaria 
in the 1930s 
that was 16 years ago when whealy was fresh out of the 
university of kansas he now is editor and founder of seed savers 
exchange a small group working to save countless varieties of seeds 
from extinction 
animals just have more cuddle appeal its a lot easier to get 
the concern about an animal than it is to get concerned about a 
plant whealy said adding that the genetic erosion of seeds 
has been dramatic 
the us department of agriculture conducted a survey of the us 
and canadian garden seed inventory in 1903 a comparison between 
that list and the inventory of the governments largest seed 
collection found only 3 percent of the varieties available in 1903 
are still in government collections he said 
seed savers exchange offers three publications a year offering 
more than 700 members who pay 15 a year the chance to trade 
their seed collections many of them strains that go back

evidence that cultivated vegetables 
found in a cave are half as old as was believed is forcing 
archaeologists to examine their assumptions about how agriculture 
was introduced in the southwest 
indians were once thought to have cultivated corn at bat cave 
along the southern rim of the plains of san augustin in southwest 
new mexico thousands of years before the agricultural lifestyle 
caught on throughout the region 
bat cave was excavated in 1948 and 1950 in an early application 
of radiocarbon dating researchers concluded that corn cobs found at 
the cave had been grown 6000 years ago the findings influenced a 
generations ideas about early agriculture said university of new 
mexico anthropologist wh wills 
a new excavation in 1981 and 1983 and reexamination of the 
earlier artifacts using updated radiocarbon techniques showed the 
corn bean and squash specimens from the site are 3000 to 3500 
years old 
those dates correspond to the age of domesticated plants in other 
sites in the southwest said wills who supervised the reexcavation 
based on the early findings researchers speculated that 
agriculture spread slowly because crops initially were a dietary 
supplement with limited value 
the newer findings and data from other agricultural sites in the 
mogollon highlands suggest that people must have considered corn 
beans and squash to be very important for their survival wills 
said cultivation of crops demanded a dramatic change in lifestyle 
for those people 
because people throughout the region all seemed to adopt 
agriculture at about the same time something might have happened to 
the environment to make the change worthwhile or necessary he said 
huntergatherers ranged over the southwest and northern mexico 
traveling hundreds of miles a year in small bands cultivating crops 
at high elevations would have required at least some to remain in 
one place for a growing season 
we tend to think of agriculture as inherently better than 
running around as huntergatherers but early plants were 
nutritionally deficient and farms faced the risk of poor weather or 
blight wills said 
corn squash and beans the staples of southwestern agriculture 
were first domesticated in the valley of mexico

the laboratory has launched more than 50 giant heliumfilled 
balloons that carry scientific payloads weighing up to 6000 pounds 
as high as 130000 feet nearly 27 miles 
most are released from the national scientific balloon facility 
in palestine texas the site is used when upperaltitude winds are 
from the east to avoid landings in heavily populated areas when 
the upper winds are from the west a launch area in fort sumner is 
used a series of balloons also launched from australia and 
antarctica to study last summers supernova which was observable 
only in the southern hemisphere 
the balloons that we fly regularly at palestine hold between 
11 million and 29 million cubic feet of helium connell said 
the large ones have 15 acres of plastic in them about as thick as 
a drycleaning garment bag that 15 acres of plastic will weigh

a tiny beetle from turkey may be the hero 
of colorados war against the russian wheat aphid which cost 
growers an estimated 26 million last year in damage and controls 
some winter wheat fields in moffat county suffered as much as 25 
percent infestation by the aphid last fall said bob hammond an 
entomologist with the state department of agriculture insectary 
here if this winter is mild the aphids will survive to cause more 
problems next spring he said 
but the scynmus frontalis beetle which looks like its cousin 
the ladybird beetle but is onefourth the size may save the day 
the scynmus imported by the us department of agriculture 
beneficial insects laboratory kills more russian wheat aphids than 
it can eat it kills an aphid briefly feeds then goes for a fresh 
kill it can rapidly clean out an aphid infestation where its 
slowereating cousin takes much more time 
the insectary soon will be raising the scynmus hammond said 
though it will take some time to begin mass production because of 
space limitations a new technique will have to be established to 
fit the facilitys size

the fermi national accelerator laboratory

its the first accelerator built exclusively for medical

medical center in california 
with conventional radiation xrays and gamma rays the beams 
go right through the patient said loma linda spokesman dick 
schaefer were losing 100000 people in the united states alone 
because we cant put enough radiation on the tumor without doing too 
much damage to the good tissue 
proton beams however come through good tissue at a tremendous 
rate of speed and come to a stop at the directed target schaefer 
said the loma linda accelerator will deliver 250 million electron 
volts 
proton therapy and neutron therapy so far available only through 
hospitals with access to major physics laboratories neutron 
therapy provided since 1976 to patients at fermilabs neutron 
therapy facility is available at a handful of us hospitals said 
fermilab physicist arlene lennox weve had people from india 
the philippines and all 50 states for treatment she said 
there has been talk of running it 24 hours a day because of the 
expected interest said schaefer loma linda is expected to take 
delivery this summer 
its been an international effort to benefit mankind he 
said researchers from sweden switzerland japan the soviet union 
and various parts of the united states contributed to the project 
the facility carried an initial pricetag of 40 million since 
augmented by 20 million from the us energy department ms lennox

northwest airlines has done better than its 
competitors in limiting costs but has been less profitable since its 
1986 merger with republic airlines the air line pilots association 
said 
northwest planes spent less time in the air and thus generated 
less revenue than those of american airlines delta air lines and 
united airlines from the beginning of 1986 through mid1988 the 
association said in a study reported this weekend 
the association which represents 4800 northwest pilots based 
its findings on an analysis of us department of transportation 
data the pilots and eagan minnbased northwest entered mediated 
bargaining in late 1988 after 19 months of negotiations failed to 
produce a new contract 
we found not only was northwest not making full use of its 
domestic resources both planes and employees but that this 
phenomenon was beginning to show up as a drag on the bottom line 
said pete quortrup a northwest copilot and association spokesman 
northwests domestic operating expenses increased by 5 percent 
from 1986 to 1988 the study said expenses increased at american 
and united during that period by 188 percent and 155 percent 
respectively it said 
but americans domestic operating revenues increased 291 
percent uniteds rose 274 percent and deltas grew 17 percent 
during the period while northwest revenues were up only 25 
percent it said 
profits for the period soared by 99613 percent at american 
3134 percent at delta and 939 percent at united northwest profits 
declined 397 percent during the 30month period the study said 
in addition it said the number of hours flown daily by each 
american delta and united plane increased during the period and 
declined at northwest 
the 1986 merger with republic prompted northwest to reduce 
service to many cities where both airlines had competed quortrup 
said but northwest left many newly available planes idle instead of 
assigning them to other routes he said 
northwest chairman steven rothmeier declined a request by the 
detroit news to be interviewed about the pilots study but gave 
written responses to several questions in a story published sunday 
rothmeier acknowledged that northwest scaled back use of its 
domestic fleet during the first six months of 1988 to get a better 
handle on customer service 
anybody who flew northwest in detroit knew the problems we were 
having poor ontime performance baggage mishandling and other 
complaints in large part all the result of inadequate airport 
facilities he wrote 
northwest also absorbed relatively high labor costs during the 
period including a 14 percent pay raise for former republic pilots

the eec commission said monday it had 
begun an inquiry into imports of audio cassette tapes from asia 
which are allegedly being sold in the 12nation trade bloc at below 
market prices 
the commission said it had opened the antidumping investigation 
after receiving a complaint from the european council of chemical 
manufacturers federations on behalf of eec producers of audio 
cassette tapes 
cefic claimed that the imports from japan south korea and hong 
kong rose 23 percent between 1984 and 1987 it said the three 
countries had exported 2345 million audio cassettes in 1987 up 
from 1906 million in 1984 taking their share of the european 
economic community market from 65 percent to 71 percent in 1987 
the complaint also alleges that the asian tapes were undercutting 
prices charged by eec producers by between 34 percent and 285 
percent 
cefic said that as a result of this price undercutting eec 
producers had had to lower their prices so much that they had 
suffered substantial reduction of their profits and significant 
losses 
eec producers production had dropped from 156 million audio 
cassettes in 1984 to 151 million in 1987 cefic said 
among the 20 exporters from hong kong named in the complaint who 
exported 242 million audio tapes in 1987 are magnetic enterprise

nearly three years of forced austerity have 
produced some encouraging signs for norways ailing economy but 
most people are still feeling the pinch of hard times 
oslo is listed as europes most expensive city by business 
international the geneva research company and bargains have long 
been hard to find anywhere in the country 
but real trouble came in the mid80s with a sudden drop in the 
price of oil a major norwegian export easy credit and plenty of 
money had given norwegians a spending habit and many households 
went in debt to buy television sets furniture foreign vacations or 
cars 
the last year people really have been buying less said anne 
titlerstad manager of tronsmo bookstore near the center of oslo 
i think people are cutting down on luxuries if you can call it 
luxuries like going to the cinema or taking a taxi 
as the banks tightened credit one result was a wave of 
bankruptcies last year 3494 companies filed bankruptcy petitions 
up 81 percent from the previous year most victims were small firms 
with less than 10 employees 
and though many countries might be envious of norways 32 
percent unemployment figure that december rate was more than double 
the figure for december 1987 and its expected to keep climbing 
unemployment is a necessary evil to improve the trade balance 
and hold down domestic demand said hans petter wilse an 
economist at norges bank the central bank the increase is not 
what we want but its necessary to avoid an even worse situation in 
the future 
the government of prime minister gro harlem brundtland a social 
democrat has had to enforce some unpopular measures to keep the 
economy afloat last summer a wage restriction law limited 
increases to one krone per hour or 15 cents 
the measure means that most workers are not keeping abreast of 
inflation which was measured at an annual rate of 56 percent in 
december it has however helped bring inflation down 
in 1987 inflation reached 87 percent wilse said the decline 
was encouraging but not as much as we had hoped 
other encouraging signs on paper at least are an improved trade 
balance lower interest rates and indications that norwegians are 
saving more 
central bank projections show that norway in 1988 will show a 
positive personal savings figure after three years of norwegians 
spending more than they earned 
that may be small comfort though to people trying to make do 
with less money especially since middleincome wage earners can 
expect to pay out about half their salaries in taxes 
a liter of milk costs about 640 kroner 96 cents a dozen eggs 
is 2185 327 a kilo 22 pounds of fresh sliced codfish runs 
75 kroner or 1122 shoppers pay 45 kroner and up for a pair of 
wool socks and 700 kroner or more for a pair of solid winter boots 
several norwegians said in interviews that widespread 
dissatisfaction could turn into trouble for the government which 
has been in office since the spring of 1986 income taxes have gone 
up every year since then and a national election is scheduled sept 
11 
the government has a tough task because its easy to take shots 
at them said wilse

american telephone amp telegraph co is expected to 
take part in a planned consortium bid for general electric co plc 
of britain a respected financial daily reported monday 
analysts said however that gecs defenses against a consortium 
takeover bid was strengthened by its announcement friday of a merger 
with the usbased general electric co of their european consumer 
products medical equipment and some electrical divisions 
the financial times reported that atampt was expected to confirm 
its participation in the dramatic bid for gec this week following 
weekend negotiations with lazard brothers investment firm 
the financial times and other newspapers also reported that the 
british electronics firm plessey co plc made a bid to acquire gpt 
an electronics company it jointly owns with gec citing a broken 
agreement between the two companies 
gec which itself has made a 3 billion bid with west germanys 
siemens ag for plessey said it would fight to keep its share of 
gpt reports in the guardian and financial times said 
the financial daily said that under a deal with the consortium 
atampt would take a controlling stake in gpt it said atampt would 
announce its participation after a board meeting wednesday in new 
york 
in the united states atampt spokesman walter murphy declined to 
comment on the reports 
lazard brothers is the merchant bank adviser to plessey which 
also has been reported to be a member of the consortium bidding for 
gec along with the french company thomson 
the announcement of a deal between ge and gec dampened 
speculation that ge which had not been related to the british gec 
would participate in the consortium to buy gec ge is paying 580 
million to gec in the jointventure agreement 
in the case of gpt plessey served notice to gec saturday night 
that it intended to buy out gecs holding in the company they formed 
a year ago the reports said 
plessey said that gec by making its bid with siemens had broken 
an agreement not to change the 5050 ownership arrangement the 
dailies reported gec had promised siemens 40 percent of plessey 
if either side broke the agreement the other was allowed to buy 
its share at a price determined by independent auditors 
a spokesman for plessey who was not named denied the companys 
move was designed as a spoiling tactic we believe they have 
broken an agreement in good faith we have to protect our 
shareholders interests the observer reported sunday 
but an unnamed gec spokesman called the move a pretty 
unconvincing argument in the financial times 
on thursday the british government referred the gecsiemens bid 
for plessey to the monopolies and mergers commission which blocks 
the takeover during a threemonth inquiry into its effects on 
competition 
the european economic community commission will examine the 
agreement between ge and gec closely before deciding to investigate 
whether it impedes fair competition within the 12nation trade bloc 
according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity

winstonsalem ap some rjr nabisco stockholders are refusing 
to part with their rjr nabisco stock apparently under the belief 
that their rjr dividends will keep coming in the mail financial 
officials say 
in addition some feel they are voting against the buyout by not 
tendering and thats a real mistake said david schamens 
managing executive of integrated resources equity corp 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co won the bidding war for rjr nabisco 
six weeks ago in a record 25 billion cash deal 
schamens said about 2 percent of his rjr callers are holdouts 
they think that the dividends are just going to keep coming in 
the mail every three months and unfortunately theyre wrong 
schamens said 
under the law stockholders have two years to trade their rjr 
nabisco shares for the new securities if they take no action their 
holdings then go to a north carolina fund where it is held for seven 
years if not claimed in that time it belongs to the state 
harry rolison manager of corporate trust at wachovia bank and 
trust co said he talked with a couple last week who did not plan 
to sell their shares on the market or tender them to kkr 
they were planning to take securities that kkr expects to issue 
for rjr stock after its cash offer expires jan 31 but they did not 
realize they would be losing their rjr nabisco dividend 
once they understood that it was obvious to me that they were 
reconsidering rolison said 
kkr won the right to acquire rjr nabisco with a bid of 25 
billion under the terms of the cash tender offer kkr will pay 109 
a share in cash for about 74 percent of rjr nabiscos outstanding 
common stock in a second step expected in late april or may kkr 
will issue preferred stock and converting debentures for the 
remaining shares 
when the deal is done stockholders who tendered their shares 
will have received about 81 in cash and 28 in securities for each 
share 
gene hoots an investment consultant in winstonsalem said he 
thinks there is a sizable group of stockholders who have done 
nothing to get ready to sell or tender 
there are people who have actually left town for extended 
periods without having taken care of this he said for 
those people this could be a very expensive decision 
for goodness sakes they need to get their paperwork in order 
and talk to somebody who can help them 
the securities kkr will issue are expected to be traded at a 
discount of about 70 percent of their face value immediately after 
the transaction is completed but kkr has included a provision in 
the deal that it hopes will raise the value of the securities to par 
value in two years 
while many stockholders are opting to sell their stock outright 
schamens said he is advising people to tender their shares to kkr 
rjr nabisco stock closed at 9475 friday on the new york stock 
exchange

a year ago sport magazine swore off swimsuit 
issues and gave its readers a pinup sports calendar rather than 
devoting 16 pages to luscious photos of beautiful women in 
swimsuits as competing magazines did 
there are no sexy pictures there just some remarkable sports 
photos but you dont have to hide it from your kid either the 
magazines editor said in a message to readers in the 
januaryfebruary 1988 issue 
but that was last year 
sports latest issue recently hit the stands with a darkhaired 
model on the cover appropriately dressed for what the headline over 
the magazine title called its hot swimsuit issue 
the magazines executives note that new owners and a new editor 
have taken over since the last policy pronouncement on swimsuits 
petersen publishing co based in los angeles bought the magazine 
last summer 
and the new owners say they are giving the predominantlymale 
sports magazine audience what it wants as demonstrated by the huge 
popularity of the swimsuit issues from its rivals sports 
illustrated and inside sports 
whats a faithful follower of sport magazine to think 
our readers are going to be happy that sport magazine changed 
its mind said executive editor kelly garrett 
sport is reviving its swimsuit issue just weeks before sports 
illustrated celebrates the 25th anniversary of its first swimsuit 
edition with a blitz that will include a paycable program a home 
video and a desk calendar 
sports illustrated designed its initial swimsuit issue as a 
travel feature to brighten up the dark days between the football and 
baseball seasons when many northern cities are snowbound and sports 
fans are blue 
the swimsuit issues periodically have sparked protests that the 
sections are sexist exploit women and are unsuited to a sports 
magazine some readers threaten subscription cancellations although 
publisher donald barr said he had fewer than 50 cancellations due to 
last years swimsuit issue 
sports illustrated charges about 28 percent more for ad space and 
75 percent more for a single copy of its swimsuit issue it expects 
to sell nearly 55 million copies of this years special issue 
which hits the newstands feb 6 compared with the usual 3 million 
for regular issues 
barr has also agreed as part of the 25th anniversary to have a 
video shot in connection with the swimsuit issue 
home box office inc plans to air the 47minute video about 
shooting the swimsuit issue several times starting feb 9 a 
slightly longer home video will made available a few days later in 
video retail and magazine stores 
bridget potter an hbo executive said retailers had placed about 
350000 orders for the home video which will be priced at 1999 
it will carry two automobile commercials for which chrysler corp 
paid 337500 
next fall a special 25th anniversary desk calendar will be 
published for 1990 using photos taken for the 1989 swimsuit issue 
tom ettinger of sports illustrated enterprises said he expects to 
sell about 250000 desk calendars at 1295 each in addition to 
500000 of the usual wall calendars at 1095 each 
magazine executives decline to say how much will be made from the 
25th anniversary issue and related products but business week 
magazine estimates total sales could reach 30 million 
inside sports owned by century publishing co in evanston ill 
has its ninth swimsuit issue on the newsstands and hopes to sell 
850000 copies compared with a normal rate base of 500000 
the magazines first swimsuit issue was a parody of sports 
illustrateds version showing pretty women in swimwear carrying 
rolledup copies of the competitions swimsuit issue 
it was so wellreceived that we decided we would keep doing our 
own every year said marketer jerry croft 
sport magazine tried its first swimsuit issue in march 1986 
featuring swimsuitclad women athletes from all fields but sales 
failed to improve 
in his message to readers last year theneditor neil cohen 
wrote we didnt feel comfortable with the pages they didnt fit 
our magazine 
this year sport used professional models rather than athletes in 
swimsuits publisher lew green is looking for a sales boost but 
wont say how much in sports rate base of 850000 copies 
green makes no apology for the change in philosophy on swimsuit 
issues 
what we are showing here is appropriate for a young male 
audience he said its part of what sports are all about

amid widespread skepticism the 
government on monday began a campaign to persuade congress and the 
brazilian people to support a radical antiinflation program 
announced sunday 
president jose sarney in a nationwide radio and tv address 
sunday asked brazilians to back him in a total war on the 
nations 933 percent inflation rate the plan includes a 
wageandprice freeze government spending cuts and a currency 
devaluation 
however initial reaction to the economic reforms was lukewarm 
mario amato president of the powerful federation of industries 
of sao paulo state said he didnt like the price freeze but he 
added we will ask businessmen to make this new sacrifice 
the leader of the influential metalworkers union of sao paulo 
luiz antonio medeiros said after sarneys speech he would back a 
general strike to protest the wage freeze but on monday he said the 
president deserves a vote of confidence 
if the plan fails it will be catastrophic well go back to 
hyperinflation and lose the best thing we have democracy 
medeiros said in a televised interview 
sarney a civilian took office in 1985 after a 21year military 
regime but his inability to halt inflation led to leftist gains in 
recent nationwide elections and rumors of military unrest 
the antiinflation program is the third enacted by the sarney 
government the first two in 1986 and 1987 enjoyed some early 
success but then collapsed disastrously under black marketeering 
shortages and reheated inflation 
under the new plan prices of many items and salaries will be 
frozen indefinitely the government also created a new currency the 
new cruzado by devaluing the old cruzado 17 percent and lopping 
off three of its zeroes one new cruzado is worth roughly one us 
dollar 
sarney also promised to sharply cut government spending seen as 
the main cause of inflation he pledged to fire about 60000 federal 
employees sell off 14 staterun companies and eliminate five of 
brazils 27 ministries as well as 42 government agencies 
to avoid a surge in consumer spending that sabotaged the earlier 
price freezes the government announced it would raise interest 
rates and restrict credit time payments 
a bank holiday was decreed monday and tuesday to allow banks to 
adapt to the reforms long lines formed at automatic tellers as 
brazilians withdrew cash to tide them over until banks reopened 
in sao paulo supermarkets closed monday morning while employees 
changed prices to meet governmentset limits however there were 
charges that many shops had raised prices as much as 100 percent in 
anticipation of the freeze 
in rio the illegal but widely tolerated numbers game known as 
the animal game was suspended monday to avoid confusion over the 
currency change 
in brasilia the capital finance minister mailson da nobrega 
warned that brazil could suspend interest payments on its huge 
foreign debt if it needed hard currency to make the plan work 
brazil has a foreign debt of 115 billion the third worlds 
largest in 1987 the government stopped interest payments to private 
overseas creditors when reserves fell low but the moratorium was 
lifted last year 
the new program must be approved by congress within 30 days the 
twochamber body is in recess for southern hemisphere summer 
vacation and was to convene in special session 
conservatives and leftists promised to oppose the plan but the 
centrist brazilian democratic movement party was expected to give 
sarney enough votes to get the program approved 
the congress will not deny the country this chance at national 
salvation said rep carlos santanna leader of the democratic 
movement party

billion bushels down from 977 billion a year earlier but still 
well above prereport estimates

said the corn and soybean markets pulled down wheat prices for 
nearmonth delivery

lower on tuesday

cents a bushel the limit in that market and the limitless contract 
for january delivery fell 36 cents

six members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries now have 705 percent of the worlds 
proven oil reserves the middle east economic survey reported monday 
the respected oil industry newsletter said that according to 
revised estimates reserves for the big six in the last five 
years has risen from 308 billion barrels to a total of 699 billion 
barrels 
it listed saudi arabia with 255 billion barrels iraq with 100 
billion the united arab emirates with 98 billion kuwait with 95 
billion iran with 93 billion and venezuela with 58 billion 
the five persian gulf states alone account for nearly twothirds 
of the worlds proven reserves 
saudi arabia last week upgraded its reserves by 85 billion 
barrels to 255 billion following a sixyear study 
the arabian american oil co noted that with additional 
development and exploration their remaining reserves could be as 
high as 313 billion barrels of oil 
describing the saudi revision as a staggering increase the 
nicosiabased survey noted the reassessment of reserves in saudi 
arabia represents the latest stage of a truly massive upward 
revision of proven oil reserves by the major opec countries in 
recent years 
in other opec news monday venezuelan presidentelect carlos 
andres perez arrived in abu dhabi as part of a gulf swing designed 
to bolster unity within opec and stablize oil prices 
he said he would discuss with gulf leaders the possibility of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries holding a summit such 
a summit if held would be the second since 1975 
however uae oil minister mana saeed otaiba who is

contributions to worthy causes by the largest 
us corporations continue to level off the conference board said 
monday 
according to a survey of 328 leading corporations contributions 
rose by less than 5 percent in 1987 the latest year for which 
complete data were available 
donations over the last three years have gone up by 3 percent to 
7 percent annually these are much smaller rises than the 
doubledigit ones posted over the previous decade said the board a 
nonprofit group that does management and economic research 
total contributions including those made by both large and small 
corporations came to about 46 billion in 1987 the same as the 
1986 level 
in 1988 corporate giving appears to have been flat or possibly 
less than in 1987 the sponsors of the survey said the survey was 
jointly sponsored by the board and the council for aid to education

coastal corp announced monday it planned to 
launch a 26 billion tender offer for texas eastern corp in a deal 
that would make coastal the nations largest natural gas company 
the 42 per share offer was about 40 percent more than texas 
easterns closing stock price on friday 
the announcement sent texas eastern stock soaring by 1475 a 
share to 45 in trading on the new york stock exchange which 
analysts said indicated the bidding may go higher 
at the same time coastals stock fell 75 cents a share to 
3412 
houstonbased coastal is the third largest natural gas company in 
the country while texas eastern also of houston is among the top 
six another houston firm enron corp holds the top position 
analysts said 
in my view coastal and enron are two prototypes of interstate 
pipeline networks of the future said charles strain director of 
energy research for lovett mitchell webb amp garrison in houston 
texas eastern is attractive to both companies because of its 
pipeline system reaching the northeast market 
strain said even though the acquisition will put coastal further 
in debt in the long run it is a good move because pipeline 
regulations are expected to be relaxed 
william d hyler an analyst for oppenheimer amp co inc in new 
york said he was surprised by coastals timing of the offer because 
of its debt 
coastal had nearly 35 billion in debt outstanding as of sept 
30 according to coastal spokesman rw wells 
i believe theyve always had an interest in this company 
hyler said apparently they thought that if they waited someone 
else would get it in the long term it looks good its a good 
strategic fit 
hyler said if the buyout were successful he expected coastal to 
sell off texas easterns exploration and production operations 
mondays jump in the price of texas eastern stock however 
prompted analysts to predict coastal would have to sweeten its offer 
to 45 or 48 per share 
texas eastern urged its shareholders not to not to take any 
action on the expected tender offer until it makes its 
recommendation 
when the offer is received the board of directors of texas 
eastern will carefully consider the offer and expects to advise its 
shareholders of its recommendation no later than 10 business days 
from the date of commencement of such tender offer texas eastern 
said in a statement 
coastal said the decision to make the offer was approved at a 
sunday night meeting of its board of directors coastal said it 
would begin the offer on tuesday for all outstanding shares of texas 
easterns common stock 
us district judge lynn hughes in houston was considering a 
request from coastal for a temporary restraining order to keep texas 
easterns board of directors from taking any action to prevent 
shareholders from accepting the offer 
james r paul president and chief operating officer of coastal 
wrote his counterpart at texas eastern dennis r hendrix 
requesting a meeting with the texas eastern board of directors to 
discuss a business combination 
we are convinced that a combination of coastal and texas 
eastern would be in the best interests of our respective 
stockholders as well as employees customers and suppliers paul 
wrote operating flexibility and efficiencies brought about by a 
combination of our companies would significantly improve the 
abilitites of each company to provide the best possible service to 
customers 
we also believe that our offer is a fair one it gives texas 
easterns stockholders an opportunity to receive immediately a very 
attractive cash price for all their shares 
coastal is diversified energy firm with 8 billion in assets and 
operations in natural gas transmission and storage gas and oil 
exploration and production refining and marketing coal trucking 
and independent power production 
texas eastern with 5 billion in assets is involved in natural 
gas and petroleum products pipeline and international oil and gas 
exploration and production it also refines and markets petroleum 
products at wholesale and is involved in real estate projects 
coastal said its offer will be financed primarily by bank 
borrowings and subordinated notes citibank has told the company by 
letter it is confident it can provide up to 2 billion in senior 
bank financing including 500 million citibank will provide under a 
firm commitment 
drexel burnham lambert inc sent a letter to coastal saying it is 
confident it can place up to 13 billion in subordinated notes of 
coastal 
drexels involvment in the takeover attempt comes at a time when 
it is finalizing details of its securities fraud plea bargain 
settlement with the federal government 
under an agreement with the securities and exchange commission 
drexel agreed to pay a record 650 million in fines and restitution 
plead guilty to six unspecified felonies settle related civil 
litigation with the sec and agree to cooperate in the governments 
expanding campaign against wall street corruption

americas general electric co has strengthened its 
european foothold ahead of 1992 by stepping into a complex 
electronics industry takeover battle and emerging with an agreement 
with britains general electric co plc to merge european operations 
the us and british companies previously unrelated announced 
on friday that they had reached agreement to merge their european 
consumer products medical equipment and some electrical divisions 
american and japanese companies are eager to expand operations in 
europe before 1992 when the 12nation common market is to be 
transformed into one barrierfree marketplace of 320 million people 
ge the us company is paying gec 580 million to create the 
joint operations which will have annual revenue of about 245 
billion 
the agreement also helps gec by serving as a defensive tactic 
against a possible takeover bid for gec by an international 
consortium 
the investment firm lazard brothers and co announced on jan 8 
that a new company had been formed to create an international 
consortium to make a bid for gec 
such a bid was expected to amount to between 11 billion and 14 
billion making it britains largest takeover ever 
plessey co the target of a 3 billion joint takeover attempt by 
gec and west germanys siemens ag was expected to participate in 
the potential consortium bid to buy gec such a counterbid would be 
what wall street calls a pac man defense an allusion to the 
eatorbeeaten video game 
ge had been rumored to be interested in joining a bid for gec 
but the announcement of a deal between ge and gec cooled that 
speculation 
however american telephone amp telegraph co was expected to 
confirm this week its participation in a consortium bid the 
financial times reported monday in the united states atampt 
spokesman walter murphy declined to comment 
a lazard brothers official did not return a phone call from the 
associated press lazard brothers serves as adviser to plessey 
which has declined comment on the consortium bid 
gec and siemens offer for plessey launched in november is on 
hold for three months following the british governments decision 
thursday to have the monopolies and mergers commission examine its 
effect on competition 
the european economic community commission also is examining the 
offer 
ges arrangement with gec fits a strategy followed by many 
noneuropean companies which are concerned that 1992 might see the 
emergence of a fortress europe shutting them out of the huge 
lucrative market 
european companies also have scrambled to form paneuropean 
alliances 
what it ge has done is significantly increase the size of its 
business in europe by this deal said analyst keith sykes of the 
london investment firm smith new court plc the prime reason is 
1992 
he added there are a number of other people who must be 
feeling shut out of the market i think there are quite a number of 
people looking to position themselves i think theres going to be 
more of this 
however electronics companies efforts to expand their 
businesses across borders will be hampered by governmernts concerns 
about national security and other matters sykes said 
the electronics business has been largely domestic because the 
companies usually do a big portion of their business with state 
agencies such as defense departments and state telecommunications 
concerns sykes said 
its going to be really difficult but i think at least they are 
going to have a go at it he said 
analyst chris tucker of kleinwort grieveson ltd said the 
takeover scramble has been spurred by overcrowding 
theres been overcapacity in the uk industry and there is a 
need for rationalization he said 
ge and gec were founded independently a century ago and have 
grown into the largest electronics companies in their own countries 
ge a minority stakeholder in gec from 1928 until 1934 is much 
larger with annual revenue of 405 billion in 1987 
ge said its european revenue which totaled 2 billion in 1987 
should swell to an estimated 6 billion in 1989 
it already has european interests in plastics medical diagnostic 
equipment electrical distribution control and protection products 
and information services 
gec had revenue of 98 billion in the year ended march 31

the chicago board of trade limits corn and oat futures to daily 
moves of 10 cents a bushel wheat to 20 cents a bushel and soybeans 
to 30 cents a bushel the limit on the january soybean contract has 
been lifted pending the contracts pending expiration 
analysts said they had expected the sharp declines especially in 
the corn market in reaction to an agriculture department crop 
report released after the close of trading on friday 
the reports final 1988 us corn production figure 492 
billion bushels was nearly 6 percent higher than the average 
prereport estimate of market analysts and more than 5 percent above 
the usdas last projection which it made in november 
the usda pegged the nations corn stockpile as of dec 1 at 707 
billion bushels more than 6 percent higher than the average 
prereport estimate 
the governments numbers for soybean production and soybean 
stocks also were higher than expected 
the usdas wheat numbers were considered bullish but analysts 
said the corn and soybean markets pulled down wheat prices for 
nearmonth delivery 
the sharp drop in prices may force some corn producers to 
reconsider their strategies for the new growing season said cathy 
leow a grainmarket analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
in new york 
she said corns recent rise to levels near 280 a bushel may 
have prompted some farmers to consider dropping out of the 
governments pricesupport program in which they agree to limit 
their corn acreage in return for a guaranteed selling price 
but now she said i think a lot of them will think twice about 
dropping out of the program given current price levels it will 
affect planting decisions but we dont know how much 
the soybean market came under additional pressure monday from 
reports of weekend showers in the south american soybean belt 
analysts said 
under exchange rules the daily price limit for corn futures will 
be expanded tuesday to 15 cents a bushel but analysts said they did 
not expect a second session of limit losses 
most livestock and meat futures prices fell on the chicago 
mercantile exchange on expectations of lower feed costs in the 
future analysts said sharply lower cash prices for hogs added to 
the selling pressure

7415 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 20 cent

copper corps chuquicamata mine could take two months 
chile is the worlds largest copper exporter and the chuquicamata 
mine is the worlds largest copper mine accounting for more than 
half of chiles annual copper output said craig sloane an analyst 
in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
the market is balanced finely enough that if you can affect 
production in chile from this mine for a couple of months thats 
significant he said 
copper settled 280 cents to 445 cents higher with march at 
14805 a pound 
gold settled 10 cents to 30 cents lower on the commodity exchange 
with february at 40330 a troy ounce silver was unchanged to 02

brazil must lower its debt interest 
payments to avoid potentially serious social and political unrest 
which could stimulate calls for another debt moratorium a top 
government official said monday 
finance minister mailson da nobrega called unbearable the 
present situation of brazil and other latin debtors whose massive 
foreign debt payments make them net exporters of capital 
last year brazil spent 12 billion in interest payments on the 
115 billion foreign debt 
da nobrega said this year brazil must import capital and recover 
economic growth to avoid serious problems in the social and 
political fields 
according to da nobrega the debt is not brazils principal 
problem but it is the principal flag waved by populist 
politicians who could take advantage of this presidential 
election year in brazil to push for a moratorium on interest 
payments 
in the past some politicians have argued the 1 billion monthly 
payments takes money away from needed investments in domestic social 
programs 
if a populist reaches the government after an electoral 
campaign based on threats to foriegn creditors there will be a 
moratorium on all payments and it will be of the worst kind da 
nobrega told a news conference 
da nobrega said the brazilian government which sunday announed a 
package of economic measures including a wage and price freeze and 
massive spending cuts had no intention of returning to its 
previous confrontational approach of dealing with foreign 
creditors 
however he said should the country suffer a dip in money 
reserves from the measures which included a freeing of currency 
exchange and import restrictions of certain products brazil could 
suspend payments in common accord with creditors 
last year brazils current account trade surplus was a record 18 
billion brazil takes its foreign debt payments from the monthly 
surplus 
in 1987 brazil declared an 11month moratorium on about 70 
billion of its foreign debt with private creditors saying the 
country was broke with monthly trade surpluses as low as 131 
million in return private banks cut the countrys short term 
credit lines and stalled rescheduling negotiations 
but last year brazil eased its hardline stand suspended the 
moratorium and reached an agreement with banks to reschedule some 
64 billion in interest and principal due over 20 years with an 
eightyear grace period they also were to receive 52 billion in 
new financing

the dollar strengthened against all key 
currencies in quiet holiday trading monday 
gold and silver prices fell with silver dipping to its lowest 
level in nearly 22 months in london 
bruce giammattei a currency trader for harris trust amp co in 
chicago said nearterm sentiment toward the dollar remained 
somewhat bullish 
i think theres a growing feeling in the market that the united 
states doesnt really mind seeing a higher dollar at this time 
giammattei explained a higher dollar helps take inflationary 
pressure off of us by making imports cheaper 
right now the no 1 goal in this country is to see that 
inflation doesnt get out of hand 
traders said the dollar also was boosted by reduced chances for 
centralbank intervention from the united states and japan due to 
holidays there 
many us traders were absent from the market monday in 
observance of the rev martin luther kings birthday a federal

grain processor archer daniels midland co said 
monday it had purchased an 8 percent stake in illinois central 
transportation co a major rail hauler of grain between chicago and 
the gulf of mexico 
adm based in decatur ill said the purchase was an investment 
not a takeover move and industry analysts agreed 
i think at this time they really are buying for investment 
purposes said analyst leonard teitlebaum of merrill lynch capital 
markets inc in new york i dont think they have any interest in 
running the railroad 
illinois central spokesman joseph fidanza said he knew nothing 
more about adms intentions than what adm had told the railroad 
company 
they said to us that its for investment purposes he said 
adm spokesman richard burket said the company recently purchased 
the nearly 16 million shares of illinois central at market prices 
which have ranged from 1212 on jan 3 the stocks first day of 
trading on the new york stock exchange to 1412 
illinois central closed monday in composite trading at 14 12 
cents below fridays close making adms stake worth about 224 
million 
chicagobased illinois central became an independent company late 
last year when it was spun off from its parent ic industries inc 
ic then changed its own name to whitman corp 
the railroad benefited from last summers drought which lowered 
the level of the mississippi river and forced grain companies to 
ship by rail instead of by barge 
a recent study commissioned by illinois central found a trend 
toward drier weather in the mississippi river watershed prompting 
projections by the railroad for continued rivershipping problems 
burket said he didnt know if the railroads predictions played a 
part in adms decision to invest in illinois central 
as you know the company is just available now as a railroad 
he said referring to the spinoff we took a look at it and 
decided wed make an investment 
he said the stock was part of adms 12 billion portfolio of 
cash and securities 
analyst george s dahlman of piper jaffray amp hopwood inc in 
minneapolis said he wouldnt be surprised to see an adm 
representative named to illinois centrals board of directors 
adm is one of the major users of railways and so i think they 
know a good one when they see one he said i would not be 
surprised to see the investment go higher but id be surprised if 
they tendered for the whole thing

two more boeing 757 jetliners have been found with 
crossed wires leading to cargo hold fire extinguisher bottles 
bringing the total to five since compulsory checks began friday the 
times of london reported tuesday 
the newspaper said checks by engineers in the netherlands and 
canada revealed that two aircraft both less than a year old were 
wrongly wired at the boeing plant in seattle in the united states 
before delivery 
boeing spokesman tom cole in seattle said such problems can take 
place in the manufacture or in the maintenance of airplanes 
were aware of the air holland findings and this does make five 
airplanes reported so far cole said monday night we are 
looking into the technical aspects of it to see what the miswiring 
was or is how they relate to each other and what might have 
happened so we can correct it 
britains civil aviation authority reported sunday that engineers 
of the british airline air 2000 found crossed wires during checks of 
cargo compartment warning systems following the discovery of wiring 
problems in two boeing 757s in the united states since compulsory 
checks began 
faulty wiring is one possibility being examined by experts 
investigating the british midlands boeing 737 crash at kegworth in 
central england on jan 7 in which 44 people were killed 
but the times said the faults involving wiring to the cargo hold 
fire extinguisher bottles found on the five 757s are not thought to 
have been a factor in the crash of the 737 on jan 7 
in the jan 7 crash for some reason so far unexplained the 
righthand engine was shut down though it was the lefthand engine 
that caught fire 
the times said the faults in each of these two new cases were 
identical to the fault discovered on a boeing 757 operated by air 
2000 
the caa said sunday that the fault on the air 2000 plane was 
caused by switched plugs and was immediately rectified 
the times said tuesday that the air 2000 plane and the two latest 
planes found to have crossed wires were delivered within days of 
each other 
it said boeing executives are now trying to trace the fitter 
responsible though cole on monday said boeing was not pointing the 
finger at any one person 
cole confirmed that the last three planes reported with problems 
were manufactured at about the same time but the first two were not 
the times reported a 757 belonging to air holland was found to 
have its wires crossed in checks ordered by the faa the us 
federal aviation administration following two similar faults 
reported in the united states on a delta airlines 757 and another 
belonging to royal brunei airlines although the faults were not 
identical they all involved the wiring to fire extinguisher bottles 
in the cargo hold 
it did not name the canadian charter airline that owned the other 
faultily wired aircraft 
the paper said the findings indicated that someone in boeings 
plant at renton wash where the 757s are manufactured made 
repeated errors in fitting wiring 
the assembly lines for the 737 the type involved in the 
british midlands crash run alongside the 757 lines and efforts are 
now being made to ensure that similar mistakes were not made the 
paper said 
cole said the boeing company will examine whats happened and 
study the way the bottles are put in there well see if something 
can be done to make them less fallible 
we do have a large number of checks and balances before we send 
these out and thats why we want to study these reports he added 
cole said boeing didnt yet know whether the wiring problems were 
identical although all affect the cargo fire suppression system 
that system has nothing to do with engines he said 
an faa directive that all american airlines check their 757s for 
the problem is to conclude tuesday afternoon cole said at which 
time it will be announced whether the problem is more widespread
