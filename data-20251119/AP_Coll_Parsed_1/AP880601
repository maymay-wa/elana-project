riot police firing water cannons and tear 
gas broke up street protests in this capital city on wednesday 
during a communistled general strike that paralyzed transportation 
small pockets of strikers blocked streets with flaming tires and 
rubble before being driven off 
the government said 13 protesters were arrested in quito news 
reports said six people were detained in guayquil the nations 
financial center and largest city with 2 million people 180 miles 
southwest of the capital 
interior minister heinz moeller called the strike a failure he 
said nearly all of the nations labor force of 3 million workers 
ignored the strike call 
moeller told a news conference a capital policeman was injured 
by a firebomb tossed by a protester there were no other reports of 
injury 
strike leader fausto dutan said 80 percent of ecuadors business 
activity was halted by the strike called to back demands for 
higher pay 
radio reports said the strike had little impact in provincial 
cities across this andean nation which is the size of colorado and 
has 10 million people 
strike protests waned as night fell the downtown of this 
highland capital of 14 million residents was filled with tear gas 
making breathing difficult for the few pedestrians left on the 
streets 
president leon febres cordero said the strike the seventh 
during his tenure was illegal and declared a nationwide state of 
emergency 
combat troops were sent to guard electric generating plants 
gasoline stations and other installations riot police patrolled 
streets and industrial sectors of ecuadors major cities 
the nationwide strike was organized by the communistled united 
front of laborers the nations most powerful labor federation to 
seek wage increases 
dutan said the 200000member confederation wants the minimum 
monthly wage raised from 31 to 76 
moeller admitted that bus and taxi service in quito and 
guayaquil was nearly halted as drivers stayed off the job either in 
strike sympathy or in fear of violence 
many of quitos factories did not open because workers could not 
reach their jobs news reports said 
banks stores and shops in downtown quito opened normally or 
slightly late but closed in early afternoon to avoid trouble the 
government suspended school classes nationwide 
febres cordero a conservative whose fouryear term ends aug 
10 has faced increasing labor unrest over the past two years amid 
mounting economic woes caused mainly by depressed world prices for 
oil ecuadors main export 
rodrigo borja a lawyer who heads the democratic left party won 
a presidential runoff election in may to replace febres cordero 
moeller said the state of emergency which permits the 
government to deploy the military ban public meetings and censor 
the media would stay in force only until the strike officially 
ended at midnight wednesday

when mary hart was growing up in sioux 
falls sd her mother often worried about the future 
entertainment tonight host running away to become a showgirl 
well mom dont look now but 
the perky blonde who taught high school english and piano while 
doing community theater and dreaming of a show business career 
recently made her stage debut in las vegas 
with more bookings here and in atlantic city plus summer stock 
and music festivals this summer harts ready to continue her dual 
professional role although shed just as soon skip those 18hour 
days juggling two careers in two cities 
her grueling daily grind shuttling between this citys glitter 
gulch for her longawaited fling at singing and dancing then back 
to a hollywood et set for more tv patter gave new meaning to 
the concept of commuting to work 
hart realized a lifelong dream when she spent two weeks 
appearing with comedian david brenner at the golden nugget hotel 
and casino earlier this month 
but she admits she wouldnt care for a steady diet of the double 
duty 
i performed at 8 and again at 11 she said then i caught 
a 1 am flight to los angeles and hit the house about 245 i got 
up at 730 and was at paramount where et is filmed by 8 am we 
did our promos and other spots then began taping the show at 1130 
am at 245 in the afternoon i was on a flight back to vegas 
both worlds is not an ideal situation she laughed as she 
relaxed between shows during her twoweek engagement its 
conceivable to do one show a night and commute for a short period 
of time 
in her show hart does several dance numbers and displays a 
surprisingly good singing voice her appearance and style are 
reminiscent of annmargret when she was a las vegas headliner for 
years 
harts sexy legs insured by lloyds of london for 2 million 
are amply displayed in the las vegas show the legs are a product 
of a lot of hard work including a treadmill rowing machine and 
exercycle at home 25 miles of speedwalking a week and aerobics 
and dance classes 
she admits that coming into this town with a nationally known 
name didnt hurt her chances for success but she thinks she had to 
have more than just a pretty recognizable face and 2 million 
legs 
you know youre putting it all on the line when you come in 
here as a coheadliner she said theres no way of hiding it 
but i wanted to do it i was both exhilarated and intimidated by 
the experience 
her songanddance debut has given her a new appreciation of the 
people she covers on et 
theres a lot of rejection and hard knocks im far more 
appreciative for having experienced it firsthand 
hart admits to something of a walter mitty lifestyle since her 
days in south dakota shes been a finalist in the miss america 
pageant 1971 been a host of et for five years sparred with 
david letterman sung the national anthem at los angeles dodgers 
games ridden with the blue angels flight team danced on the emmy 
awards show injured one leg in a fall from the high wire on a 
circus of the stars performance and been cohost of the 
tournament of roses parade coverage and the regis philbin show 
despite all those credits she thinks her stage debut at the 
golden nugget was one of her toughest gigs 
i prepared for the opening for months she recalled then 
the day of the opening after working all afternoon in dress 
rehearsals i almost felt like i couldnt do it i proceeded to cry 
for three hours 
part of it was sheer fear part of it was excitement there 
were moments of being panicstricken but the overriding emotion 
was one of exhilaration 
i have really always seen myself as an entertainer she 
said you dream those things but you dont know for sure if 
theyll ever happen i think that was part of my emotionalism 
realizing those things had come true 
a few dreams a broadway play and her own tv sitcom remain 
unfulfilled but at age 35 she thinks time is on her side 
shes learned to roll with the punches to be patient 
after doing radio and tv talk shows in sioux falls cedar 
rapids iowa and oklahoma city she moved west to headline pm 
magazine she left that show to cohost regis philbin which 
folded four months later 
i was out of work and out of money she recalled that was 
a time i was terribly disappointed then et came along thank 
heaven for my midwestern upbringing and positive thinking 
my parents always told me that the bad times accentuate the 
good ive always translated the negative experiences into good in 
the long run im a big believer that life goes on you get back 
from life what you put into it

it began with rural women passing on 
the traditional crafts of knitting and weaving grandmother to 
mother to daughter 
today it is a 4millionayear business cooperative shipping 
colorful sweaters around the world including the united states 
manos del uruguay hands of uruguay is made up of 18 rural 
cooperatives whose workers spin knit weave and dye virgin wool 
one of uruguays top commodities entirely by hand 
it was founded in 1968 by sara beisso and four other members of 
uruguays high society who had second homes on ranch estates 
outside montevideo 
unemployment was high in south americas smallest republic at 
the time so the five devised a way for rural women to do what they 
knew best weave colorful sweaters using natural vegetable dyes 
and uruguays virgin wool 
the result is a richly colored wool woven in bright distinctive 
sweaters as well as in rugs tapestries and placemats each 
article bears the name of the artisan and where it was made on a 
card accompanying the product 
finding many of the artisans work sites on a map is often 
difficult they include tacuarembo said to be the birthplace of 
famed tango singer carlos gardel and villages such as los mellizos 
and quebracho 
one thousand workers in more than 40 sites some using just a 
loom or a table under a tree labor over the sweaters tapestries 
and rugs each sweater takes 12 to 28 hours to finish mrs beisso 
said 
most of the sweaters end up in shops in neighboring argentina 
but many are shipped to the united states italy japan and 
belgium seventy percent of manos sweaters are exported said 
maria orfila algalarronda 
ms algalarronda 36 was with manos from its start weaving 
from the village of paso de la cruz two decades later she is 
secretary counsel of the sevenmember directorate five women two 
men that oversees manos operations from montevideo 
now one of uruguays largest exporters of wool manos is 
wellregarded in business circles for the quality of its work and 
fashion acumen 
manos is an experience thats practically unique in the 
world ms algalarronda said in an interview the world is a 
very competitive place and uruguay is a very small place but at a 
minimum manos has turned into a source of work for 1000 women 
each sweater which costs the equivalent of about 30 in 
uruguay sells for up to 300 in the united states or japan said 
maria cecilia fernandez an aide in the promotion department of 
manos main office in the oldtown section of this capital city 
in the united states manos sweaters can be found in some saks 
fifth avenue and ann taylor stores mrs beisso said manos 
recently opened a small showroom in new york city 
ms algalarronda said 50 designs are ready for the 1989 summer 
collection including sweaters specially made for japan smaller 
sizes because the japanese are smaller the united states 
simpler designs and spain reds and blacks are popular 
a specially designed sofa that pope john paul ii used at a mass 
in salto uruguay on his visit in may was produced by manos mrs 
beisso said 
manos is set up so that regional leaders from each cooperative 
elect representatives who then report to the directorate in 
montevideo all business decisions from designs to marketing and 
exports are made only after receiving input from the interior ms 
algalarronda said 
any profits 1987 sales were 4 million are plowed back into 
the business helping keep those workers employed which was the 
founding purpose of manos 
its a fine source of employment but not a good business 
mrs beisso said the people in the country are the ones who 
really profit from this

some republicans refer to firstterm sen 
jeff bingaman as the invisible senator and their conviction 
that he can be beaten has lured four candidates to seek the gop 
nomination in the june 7 primary 
bingaman is vulnerable because of his liberal voting record and 
his position on national defense issues said state gop chairman 
john lattauzio 
new mexicos congressmen philosophically have always supported 
defense spending until jeff bingaman came along he said and 
economically defense spending is very important to new mexico 
if we can articulate these issues effectively the republican 
candidate will do very well lattauzio said 
another thing we will be able to talk about a lot is that 
bingaman is the invisible senator new mexicans are accustomed to 
their congressmen staying in touch with them lattauzio said 
jeff just hasnt been around up until recently 
bingaman said in january when he announced for reelection that 
as one of only two firstterm democrats running this year the 
other is new jersey sen frank lautenberg he expected his race to 
be targeted by the national republican party 
but democrats question whether the republican field of state 
sens bill valentine 44 and joe carraro 43 both of albuquerque 
longtime party activist corky morris 52 of albuquerque and 
former us interior department official rick montoya 41 of las 
cruces can produce a strong challenger to bingaman 
polls showing a high percentage of undecided republicans far 
greater than the percentage favoring any candidate indicate none 
of the four has caught fire with the voters valentine and morris 
however appear to be the frontrunners 
lawrence ingram a former state democratic chairman said 
bingaman may be vulnerable but not with any of this years 
republican candidates 
those guys are all wallflowers who follow the old party 
line ingram said i think had the republicans had a 
charismatic candidate running against bingaman he would have a 
tough time in the fall 
valentine who sold his dentistry practice to campaign fulltime 
and carraro who owns and operates two pizza restaurants are 
giving up their state senate seats to try for the us senate 
morris who owns trucking and warehousing companies in 
albuquerque is a former state gop chairman and was new mexico 
chairman of the reaganbush campaign in 1984 
montoya left the reagan administration as assistant secretary of 
interior for terriorities and international affairs to return to 
new mexico and seek elective office for the first time 
bingaman who is unopposed in the democratic primary is a 
harvardeducated lawyer who in 1982 defeated firstterm republican 
sen harrison jack schmitt a former astronaut 
ingram said bingaman has recognized his problems and corrected 
most of them including that he had not been communicating with his 
constituency on a regular basis he also has been spending more 
time in new mexico in the last year meeting with residents 
the senate race and presidential voting top new mexicos primary 
ballot but the retirement after 20 years of republican rep manuel 
lujan jr has thrown open the door in the 1st congressional 
district 
three republicans including lujans younger brother edward and 
nine democrats aspire to succeed lujan who has called it quits 
after 20 years in congress 
edward lujan 55 is an albuquerque insurance executive and 
former state gop chairman challenging him are bernalillo county 
district attorney steven schiff 40 of albuquerque and state sen 
john budagher 41 of albuquerque 
the top democratic contenders are former state land commissioner 
jim baca 42 former state district judge patricia madrid 41 
bernalillo county commissioner lenton malry 57 city councilor 
steve gallegos 35 and former assistant us attorney tom udall

ah springtime in new york the first robin in 
central park the first ballgame at yankee stadium and the first 
angry protester ejected from police headquarters in the annual 
brawl over city rents 
people get frustrated people get thrown out their blood 
pressure goes way up says john j gilbert iii head of a 
landlord group in summing up the yearly hikeorholdtherent 
fight before the city rent guidelines board beginning its hearings 
today 
the proceedings match angry tenants with irate landlords with 
roughly the same results as introducing billy martin to patrons in 
a topless bar rhetoric is thick and animosity thicker with 
supporters on both sides cheering jeering and with the aid of 
police disappearing during the session 
slightly more than 50 percent of the citys apartments are 
covered by the boards guidelines under a system that has its roots 
in the citys world war ii housing scarcity although the owners 
routinely request doubledigit increases on one and twoyear 
leases the board generally grants a much lower increase this 
year gilbert asked for increases of 15 percent on oneyear leases 
and 19 percent on twoyear leases 
the hearings once held privately but opened to the public by 
court order in 1979 are held inside police headquarters for 
security reasons dozens of police officers are assigned to the 
hearings and others are available if verbal arguments get out of 
hand 
the headquarters is the only place where we have the ability 
to keep things under restraint explained veteran board member 
joseph forstadt whos seen several participants dragged out over 
the past four years otherwise 
otherwise thered be more stories like these 
a woman was arrested two years ago for biting the finger of 
the police officer who was dragging her from the auditorium it 
was unclear which point of view she was biting for recalled 
forstadt 
gilbert whose rent stabilization board represents 25000 
building owners stood up and dramatically tore a dollar bill in 
half last year to demonstrate how landlord profits were down 50 
percent from 1971 tenants derisively greeted the display with boos 
in 1984 after the usual spate of insults obscenities and 
outbursts in english a group of spanishspeaking tenants enlivened 
the hearing with chants of callate callate shut up shut 
up as a landlord spoke 
after all the signwaving and screaming is finished the 
ninemember rent guidelines board determines whether rent increases 
should be granted and if so how much 
the oldest and most stringent guideline rent control covers 
218000 apartments when they become vacant they come under a rent 
stabilization guideline which covers 943000 apartment 
when you have landlords and tenants at the same meeting 
which i think is a mistake youre bound to have turmoil said 
77yearold jane benedict founder and chairman emeritus of the 
metropolitan council on housing a tenant group 
benedict a fixture in rent fights since 1969 has attended 
every board hearing since they went public she sees no end to the 
nearanarchy of the hearings in fact the problem of homelessness 
could make this years affair even wilder she predicted 
everybody knows new york city rents are outrageous the 
feelings are intense she said its not just an academic 
debate were talking about people with no place to live 
at least one landlord group blames the media for stirring up 
antilandlord sentiment and making the hearings contentious 
jimmy silber vicepresident of the small property owners of new 
york cited recent tabloid stories on the dracula landlord and 
the reptile landlord as well as the annual village voice 
listing of the citys 10 worst landlords 
nevertheless silber believes the animosity level has decreased 
over the past two years benedict almost predictably disagrees 
but forstadt said there is an interesting phenomenon which occurs 
each year among the participants 
after six or seven hours its hard to tell the landlords from 
the tenants when theyre talking he said theyre both under 
such distress they begin to feel sympathetic toward one another 
theres a sense of cohesion theyre all in the same boat

school officials here learned a lesson the 
hard way after a quarter of the students played hooky many with 
their parents approval 
i dont think any member of the present school board will ever 
vote to hold classes on memorial day again said karen coleman a 
spokeswoman for the seminole county school board 
seminole was one of 24 of floridas 67 counties to hold classes 
monday absentees totaled 5000 of seminoles enrollment of 20033 
many parents called the school districts offices to make it 
clear they regarded the day as a family holiday coleman said 
some were really angry about having school on memorial day 
she said they were all blunt in saying they were keeping their 
kids home and were going to celebrate the holiday 
i know were taking a beating on this said school board 
chairman joe williams i guarantee it wont happen next year

chinas family planning policy which calls for 
no more than one child per couple has in six years reduced by 301 
million the number of children under the age of 14 the state 
statistics bureau said today 
the bureau said china now has 30715 million children under 14 
compared to 33725 million in 1982 
it found the proportion of children in chinas total population 
of 107 billion to be 2868 percent down from 3345 percent six 
years ago the official xinhua news agency reported 
the bureau attributed the decline to the family planning policy 
which has been largely successful in chinas crowded cities but has 
met resistance in many rural areas where two or more children is 
still the norm 
the bureau said children account for just 1836 percent of the 
population in shanghai chinas largest city while making up 36 
percent in the remote western areas of tibet and ningxia hui 
autonomous region

distributors of discount merchandise say 
consumers are the big winners in a supreme court ruling upholding a 
lions share of the multibilliondollar gray market that allows 
costly imports to be sold at reduced prices 
sen john h chafee rri sponsor of a bill favoring gray 
market imports also praised the decision this is very good news 
for everyone in the united states who likes to save a dollar or 
many dollars on imported goods like televisions cameras and 
perfume he said 
nathan lewin a lawyer for discount dealer 47th street photo 
inc in new york city said the decision will mean savings for 
buyers of brandname imports 
i think the supreme courts ruling today is a great victory 
for american consumers and for the right of merchandisers in the 
united states seeking to bring products manufactured abroad into 
the united states at realistic and honest prices he said 
by a 54 vote the court upheld key us customs service 
regulations that permit the gray market brandname foreignmade 
goods bearing valid us trademarks sold in this country without 
approval from trademark owners 
the gray market is estimated to produce 5 billion to 10 
billion a year in the united states with consumers buying 
everything from german sedans and french champagne to japanese 
cameras and watches 
the business began to flourish when the value of the dollar on 
the international currency exchange rose dramatically in the early 
1980s but the more recent decline in the dollar apparently has not 
substantially depressed the american appetite for gray market 
foreign goods 
the gray market is created when foreign goods are purchased 
abroad and sold through discount retailers in the united states in 
competition with the owners of us trademarks of those products 
trademark owners say they are being shortchanged because they 
are forced to charge a markup to help cover advertising warranty 
and service costs 
k mart corp and 47th street photo two leading discount 
distributors joined with the customs service to defend the gray 
market 
justice anthony m kennedy the courts newest member 
provided the pivotal vote in the decision 
by a separate 54 vote the court struck down another customs 
service rule that could have been used to expand the gray market 
some lawyers for discounters said that rule probably is 
inconsequential 
but another attorney representing discounters said there may be 
loopholes in the supreme court decision that would allow trademark 
owners to block the gray market in the future 
that lawyer who asked to remain anonymous said trademark 
holders could get around the ruling in time by conveying their 
trademark to an independent company that then would be able to 
block competing imports 
the customs service for more than 50 years permitted gray market 
imports when foreign manufacturers of the goods are affiliated with 
the owners of the us trademarks the rules apply when the us 
trademark holder is a subsidiary of parent of or the same as the 
foreign manufacturer 
the regulations were challenged by some 60 major trademark 
owners that banded together to form the coalition to preserve the 
integrity of american trademarks 
in other matters the court 
ruled by a 53 vote that states sometimes may execute convicted 
murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyers help was 
violated 
the justices said such violations may be deemed harmless but 
they overturned a texas killers death sentence after ruling that 
the violation in his case was not harmless 
unanimously struck down the way ohio promotes through tax 
credits the use of gasohol a motor vehicle fuel less 
environmentally troublesome than gasoline 
cleared the way for price deregulation of some natural gas an 
80 decision the reagan administration said could save consumers an 
estimated 100 million a year 
unanimously gave federal regulators in a test case from iowa 
broad power to oust bank executives from their jobs temporarily 
when the executives are accused of serious crimes

are you suggesting that this commission is supposed to make 
specific recommendations for budget cuts and tax increases 
weinberger asked alice rivlin of the brookings institution a 
washington think tank 
weinberger and fellow republican donald rumsfeld another former 
defense secretary had focused their remarks on changing the 
cumbersome budget process the two former administration officials 
suggested changing the system to give the president more power over 
what they described as a spendthrift congress 
but rep william h gray iii dpa another commission member 
noted that president reagan has never submitted balanced budgets 
trying to blame congress for the deficits misses the point said 
gray the chairman of the house budget committee 
i thought we had to come up with specific recommendations 
said chrysler chairman lee iacocca another commission member 
by the end of the session strauss admonished the members not to 
get too tied up in possible philosophical differences strauss 
is cochairman of the 12member commission along with drew lewis 
president of the union pacific railroad and president reagans 
former transportation secretary 
ms rivlin a former director of the congressional budget 
office said the commission should seek ways to improve the process 
to keep the deficit under control in the long run but she said 
the panel will be a failure unless it proposes shortterm 
improvements as well 
congress created the commission last year to develop proposals 
for reducing the federal deficit its members were appointed by 
reagan and the bipartisan congressional leadership and two 
additional slots will be filled by the next president

former attorney general griffin b bell 
ignored evidence that top ef hutton executives orchestrated a 
widespread checkkiting scheme when he blamed midlevel managers in 
a defamatory report the lawyer for one of those managers says 
bell a defendant in a defamation suit brought by one of six 
branch managers he criticized in the 1985 report about the 
checkkiting scheme was trying to shift the blame away from top 
management the lawyer argued tuesday in us district court 
he cleared the company he cleared the management and put the 
blame out on regional managers and branch managers stephen g 
milliken a lawyer for former hutton manager john m pearce said 
as the defamation trial got under way 
bell a private attorney in atlanta was retained by hutton to 
conduct the internal investigation after the company pleaded guilty 
may 2 1985 to 2000 counts of mail and wire fraud for 
manipulating its checking accounts 
the company admitted writing checks for amounts exceeding money 
in the accounts thereby giving itself interestfree loans the 
accounts were replenished before the overdrawn checks cleared 
enabling hutton to make extra money by riding the float 
hutton which is now part of shearson lehman hutton inc agreed 
to pay a 2 million fine and reimburse banks that were victims of 
the checkkiting scheme federal investigators said the company had 
interestfree use of 250 million a day 
milliken said the practice was conceived in the late 1970s by 
hutton management and promoted as a way to get interestfree loans 
from banks 
the entire operation was known to new york understood by new 
york created by new york milliken said but mr bell by his 
investigation cleared everybody in new york 
bell a partner in the atlanta law firm of king amp spalding was 
retained shortly after the guilty plea was entered by the company 
he produced a report three months later that recommended that 
pearce and eight other branch and regional executives be 
disciplined 
the report exonerated all but one top management official whom 
bell recommended be stripped of any duties involving huttons 
banking activities 
bells attorney earl j silbert said the former attorney 
generals probe was a carefuly thorough meticulous and fair and 
independent investigation 
silbert charged that pearce violated company policies limiting 
overdrafts in order to make extra money pearce overdrew by as much 
as 400 percent to take his 10 percent share of interest profits 
that were given branch managers as an incentive for efficient cash 
management silbert said 
bell carefully refrained from accusing top managers because 
there was insufficient evidence they did anything wrong he said 
but pearce and the others named in the report were criticized 
because their conduct was so egregious and abusive and so 
aggravated and the evidence of proof so overwhelming that he would 
have been derelict in his responsibility if he had not so named 
them said silbert a former us attorney 
milliken said the overdrafting policies were so important to 
huttons business strategy that pearce was admonished when he did 
not write checks for more than the amounts in the accounts 
they taught him to overdraft they told him what branches to 
use he said 
milliken argued that bells independence was undermined by his 
relationship to hutton which paid king amp spalding 25 million to 
conduct the investigation 
hutton was supplying the information hutton was supplying the 
fee hutton was controlling the timing of when the report would be 
released milliken said 
bell a former federal appeals judge who was president carters 
first attorney general was paid at a rate of 1711 an hour for 
518 hours of work 
pearce also sued hutton but a federal appeals court ruled that 
his claim against the brokerage firm must first be submitted to 
arbitration by the new york stock exchange

fourteen school and church groups are giving 
their imprimatur to a new pamphlet that lays out constitutional 
ways for public schools to teach about religion in a way that does 
not advocate a particular belief 
the sponsors said tuesday that endorsement of the document by 
such diverse groups as the national school boards association the 
national association of evangelicals and the research arm of 
americans united for separation of church and state indicates that 
the time is ripe for a resurgence of instruction about religion 
the question is no longer should we teach about religion 
charles c haynes of americans united told a news conference the 
question is how do we do this 
other participants called the 1000word pamphlet historic and 
expressed hope it will embolden teachers and principals to give 
religion its due in history literature and other classes 
james dunn of the baptist joint committee on public affairs said 
it shows there is a nobler and better way to deal with religion 
in public schools than simply to yell at each other and threaten a 
lawsuit 
all too often debates about religion in public schools have 
degenerated into a hogcalling or a shouting match dunn said 
secular and religious groups alike as well as secretary of 
education william j bennett have complained in recent years that 
religion gets short shrift in most american classrooms and 
textbooks even in courses that teach about historical events in 
which religion played a prominent part 
some critics blamed publishers fear of controversy while 
others attribute it to an overreaction by educators to supreme 
court rulings in the 1960s that barred statesponsored school 
prayer and bible reading 
the pamphlet provides guidance in questionandanswer form for 
school boards teachers and others 
the pamphlet called religion in the public school curriculum 
questions and answers notes that the supreme court has ruled 
unconstitutional a louisiana law that required schools to teach the 
biblical account of creation in science classes but it said the 
high court also acknowledged a variety of scientific theories about 
origins can appropriately be taught in a science class 
the pamphlet added though science instruction may not endorse 
or promote religious doctrine the account of creation found in 
various scriptures may be discussed in a religious studies class or 
in any course that considers religious explanations for the origin 
of life 
the pamphlet gives the following general advice on how to teach 
about religion 
the schools approach is academic not devotional 
the school may sponsor study about religion but may not 
sponsor the practice of religion 
the school may educate about all religions but may not 
promote or denigrate any religion 
the school may inform the student about various beliefs but 
should not seek to conform him or her to any particular belief 
because religion plays a significant role in history and 
society the pamphlet said study about religion is essential 
to understanding both the nation and the world omission of facts 
about religion can give students the false impression that the 
religious life of humankind is insignificant or unimportant 
failure to understand even the basic symbols practices and 
concepts of the various religions makes much of history 
literature art and contemporary life unintelligible 
the pamphlet recommends careful handling of religious 
holidays in the classroom with information focusing on the 
origin history and generally agreedupon meaning of the 
observances 
other sponsors include the american academy of religion 
national school boards association the american association of 
school administrators the christian legal society the national 
conference of christians and jews the national council of churches 
of christ the national council for the social studies the 
association for supervision and curriculum development the 
american federation of teachers and the national education 
association

the only american indian in congress says 
president reagan in claiming the united states humored native 
americans by putting them on reservations appears to have learned 
all he knows on the subject from his old western movies 
i only wish the president knew as much about american indians 
as he seems to know about the russians said rep ben nighthorse 
campbell a northern cheyenne who represents the western half of 
colorado its incredible he knows so little 
campbell a democrat joined a chorus of indian groups and 
others in denouncing reagans remarks to students at moscow state 
university on tuesday 
maybe we made a mistake in trying to maintain indian 
cultures reagan said maybe we should not have humored them in 
that wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle maybe we 
should have said no come join us be citizens along with the 
rest of us 
reagan misspoke all american indians were made full us 
citizens by an act of congress in 1924 
suzan harjo executive director of the national congress of 
american indians said she found the remark about humoring the 
indians particularly insulting 
gregory frazier president of the denverbased national urban 
indian council said im a fan of the president but the 
president is a little bit removed from the reality of american 
indians 
reagan volunteered his comments when he was asked by a student 
if he would meet with three indians visiting moscow under the 
auspices of the militant american indian movement they went to the 
summit city to call attention to the problems of american indians 
we have provided millions of acres of land for what are called 
preservations or the reservations i should say reagan said 
they from the beginning announced that they wanted to 
maintain their way of life as they had always lived there in the 
desert and the plains and so forth and we set up these 
reservations so they could and have a bureau of indian affairs to 
help take care of them 
though many indians leave the reservations many stay the 
president noted 
the 1980 census found 137 million indians among whom 332000 
were living on 260 reservations 
weve done everything we can to meet their demands as to what 
they how they want to live reagan said 
campbell said he appears not to know that indians are 
citizens 
he must have been learning from these old celluloid westerns 
of the 1930s he used to act in the congressman said 
theres no question that american indians dont want to lose 
their traditions but i dont know any indians who want to be 
primitive 
harjo said i thought his notion of having granted indians 
millions of acres of land was astonishing there was no grant 
involved his ancestors werent dragging any land behind them when 
they came to this country 
he has headed the worst administration for indians since the 
days of outright warfare and extermination she said because of 
consistent efforts by this administration to undo legal 
longstanding rights and wipe out programs that meet our needs 
indians leave reservations for better jobs and education and 
politics frazier said life can be very hard on a reservation 
if youre part of the out party 
but many indians dont have the choice to move off the 
reservation because they have no job skills that mainstream 
society will pay for frazier said 
american indians are among the poorest worstoff of americans 
a government study noted that the 1980 census found 12 percent of 
all americans living in poverty but poverty among indians affected 
22 percent of those living off the reservation and 41 percent of 
indians living on reservations unemployment on reservations 
frequently exceeds 60 percent and can reach 80 percent 
young indian adults commit suicide at a rate six times their 
counterparts in mainstream society 
campbell noted that government policy had tried to dissolve 
tribes and force indians to join mainstream culture as small 
farmers in 18871934 then turned around and tried to maintain 
tribes and tribal governments but then flipped again to 
termination of tribes in the eisenhower administration in the 
1950s and flopped back to governmenttogovernment policy in 
subsequent administrations a policy reagan has affirmed 
as for aim and its three members in moscow campbell said 
people in aim do not speak for all indians they speak for only a 
small minority

following is the text of president reagans speech 
tuesday before a student assembly at moscow state university 
well thank you rector lagunov and i want to thank all of you 
very much for a very warm welcome its a great pleasure to be here 
at moscow state university and i want to thank you all for turning 
out i know you must be very busy this week studying and taking 
your final examinations so let me just say speaks in russian 
applause 
nancy couldnt make it today because shes visiting leningrad 
which she tells me is a very beautiful city but she too says 
hello and wishes you all good luck 
let me say its also a great pleasure to once again have this 
opportunity to speak directly to the people of the soviet union 
before i left washington i received many heartfelt letters and 
telegrams asking me to carry here a simple message perhaps but 
also one of the most important business of this summit it is a 
message of peace and good will and hope for a growing friendship 
and closeness between our two peoples 
as you know ive come to moscow to meet with one of your most 
distinguished graduates in this our fourth summit general 
secretary gorbachev and i have spent many hours together and i 
feel that were getting to know each other well our discussions 
of course have been focused primarily on many of the important 
issues of the day issues i want to touch on with you in a few 
moments 
but first i want to take a little time to talk to you much as 
i would to any group of university students in the united states i 
want to talk not just of the realities of today but of the 
possibilities of tomorrow 
standing here before a mural of your revolution i want to talk 
about a very different revolution that is taking place right now 
quietly sweeping the globe without bloodshed or conflict its 
effects are peaceful but they will fundamentally alter our world 
shatter old assumptions and reshape our lives its easy to 
underestimate because its not accompanied by banners or fanfare 
its been called the technological or information 
revolution and as its emblem one might take the tiny silicon 
chip no bigger than a fingerprint one of these chips has more 
computing power than a roomful of oldstyle computers as part of 
an exchange program we now have an exhibition touring your country 
that shows how information technology is transforming our lives 
replacing manual labor with robots forecasting weather for 
farmers or mapping the genetic code of dna for medical 
researchers these microcomputers today aid the design of 
everything from houses to cars to spacecraft they even design 
better and faster computers 
they can translate english into russian or enable the blind to 
read or help michael jackson produce on one synthesizer the sounds 
of a whole orchestra linked by a network of satellites and fiber 
optic cables one individual with a desktop computer and a 
telephone commands resources unavailable to the largest governments 
just a few years ago 
like a chrysalis we are emerging from the economy of the 
industrial revolution an economy confined to and limited by the 
earths physical resources into as one economist titled his book 
the economy in mind in which there are no bounds on human 
imagination and the freedom to create is the most precious natural 
resource 
think of that little computer chip its value isnt in the sand 
from which it is made but in the microscopic architecture designed 
into it by ingenious human minds or take the example of the 
satellite relaying this broadcast around the world which replaces 
thousands of tons of copper mined from the earth and molded into 
wire 
in the new economy human invention increasingly makes physical 
resources obsolete we are breaking through the material conditions 
of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny even as 
we explore the most advanced reaches of science we are returning 
to the ageold wisdom of our culture a wisdom contained in the 
book of the genesis in the bible in the beginning was the spirit 
and it was from this spirit that the material abundance of creation 
issued forth 
but progress is not foreordained the key is freedom freedom 
of thought freedom of information freedom of communication the 
renowned scientist scholar and founding father of this university 
mikhail lomonosov knew that it is common knowledge he said 
that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid 
particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by 
the freedom of philosophy 
you know one of the first contacts between your country and 
mine took place between russian and american explorers the 
americans were members of cooks last voyage on an expedition 
searching for an arctic passage on the island of unalaska they 
came upon the russians who took them in and together with the 
native inhabitants held a prayer service on the ice 
the explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs men with 
vision with a courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the 
unknown these entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are 
responsible for almost all the economic growth in the united states 
they are the prime movers of the technological revolution in 
fact one of the largest personal computer firms in the united 
states was started by two college students no older than you in 
the garage behind their home some people even in my own country 
look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only 
waste what of all the entrepreneurs that fail 
well many do particularly the successful ones often several 
times and if you ask them the secret of their success theyll 
tell you its all that they learned in their struggles along the 
way yes its what they learned from failing like an athlete in 
competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth 
experience is the greatest teacher and thats why its so hard 
for government planners no matter how sophisticated to ever 
substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to 
make their dreams come true

the fact is bureaucracies are a problem around the world 
theres an old story about a town it could be anywhere with a 
bureaucrat who is known to be a goodfornothing but he somehow 
had always hung onto power so one day in a town meeting an old 
woman got up and said to him there is a folk legend here where 
i come from that when a baby is born an angel comes down from 
heaven and kisses it on one part of its body if the angel kisses 
him on his hand he becomes a handyman if he kisses him on his 
forehead he becomes bright and clever and ive been trying to 
figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there 
for so long and do nothing applause 
we are seeing the power of economic freedom spreading around the 
world places such as the republic of korea singapore taiwan have 
vaulted into the technological era barely pausing in the 
industrial age along the way lowtax agricultural policies in the 
subcontinent mean that in some years india is now a net exporter 
of food perhaps most exciting are the winds of change that are 
blowing over the peoples republic of china where onequarter of 
the worlds population is now getting its first taste of economic 
freedom 
at the same time the growth of democracy has become one of the 
most powerful political movements of our age in latin america in 
the 1970s only a third of the population lived under democratic 
government today over 90 percent does in the philippines in the 
republic of korea free contested democratic elections are the 
order of the day throughout the world free markets are the model 
for growth democracy is the standard by which governments are 
measured 
we americans make no secret of our belief in freedom in fact 
its something of a national pastime every four years the 
american people choose a new president and 1988 is one of those 
years at one point there were 13 major candidates running in the 
two major parties not to mention all the others including the 
socialist and libertarian candidates all trying to get my job 
about a 1000 local television stations 8500 radio stations 
and 1700 daily newspapers each one an independent private 
enterprise fiercely independent of the government report on the 
candidates grill them in interviews and bring them together for 
debates in the end the people vote they decide who will be the 
next president 
but freedom doesnt begin or end with elections go to any 
american town to take just an example and youll see dozens of 
churches representing many different beliefs in many places 
synagogues and mosques and you will see families of every 
conceivable nationality worshiping together go into any school 
room and there you will see children being taught the declaration 
of independence that they are endowed by their creator with 
certain inalienable rights among them life liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness that no government can justly deny the 
guarantees in their constitution for freedom of speech freedom of 
assembly and freedom of religion 
go into any courtroom and there will preside an independent 
judge beholden to no government power there every defendant has 
the right to a trial by a jury of his peers usually 12 men and 
women common citizens they are the ones the only ones who weigh 
the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence in that court the 
accused is innocent until proven guilty and the word of a 
policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the 
word of the accused 
go to any university campus and there you will find an open 
sometimes heated discussion of the problems in american society and 
what can be done to correct them turn on the television and you 
will see the legislature conducting the business of government 
right there before the camera debating and voting on the 
legislation that will become the law of the land 
march in any demonstration and there are many of them the 
peoples right of assembly is guaranteed in the constitution and 
protected by the police go into any union hall where the members 
know their right to strike is protected by law as a matter of 
fact one of the many jobs i had before this one was being 
president of a union the screen actors guild i led my union out 
on strike and im proud to say we won 
but freedom is more even than this freedom is the right to 
question and change the established way of doing things it is the 
continuing revolution of the marketplace it is the understanding 
that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions it is 
the right to put forth and idea scoffed at by the experts and 
watch it catch fire among the people it is the right to stick to 
dream to follow your dream or stick to your conscience even if 
you are the only one in a sea of doubters 
freedom is the recognition that no single person no single 
authority or government has a monopoly on the truth but that every 
individual life is infinitely precious that every one of us put on 
this world has been put there for a reason and has something to 
offer 
america is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities our 
ties to you are more than ones of good feeling theyre ties of 
kinship in america youll find russians armenians ukrainians 
peoples from eastern europe and central asia they come from every 
part of this vast continent from every continent to live in 
harmony seeking a place where each cultural heritage is respected 
each is valued for its diverse strengths and beauties and the 
richness it brings to our lives 
recently a few individuals and families have been allowed to 
visit relatives in the west we can only hope that it wont be long 
before all are allowed to do so and ukrainianamericans 
balticamericans armenianamericans can freely visit their 
homelands just as this irishamerican visits his

freedom it has been said makes people selfish and 
materialistic but americans are one of the most religious peoples 
on earth because they know that liberty just as life itself is 
not earned but a gift from god they seek to share that gift with 
the world reason and experience said george washington in his 
farewell address both forbid us to expect that national morality 
can prevail in exclusion of religious principle and it is 
substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of 
popular government 
democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to 
keep government limited unintrusive a system of constraints on 
power to keep politics and government secondary to the important 
things in life the true sources of value found only in family and 
faith but i hope you know i go on about these things not simply 
to extol the virtues of my own country but to speak to the true 
greatness of the heart and soul of your land 
who after all needs to tell the land of dostoyevsky about the 
quest for truth the home of kandinsky and scriabin about 
imagination the rich and noble culture of the uzbek man of 
letters ali sheer nevoyai about beauty and heart the great 
culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all 
humanity 
let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on 
human freedom it comes not from the literature of america but 
from this country from one of the greatest writers of the 20th 
century boris pasternak in the novel dr zhivago he writes 
i think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down 
by threats any kind of threat whether of jail or of retribution 
after death then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion 
tamer in the circus with his whip not the prophet who sacrificed 
himself 
but this is just the point what has for centuries raised man 
above the beast is not the cudgel but an inward music the 
irresistible power of unarmed truth the irresistible power of 
unarmed truth 
today the world looks expectedly to signs of change steps 
toward greater freedom in the soviet union we watch and we hope as 
we see positive changes taking place there are some i know in your 
society who fear that change will bring only disruption and 
discontinuity who fear to embrace the hope of the future 
sometimes it takes faith its like that scene in the cowboy 
movie butch cassidy and the sundance kid which some here in 
moscow recently had a chance to see 
the posse is closing in on the two outlaws butch and sundance 
who find themselves trapped on the edge of a cliff with a sheer 
drop of hundreds of feet to the raging rapids below butch turns to 
sundance and says their only hope is to jump into the river below 
but sundance refuses he says hed rather fight it out with the 
posse even though theyre hopelessly outnumbered butch says 
thats suicide and urges him to jump but sundance still refuses 
and finally admits i cant swim butch breaks up laughing and 
says you crazy fool the fall will probably kill you and by 
the way both butch and sundance made it in case you didnt see 
the movie 
i think what ive just been talking about is perestroika and 
what its goals are but change would not mean rejection of the 
past like a tree growing strong through the seasons rooted in the 
earth and drawing life from the sun so too positive change must 
be rooted in traditional values in the land in culture in 
family and community and it must take its life from the eternal 
things from the source of all life which is faith such change 
will lead to new understandings new opportunities to a broader 
future in which the tradition is not supplanted but finds its full 
flowering 
that is the future beckoning to your generation at the same 
time we should remember that reform that is not institutionalized 
will always be insecure such freedom will always be looking over 
its shoulder a bird on a tether no matter how long the rope can 
always be pulled back 
and that is why in my conversation with general secretary 
gorbachev i have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize 
change to put guarantees on reform and we have been talking 
together about one sad reminder of a divided world the berlin wall 
its time to remove the barriers that keep people apart i am 
proposing an increased exchange program of high school students 
between our countries general secretary gorbachev mentioned on 
sunday a wonderful phrase you have in russian for this better to 
see something once than to hear about it a hundred times 
mr gorbachev and i first began working on this in 1985 in our 
discussion today we agreed on working up to several thousand 
exchanges a year from each country in the near future but not 
everyone can travel across the continents and oceans 
words travel lighter and thats why wed like to make available 
to this country more of our 11000 magazines and periodicals and 
our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite 
in seconds nothing would please us more than for the soviet people 
to get to know us better and to understand our way of life 
just a few years ago few would have imagined the progress our 
two nations have made together the inf treaty which general 
secretary gorbachev and i signed last december in washington and 
whose instruments of ratification we will exchange tomorrow the 
first true nuclear arms reduction treaty in history calling for 
the elimination of an entire class of us and soviet nuclear 
missiles

and just 16 days ago we saw the beginning of your withdrawal 
from afghanistan which gives us hope that soon the fighting may 
end and the healing may begin and that that suffering country may 
find selfdetermination unity and peace at long last 
its my fervent hope that our constructive cooperation on these 
issues will be carried on to address the continuing destruction of 
conflicts in many regions of the globe and that the serious 
discussions that led to the geneva accords on afghanistan will help 
lead to solutions in southern africa ethiopia cambodia the 
persian gulf and central america 
i have often said nations do not distrust each other because 
they are armed they are armed because they distrust each other if 
this globe is to live in peace and prosper if it is to embrace all 
the possibilities of technological revolution then nations must 
renounce once and for all the right to an expansionist foreign 
policy peace between nations must be an enduring goal not a 
tactical stage in a continuing conflict 
ive been told that theres a popular song in your country 
perhaps you know it whose evocative refrain asks the question 
do the russians want a war in answer it says go ask that 
silence lingering in the air above the birch and poplar there 
beneath those trees the soldiers lie go ask my mother ask my 
wife then you will have to ask no more do the russians want a 
war 
but what of your onetime allies what of those who embraced you 
on the elbe what if we were to ask the watery graves of the 
pacific or the european battlefields where americas fallen were 
buried far from home what if we were to ask their mothers sisters 
and sons do americans want war ask us too and youll find the 
same answer the same longing in every heart 
people do not make wars governments do and no mother would 
ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain for 
economic advantage for ideology a people free to choose will 
always choose peace americans seek always to make friends of old 
antagonists 
after a colonial revolution with britain we have cemented for 
all ages the ties of kinship between our nations after a terrible 
civil war between north and south we healed our wounds and found 
true unity as a nation weve fought two world wars in my lifetime 
against germany and one with japan but now the federal republic of 
germany and japan are two of our closest allies and friends 
some people point to the trade disputes between us as a sign of 
strength but theyre the frictions of all families and the family 
of free nations is a big and vital and sometimes boisterous one 
i can tell you that nothing would please my heart more than in 
my lifetime to see american and soviet diplomats grappling with the 
problem of trade disputes between american and a growing 
exuberant exporting soviet union that it opened up to economic 
freedom and growth

and as important as these official peopletopeople exchanges 
are nothing would please me more than for them to become 
unnecessary to see travel between east and west become so routine 
that university students in the soviet union could take a month off 
in the summer and just like students in the west do now put 
packs on their backs and travel from country to country in europe 
and with barely a passport check in between nothing would please 
me more than to see the day that a concert promoter in say 
england could call up a soviet rock group without going through 
any government agency and have them playing in liverpool the next 
night 
is this just a dream perhaps but it is a dream that is our 
responsibility to have come true your generation is living in one 
of the most exciting hopeful times in soviet history it is a time 
when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats 
to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulated spiritual 
energies of a long silence yearn to break free 
i am reminded of the famous passage near the end of gogols 
dead souls comparing his nation to a speeding troika gogol 
asks what will be its destination but he writes there was 
no answer save the bell pouring forth a marvelous sound 
we do not know what the conclusion of this will be of this 
journey but we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be 
fulfilled in this moscow spring this may 1988 we may be allowed 
that hope that freedom like the fresh green sapling planted over 
tolstoys grave will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile 
soil of your people and culture we may be allowed to hope that the 
marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rising through ringing 
through leading to a new world of reconciliation friendship and 
peace 
thank you all very much and da blagoslovit da gospod god 
bless you applause

sunny skies a warm breeze temperatures around 80 
and the lilacs in full bloom moscow could hardly be lovelier and 
ronald reagan has made it nicer than usual for muscovites 
reagans legendary good luck and a crash cleanup by soviet work 
crews combined to put the prettiest possible face on this otherwise 
seedy capital for the superpower summit 
even the citys notorious pookh the cottonwool summer 
scourge that falls from the citys silver poplar trees fills the 
air and covers the ground like snow has cooperated it is having 
either a late season or a light one 
yuri somov an architect and wouldbe artist was displaying his 
favorite painting on a downtown street when three americans 
approached one asked how much hed take for his painting a 
stylized russian orthodox church scene when he discovered their 
nationality however he insisted he couldnt sell his favorite 
work but wanted to give it to the american president 
to mr ronald reagan with profound respect he wrote on the 
back and signed his name the painting found its way to reagans 
white house staff 
it was typical of the outpouring of goodwill that has greeted 
the swarm of americans and other foreigners mostly journalists 
who have descended on moscow for the meetings between soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev and reagan 
a 25yearold woman standing at the edge of red square who 
identified herself as olga said moscow streets look prettier 
because they cleaned everything up for this summit 
if only it would stay this way she said 
it wont although the constant hosing down and sweeping of the 
streets is not extraordinary here street sweepers are undeterred 
even by moscows frequent rainy days but poor grading and 
practically nonexistent drainage ensure that the streets have 
almost perpetual puddles in summer dirt becomes mud only to be 
redistributed by the next storm or water truck 
some americans particularly those who visited moscow when 
relations were more strained and its people more suspicious of 
foreigners have been surprised by muscovites approaching them on 
the street just to practice their english or exchange pleasantries 
on the arbat the pedestrian mall in the restored historic 
district that reagan visited shortly after arriving sunday one 
artist displayed a mural depicting familiar moscow monuments and 
in the middle was a cherubic babe holding american and soviet flags 
the artist who called himself vladimir britikovcambridge told 
a reporter ronald is one of us hes an artist 
but if the summit has brought out a friendly comraderie in a 
society where people often pass on the street without acknowledging 
each other it also has meant some inconvenience 
authorities announced before reagan arrived that people without 
residence permits would not be allowed to come into the city this 
week effectively banning an estimated 3 million visitors from 
outside the capital who crowd in on any given day to stay with 
relatives shop sell homeproduced goods or search for 
hardtofind commodities 
permanent residents who live near summit sites have been pleased 
to discover rarely found goods on store shelves that have been 
barren most of the winter 
one shopper refused to believe that an ordinary shop was selling 
danish canned ham a rarity in the best of times even in the 
hardcurrency berioska stores set up for foreigners 
cars without moscow plates and those that police inspectors fear 
might break down and clutter the streets have been stopped at 
roadblocks set up at the city limits 
but if the stringent controls have cut down on traffic volume 
the extraordinary enthusiasm of the foot police assigned to seal 
off much of the city center has snarled the remaining traffic in a 
city which hardly has enough cars to stage a respectable rush hour 
more than one driver has exercised his newfound freedom of 
expression to give policemen a candid opinion of a system that 
leads innocent motorists into a trap where all vehicles trucks and 
buses included must stop and turn around in the street to escape 
horrendous tieups 
a moscow taxi driver who spent 20 minutes to drive less than 
three miles grumbled to his american passenger your president 
comes and then when i want to go this way i have to go the 
opposite way instead

here is the exchange on american indians during 
president reagans questionandanswer session tuesday at moscow 
university the questioner refers to the presence in moscow of 
three representatives of the american indian movement to call 
attention to the problems of indians 
moderator a question from a student from the biological 
faculty mr president i heard that a group of american indians 
have come here because they couldnt meet you in the united states 
of america if you fail to meet them here will you be able to 
improve to correct it and to meet them back in the united states 
president reagan i didnt know that they had asked to see me 
if theyve come here or whether to see them there id be very 
happy to see them 
let me tell you just a little something about the american 
indian in our land we have provided millions of acres of land for 
what are called preservations or the reservations i should say 
they from the beginning announced that they wanted to maintain 
their way of life as they had always lived there in the desert and 
the plains and so forth and we set up these reservations so they 
could and have a bureau of indian affairs to help take care of 
them 
at the same time we provide education for them schools on the 
reservations and theyre free also to leave the reservations and 
be american citizens among the rest of us and many do 
some still prefer however that way of that early way of 
life and weve done everything we can to meet their demands as to 
what they how they want to live 
maybe we made a mistake maybe we should not have humored them 
in that wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle maybe 
we should have said no come join us be citizens along with the 
rest of us 
as i say many have many have been very successful and im 
very pleased to meet with them talk with them at any time and see 
what their grievances are or what they feel they might be 
and youd be surprised some of them became very wealthy because 
some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil and 
you can get very rich pumping oil 
and so i dont know what their complaint might be

wearing a wide smile the local 
communist party chief put his arm around an american visitor and 
steered him into his paneled office to watch the latest tv report 
on the moscow summit 
may these sunny may days at the kremlin mean that a new page 
has been turned in the history between our countries igor a 
tolstoukhov said at one point tuesday 
in volgograd olga v sovelyova picked her way through a thick 
crowd when she heard there was an american nearby removed her 
sunglasses and extended her hand 
i want to congratulate you on the ratification of the 
mediumrange missile treaty by your senate said the plump 
41yearold russian woman things are looking up for relations 
between us 
for a reporter on a 1900mile swing through the russian 
heartland the hopes inspired by the meeting between president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev are immediately 
apparent because soviets readily express them 
i just wanted to say that we want to be friends with you 
said a shy teenaged girl in stavropol who then left a bookstore on 
karl marx prospekt that among other things sells posters condemning 
us militarism 
if there is a peoria in the soviet union the moscow summit 
appears to be playing well there 
thats the case even if the hopes it inspires are tempered by 
memories of past swings in superpower relations and the political 
fact that reagan will be out of office in january 
for most soviets the ronald reagan who once joked about bombing 
their country has been replaced by a wiser more sober statesman 
who has joined with their countrys leader in seeking tighter 
ussoviet relations 
he has changed said tolstoukhov 49 party chief for a 
region the size of holland centered around the ancient city of 
yaroslavl 150 miles north of moscow but after all he was once 
a democrat who became a republican 
in interviews many people credited recent changes in the soviet 
union itself for bringing reagan to the capital of the socialist 
nation he once called an evil empire 
as mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev said it is better to once 
see than to hear 100 times tolstoukhov said we hope he will 
sense the hospitality of our russian people and their desire for 
peace 
gennady p starostin mayor of stavropol said we are all 
people and we all live on the same tiny planet all of us want to 
live longer and better the only place we should be competing is at 
the stadium 
among some soviets however the hopes are twinned with 
suspicions fueled in part by incomplete knowledge about how the 
us political system functions 
a collective farmer in the village of beshpagir 25 miles from 
stavropol thought the lengthy debate over mediumrange nuclear 
treaty meant the united states was backing out on its commitment 
your president signed it why isnt that enough said the 
sunburned man standing outside his cottage dont you trust us 
but the man in his 40s who gave his name only as vassily is an 
exception most soviets spoke wistfully of the highwater marks in 
ussoviet relations the wartime alliance against nazi germany 
the soyuzapollo flight the detente of the 1970s 
mrs sovelyova was among them a guide at the monument to the 
world war ii battle of stalingrad now called volgograd she 
gestured to the stone pillars that commemorate the red army 
soldiers who died in battle 
we were once in a common cause she said let us work 
together to reinforce peace on our beautiful green planet

following are excerpts of president reagans 
exchange tuesday with students at moscow state university 
moderator dear friends mr president has kindly agreed to 
answer questions but since he doesnt have too much time only 15 
minutes so those who have questions please ask them 
q this is a student from the history faculty and he says that 
hes happy to welcome you on behalf of the students of the 
university do you think that itll be possible for you and the 
general secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic 
arms during the time that you are still president 
a this is a much more complicated treaty than the inf treaty 
the intermediaterange treaty which we have signed and which our 
two governments have ratified and is now in effect so there are 
many things still to be settled once we had hoped that maybe 
like the inf treaty we would have been able to sign it here at 
this summit meeting it is not completed there are still some 
points that are being debated 
we are both hopeful that it can be finished before i leave 
office which is in the coming january but i assure you that if it 
isnt i will have impressed on my successor that we must carry 
on until it is signed my dream has always been that once weve 
started down this road we can look forward to a day you can look 
forward to a day when there will be no more nuclear weapons in the 
world at all applause 
q the student wonders how the youths have changed since the 
days when you were a student up till now 
a well i know there was a period in our country when there was 
a very great change for the worst when i was governor of 
california i could start a riot just by going to a campus but 
that has all changed and i could be looking out at an american 
student body as well as im looking out here and would not be able 
to tell the difference between you 
i did happen to go to school and get my college education in a 
unique time it was the time of the great depression when in a 
country like our own there was 25 percent unemployment and the 
bottom seemed to fall out of everything 
i think what maybe i should be telling you from my point here 
because i graduated in 1932 that you know an awful lot more 
about being young than you do about being old and i think there is 
a seriousness i think theres a sense of responsibility that young 
people have and i think that theres an awareness on the part of 
most of you about what you want your adulthood to be and what 
the country you live in you want it to be 
and i have a great deal of faith i said the other day to 76 
students they were half american and half russian i believe if 
all the young people of the world today could get to know each 
other there would never be another war 
q mr president you have just mentioned that you welcome the 
efforts aimed at the settlement of the afghani question and it 
might promote the settlement of other regional conflicts what 
conflicts do you mean central american conflicts southeast 
asian or south african 
a well for example in south africa where namibia has been 
promised its independence as a nation it is impossible because 
of a civil war going on in another country there and that civil 
war is being fought on one side by some 30000 to 40000 cuban 
troops who have gone from the americas over there and are fighting 
on one side with one kind of authoritative government but what 
we believe is that those foreign soldiers should get out and let 
them settle it let them the citizens of that nation settle their 
problems 
and the same is true in nicaragua nicaragua had a 
dictator there there was an organization that then was aided by 
others in the revolution and they appealed to the organization of 
american states for help in getting the dictator to step down stop 
the killing and he did but the organization of american states 
had asked what are the goals of the revolution and they were 
given in writing and they were the goals of a pluralistic society 
of the right of unions and freedom of speech and press and so 
forth and free elections 
and then the one group that was the best organized among the 
revolutionaries seized power exiled many of the other leaders and 
has its own government which violated every one of the promises 
that had been made and here again were trying to encourage 
the making of those promises come true and letting the people 
of that particular country decide their fate 
q i am very much anxious and concerned about the destiny of 310 
soviet soldiers missing in afghanistan can you are you willing to 
help in their search and their return to the motherland 
a very much so we would like nothing better than that 
q the realization of the unalienable right of citizens 
guaranteed by the constitution faces certain problems for example 
the right of people to have arms or for example whether a 
spread of pornography or narcotics is compatible with these rights 
do you believe that these problems just are unavoidable problems 
connected with democracies or they could be avoided 
a if i understand you correctly does that include the 
right to do criminal acts and for example in the use of drugs and 
so forth no laughter applause 
no we have a set of laws our constitution is a document in 
which we the people tell the government what its powers are 
but very carefully at the same time the people give the 
government the power with regard to those things which they think 
would be destructive to society the government can enforce the 
laws but that has all been dictated by the people

q since your term of office is coming to an end what sentiment 
do you experience and whether you feel like if hypothetically you 
can just stay for another term 
a there has kind of grown a tradition in our country about two 
terms it was just a tradition and then roosevelt ran the four 
times died very early in his fourth term and suddenly in the 
atmosphere at that time they added an amendment to the 
constitution that presidents could only serve two terms 
when i get out of office im going to travel around and try 
to convince the people of our country that they should wipe out 
that amendment to the constitution because it was an interference 
with the democratic rights of the people the people should be 
allowed to vote for who they wanted to vote for as many times as 
they want to vote for them and that it is they who are being 
denied a right applause 
in hollywood when i was there if you didnt sing or dance you 
wound up as an afterdinner speaker and i didnt sing or dance so 
i have a hunch that i will be out on the speaking circuit telling 
about a few things that i didnt get done in government but urging 
the people to tell the congress they wanted them done applause 
q i heard that a group of american indians have come here 
because they couldnt meet you in the united states of america if 
you fail to meet them here will you be able to correct it and 
to meet them back in the united states 
a i didnt know that they had asked to see me id be very 
happy to see them 
they from the beginning announced that they wanted to maintain 
their way of life and we set up these reservations so they 
could and have a bureau of indian affairs to help take care of

and theyre free also to leave the reservations and be american 
citizens among the rest of us and many do some still prefer 
however that early way of life 
maybe we made a mistake maybe we should not have humored them

we should have said no come join us be citizens along with the 
rest of us 
im very pleased to meet with them talk with them at any time 
and see what their grievances are or what they feel they might be 
and youd be surprised some of them became very wealthy because 
some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil and 
you can get very rich pumping oil and so i dont know what their 
complaint might be q why did you receive yesterday just 
refuseniks or dissidents just what are your impressions from 
soviet people 
a you have to realize that we are a people that are made up of 
every strain nationality and race of the world and the result is 
that when people in our country think someone is being mistreated 
or treated unjustly in another country these are people who still 
feel that kinship to that country because that is their heritage 
what i have brought to the general secretary and i must say he 
has been very cooperative about it i have brought lists of names 
that have been brought to me that are from people that are 
relatives or friends that believe that this individual is being 
mistreated here in this country and they want them to be allowed 
to emigrate to our country some are separated families 
now im not blaming you im blaming bureaucracy we have the 
same type of thing happen in our own country and every once in 
while somebody has to get the bureaucracy by the neck and shake it 
loose and say stop doing what youre doing 
moderator makes comment in russian followed by applause 
a thank you very much applause you are all very kind 
nobody asked me what it was going to feel like to not be president 
anymore i have some understanding because after id been governor 
for eight years and then stepped down wed only been home a 
few days and someone invited us out to dinner nancy and i both 
went out got in the back seat of the car and waited for somebody 
to get in the front and drive us

drink to me only with thine eyes premiered 
by american ballet theater on tuesday night at the metropolitan 
opera house is a pleasing lighthearted dance the first 
choreographed for the company by mark morris 
morris who heads his own modern dance group succeeds here by 
being interesting but not pushing cleverness too far and being 
inventive but not pushing that either 
the mood of the dancing fit the mood of each of the 13 sections 
of music from virgil thomsons etudes for piano pianist 
michael boriskin played a grand piano at the stages rear center 
mikhail baryshnikov danced but there is no star part there 
was much coming and going there were touches of humor as when a 
dancer would enter at one side dance straight across the stage and 
exit or when dancers would enter make a uturn and return 
immediately to the wings 
morris sometimes repeated images like having the women clasp 
their hands over their heads and lean back against their partners 
arm he would walk around in a circle partly carrying the 
ballerinas weight with her pivoting on one toe

here is a transcript of president reagans remarks 
tuesday to members of the cultural and arts community at the house 
of artists 
well as henry viii said to each of his six wives i wont 
keep you long 
laughter 
thank you vladimir vasilovich its with some humility that i 
come here today you here writers artists dramatists musicians 
of this vast country are heirs to the seminal figures in many of 
the arts as they have developed in the 20th century europe and 
america im thinking of such giants as kandinsky stravinsky 
stanislavsky dostoyevsky to name a few men whose vision 
transformed all of ours 
ive been very impressed with what ive heard just now for my 
contribution to this dialogue i thought i would deal here briefly 
with a question whose answer might open up some new insights for 
all of us you see ive been told that many of you were puzzled 
that a former actor could become the leader of a great nation 
particularly the united states what does acting have to do with 
politics and statecraft whatever possessed the american people to 
entrust this high office to me you might feel reassured to know 
that you arent the first to ask that question back in washington 
just about every member of the political opposition has been asking 
it for the last eight years and theyre not the first its been 
happening ever since 
almost a quarter of a century ago i announced that i was going 
to run for what turned out to be the first public office i ever 
held governor of california yes i had served as president of my 
union the screen actors guild yes in that role id led a 
successful strike by the union against the studios and yes i had 
campaigned actively for a number of candidates for office 
including candidates for president but i was still known primarily 
as an actor 
in the movie business actors often get what we call type 
cast that is the studios come to think of you as playing 
certain kinds of roles so those are the kinds of roles they give 
you and no matter how hard you try you just cant get them to 
think of you in any other way well politics is a little like that 
too so ive had a lot of time and reason to think about my role 
not just as a citizen turned politician but as an actor turned 
politician 
in looking back i believe acting did prepare me for the work i 
do now there are two things two indispensable lessons that ive 
taken from my craft into public life and i hope you wont think it 
excessive opportune if i use the words of a soviet filmmaker to 
explain one of them he was after all one of the worlds greatest 
filmmakers and so like so many of your artists indeed like so 
many of you belongs in a broader sense to all of humanity 
it was during the production of ivan the terrible when 
eisenstein noted that in making a film or in thinking through any 
detail of it which to my mind the acting of a part in his 
words the most important thing is to have the vision the next 
is to grasp and hold it you must see and feel what you are 
thinking you must see and grasp it you must hold and fix it in 
your memory and senses and you must do it at once 
to grasp and hold a vision to fix it in your senses that is 
the very essence i believe of successful leadership not only on 
the movie set where i learned about it but everywhere and by 
the way in my many dealings with him since he became general 
secretary ive found that mr gorbachev has the ability to grasp 
and hold a vision and i respect him for that 
the second lesson i carried from acting into public life was 
more subtle and let me again refer to a soviet artist a poet 
again one of the worlds greatest at the beginning of requiem 
anna akhmatova writes of standing in a line outside a prison when 
someone in the crowd recognizes her as a wellknown poet she 
continues then a woman standing behind me whose lips were blue 
with cold and who naturally enough had never even heard of my 
name emerged from that state of torpor common to us all and 
putting her lips close to my ear there everyone spoke in whispers 
asked me and could you describe this and i answered her i 
can then something vaguely like a smile flashed across what once 
had been her face that exchange can you describe this i 
can is at the heart of acting as it is of poetry and of so many 
of the arts you get inside a character a place and a moment you 
come to know the character in that instant not as an abstraction 
one of the people one of the masses but as a particular person 
yearning hoping fearing loving a face even what had once been 
a face apart from all others and you convey that knowledge you 
describe it you describe the face

pretty soon at least for me it becomes harder and harder to 
force any member of humanity into a straightjacket into some 
rigid form in which you all expect to fit in acting even as you 
develop an appreciation for what we call the dramatic you become 
in a more intimate way less taken with superficial pomp and 
circumstance more attentive to the core of the soul that part of 
each of us that god holds in the hollow of his hand and into which 
he breaths the breath of life and you come to appreciate what 
another of your poets nikolai gumilov meant when he wrote that 
the eternal entrance to gods paradise is not closed with seven 
diamond seals it is a doorway in a wall abandoned long ago 
stones moss and nothing more 
as i see it political leadership in a democracy requires seeing 
past the adstractions and embracing the vast diversity of humanity 
and doing it with humility listening as best you can not just to 
those with high positions but to the cacophonous voices of 
ordinary people and trusting those millions of people keeping out 
of their way not trying to act the allwise and allpowerful not 
letting government act that way and the word we have for this is 
freedom 
in the last few years freedom for the arts has been expanded in 
the soviet union some poems books music and works in other 
fields that were once banned have been made available to the 
public and some of those artists who produced them have been 
recognized two weeks ago because of the work of the writers 
union the first step was taken to make the pasternak home at 
peredelkino into a museum in the meantime some artists in exile 
the stage director yuri lubimov for example have been permitted 
to return and to work and artists who are here have been allowed a 
greater range 
we in the united states applaud the new thaw in the arts we 
hope to see it go further we hope to see mikhail baryshnikov and 
slava rostropovich artists mrs and i have seen perform in 
washington perform again in moscow we hope to see the works of 
aleksandr solzhenitsyn published in the land he loves and we hope 
to see a permanent end to the restrictions on the creativity of all 
artists and writers we want this not just for your sake but for 
our own we believe that the greater the freedoms in other 
countries the more secure both our own freedoms and peace and we 
believe that when the arts in any country are free to blossom the 
lives of all people are richer 
william faulkner said of poets although he could have been 
speaking of any of the arts it is the poets privilege to help 
man endure by lifting his heart by reminding him of the courage 
and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice 
which have been the glory of our past the poets voice need not 
merely be the record of man it can be one of the props the 
pillars to help him endure and prevail 
thank you for having me here today and for sharing your 
thoughts with me and god bless you all

here is a transcript of soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs toast tuesday at the dinner president reagan hosted at 
the home of the us ambassador 
esteemed mr president esteemed mrs reagan ladies and 
gentlemen comrades i thank you mr president for the words of 
greeting youve just addressed to us two great nations have given 
the two of us a mandate to determine what sovietamerican relations 
should be like since our first meeting in geneva relations 
between our two countries have overcome a long drawnout period of 
confrontation to reach an acceptable level from it which it is now 
easier to move forward in reykjavik in washington and during 
this present visit of yours our dialogue has been intense its 
most important result has been the nowratified first treaty to 
reduce nuclear weapons a search is continuing to find a solution 
for problems relating to 50 percent cuts in strategic offensive 
arms the geneva accord on afghanistan has come into force we now 
have as many as 47 bilateral agreements on cooperation 
the visit by a president of the united states to the soviet 
union is an occasion for a glance at the past and a look into the 
future the history of relations between our two countries has 
known all kinds of things good and bad of the good things we 
remember particularly well the sovietamerican comradeship in arms 
in world war ii those grim years saw the emergence of the first 
shoots of sovietamerican friendship and there was not one single 
soviet citizen who did not feel bitter when that glorious page in 
the history of our relations gave way to cold war that was a hard 
test for our peoples the world found itself in a dangerous 
situation we all felt the breath of impending catastrophe even 
today were sometimes chilled by cold winds but world 
developments in their main tendency are turning toward a search 
for political solutions toward cooperation and peace we are all 
of us witnesses to momentous changes though a lot still has to be 
done to achieve irreversible change 
although everything urges cooperation and trust prejudices and 
stereotypes are still with us as is rivalry above all in the 
military sphere a great deal has been said at this meeting too 
about how pointless and catastrophic it is more importantly we 
can register some headway toward better mutual understanding in 
this area as well 
today i would like to address another major world problem the 
situation in the developing world which cannot but affect our 
countries too the problems which the developing countries face 
have turned out to be difficult to the point of tragedy glaring 
backwardness hunger poverty and mass diseases continue to beset 
entire nations and incredibly high debt has become an excruciating 
and universal problem it would seem that everybody can see its 
complexity involving as it does extremely diverse and truly vital 
interests and understand that a way out must be sought 
we believe that if the international community and above all 
the great powers are to be of any help the starting point and the 
essential thing is to recognize unconditionally the freedom of 
choice we are insisting on fairness we have seriously studied the 
economic situation in developing nations and i am convinced that a 
way out is possible along the lines of a radical restructuring of 
the entire system of world economic relations without any 
discrimination for political reasons this would promote a 
political settlement of regional conflicts which not only impede 
progress in that part of the world but also cause turmoil in the 
entire world situation with such an approach our differences as 
to what kind of a future awaits the third world would not take on 
confrontational forms so in this matter too our relationship is 
doomed to have an international dimension 
turning now to our bilateral relations we envision their 
opportunities and prospects primarily in the light of internal 
evolution in both countries but also in the context of world 
developments many americans who are studying us and who have 
visited the ussr and now i hope those present here as well have 
been able to see for themselves the sweeping scope of change in our 
country it is based on comprehensive democratization and radical 
economic reform i am gratified to note that today the president 
and i have had an indepth exchange of views on this subject we 
have also discussed our perestroika a number of times with other 
americans this is all to the good it too is a sign of change in 
our relationship 
we for our part are trying to closely follow the profound 
trends in the united states we see how little similarity there is 
between what is happening in our country and in yours in two very 
different societies based on different values but we do not regard 
this as an obstacle to identifying promising areas for mutually 
beneficial ties or for cooperation in the interests of the two 
peoples were in favor of competition and comparison 
and another thing whatever the ups and downs of our dialogue 
with america soviet representatives have been upholding the 
interests of the soviet state in their contacts with us american 
officials have been acting in exactly the same way visavis their 
own interests the truth is that in building their relationship 
the soviet union and the united states can effectively serve their 
own interests only if they have a realistic view and take account 
of each others interests and intentions 
we must learn the difficult art of not just existing side by 
side but of building bridges of mutually beneficial cooperation 
soviet and american people want to live in peace and communicate in 
all areas in which they have a mutual interest the interest is 
theirs and it is growing we feel no fear we are not prejudiced 
we believe in the value of communication 
i ee a future in which the soviet union and the united states 
base their relations on disarmament a balance of interest and 
comprehensive cooperation rather than on deterring each other or 
upgrading their military capabilities i see a future in which 
solutions to real problems are not impeded by problems historically 
outdated or artificially kept alive inherited from the times of 
the cold war and in which the policies of confrontation give way 
to a joint quest based on reason mutual benefit and readiness to 
compromise 
i see a future in which our two countries without claiming any 
special rights in the world are always mindful of their special 
responsibility in a community of equal nations it will be a world 
that is safer and more secure which is so badly needed by all 
people on earth by their children and grandchildren so that they 
can gain and preserve the basic human rights the right to life 
work freedom and the pursuit of happiness 
the path towards this future can be neither easy nor short we 
may be standing at the threshold of a uniquely interesting period 
in the history of our two nations this new meeting between the two 
of us mr president confirms that three years ago in geneva we 
took the right decision may the years to come bring a healthier 
international environment may life be triumphant 
to the very good health of the president to the very good 
health of mrs nancy reagan to cooperation between our two peoples

here is a transcript of president reagans toast 
at a dinner tuesday honoring soviet leader and mrs mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the general secretary and i had already held three meetings 
before this one began here in moscow each of those earlier 
encounters took place in the autumn the days were growing short 
the weather ever grayer and colder it makes for a bracing 
delightful change to have this meeting take place at the high point 
of spring a time of long lightfilled days 
i know that nancy found her springtime visit to leningrad 
earlier today both magnificent and moving the play of light upon 
the rivers and canals added the special splendor of the season to a 
city splendid in any season and everywhere nancy has told me 
there was a sense of history especially of leningrads immense 
courage and sacrifice during the second world war surely one of 
the most stirring epics in the whole human story 
here in moscow i have been reminded a number of times during 
this springtime visit of a passage in a book about your country by 
lawrence vanderpost especially struck by the citys churches 
vanderpost wrote that when he caught his first sight of the moscow 
skyline he saw the light of an unusually pure evening upon it 
that light was alchemical and it transformed moscow into a city of 
gold the tops of the spires and pinnacles drawing the rigid forms 
of the skyscrapers after them into arrows of gold aimed at the 
arched and timeless blue 
so we too have found a city of beauties a city especially 
whose pinnacles and spires reminded one at virtually every turn of 
mans ancient capacity for aspiration for reaching out toward the 
light 
its a particular pleasure to be able to welcome you to spaso 
house a house of considerable beauty in its own right the 
residence of our ambassadors to the soviet union during the 55 
years of diplomatic relations between our two nations spaso house 
has served as one of the principal settings for exchanges between 
us exchanges formal and informal alike 
thereve been some splendid moments within these walls 
prokofiev once conducted his marvelous the love for three 
oranges in this very room as wartime allies our 
representatives met often under this roof and ambassador and mrs 
matlock have continued the tradition of making spaso house a 
centerpiece of american culture a place to receive and talk with 
soviet officials and with people from all walks of life and from 
all parts of the soviet union 
but there have also been quiet times in this house 
unnaturally quiet times times when difficult relations between us 
meant that this house this huge magnificent house stood virtually 
empty of visitors im told that it was even possible to hear the 
moscow metro rumbling past ever so faintly deep in the earth below 
mr general secretary we know that on matters of great 
importance we will continue to differ profoundly and yet you and 
i have met four times now more often than any previous president 
and general secretary while our discussions have sometimes been 
pointed or contentious we possess an enlarged understanding of 
each other and of each others country 
on specific matters of policy we have made progress often 
historic progress and perhaps most important we have committed 
our nations to continuing to work together agreeing that silence 
must never again be permitted to fall between us we have agreed 
always to continue the interchanges between our nations because i 
believe we both hear the same voice the same overwhelming 
imperative what that voice says can be expressed in many ways but 
ive found it in vivid form in pasternaks poem the garden of 
gethsemane listen if you will to pasternaks account of that 
famous arrest 
there appeared no one knew from where a crowd of slaves and a 
rabble of knaves with lights and swords and leading them judas 
with a traitors kiss upon his lips peter repulsed the ruffians 
with his sword and cut off the ear of one of them but he heard 
you cannot decide a dispute with weapons put your sword in its 
place o man thats the voice put your sword in its place o man 
that is the imperative the command and so we will work together 
that we might forever keep our swords at our sides 
mr general secretary ladies and gentlemen spaso house has as 
ive said seen quiet times yet the animated conversation of this 
evening has already done much to make up for them 
and so i would like to raise a glass a glass to the continued 
interchange between our two nations and if i may to spaso house 
itself as a symbol of our relations may this lovely home never 
lack for visitors and shared meals and the sounds of spirited 
conversation and even the peal of hearty laughter thank you and 
god bless you to the general secretary to mrs gorbachev to the 
relationship that i believe must continue

jesse jackson says he does not foresee 
confrontation at the democratic national convention although he 
is considering challenges on a range of issues from platform planks 
to the status of super delegates 
in an interview tuesday jacksons convention manager said the 
candidate expects to have a significant impact on the platform 
itself not just some minority reports 
ron brown a washington lawyer and party activist said there 
was great concern among democrats over what jesses core 
constituency does in the general election 
black voters who provided the base of jacksons support in 
primaries and caucuses have voted overwhelmingly democratic in 
recent presidential elections but there now is concern within the 
party over whether those voters will turn out in large numbers if 
they believe jackson was shortchanged at the party convention in 
july 
after meeting sunday with black supporters massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis the likely party presidential nominee said i 
dont see any deep divisions philosophically ideologically on 
the issues i dont see any of that were going to have as united 
a democratic party as weve ever had 
campaigning in new jersey on monday jackson said i do not 
foresee confrontation we can effectively negotiate on mutually 
respectful terms 
but he also held out the possibility of floor fights over 
platform issues 
brown said jackson has become in effect the leader of the 
progressive part of the democratic party and he added that the 
enthusiasm his supporters would show for a dukakis candidacy would 
depend not only on what jackson does and how he is treated but he 
is perceived to have been treated 
brown also said jackson expects to play a strong role in the 
selection of the partys vice presidential nominee although he 
does not anticipate having veto power over that choice 
when asked whether he would accept second place on a dukakis 
ticket jackson said ive earned consideration 
while saying he did not believe jackson expected to have a veto 
power over the vice presidential candidate brown said he thought 
selection of sen sam nunn of georgia would not be a great 
signal to jackson supporters 
on the other hand brown said jackson has not indicated he 
expects to have a blackball of any candidate thats not a view 
ive heard expressed by him at all 
by limiting their count to only elected committed delegates the 
jackson campaign is arguing that dukakis will not have a delegate 
majority when the convention convenes in atlanta in july 
we count super delegates as uncommitted until they cast 
their vote on the ballot for president said brown super 
delegates are party and elected officials who became automatic 
uncommitted delegates outside the primary and caucus process 
the role of super delegates in choosing democratic presidential 
nominees will be one of the major issues raised by the jackson 
forces at the convention brown said 
we want to get the party to look at the general fairness or 
lack thereof of the process he said 
there ought to be some nexus between the popular vote and 
delegate strength added brown who said the purpose of super 
delegates is to flock to the frontrunner 
many of the 1988 super delegates have been flocking to dukakis 
even though jackson finished first or second in 36 primaries and 
caucuses this year not a single governor not a single senator 
not a single state party chair with the exception of the district 
of columbia has declared support for him brown said 
he said a jackson challenge to the role of super delegates would 
be more likely to apply to future conventions than the 1988 
gathering

guerrillas have wrested control of 
the valley through which soviet troops are withdrawing from 
afghaninstan but are sparing the retreating red army western 
diplomats and guerrilla officials say 
the sources who spoke tuesday gave credence to reports that a 
deal had been struck between a guerrilla commander and the 
kremlins army allowing soviet soldiers to leave afghanistan if 
they do so peacefully 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity also reported 
rumors of an imminent military coup in kabul and said the soviets 
have been giving the afghan army more sophisticated gear than 
before 
the gear includes sovietbuilt an12 transports jets comparable 
to the us turboprop c130 hercules large bombs infrared 
nightsighting devices for small arms and new radar equipment 
the anticommunist guerrillas are apparently also getting their 
share of topnotch weaponry 
official afghan television showed pictures of a new longrange 
rocket captured south of the city the rocket has a range of about 
12 miles and is believed to come from the united states 
washington while acknowledging it supplies the guerrillas 
rarely discloses details of arms shipments china and pakistan also 
arm the guerrillas 
meanwhile the insurgents were reported to have stepped up 
rocket attacks on kabul a possible indication they are getting 
stronger and drawing nearer to afghanistans center of power 
diplomats citing dispatches from the capital said 14 rockets 
slammed into the city mainly into its western and southern 
districts from may 2330 that was the heaviest missile attack on 
kabul in any week this year 
several western military analysts all speaking on condition of 
anonymity say guerrillas are now operating within six to 12 miles 
of kabul which is on a plain ringed by hills 
on tuesday the soviet withdrawal continued as red army troops 
evacuated towns south of kabul in their second major retreat from 
afghan outposts 
western and soviet diplomatic sources in kabul said soviet 
troops left ghazni 85 miles southwest of kabul and gardez 60 
miles south of kabul and were heading north toward the soviet 
border 
the evacuation of soviet troops from the area leaves the afghan 
army largely unassisted at least on the ground against attacks by 
antigovernment guerrillas in the provinces separating kabul from 
the pakistani border to the south and southeast 
on tuesday the guerrillas said from their headquarters in 
pakistan that they captured the strategic panjshir valley northeast 
of kabul last thursday diplomats in islamabad supported the claim 
the salang highway the major soviet withdrawal route runs 
through the valley but the insurgents say they are letting the red 
army pass without attacking 
recent reports said the guerrilla commander ahmed shah masood 
made a deal with the soviet military to leave its troops alone if 
they retreat peacefully 
masood has made such deals in the past but only at a price 
it is not known what concessions he may have extracted from the 
soviets 
the soviet withdrawal started may 15 with departure of troops 
from jalalabad 75 miles east of kabul 
under an april agreement signed in geneva the soviets are to 
complete their withdrawal by feb 15 1989 when the pullout began 
the soviets had an estimated 115000 soldiers in afghanistan about 
10000 have left so far according to reports from moscow 
the soviet military intervention in afghanistan began in 
december 1979 when troops were dispatched to prop up a sovietstyle 
government in the face of escalating guerrilla attacks 
sources in pakistan said speculation has been rife about a 
possible military coup when president najib leaves the country for 
10 days beginning saturday 
najib will be going to moscow and is also scheduled to speak at 
the united nations in new york 
speculation focuses on the khalq faction of the governing 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan the faction dominates the 
police and military najibs parcham wing also is split in two his 
supporters and those of former leader babrak karmal

city council couldnt agree whether members 
should face each other or the public but unanimously decided to 
study the matter 
the councilors on tuesday considered doing away with their 
decadesold semicircular seating arrangement which allows them to 
face each other rather than the public during meetings 
the current horseshoe certainly gives the appearance that 
council members are not listening said councilwoman joan milke 
flores 
councilman nate holden said he thought the change would be a 
misuse of taxpayers money and nothing more than a 
headlinegrabber 
councilman joel wachs wasnt sure a rearrangement was a good 
idea 
i think its worked well this way and i dont think i would 
like to see it changed wachs said 
the council voted 110 to order a study of whether changing the 
seating would violate regulations that govern the council chamber 
which is designated a historical landmark

president reagan says he plans to become an 
afterdinner and luncheon speaker afer he leaves office and that 
hell try to convince the american people to rescind the twoterm 
limits on presidents 
the 22nd amendment which prescribes that limit was ratified by 
the states in 1951 
it was an interference with the democratic rights of the 
people he told students at moscow state university on tuesday 
during a question and answer session the people should be 
allowed to vote for who they wanted to vote for as many times as 
they want to vote for them 
the reply which drew applause was in answer to a question of 
whether reagan would like a third term 
the president explained that a tradition of twoterm presidents 
had grown up since george washington refused a third tirm because 
he didnt want to foster a monarchy he said the amendment passed 
because of the atmosphere of the time 
i think it was kind of a revenge against franklin delano 
roosevelt who was elected four times reagan told the students 
he said when he leaves office hell travel around the mashed 
potato circuit and try to convince the people of our country that 
they should wipe out that amendment to the constitution the 
president said i cant do this while im in office because itll 
look as if im selfishly doing it for myself 
reagan said that on the speaking circuit hell tell about a 
few things that i didnt get done in government but urging the 
people to tell the congress they wanted them done

nancy reagans fondness for astrology became an 
abstract point of ridicule during the presidents meeting tuesday 
with intellectuals 
film director elem klimov made no direct reference to mrs 
reagans reliance on stargazers during his remarks to reagan but 
he noted that our astrologers had predicted this would be the 
century of russia 
he suggested with a smile that perhaps us and soviet 
astrologers should follow the new fashion for conferences and 
get together to exchange predictions 
the president had no visible response to klimovs remarks

baskinrobbins is coming to moscow 
barney brown vice president of the glendale califbased ice 
cream manufacturer said tuesday the company has signed a franchise 
agreement to sell its 31 flavors at the hote rossiya across from 
the kremlin 
the soviets will operate the concession with baskinrobbins 
providing the equipment and the ingredients brown said the store 
is scheduled to open july 1 about a month after hordes of 
americans who were here for the summit leave 
most soviet citizens who are frequently seen licking ice cream 
brought from street vendors probably will not be able to buy the 
product at first because it will be sold only for hard currency 
but brown said the company eventually hopes to work out an 
arrangement to sell the ice cream for rubbles

michael dukakis intends to campaign 
extensively in the weeks following the june 7 end of the primary 
season traveling to the south west and midwest as well as tending 
to the business of selecting a running mate and preparing for the 
democratic national convention 
the massachusetts governor also plans to make a speech on 
ussoviet relations a day or two after president reagan wraps up 
his moscow summit according to aides 
dukakis who expects to clinch the partys presidential 
nomination in the final round of primaries next week said in an 
interview that he anticipates making a quick campaign swing with 
his vice presidential running mate shortly after the convention 
dukakis declined to comment further on his selection of a vice 
presidential candidate although he acknowledged he has been 
advised by members of congress and others to pick someone who is 
regarded as a moderate or conservative to help reassure voters in 
the south and west 
im not looking for a clone of myself he said 
the massachusetts governor shrugged off jesse jacksons recent 
criticisms that he is too conservative saying i dont see any 
deep division that would mar the unity of the partys convention 
i dont see anything that cant be resolved he said 
in the meantime dukakis aides are converting as many delegates 
as they can campaign sources said as many as 25 oklahoma delegates 
pledged to dropout candidates albert gore and richard gephardt may 
enlist perhaps as early as today other such converts could come 
from kentucky and the campaign is trying to win over some of sen 
paul simons illinois delegates 
dukakis comments came as fresh public opinion polls show him 
running ahead of vice president george bush the lockedin 
republican nominee dukakis said he believes his success thus far 
is due in part to the steady consistent campaign he has run 
but also because there really is a strong desire for change 
the cycle has come around here he said 
dukakis and his aides have begun to direct their energies toward 
the fall campaign even as they go about wrapping up the delegates 
needed to clinch the nomination they have hired a new press 
secretary dayton duncan and expect to add an additional 
speechwriter to the staff shortly 
dukakis hopes to use the five weeks between the end of the 
primaries and the convention to get off to an early start against 
bush and keep the focus on the issues they want to raise and not 
on the ins and outs of the vice presidential selection process 
they will be a couple of highly thematic trips in which we 
will do our best to get you guys to do something other than 
political horserace stories said chris edley the campaigns 
issues director something to keep the campaign themes in the eye 
of the voters 
dukakis frequently says that he does not intend to concede any 
states to bush in the fall and leslie dach the campaigns 
communications director said one purpose of the preconvention 
traveling is to reinforce the impression that we can win 
electoral votes in every region of the country 
aides said the first extended trip is a southern swing the week 
following the end of the primary season in which dukakis will speak 
about drugs and crime issues dukakis tentatively plans stops in 
north carolina georgia florida and texas including a visit to 
the texas democratic convention on june 18 that will mark his 
second trip to texas since the states primary on march 8 he 
attended a huge barbecue with the states democratic hierarchy last 
week and apparently reflects a decision to campaign hard in the 
state where bush got his political start 
a trip is tentatively being planned for the end of june to key 
industrial states perhaps michigan and illinois in which dukakis 
will address economic issues 
the governor is expected to travel to new york new jersey and 
pennsylvania sometime around july 4 and a trip to california and 
perhaps one other west coast state is being planned 
in addition dukakis may travel to salt lake city to address the 
us conference of mayors the week after the primaries and also 
may make a quick trip to california on june 22 to speak to a 
convention of the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees union 
dukakis will spend the balance of his time working in his 
statehouse office he envisions three days a week in boston doing 
my job during the day and having the evenings free for briefings 
discussions on everything from the platform to general issues to a 
running mate 
the governor also has set aside time for a vacation with his 
wife kitty during june most likely on cape cod

the research ship atlantis ii seized under the 
federal zerotolerance drug policy was allowed to set sail for 
oregon but must keep authorities posted on its whereabouts 
the ship which took part in the exploration of the wreck of the 
titanic left its moorage here tuesday said mike fleming 
spokesman for the us customs service in los angeles 
atlantis ii remains under constructive seizure which means 
that ship officials must report the crafts position to customs 
officials at least once a week said capt gary chiljean 
chiljean who was not the captain when the seizure took place 
said monday the release of the 210foot vessel was based in part on 
an agreement that this would never happen again 
the ship worth an estimated 30 million is now bound for 
exploration off the oregon coast the stop in san diego was a 
planned one for overhaul of equipment chiljean said and the ship 
remains on schedule 
customs officials seized atlantis ii on may 18 after finding a 
tiny bit of marijuana and some residue in a pipe owned by a crew 
member 
the ship was returning with a scripps institution of 
oceanography vessel from an exploration off the coast of south 
america 
the seizure was one of the most publicized of the zerotolerance 
program a federal crackdown in which officials are confiscating 
boats or vehicles for discovery of any amount of drugs 
protest of the policy including a congressional attack on it 
last week led to a coast guard decision to use more discretion in 
deciding whether to seize vessels ships outside the 12mile 
territorial limit will be taken only if intent to smuggle is 
determined

a study has found that the us death 
toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously 
predicted the head of the national hurricane center said tuesday 
to mark the opening of the 1988 atlantic storm season 
recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the 
atlantic and gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier 
thought must be evacuated under certain conditions said center 
director bob sheets 
fortythree million people live in about 175 coastal counties 
from maine to texas and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier 
islands is virtually impossible sheets said 
there are not enough shelters to handle the added load and there 
are serious concerns how new glasswindowed highrises would fare 
if lashed by hurricaneforce winds during evacuations he said 
during a hurricane that struck houston glass was flying 
everywhere said sheets 
he refused to make predictions about the 1988 hurricane season 
saying no one has convinced forecasters they can reliably predict 
the number and severity of storms 
the first tropical depression of the year has formed and 
remained stationary tuesday night just south of the western tip of 
cuba or about 200 miles southwest of havana the system contained 
winds of up to 30 mph and was not expected to strengthen 
one of the two satellites used to keep track of hurricanes could 
fail this year forecasters said 
its quite possible this year that we could lose goeswest at 
anytime hurricane specialist bob case said of the geostationary 
earthorbiting environmental satellite which records atmospheric 
conditions over the pacific ocean and part of the western 
hemisphere 
if that satellite does stop working goeseast would have to be 
directed to move from its equatorial orbit over brazil to a spot 
south of the texas gulf coast where it would provide a view of the 
western hemisphere with limited vision in the hurricanespawning 
eastern atlantic he said 
a previous goeseast expired in 1984 and temporarily deprived 
meteorologists of atlantic atmospheric photographs 
a typical atlantic hurricane season from june 1 to nov 30 has 
10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained wind 
exceeding 39 mph six of which become hurricanes with drenching 
rain and wind over 74 mph case said 
in 1987 there were only three hurricanes and four tropical 
storms in the atlantic 
hurricane emily slammed into the dominican republic on sept 22 
causing three deaths with wind gusts up to 110 mph it recovered 
enough punch to belt bermuda with 116 mph wind three days later 
emily was the fastest moving hurricane of any known in this 
century case said 
hurricane arlene meandered through the atlantic in midaugust 
with top wind of 75 mph hurricane floyd hit key west with 75 mph 
wind but fizzled out over the everglades and miami in midoctober 
here are the names to be given to atlantic tropical storms that 
could grow into hurricanes this season

the prosecution in the irancontra case 
insists a joint trial can be held despite the judges reservation 
that it could damage the defendants rights to confront each other 
at trial 
separate trials for oliver l north and three codefendants 
would be a massive waste of time and effort independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh said tuesday in a legal brief 
last week us district judge gerhard a gesell said a single 
trial on the crucial conspiracy charge may be a practical 
impossibility but he did not rule on the issue 
the prosecutor said that the defense strategy would require five 
separate trials on various counts for north a former national 
security council staffer and one each for john m poindexter 
president reagans former national security adviser businessman 
richard v secord and his former partner albert hakim 
walsh said the defendants participated in a common scheme to 
create protect and preserve an illegal financial and logistical 
network to support the nicaraguan contras and other 
activities designed by north and poindexter 
norths lawyers contended that multiple trials were needed for 
their client on counts that charged him but not other defendants 
walsh said the law did not require such a separation 
gesell said last week a single trial would have problems because 
codefendants might be unable to exercise their rights to fully 
confront each other in crossexamination 
in this case such crossexamination might involve questions 
that refer to testimony given to the congressional irancontra 
investigating committees under a grant of limited immunity from 
prosecution the immunized testimony given by all defendants 
except secord cannot be used by the prosecution and theres a 
chance that gesell may bar the defense from using it also 
that would create a conflict between the fifth amendment 
privilege of a testifying defendant not to have his immunized 
testimony used against him and the right of a defendant under the 
sixth amendment to confront his codefendants in a trial 
in the irancontra case secord has asked for the right to 
question north about his immunized testimony on grounds that 
norths statements to congress would prove secords innocence 
walsh replied there would be no need for a reference to the 
congressional testimony because the defendants testifying under 
oath in both cases would provide the same information 
moreover even if a defendant initially were to make 
statements at trial inconsistent with his prior testimony his 
memory could be refreshed without the need for the introduction of 
that testimony walsh said 
material used to refresh a witness recollection need not be 
admissible itself he said 
if a conflict developed between the congressional and trial 
testimony the court has the ability to decide whether to 
permit a line of questioning drawing on immunized testimony 
walsh said 
the court also has the option of severing certain charges from 
the case to keep immunized testimony out walsh said 
gesell said at a hearing may 26 as i see it it is a 
practical impossibility to try the conspiracy counts in the 
context of rules on immunity if you try them the defendants 
together you violate the immunities 
but the judge added that trying the defendants separately 
makes a conspiracy trial a farce none gets the benefit of the 
others testimony 
he commented at one point four individual trials is 
ridiculous

a federal appeals court ruling allows members 
of congress to keep the 12100 pay raise they received last year 
and continue using the law that gave them the increase 
in a 30 ruling tuesday the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia agreed with a lower court ruling last year 
that the federal salary act is constitutional 
members of congress earn 89500 although leaders in each house 
earn slightly more 
sen gordon humphrey rnh and five house republicans 
challenged the acts multistep procedure establishment of a pay 
study commission the commissions recommendation to the president 
a presidential decision setting the increase and the chance for 
lawmakers to change the presidential ruling 
the lawmakers said the constitutions intent was that congress 
set its pay scale by passing a law a politically risky system used 
from the founding of the nation through enactment of the current 
law in 1967 
the challenge also contended the act violated the constitutional 
separation of powers among the branches by delegating 
decisionmaking authority to the president in setting the pay 
the salary act determines pay increases not only for congress 
but also for judges and highranking executive branch officials 
since the court threw out the challenge it di not address 
whether a decision declaring the law unconstitutional would have 
wiped out salary increases for judges and administration officials 
the appellate court said the 1967 law is constitutional because 
it gives congress the ultimate role of disapproving salary 
recommendations by the president 
the pay commission is established every four years its members 
appointed by all three branches after the commission reports to 
the president and the chief executive submits his figures to 
congress lawmakers have 30 days to disapprove the presidential 
decision otherwise the presidents figures take effect 
referring to congress ability to change the presidents 
recommendations the court said whatever the practical 
difficulties and political realities senator humphrey and his 
coplaintiffs have readily at hand an inhouse remedy 
the availability of an internally available remedy to members of 
congress means that it would be an abuse of discretion for the 
judiciary to entertain the action 
in 1987 the commission recommended giving congress a raise to 
135000 but president reagan citing the need to reduce the 
deficit recommended the 12100 figure 
the opinion was written by us circuit judge kenneth h starr 
joining him were circuit judges patricia wald and harry edwards 
challenging the law along with humphrey were robert dornan 
rcalif bob smith rnh beau boulter rtexas jack davis

a federal judge has halted tests scheduled to 
begin today of a highpowered electrical generator designed to 
simulate one of the effects of a nuclear explosion 
us district judge john garrett penn after hearing arguments 
from attorneys representing the navy and the foundation on economic 
trends issued a temporary restraining order on tuesday against the 
tests 
navy officials had planned to begin the test wednesday with 
empress ii barge in international waters about 15 miles off the 
virginianorth carolina coast

antenna system capable of sending pulses of electrical power 
into the atmosphere at power levels up to 7 million volts to test a

two former latin american presidents 
say they met with panamas military leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega and offered to mediate this nations political crisis 
daniel oduber of costa rica and carlos andres perez of venezuela 
said they made the offer as part of a latin american initiative 
during a twohour meeting tuesday with noriega shortly after 
arriving in the country 
staterun channel 2 television later broadcast their statements 
there was no immediate response from noriega on the initiative 
and his press office would not say whether oduber and andres perez 
were still in the country 
we came to offer our good offices to try to find a solution to 
the problem we are doing this as latin americans because we are 
worried andres perez said 
he said he and oduber told noriega they planned to divide their 
mission into two parties to achieve a dialogue between the 
government and the opposition and to resolve the confrontation 
between the united states and the noriegacontrolled government 
both the opposition and the united states want noriega to 
relinquish power the general who heads the countrys 
15000strong defense forces was indicted in florida on federal 
drug trafficking charges in february 
panamas acting president manuel palma solis was also present 
at tuesdays meeting at a louge in tocumen air force base near the 
capital which occurred after andres perez and oduber arrived in a 
private plane 
the two were picked for the mission by president oscar arias of 
costa rica who announced the initiative on monday 
an earlier effort to have panamas roman catholic archbishop 
marcos g mcgrath mediate the crisis failed because of what arias 
called interference by the united states 
most latin american leaders have been cool to noriega who has 
been accused of electoral fraud graft and political assassination 
but also resent overt intervention by the united states to force 
the generals ouster 
panama has been hurt by us economic sanctions imposed after 
the drug indictments to try and force noriega to leave panama 
but noriega has not budged and negotiations with a us state 
department envoy about the generals stepping down broke down last 
week

republicans believe peter dawkins a heisman 
trophy winner rhodes scholar and war hero is the starquality 
candidate who can unseat democratic us sen frank lautenberg 
lautenberg a ragstoriches business pioneer seeking a second 
sixyear term warns that he wont give up his seat without a big 
fight 
with that battle well under way lautenberg 64 and dawkins 
50 say they are confident of victory they are prepared to spend 
7 million or more apiece to get it 
the two are crisscrossing the state in anticipation of tuesdays 
primary election 
dawkins faces no gop challenger lautenberg faces nominal 
opposition from two littleknown democrats elnardo j webster a 
40yearold state corrections department recreation official who 
contends the senator is out of touch with constituents and harold 
j young who is running as a conservativeradical 
nationally the republicans have targeted lautenberg as one of 
the senates most vulnerable incumbents president reagan spoke at 
a dawkins fundraiser in march that took in 300000 new jerseys 
popular gop governor thomas h kean is chairing dawkins campaign 
lautenbergs bid is led by the equally popular sen bill 
bradley the states democratic senior senator lautenberg has 
raised nearly 4 million and has tried to get the best campaign 
help money can buy 
in a way bradley is part of lautenbergs problem since taking 
office in 1982 lautenberg has worked to emerge from the shadow of 
his nationally known colleague a former national basketball 
association star and like dawkins a rhodes scholar 
part of dawkins strategy has been to subtly stress his 
similarities to bradley 
the message has been clear by electing dawkins new jersey 
the brunt of garbagedump and gangster jokes could be the only 
state to boast two rhodes scholars as senators 
dawkins has begun to sell himself as a natural senator he was 
captain of his west point football team decorated as a paratrooper 
in vietnam and named the youngest general in army history along 
the way he studied at oxford and earned a phd from princeton 
dawkins left the army in 1983 to join the shearsonlehman 
brokerage house in new york he resigned last year to become a 
fulltime candidate and moved from new york city to the exclusive 
new jersey suburb of rumson 
dawkins has a largerthanthan life presence augmented by 
piercing eyes a steve canyon jaw and a broadcasters voice 
when he walks in a room heads turn people know hes there 
said campaign manager doug goodyear 
lautenbergs camp says its candidate also has a remarkable 
background and two things dawkins doesnt have a proven 
legislative record and a longterm connection with new jersey 
the lautenberg story is very compelling asserted paul 
begala spokesman for the senators campaign 
as he did in his 1982 upset of republican sen millicent 
fenwick lautenberg affable whitehaired and with a noticable 
gap in his front teeth is stressing his roots as the son of poor 
immigrants raised in the textile center of paterson 
he attended columbia university on the gi bill and helped to 
found the worldwide automatic data processing corp en route he 
amassed a personal fortune topping 25 million and became an 
international philanthropist 
lautenberg is running on his record greatly enhanced when 
democrats took control of the senate last year then an obscure 
freshman lautenberg was elevated to chair subcommittees on 
transportation and the environment two meatandpotatoes issues in 
new jersey politics 
for dawkins the goal is to convince voters that his remarkable 
resume qualifies him to be a better senator 
according to goodyear dawkins will assert that lautenberg has 
a record of no achievement no accomplishment lackluster 
performance 
begala countered frank lautenbergs motto is new jersey 
first the other guys is me first

former sen eugene j mccarthy will run a 
third time for the presidency this year to help establish an 
alternative voice in american politics according to the party 
backing his bid 
the consumer party said tuesday the former minnesota congressman 
and senator planned a 1 pm edt announcement today outside 
independence hall 
we think theres a need for a permanent third force in 
american politics one that can speak for consumer interests 
rather than corporate interests party spokesman darcy richardson 
said 
neither the party nor mccarthy expect the 72yearold elder 
statesman of antiestablishment politics to win the oval office 
this year richardson said 
it would be nice to pull off a miracle but were building a 
party that we hope can be an effective third party he said 
sharon varallo a spokeswoman for mccarthy said tuesday she 
could not confirm or deny that mccarthy would become a candidate 
for the 21yearold philadelphiabased party there was no answer

japans average household income has topped 40000 
a year but nearly half of all households report difficulties in 
making ends meet according to a survey released today 
the nationwide survey conducted by the health and welfare 
ministry showed the average income of japanese households was 
40400 in 1986 
the figure was 25 percent higher than the previous year but 
was the lowest increase since the first such survey was conducted 
in 1962 
the survey conducted last summer says there are 3806 million 
households in japan with an average 319 persons per household 
of the total households 347 million were composed of people 65 
years or older up 45 percent from the year before 
the survey saysd 431 percent of the households of people 65 or 
older are totally dependent on annuities or pensions 
in the survey 45000 households chosen at random were asked 
about the ages of their family members and 8000 about income 
asked about living standards 524 percent said they were living 
an average life up from 497 percent the previous year 
forty percent unchanged from last years survey reported they 
found it hard to make ends meet those who said they were living a 
comfortable life accounted for 71 percent down from 94 
percent

now that the finer points of kidney 
transplantation have been mastered doctors are looking for ways to 
make young recipients grow up to be big as well as strong 
virtually impossible under conventional therapy 
you can give them a good kidney but if we dont give them a 
good life it isnt worth it said dr amir tejani director of 
renal services at the state university of new york health science 
center in new york city 
children with kidney failure like those with other major 
illnesses tend to be shorter than normal sometimes barely topping 
4 feet as adults even with successful transplants they dont come 
close to reaching normal size because of a steroid commonly given 
them along with antirejection drugs 
they want to look normal they want to feel normal tejani 
said tuesday at the annual conference of the american society of 
transplant physicians 
you cant tell them the world is made up of small people when 
americans are getting taller added dr ira greifer medical 
director of the national kidney foundation 
to help the youngsters grow tejani is trying to withhold the 
steroid prednisone from their posttransplant treatment the drug 
usually is combined with the potent antirejection drug 
cyclosporine and inhibits the growth plate in the bone from 
functioning normally it also causes acne and puffiness most 
noticeably in the face 
some children especially girls cheat on their medication in a 
desperate attempt to improve their looks tejani said 
the main bugaboo of children is that they look ugly and dont 
grow he perhaps the best known case is that of gary coleman 
star of the former television series diffrent strokes the 
19yearold actor who has undergone two kidney transplants is 
less than 5 feet tall 
its the ones who are 5 feet that want to be 5 feet 2 
greifer said they would give anything for another 2 inches 
about 1200 youngsters age 16 and under experience kidney 
failure every year in the united states according to greifer six 
hundred to 800 end up receiving new kidneys fewer than 9 percent 
of the total number of kidney transplants performed annually 
overall transplanted kidneys were still functioning at a rate 
of up 80 to 85 percent a year after the operation according to dr 
john mcdonald president of the american society of transplant 
surgeons 
tejani said that hes tried since 1983 to remove prednisone from 
the treatment of 30 children whose transplanted kidneys have 
functioned well 
twentythree of the youngsters were able to be treated solely 
with cyclosporine for a time tejani said but nine of these had to 
return to prednisone after experiencing episodes of organ rejection 
the remaining 14 patients have been off prednisone for up to 4 
years without any episodes of organ rejection or side effects 
according to tejani more importantly all of them have grown 
including one 17yearold boy who has reached 5 feet 8 
even for a third of them to grow normally then by all means 
we should be doing this for our kids or at least trying said dr 
lawrence g hunsicker president of the transplant society 
children who undergo liver and heart transplants also experience 
severe growth problems but its too risky to toy with their 
antirejection therapy according to doctors 
with kidneys if you goof you lose the kidney and patients 
can return to dialysis tejani said with livers and hearts 
theres no other option 
in patients unable to be weaned off prednisone tejani has 
administered growth hormone enabling them to catch up on some lost 
growth hes also tried replacing prednisone with immuran an 
antimetabolic drug but its too early to know the results 
doctors at the university of california los angeles are trying 
other methods to enhance kidney patients growth 
for about the past year dr vera h koch a clinical fellow at 
ucla and other researchers have administered growth hormone to 
young patients on dialysis and those who have undergone kidney 
transplants up to 100 percent increases in growth have been noted 
the data seem good there seems to be hope koch said but 
we need to have longer trials

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and president 
reagan commenced their final fullblown summit session wednesday 
morning as topranking officials awaited a ceremonial exchange of 
the final instruments of ratification for the mediumrange missile 
treaty 
gorbachev won a fresh endorsement tuesday from reagan for his 
soviet reform program but the leaders only inched forward during 
ticklish arms negotiations and gorbachev suggested it may be time 
to bang our fists on the table to end the impasse 
a us official said the leaders were likely to sign a joint 
statement either on wednesday or just before reagans departure 
thursday spelling out progress on two of the main obstacles to a 
strategic missile reduction treaty in an upbeat overview of the 
ussoviet relationship 
both leaders touched on the arms issue in toasts at a dinner 
reagan hosted for gorbachev at the home of the us ambassador 
tuesday night 
the president said the superpowers should work together that 
we might forever keep our swords at our sides 
gorbachev responded by acknowledging the superpowers rivalry 
above all in the military sphere 
but he said i see a future in which the soviet union and the 
united states base their relations on disarmament a balance of 
interest and comprehensive cooperation rather than on deterring 
each other or upgrading their military capabilities 
the movement on the strategic arms front came on a us proposal 
to verify limits on mobile missiles and on counting nucleartipped 
cruise missiles aboard warplanes said the official who spoke on 
condition he not be further identified 
there was no progress on the thorniest obstacle of all and 
reagan said his star wars program was not even discussed we 
would like the american delegation to originate fresh ideas 
soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov said later 
nor did reagan and gorbachev attempt to tackle any of the thorny 
regional issues that bear on their relationship around the globe 
they sidetracked policy differences in afghanistan southern africa 
and the middle east to focus on gorbachevs perestroika campaign to 
restructure the soviet economy 
we still have a day and a half to go so i will reserve final 
judgment said a senior us official speaking on condition of 
anonymity at a midnight briefing after reagan hosted gorbachev at 
dinner 
following the days only summit session gorbachev steered 
reagan through red square a stroll which delighted and surprised 
visitors especially when gorbachev picked up and cuddled a 
toddler reagan said he found red square site of this communist 
states annual military reviews wonderful 
during an encounter with reporters reagan was asked if he still 
believed the soviet union was an evil empire as he described 
it in march 1983 
standing next to his host reagan said i was talking about 
another time another era the president said 
several reporters permitted access to reagan for a few minutes 
described him as looking tired and possibly limping spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said there is no problem with the presidents 
health but that he did have a difficult nights sleep 
we are all a little tired and thats reflected in all our 
delegation he said but mrs reagan during her trip to 
leningrad was asked about the president and said he sleeps 
fine 
the 77yearold president arrived here sunday after a fourday 
rest stop in helsinki finland en route from washington 
on their third day of talks reagan and gorbachev met in the 
soviet leaders kremlin office sitting beneath a portrait of karl 
marx and holding what presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
called a largely philosophiocal discussion on perestroika 
gorbachevs economic reform effort that ran more than an hour 
in giving his blessing to gorbachevs economic reform efforts 
reagan said taht in his talks with the soviet leader i have 
spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change to put 
guarantees on reform 
he told moscow state university students they are living in 
one of the most exciting hopeful times in soviet history it is a 
time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart 
beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulated 
spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free 
we do not know what will be the conclusion of this journey 
reagan said but we are hopeful that the promise of reform will 
be fulfilled 
the leaders also watched and joined in the applause as secretary 
of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze signed several secondary agreements including a pair 
of arms accords 
under one pact the superpowers will notify each other at least 
24 hours in advance of the time place and intended target of 
intercontinentalrange missiles tests the other sets up joint 
experiments this summer in nevada and semipalatinsk of devices to 
measure underground nuclear test explosions 
reagan continuing his campaign to promote freedom and human 
rights in the soviet union met over lunch at the house of writers 
with artists filmmakers and writers 
he told them ive found that mr gorbachev has the ability to 
grasp and hold a vision and i respect him for that 
but the fellowship did not lead to any breakthrough in the 
effort to agree on terms for a 30 to 50 percent reduction in 
longrange bombers landbased missiles and nuclear submarines 
squabbling over star wars and sorting out pesky verification 
problems stand in the way 
im sure that if the president makes good use of his time that 
we have remaining im sure that we will be able to prepare the 
treaty gorbachev said both sides expressed a commitment to 
seeking agreement before reagan leaves office 
at the opening of their first session on sunday gorbachev said 
its quite possible there would be another summit if the treaty 
were ready before january 20 
gorbachev recalled that in 1985 at their first summit in 
geneva the two leaders had reached an impasse at one point he 
said the president told him well lets stamp our fists on the 
table and i said all right 
maybe now it is again a time to bang our fists on the table 
once again the soviet leader said 
asked by a reporter if he agreed reagan said ill do 
anything that works 
during a questionandanswer session with students at moscow 
state university reagan said we are hopeful that it can be 
finished before i leave office but i assure you if it isnt i 
will have impressed upon my successor that we must carry on until 
it is signed 
in the speech reagan stressed the value of american freedoms 
including the free market economy and said its so hard for 
government planners no matter how sophisticated to ever 
substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to 
make their dreams come true the fact is bureaucracies are a 
problem around the world 
then in response to a question reagan said gorbachev has 
been most helpful he has been most agreeable in dealing with 
the cases raised by the united states 
i am not blaming you i blame bureaucracy he said in regard 
to the complaints of restrictions on emigration and other freedoms 
asked about the remarks fitzwater said i think the president 
is fully aware of the constraints on emigration here and the 
source of that is within the soviet system

researchers have discovered that the aids virus 
apparently may become dormant in the human body and undetectable by 
the standard test but say the finding does not mean the nations 
blood supply is endangered 
the blood supply is exceptionally safe and protected to a 
great extent by existing screning tests and the selfdeferral of 
individuals at high risk said b frank polk a professor of 
epidemiology at the johns hopkins school of public health and 
coauthor of the study published today in junes annals of internal 
medicine 
tests to pinpoint the disease and protect blood supplies are 
based on detection of hiv1 antibodies produced naturally by the 
body to fight the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus 
the instances of aids victims who stop producing detectable 
antibodies to the disease appear to be rare and so far have only 
been observed in those who have shown small amounts of the virus in 
their bodies said homayoon farzadegan and alfred j saah also 
professors of epidemiology at hopkins and authors of the study 
farzadegan and saah said at a news conference tuesday that four 
homosexual men infected with aids stopped producing detectable 
antibodies though a newer test showed they still are infected with 
the virus farzadegan said the phenomenon may mean that the virus 
has the potential of going into a latent phase during which it 
does not reproduce 
the four were among 1000 homosexual men infected with the virus 
who participated in the continuing study the four showed the loss 
of antibodies up to 3 years ago though one has since shown signs 
of the aids infection and has developed antibodies again 
usually when an infected person loses hiv1 antibodies he or 
she is in the end stages of aids and has a deteriorated immune 
system said polk the four had no clinical symptoms of 
illness such as swollen lymph glands or abnormal counts of the 
white blood cells targeted by the virus 
the researchers reported their findings last june but could not 
determine whether the men had been properly diagnosed as having 
aids or whether mistakes had been made in laboratory tests 
during the followup study the researchers used a new method to 
test for the virus instead of the antibody test and determined that 
the men showed evidence of infection but not hiv1 antibodies 
the new test called pcr or polymerase chain reaction assay 
magnifies the presence of the virus genetic material inside cells 
up to 1 million times 
we dont know if something in the virus itself is defective 
and causing it not to reproduce or whether it is something within 
the host saah said adding that researchers have not determined 
whether the disease is transmittable during this phase 
farzadegan said the new test was not commonly used to screen 
blood donors because of the complexity of conducting it and 
interpreting its results 
in an editorial accompanying the article dr thomas f zuck of 
the university of cincinnati medical center said that even though 
the four would not have been picked out by the aids test used by 
blood centers the finding does not mean that the blood supply is 
threatened 
he wrote that there was no evidence that unexpectedly large 
numbers of aids virus infections had been spread by transfusions 
since 1985 when screening began and that efforts to discourage 
blood donations from those at high risk for aids were largely 
successful 
aids attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancers it is most often transmitted 
by exposure to the body fluids of a person who carries the disease 
including sexual contact blood transfusions or the sharing of 
contaminated hypodermic needles 
all of the men who participated in the initial report are 
participants in the multicenter aids cohort study which follows 
nearly 5000 homosexual and bisexual men in baltimore los angeles 
chicago and pittsburgh to document the natural progression of aids

a genetically engineered protein that kills 
transplantattacking cells in mice should be tested soon on humans 
and researchers hope it will reduce or eliminate the need for 
antirejection drugs 
its the promise for the future thats very exciting said 
dr jack murphy chief of biomolecular medicine at boston 
university medical center 
researchers expect the protein to be introduced for some 
leukemia patients this fall and for transplant patients in about a 
year the leukemia patients suffer from a form of the disease 
marked by an excess of the transplantattacking blood cells 
theres no question that if everything works out the way wed 
like it to it will be a whole new way of treating transplant 
patients and victims of certain immune diseases said dr robert 
kirkman a transplant surgeon at brigham and womens hospital in 
boston 
kirkman said tuesday at the annual meeting of the american 
society of transplant physicians that the new fusion protein has 
succeeded in prolonging the lives of mice after heart 
transplantation nine of the 10 mice in the experiment appeared to 
retain their new hearts permanently without need for continual 
therapy 
dr lawrence g hunsicker the societys president hailed the 
fusion protein as terribly important 
the hope is that you could get someone who needs a kidney 
transplant and put in whatever one you have available hunsicker 
said maybe tissue matching at that point wouldnt make a 
difference 
researchers have been working for nearly a decade on the new 
protein a fusion of a portion of the diphtheria toxin one of the 
deadliest known toxins and the natural immune system protein 
interleukin2 
when the bodys immune system is confronted with unfamiliar 
material such as bacteria or a transplanted organ it fights back 
with a group of cells called tcells 
the foreign substances activate a small number of tcells which 
produce interleukin2 receptors points on the cell surface to 
which only interleukin2 molecules will stick 
activation of these receptors leads to an immunological cascade 
that stimulates more harmful cells that then attack the 
transplanted organ leading to rejection of the foreign tissue 
to prevent this from happening murphy and dr terry strom 
director of clinical immunology at bostons beth israel hospital 
isolated the part of the diphtheria toxin that binds it to other 
cells and replaced it with the binding portion of the interleukin2 
molecule 
the result was a hybrid protein that seeks out and attaches to 
only those tcells harmful to transplanted organs and kills the 
tcells with the toxin 
this therapy only zaps the cells that are active against the 
transplanted organ at that time and doesnt depress the 
diseasefighting immune system across the board strom said 
cyclosporine a popular antirejection drug suppresses the 
bodys entire immune system and therefore enhances the risk of 
infection side effects include kidney failure excessive hair 
growth and tremors cyclosporine also costs transplant patients 
5000 a year or more 
and doctors at the university of iowa are reporting an increase 
in malignant tumors in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine 
along with steroids and another drug azathioprine the socalled 
triple drug therapy is suspected of being responsible for the 
cancer although there is no hard evidence so far 
it is likely the fusion protein would be used with cyclosporine 
in humans pending food and drug administration approval strom 
said 
so maybe a little bit of cyclosporine will go a long way with 
this toxin he said 
researchers said the fusion protein eventually may be used to 
treat autoimmune diseases in which the body produces a disordered 
immunological response against itself such diseases include forms 
of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis 
also at tuesdays meeting robert h rubin chief of infectious 
disease for transplantation at massachusetts general hospital 
warned doctors they may be doing more harm than good by putting new 
kidneys into dialysis patients infected with aids 
about 250 people currently are on dialysis who test positive for 
the aids virus but exhibit no symptoms of the disease rubin said 
nobody wants to turn their backs on these people he said 
but preliminary data suggest these folks do not do as well as 
other folks following transplantation

gun owners have filed petitions to block 
marylands pioneering ban on sales of cheap handguns and to force a 
public vote on the gun control law in november 
fred griisser chairman of the maryland committee against the 
gun ban submitted petitions tuesday to the secretary of state that 
he said contained signatures of more than 22000 voters 
the committee will need 33044 valid signatures by the end of 
june to force the law to referendum 
griisser said his group believes the law has the potential to 
ban all handguns 
the law allows the state to ban guns that are cheaply made of 
poor quality materials and are so inaccurate that they cant be 
used for sporting purposes or defense it also bans those that 
cant be detected by metal detectors

the beach seasons start brought an 
onslaught of sunbathers to one of maines few sandy beaches but 
none of the turmoil expected from a ruling that limited access to 
the seashore in accordance with 17th century puritan law 
but an attorney for homeowners along the cherished beach in 
southern maine warned tuesday that vacationers who relax on the 
wrong patch of sand could wind up in court 
at issue is milelong moody beach which a superior court judge 
ruled in september is in effect private the judge agreed with 30 
homeowners that the beach between the high and low tide marks is 
limited to fishing bird hunting and boating based on a 1648 
ordinance 
the homeowners argued that sunbathers occupy the beach in front 
of their homes property which they say is deeded to them and 
make noise and leave behind trash 
justice william s brodricks decision has been appealed to the 
state supreme court which is expected to rule in september the 
high courts decision also could affect some of the remaining 35 
miles of sandy beaches along maines 3500 miles of coastline 
meantime wells police chief william zackular says he will make 
no trespassing arrests at the beach this summer he said he was 
instructed by the offices of the york county district attorney and 
state attorney general to withhold enforcing the court decision 
until the supreme court rules 
but sidney st f thaxter an attorney for the homeowners 
believes the town must enforce the decision pending the outcome of 
the appeal 
its always been a private beach thaxter said the judge 
says its a private beach and the public isnt allowed to be 
there 
thaxter said the chiefs actions violate the order and he 
suggested that the town is encouraging the use of the property 
he added that the police should at least come up with a solution 
more equitable to the homeowners if the ruling is not going to be 
enforced 
if that fails thaxter said he would consider suing beachgoers 
for civil trespass 
the homeowners want to live in peace with the town and the 
people that live there but theyre tired of being abused he 
said 
zackular countered that he has increased patrols at the beach 
and is considering adding lifeguards to keep an eye on sunbathers 
near as i can tell the vast majority of the moody beach people 
are happy with it the chief said theyre happy with the 
increased enforcement there are just a few people who havent 
been pleased 
the police department received no complaints of trespassing 
during the memorial day weekend zackular said 
but some homeowners found weekend beachgoers annoying 
i feel so sorry for my grandchildren because during the summer 
theres absolutely no place to play said dorothy jones 68 a 
plaintiff in the lawsuit and it isnt even safe to run down 
there and play with all those strangers in this day and age

policy of increased openness is merely a means of improving that

a group of south african clergymen 
has pledged to organize antigovernment protests and called for 
increased nonviolent resistance to apartheid in apparent violation 
of government restrictions 
the decision was made at an emergency conference the largest 
and most broadly based of its type that ended tuesday with a 
church service at the regina mundi cathedral in soweto 
johannesburgs largest black township 
we are determined we are going to obey god whatever the 
cost anglican archbishop desmond tutu told a mostlyblack crowd 
of 1200 during the service 
tutu then ripped symbolic gags from the mouths of black and 
white youths on the podium took up a wooden cross and carried it 
back and forth down the cathedrals center aisle 
the audience sang an african hymn then held hands and swayed 
together singing the american civil rights song we shall 
overcome security force vehicles including a teargas truck 
lined the street outside 
more than 200 religious leaders representing more than 30 church 
groups assembled monday in johannesburg to consider new tactics to 
oppose the white minority governments racial policies 
they ended the twoday convocation with a decision to mobilize 
support for a threeday national protest planned next week by black 
trade unions 
they also said that on june 12 they would start a campaign for 
the release of political prisoners 
the campaign is to end july 18th the 70th birthday of jailed 
african national congress leader nelson mandela 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the south african 
council of churches said the clergymens plans might be regarded 
by some as civil disobedience 
we are not trying to undermine authority or advocate 
anarchy he said we are distinguishing between two different 
kinds of authority that between god and man 
the government has recently banned numerous groups such as 
unions and newspapers from conducting political activity 
antiapartheid factions in the church which was not initially 
included in the ban have begun to take up the struggle where these 
groups left off 
the rev allan boesak mixedrace leader of the world alliance 
of reformed churches said he had hoped the statement adopted by 
the convocation would have been stronger calling for more protests 
and direct confrontation with the government 
it will take time but we are moving away from a theology of 
protest to a life of protest and resistance boesak said 
on the church podium were about 45 of the clergymen who attended 
the convocation including tutu and boesak 
what this convocation wants to say is that the church of jesus 
christ has no choice but to stand up for the poor and weak and 
oppressed in this country said boesak we say to the south 
african government we must be more obedient to god than to 
you 
during the convocation workshops were held to discuss a range 
of antiapartheid tactics including noncooperation and 
noncollaboration with the government 
the agenda suggested that targets of civil disobedience could 
include tax payments military service and racially oriented laws 
such as those mandating segregated residential areas 
the convocation was sponsored by the south african council of 
churches which includes major protestant denominations active in 
the fight for black rights also participating were the roman 
catholic church and a number of independent african churches 
organizers said political conditions in the country have 
worsened since leading clergymen decided in early february to 
organize the convocation 
they cited the effective bannings of 17 antiapartheid 
organizations the closure of two opposition newspapers and pending 
legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition political 
groups

a weekend tremor labeled as an earthquake 
was a stripmine blast a geologist says 
michael hansen of the ohio department of natural resources 
division of geological survey said the blast at 1218 pm saturday 
was labeled an earthquake by the national earthquake information 
center and state officials based on information on seismographs 
it was picked up on a number of seismographs as far west 
as st louis hansen said tuesday 
the blast registered 35 on the richter scale of ground movement 
and was centered near the southeastern ohio community of gaysport 
usually we can tell the difference between a quarry blast and 
an earthquake on the seismograph hansen said but he said in 
this case the seismographic waves appeared to be those of an 
earthquake 
because hansen remained suspicious he checked with mining 
companies tuesday and learned one had set off a blast precisely at 
the time the ground waves were recorded 
we were not able to find very many people who felt the 
earthquake hansen said that was kind of strange too 
hansen said earthquakes have been reported in that portion of 
the state most recently in 1953

a woman who beat poverty and welfare to 
become a surgeon says anyone can do the same if they are 
determined 
the reception dr charon gentile got when she landed at los 
angeles international airport recently was considerably different 
than when she first arrived in los angeles 11 years ago 
at that time she was a welfare mother a high school dropout 
from milwaukee cradling her 3monthold crying baby in her arms 
she had 30 a gift from a shelter for battered women 
late last month she returned to los angeles as a newly 
certified general surgeon 
gentile a proud new graduate of the prestigious mayo medical 
school in rochester minn was greeted by her son jimmy now a 
cheerfullooking 11yearold 
gentiles mother was at her southcentral los angeles home 
planning a surprise party for her daughter 
if i could get up on top of mount everest and tell about this 
kid id do it alberta gentile said of her daughter she is 
just an inspiration 
more than 100 people showed up at a restaurant in suburban 
hawthorne recently to celebrate gentiles success 
gentile 28 was greeted by former neighbors and former 
coworkers from the public clinic where she got her first taste of 
medical life as a clerk 
also present was the administrator at that clinic who told 
gentile that she should become a nurse 
today he marvels at her accomplishment 
honestly i didnt think she could go through medical school 
with all the discipline that required and still raise her 
child said tony rodgers administrator of the h claude hudson 
comprehensive health center 
gentile didnt take rodgers advice 
she skipped high school and passed a test giving her a graduate 
equivalency diploma 
then she enrolled at los angelessouthwestern community 
college a year later she transferred to loyola marymount 
university where she took premedical courses and graduated cum 
laude in 1984 
her residency in general surgery begins in a few weeks at the 
naval hospital in portsmouth va 
i think anybody can do it if they try she said people 
tend to settle for so little when they dont have to im sorry 
that most women dont think its an option for them 
racial discrimination was an added burden during her studies 
said gentile who is black 
one time a dean told me that the reason they let me into 
medical school was so future generations of minorities like my 
son would have a place in the world but i wasnt really qualified 
to be there gentile says 
that hurt but it increased her determination to become a doctor 
as far as i can remember thats what i wanted to be 
gentile said i think it was a response to people telling me i 
wasnt going to be anything 
they say you cant therefore you say i can 
actually i dont think its that amazing anyone can do it

president mengistu haile mariam 
denies his government is using food as a weapon in northern 
provinces where secessionist insurgencies and crop failures 
threaten the lives of 32 million people 
for the first time the ethiopian leader also accused arab 
countries of backing the rebel movement he claimed the moslem 
nations want to consolidate their control of the red sea 
during tuesdays sixhour news conference mengistus first with 
foreign reporters in two years he also called for better relations 
with washington 
the moustachioed marxist leader spoke with unprecedented candor 
on numerous other issues gesticulating with passion occasionally 
smiling and laughing 
mengistu denied his government is using food as a weapon in the 
north where the war and a government counteroffensive have 
jeopardized a massive westernfinanced relief effort for millions 
of people facing starvation in eritrea and tigre provinces 
how is it possible how is it imaginable that a government 
which came to power by the will of the people can be accused of 
using food as a weapon mengistu said we revolutionaries do 
not live for ourselves we live for others 
in early april the government ordered all foreign relief 
workers out of eritrea and tigre for security reasons 
the international red cross at first said it was defying the 
order to recall its 25 or so workers citing a humanitarian 
responsibility for the fate of some 5 million people in the two 
droughtstricken provinces 
when the government insisted that the red cross workers leave 
the areas the agency locked up its supplies and trucks and left 
on may 22 ethiopia gave the red cross 15 days to hand over the 
food 
red cross officials denied earlier requests because they said 
they must be present to supervise the foods distribution in the 
past there have been allegations that food destined for starving 
farmers has fed ethiopian troops 
mengistu said the rebels are using the food issue to elicit 
international sympathy and support for them to promote their 
propaganda activities against us 
on sunday un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said 
mengistu had promised when the two met two days earlier to allow 
the united nations to expand its role in the north to ensure the 
continued flow of aid 
the chief un representative in ethiopia michael priestley 
said mengistu had promised in principle to allow more un 
personnel into the north and to permit them to move outside 
governmentheld towns 
rebels of the eritrean peoples liberation front have been 
fighting for 27 years in africas oldest civil war and have won 
major victories this year with the capture of several towns 
mengistu who is in his mid40s made no reference to a younger 
insurgency by rebels of the tigrean peoples liberation front who 
have been fighting for 14 years 
during the conference mengistu said unspecified arab nations 
were backing the eritrean group 
rebels have embarked on a project of convincing the arab world 
of an alleged oppression of the moslems in ethiopia in order to 
invoke the sympathy of the arabs he said 
he said arabs were helping the rebels in order to keep 
ethiopia from the riches of the red sea 
ethiopias ports of assab and massawa both in eritrea are the 
only red sea ports not controlled by arab states ethiopia would be 
landlocked without them 
in the past mengistu has always said western nations supported 
the rebel movement 
on tuesday mengistu said the rebels also had won support from 
leftist countries which diplomats identified as cuba and the 
soviet union about 2500 cuban troops stationed in ethiopia have 
refused to fight in the north 
mengistu defended his countrys marxist revolution of september 
1974 calling it human and democratic and claiming it had 
improved the lives of the countrys 42 million people 
he warned that relations with the united states would be hurt if 
congress decides to stop annual imports of 20000 tons of ethiopian 
coffee a move it is debating 
still mengistu said he hopes for better ties with america we 
have always pushed for better relations with the united states and 
i hope the united states will reciprocate once upon a time we 
were good friends 
western diplomats were puzzled by mengistus conciliatory 
attitude 
they pointed out that ethiopia at the last minute caused chester 
crocker us assistant secretary of state for african affairs to 
cancel a visit in january when ethiopia announced he would not be 
meeting mengistu 
in february crocker said he believed ethiopia was not serious 
about improving relations with the united states 
oncewarm us relations with this east african country 
deteriorated after the 1974 revolution in which mengistu and a 
clique of fellow army officers overthrew emperor haile selassie 
the united states continued to arm the new military government 
until somalia invaded ethiopia in 1977 
in a dramatic superpower flipflop the soviets started backing 
ethiopia and the united states switched to somalia

opposition leader kim daejung today 
criticized american interference in korean politics and said only 
drastic changes in us policy can stop a wave of antiamerican 
sentiment in south korea 
he said south koreans resent us support for this countrys 
past authoritarian regimes and washingtons demand that korean 
markets be opened to us imports kim said the united states 
should not try to influence or control events in south korea 
first of all the united states should act up to our 
expectation for democratization if it wants to restore sincere ties 
here he told the seoul foreign correspondents club 
the opposition leader criticized us requests for south korea 
to increase its contribution to the costs of keeping about 42000 
us troops in the country under a mutual defense pact 
the united states has also been pressing for greater access to 
south korean markets to help reduce seouls 10 billion trade 
surplus with washington korean farmers strongly oppose any moves 
to open domestic markets for fear of hurting their business 
radical students have staged a series of protests over the past 
two weeks to demand the overthrow of president roh taewoo and the 
removal of american troops the protests have turned violent 
radicals have attacked us diplomatic buildings and fought police 
kim said the recent protests reflected public dismay over us 
policies there would be no more antius sentiment as long as it 
remains the patron of democracy and meets the wishes of the korean 
people he said 
government officials and other political leaders say antius 
sentiment is confined to a tiny radical minority and most south 
koreans are proamerican 
kim predicted that the olympic games in seoul that begin in 
september will lead to ties with the soviet union and china and 
help south korea end its heavy dependence on the united states but 
he ruled out drastic changes in south koreas relations with the 
united states in trade and other areas 
south korea has no formal ties with communist nations because of 
its rivalry with communist north korea the soviet and chinese 
decisions to attend the olympics are expected to lead to ties 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics because the 
international olympic committee has rejected its demand to cohost 
the games 
kim expressed disatisfaction with footdragging reforms 
proposed by the government and charged it with being insincere in 
liquidating the evil legacy of the previous government 
roh defeated kim and other opposition candidates in the dec 16 
presidential elections 
kim said today that the united states helped roh win by inviting 
him to washington before the elections giving the impression he 
was endorsed by the united states 
he said south koreas democratic development would be ensured by 
the political neutrality of the armed forces which he said have 
been used to maintain the dictatorial regimes in power 
i firmly believe the great bulk of the military opposed 
intervention in politics even though it still maintains 
considerable influence

a state holiday honoring the rev martin 
luther king jr won preliminary senate approval by one vote but 
the future of the bill was uncertain 
well have to see what the republican caucus wants to do 
senate president carl kunasek said after tuesdays vote 
kunasek a republican who blocked a similar measure earlier this 
year is not required to bring the bill to the floor for a final 
vote 
the bill cleared the calendar for debate on a 1413 vote 
tuesday but 16 votes are needed for final passage by the 30member 
senate and sponsors were unsure whether they could muster the 
needed support 
one of the three republican senators absent tuesday john 
mawhinney has said he would vote for a holiday for the slain civil 
rights leader while another jeff hill opposes it sen jacque 
steiner walked off the floor shortly before the measure came up 
and said later she had not made up her mind how to vote 
the king measure has been controversial for years in arizona 
which has separate february holidays for george washington and 
abraham lincoln many republicans say they want to keep a separate 
day for each president because lincoln a republican is important 
to them 
the federal government has combined the washington and lincoln 
days into a single holiday and created a day for king on the third 
monday in january 
the state senate passed a king holiday like the federal day in 
1986 but the house rejected the bill 
in 1987 the house passed a king holiday only to see the senate 
bottle it up in committee 
the governor at the time bruce babbitt then issued an 
executive proclamation declaring a king holiday but his republican 
successor evan mecham rescinded it citing advice from attorney 
general bob corbin who said only lawmakers could create a paid 
holiday for state employees 
mecham was removed from office april 4 when the senate convicted 
him in an unrelated impeachment trial 
house leaders said they would wait for the senate to act first 
this year and a king bill cleared the senate government committee 
but was mired in the rules committee which kunasek controls 
on tuesday three republicans joined the senates 11 democrats 
in tacking the king day provisions onto a state pension bill that 
had already hit the floor for debate 
kunasek said he believed the amendment might violate a provision 
in the state constitution requiring that each bill deal only with 
one subject he said senate attorneys would examine the question 
during the debate on the measure opponents said the question 
should be referred to the voters 
i have yet to see one poll where the people of arizona want a 
paid holiday for martin luther king said republican sen peter 
kay 
supporters said the state was losing prestige and tourist 
dollars because of international publicity about the controversy

the lead content of water exceeds federal safety 
standards at half the elementary schools in boston tested 
according to a preliminary state report and officials say some 
affected buildings will get bottled water 
samples from 40 of the 81 public and private elementary schools 
show higher levels of lead than the us environmental protection 
agencys allowable level of 50 parts per billion according to the 
department of public health study released tuesday 
nineteen schools have levels in excess of 20 parts per billion 
the epa has been considering lowering the maximum level to 20 parts 
per billion 
twenty had lead in their drinking water that was less than 20 
parts per billion 
further tests are scheduled to determine the source of the lead 
this is not an issue specific to boston said brad prenney 
director of the state child lead poison prevention program it is 
an issue that is state and nationwide 
school superintendent laval s wilson said bottled water will be 
supplied to the public schools with contaminated water we want 
to make sure our young people and staff have appropriate water to 
drink he said 
state and city officials said lead poisoning rarely results from 
drinking water that is tainted with lead 
but high levels of lead in drinking water can add to lead levels 
that may already be present in a childs body from other sources 
such as soil or leadbased paint the officials said 
lead poisoning is known to cause brain damage and can result in 
death 
state officals said the test results are similar to those from 
tests of homes in recent years

acting prime minister poul schlueter 
prepared to form a minority government after talks on a majority 
coalition broke down denmarks public radio said 
schlueter was appointed as chief negotiator 10 days ago with the 
task of putting together a government program that could win 
approval from a majority in the folketing the 179seat parliament 
but the social democrats denmarks biggest party and 
schlueters conservatives failed to close the gap between them on 
economic and defense policy 
schlueter who headed a centerright government until the 
inconclusive election of may 10 now has support from a majority of 
the eight parties to try to form a new minority coalition 
after 20 days of political jockeying all attempts to build a 
majority government appeared doomed 
the election was called following a parliamentary row over a 
toughening of denmarks peacetime ban on nuclear arms which 
provoked strong objections from its nato allies 
analyists predicted tuesday that the most likely outcome would 
be a coalition of conservatives liberals and social liberals 
commanding a total of 67 seats 
but the 10seat socialliberals who hold the balance of power 
in the new parliament as they did in the previous one had not 
decided whether to join a new schlueter administration 
the social democrats and the allied farleft socialist peoples 
party together have 79 seats efforts to form a majority coalition 
between them and the socialliberals failed earlier

a us embassy official accused the soviets today 
of engaging in a smear campaign by charging that a dissident 
who met with president reagan was a nazi war criminal 
the allegations against nikolai rozhko described by a us 
official as an americanborn man living in the western soviet 
union surfaced in soviet staterun media tuesday 
the embassy official who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified said the soviets disliked rozhko because he is 
campaigning to emigrate and is a focal point for others who want 
to leave 
the soviet charges are part of a smear campaign to pressure 
him to cease his activities said the official 
a student questioning reagan at the presidents session at 
moscow state university was swift to grill the us leader on why 
he invited the german polizei or gestapo to his meeting 
the president replied that he knew nothing about such charges 
nor did white house spokesman marlin fitzwater when asked about 
rozhko later at a news conference 
but soviet spokesman gennady i gerasimov reiterated charges by 
the state news agency tass that rozhko was a war criminal who began 
collaborating with the nazi police in 1942 
rozhko participated in the killing of soviet partisans and the 
arrests and tortures of civilians maybe jews too tass said 
it reported that rozhko was sentenced to death by firing squad 
by a military tribunal in 1944 but that the sentence was later 
commuted to 20 years imprisonment and rozhko was released on 
parole in 1955 by a government decree 
it gave no further background on the charges 
a us source who asked not to be identified said rozhko lives 
in grozdno in the western province of byelorussia a region of the 
soviet union that suffered greatly after the nazis invaded in 1941 
millions were killed in the occupied soviet union and many 
thousands of others jailed or executed on charges of collaborating 
with the nazis a charge that is viewed extremely negatively by a 
soviet public constantly reminded of the nations suffering in 
world war ii 
gerasimov said soviet journalists who attended reagans 
reception for the dissidents which was criticized by soviet 
officials turned up the background on rozhko by looking at soviet 
records 
they were rather curious and looked into the dossier of the 
invited gerasimov explained 
they found out that one of them in fact was a policeman 
sharing in the occupation of our country by germany so he was a 
former nazi agent and a war criminal gerasimov said 
the us official who asked not to be identified said rozhko 
was born in the united states and came to the soviet union as a 
child with his parents he has been trying to emigrate for the past 
20 years but the soviets have denied him permission to leave 
the source suggested that soviet authorities have charged before 
that rozhko had a nazi background but never presented firm proof 
nor implied that his history blocked his emigration 
the soviet government never once gave us one shred of evidence 
of his nazi activities the official said this was not an 
issue on rozhkos emigration until the soviets brought it up this 
week 
the official said he was speaking without direct access to 
rozhkos file and could not give precise details on the mans 
background but believed that he has a brother living in california 
the official said he had the impression that rozhko had served 
time in a soviet jail but he did not know on what charges 
reagans meeting with the refuseniks unlike all other events in 
his program was reported with negative comment by the soviet media 
the communist party daily pravda and government newspaper 
izvestia on tuesday criticized reagans meeting referring to a 
speech reagan delivered to the dissidents on monday pravda noted 
he had said its time for more kremlin reform 
indeed its time time to stop speculating on the problems of 
human rights using this serious question as an easy reason for 
selfadvertisement and politicizing pravda said 
izvestia criticized alexander ogorodnikov a religious activist 
at the meeting lev timofeyev a campaigner for press freedom 
rozhko and abe stolar a 73yearold american who has campaigned 
since 1975 for his family to emigrate from the soviet union 
like rozhko stolar was brought to the soviet union as a child 
by his parents

the 1988 atlantic hurricane season 
began today with the national weather service already tracking the 
first tropical depression of the year 
at 6 am edt the depressions center was just south of the 
western tip of cuba or about 150 miles southwest of havana the 
depression drifting toward the northeast contained winds up to 30 
mph and was not expected to strengthen 
if the systems maximum sustained winds reached 39 mph it would 
be called tropical storm alberto 
in conjunction with the start of the sixmonth season the 
weather service released a study estimating that the death toll 
from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted 
fortythree million people live in about 175 coastal counties 
from maine to texas and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier 
islands is virtually impossible said bob sheets director of the 
national hurricane center 
recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the 
atlantic and gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier 
thought must be evacuated under certain conditions sheets said 
sheets said there are not enough shelters to handle the added 
load and there are serious concerns how glasswindowed highrises 
would fare if lashed by hurricaneforce winds during the 
evacuations 
weve not had a strong category three or category four 
hurricane of record strike a glass city he said during a 
weaker hurricane that struck houston glass was flying 
everywhere 
hurricanes are rated on a onetofive scale five the most 
severe has wind speeds exceeding 150 mph 
the hurricane center director refused to make predictions about 
the 1988 season saying no one has convinced forecasters they can 
reliably predict the number and severity of the storms 
a typical atlantic hurricane season from june 1 to nov 30 
sees 10 named tropical storms with rain and winds exceeding 39 mph 
six become hurricanes with drenching rains and winds over 74 mph 
said hurricane specialist bob case of the geostationary 
earthorbiting environmental satellite 
in 1987 there were three hurricanes and four tropical storms in 
the atlantic

a west german pilot says bad weather 
caused him to fly his small plane over soviet territory over the 
weekend and that his jaunt into russian airspace was a mistake not 
a political statement 
andreas sommer said he blundered across the border in bad 
weather saturday in a singleengine cessna 150 and did it again on 
sunday 
sommer said he didnt know that saturday marked the first 
anniversary of a flight by mathias rust who stunned the world by 
flying a light plane through soviet air defenses to red square 
rust now is serving a fouryear prison term in moscow 
sommers flight caused a diplomatic flurry particularly because 
of suspicions the incursion had something to do with the moscow 
summit between president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev 
he said he hopes the summit brings peace and detente but 
his vacation flight had nothing to do with it 
in oslo foreign ministry spokesman lasse seim said the plane 
crossed the soviet border while on a 100mile flight from ivalo 
finland to kirkenes on norways barents sea coast 
he said it went deeper into soviet territory when it returned to 
ivalo on sunday staying in soviet airspace for as long as 30 
minutes 
sommer a parttime hamburg bus driver with 23 years as an 
amateur pilot said he passed into soviet territory both days while 
flying in a cloud cover at 1000 feet 
he said he said he first learned that he had strayed into soviet 
territory on sunday when norwegian air controllers warned him 
you are on soviet territory return 
the weather at the time was so bad i was prepared to land any 
place but there were only lakes and forests and i decided to 
return to finland immediately sommer told a reporter for the 
aftonbladet newspaper 
sommer said he saw no soviet aircraft scrambling to intercept 
him and had no contact with soviet air controllers 
matti autio of the finnish border patrol told the associated 
press that sommer was questioned after landing on sunday for 
deviating from his flight path but was not detained 
the norwegian national news agency ntb quoted soviet embassy 
official valery nesteruchkin in oslo as calling the overflight a 
bad joke 
seim said norway contacted soviet authorities on sunday and 
we have the impression that they followed the plane they knew 
about it 
the aftenposten newspaper speculated that the soviets may have 
refrained from shooting at the plane because of the moscow summit 
seim said the soviet border commission asked for a meeting with 
the norwegians on monday when they handed over a formal protest 
rust was 19 at the time he made the flight on sept 4 1987 he 
was found guilty by a moscow court of illegal entry into the soviet 
union violating international flight regulations and malicious 
hooliganism he was sentenced to four years in a labor camp but 
now is being held in a moscow prison

officials of that communist nation may be involved in drug 
trafficking 
laos official radio said harriet isom charge daffaires of the 
us embassy in vientiane was presented with a letter that said 
the charges affected laos honor dignity and prestige 
the letter was quoted tuesday in a broadcast by domestic state 
radio a text of which was obtained from a western embassy in 
bangkok today 
on may 11 a state department spokeswoman said there were 
numerous reports that government and military officials of the lao 
peoples democratic republic were involved in the drug trade 
the spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the department had 
submitted a report to congress on march 1 stating that opium 
cultivation and heroin production in laos had increased 
considerably in the past two years and the trend was likely to be 
irreversible 
the letter said laos was extremely surprised to learn this as 
relations between laos and the united states have been further

the nations secondlargest city survived may 
without being destroyed by a disastrous earthquake contrary to 
dire predictions by astrologers and followers of the 16thcentury 
french seer nostradamus 
that nugget of good news is followed by a dire prediction of 
another sort this time from members of the scientific community 
who say apocalyptic prophecies are a kind of industry that thrives 
in trendconscious california 
astronomer andy fraknoi said he expects more somber prophecies 
because for this rather large and lucrative new age business to 
keep churning out sales they need something cosmic every year or 
so 
fraknoi executive officer of the astronomical society of the 
pacific in san francisco blamed the attention the nostradamus 
prediction got on the media for failing to emphasize that 
scientists said the predictions were bunk 
the seismic scare was spurred by a purported prediction in vague 
poems by the astrologer nostradamus who died in 1566 in the 1981 
movie the man who saw tomorrow orson welles claimed 
nostradamus forecast a quake would destroy the new city 
supposedly los angeles when certain planets were aligned in may 
1988 
psychic hamilton farmer also predicted an 85magnitude quake 
would wreak havoc while other psychics and astrologers offered a 
variety of dates for southern californias demise 
much of the doomsaying focused on may 10 although nancy 
reagans personal astrologer joan quigley predicted the quake 
would hit may 5 
the comic strip doonesbury satirized the predictions and 
scientists called the forecasts nonsense saying nostradamus didnt 
predict a quake the planets werent aligned and wouldnt trigger a 
quake if they were 
but thousands of truly fearful residents called hot lines at 
griffith observatory and the california institute of technology in 
pasadena 
some stocked up on emergency supplies and nostradamus books and 
videotapes while others left town including an estimated 1000 or 
more cambodian refugees who were frightened by a strong real quake 
that rocked los angeles last october 
we need a campaign for the media to just say no no 
astrology no ufos no bigfoot stories no psychics fraknoi 
said when you get tempted just call another journalist and 
theyll help you just say no 
another figure prominent in the scientific study of the heavens 
criticized the prophecy business 
weve gone through the month of may with extraordinary 
unfounded predictions of a catastrophic earthquake in los angeles 
and to me this is like yelling fire in a crowded theater those 
who scared people should be ashamed of themselves said griffith 
observatory director edwin krupp 
there were many different people predicting every date of the 
month before we were done krupp said tuesday perhaps to the 
disappointment of those who had predicted a quake and counted on 
one the city of los angeles is still here 
about 30 quakes occur daily in southern california most too 
small to be felt caltech spokesman robert finn said 
the biggest quake all month in the region measured a barely 
respectable 40 on the richter scale on may 17 and was centered 
east of borrego springs about 125 miles southeast of los angeles 
he added no damage or injuries were reported 
melissa hatfield an employee at the phoenix metaphysical 
bookstore in santa monica said the scientists are pretty 
closeminded about prophesying and forseeing the future 
so why did los angeles survive 
from what ive heard because ive talked to a guy whos 
really looked into nostradamus the planets dont line up until 
1999 so thats when it the big quake is supposed to be ms 
hatfield said it should occur may 10 1999 so everybody was 
scared for nothing im moving away in 1999 
krupp scoffed at that but noted that scientists do expect a 
catastrophic earthquake is inevitable the california office of 
emergency services says a major devastating quake in southern 
california is more than 50 percent likely sometime within the next 
25 years 
if theres a good side to this nostradmus scare id bet a 
lot of people stocked up on bottled water and canned food and did 
all the other things to prepare for an earthquake finn said

the longsimmering rivalry between nancy reagan 
and raisa gorbachev flared up anew today with the american first 
lady acknowleging they were in mexican standoff 
although the two women maintained an appearance of cordiality 
and nearconstant smiles during a brief tour of an icon storage 
vault their last oneonone gettogether of the moscow summit 
erased earlier attempts to paper over the strained impasse that 
marks their relationship 
i want to say something i want to say something now ok 
mrs reagan cut in at one point as mrs gorbachev attempted to stop 
the press from questioning the american first lady 
mrs gorbachev backed away but pointedly looked at her watch as 
the us first lady chatted a bit with members of the white house 
press corps 
the incident recalled a similar one during the december summit 
in washington when mrs gorbachev lectured frequently on us 
history art and political life leaving mrs reagan attempting to 
get in a few words 
elaine crispen mrs reagans press secretary said after the 
event they are from two totally different worlds 
noting that mrs reagan has spoken out more in moscow than she 
did at the washington summit mrs crispen said she believed the 
two women now had more balance and equality in their 
relationship 
instead of meeting mrs reagan as planned by the door of the 
vault mrs gorbachev had entered first and informed the waiting 
press corp that they could have a dialogue about the art the 
guests are late she noted 
after mrs reagan arrived and the two women shook hands mrs 
gorbachev presented the first lady with a bouquet of roses and a 
large coffeetable style book of pictures from the gallery 
she also presented reporters with a copy of the same book 
proposing that they give it to whomever has covered the summit 
best 
mrs reagan raised her eyebrows in a look of mild consternation 
she then stepped forward and insisted that she be given equal time 
with the journalists 
she thanked mrs gorbachev and the gallery staff for making 
arrangements to allow her to see the nowclosed museum works and 
said she was aware that very few people were granted a chance to 
view them 
when reporters tried to question the two women mrs gorbachev 
responded we have decided there would not be any interviews 
please allow us to show mrs reagan the remaining art 
she retreated to the background however when journalists 
continued pressing for time with mrs reagan 
told that mrs gorbachev had spoken at length about the icon 
collection but had not mentioned its religious heritage mrs 
reagan responded i dont know how you can neglect the religious 
implications i mean they are there when you see them 
the first lady said she was pleased with her visit and that she 
hoped to return so that she might be able to view the artistic and 
architectural treasures of the nation once again 
asked if shed become a convert to communism during her trip 
the first lady laughed heartily saying oh no and she said 
soviets werent ready either to convert to capitalism 
mrs reagan indicated that the fiveday trip her first to the 
soviet union had not changed her views we have two different 
ways of living two different philosphies she said 
asked about her relationship with mrs gorbachev the first lady 
laughed at the maneuvering that had just occurred shrugged and 
declared a mexican standoff 
mrs reagan had requested a viewing of the famed icons of the 
tretyakov gallery since the museum has been closed for renovation 
the first lady was allowed to view a collection of the art in a 
hightech temperature controlled storage vault 
even though the two women had tried to paper over the reports of 
a feud mrs reagan left the impression during a day trip tuesday 
to leningrad that shed just as soon let the subject drop 
in a meeting with reporters aboard her plane mrs reagan said 
the soviet people are very warm and very open but that she was 
less impressed with her highlevel contacts their philosophies 
and positions are completely different from ours she said 
but given the repeated handholding between the first ladies 
during a tour of kremlin churches on sunday and at later official 
functions mrs reagan was asked who started it all 
i dont know it just sort of happened the first lady said 
with a shrug of her shoulders 
although mrs gorbachev declined to accompany mrs reagan to 
leningrad the soviet first lady arranged for lidiya gromyko the 
wife of soviet president andrei gromyko to go instead 
the first lady said she found mrs gromyko very nice very 
friendly very warm 
but asked if she had the same reaction to mrs gorbachev mrs 
reagan smiled and sat silent for a full 12 seconds pondering her 
answer 
well shes a everybodys different she finally said 
evoking a hail of laughter from the reporters 
when someone asked if mrs gromyko lectured as much as mrs 
gorbachev mrs reagan joined in the uproarious laughter 
just between us mrs reagan asked one reporter quipping 
how many viewers and readers do you have 
another long pause ending with the plea im desperately 
trying to think

up to 240 pregnant women were given a drug linked 
to birth defects without their knowledge as part of a study and 
officals are considering disciplining the researchers 
dilantin a drug commonly used to treat epilepsy was given by 
two cook county hospital anesthesiologists to about 245 pregnant 
women to determine whether it could reduce fetal stress in 
caesarean births hospital spokesman terrence hansen said tuesday 
five of the women had consented to participate in the 
hospitalapproved study from september 1987 through january said 
dr robert miller chairman of the hospitals scientific committee 
the other women were given the drug without their knowledge and 
without approval from the hospitals review board said miller 
who unlike hansen said he understood that only some of these 
approximately 240 women were pregnant 
miller said dilantin has been linked to birth defects when 
administered early in pregnancy but he said the women received the 
drug 15 minutes before delivering their babies 
the president of the cook county board which oversees the 
hospital said he would hold a meeting monday to discuss punishment 
for the doctors who have not been identified 
i was appalled to think that men in the medical profession 
would do that board president george dunne said tuesday they 
of all people should know that you dont experiment on patients 
without obtaining their written consent 
the illinois department of public health which regulates the 
licensing of hospitals is aware of the doctors action but is 
barred by state law from revealing whether it is investigating 
said spokeswoman penny strong 
spokesman terry levin of the cook county states attorneys 
office declined to comment on whether his office was investigating 
to see if criminal laws were violated 
the women all received a single smallerthannormal dose of the 
drug hansen said two of the babies died because of unrelated 
complications hansen said 
several studies have reported higher incidences of birth 
defects including heart abnormalities and retardation among 
babies born to women who use dilantin and other antiepileptic 
drugs 
miller said he did not agree with the doctors actions but did 
not consider them unethical 
but a medical ethicist called the practice a serious abuse 
of the medical profession 
it seems to me that it simply goes against the principles of 
biomedical ethics which really require that any person 
enrolled in a research project be informed of that and be given a 
chance to consent or refuse said james childress a religion and 
medical education professor at the university of virginia 
what it amounts to is basically using human beings as 
means to other ends not treating them as ends in themselves 
he said even though the risk was limited it was still a serious 
abuse 
hansen said the failure to gain the womens consent was a 
violation of hospital policy 
the hospitals executive medical staff recommended may 18 that 
the doctors be given probation a warning that would pave the way 
for stricter measures if they further violate hospital policy 
hansen said 
an ultimate decision on what action is taken against the 
doctors would rest with the board of trustees which is to meet 
monday hansen said 
hansen said none of the women has sued the hospital

a passenger train slammed today into 
the back of a gravelladen freight train on a main line in 
southwestern netherlands killing two people and injuring 20 a 
dutch railway spokesman said 
the cause of the collision the countrys worst in nearly six 
years was not immediately known said spokesman hans meijer 
one of the dead was believed to be the passenger trains 
engineer meijer said the other had not been identified 
two of the injured passengers were in serious condition said 
meijer 
the accident occurred at about 1040 am when a fourcar 
passenger train slammed into the stationary freight train meijer 
said in a telephone interview from the railways head office in 
this central dutch city 
the passenger train whose speed could not immediately be 
established was on its way from roosendaal a major junction 60 
miles south of amsterdam to vlissingen in the province of zeeland 
meijer said 
visibility was good at the site of the accident between the 
stations of rillandbath and krabbendijke where the doubletrack 
roosendaalvlissingen main line runs in a slight bend he said 
we havent been able to establish why the gravel train was 
standing still at that particular point and why the engineer of 
the passenger train didnt see it or whether the signals failed 
meijer said 
the roosendaalvlissingen line is equipped with automatic 
signals 
both tracks were blocked by the wreckage of both trains meijer 
said adding that the damage to the line and the overhead power 
lines was considerable 
fatal train collisions are rare on the technically advanced 
dutch railway network which is one of the busiest in the world 
the last serious train accident occurred in december 1982 when 
three passengers were killed in a collision near the port city of 
rotterdam

the number of soviet jewish emigrants who 
decided against coming to israel reached a record high in may when 
more than 90 percent chose to settle elsewhere a soviet jewish 
activist told the israeli newsagency itim 
chaim chessler head of the public council for soviet jewry was 
quoted as saying tuesday that soon no soviet jewish emigrants will 
come to israel unless they are flown via bucharest romania 
instead of vienna austria where they are free to immigrate to 
other western countries 
israeli officials are embarrassed by the high dropout figure 
because of their 20yearlong battle for the right of soviet jews 
to emigrate on the grounds that israel is their homeland 
israeli leaders claim 400000 soviet jews want to settle in 
israel but less than 20 percent of those who leave the soviet 
union actually settle here 
chessler said that of the 1169 jews who left the soviet union 
in may just 110 came to israel a drop of nearly 7 percent from 
april 
of the 4695 soviet jews who have emigrated so far this year 18 
percent have settled in israel he added 
meanwhile in geneva the intergovernmental committee for 
migration announced that jewish emigration from the soviet union 
through vienna austria reached a new sevenyear high in may when 
1145 jews arrived at that citys transit center 
may marked the fourth straight month of rising jewish emigration 
through vienna bringing the total for 1988 to 4547 soviet jews 
arriving there the committee said 
the figure was the highest since april 1981 when 1155 jews 
left the soviet union through the austrian capital 
more than 250000 jews have found new homes since the committee 
began its resettlement program in 1971 
the committee did not include figures for the number of soviet 
jews coming through bucharest shmuel binsky of the public council 
on soviet jewry in jerusalem said 24 jews emigrated through 
bucharest in may

here at a glance are some of the key points raised 
by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev during his news conference 
wednesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gorbachev noted that developments have become possible due to 
realism but that it is not an easy process at all 
the 24page document agreed at this meeting lays bricks so to 
say for the building of our future relationship it is a sign for 
movement into the 21st century 
the exchange of ratification documents on the intermediaterange 
weapons treaty turned the moscow meeting into a watershed 
political event in the sovietamerican dialogue and in world 
politics as a whole 
yet he said it is not easy to make progress on strategic arms 
calling negotiations on this issue the most complex task we 
confronted in postwar politics step by step we are moving 
towards a treaty 
but he strongly criticized the contrary attitude that he said 
had led to lastminute difficulties on agreeing the text of the 
joint statement i believe that we have missed a chance to take 
an important step forward toward civilized relations he said 
he added however that even though not everything has been 
achieved as we would have wanted it we will not make any dramatic 
conclusions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gorbachev said there has been some progress in this sense 
using wording that suggested resolution of some individual cases 
but he strongly criticized what he called propaganda gambits 
and all sorts of spectacles all sorts of shows in apparent 
allusion to reagans meeting monday with dissidents and refuseniks 
im not filled with admiration for this part of the visit 
gorbachev added 
he noted that reagan had had a chance to get to know soviet 
people and emphasized that the president asked on tuesday whether 
he still stuck to his march 1983 view of the svoiet union as an 
evil empire had said he did not 
he said no and he said this within the walls of the kremlin 
right in the heart of the evil empire gorbachev said we take 
note of this 
reagans evil empire comment sparked a torrent of vicious 
comment when it was made leading to an escalation in soviet 
attacks that culminated in comparision between reagan and adolf 
hitler in the deep freeze that followed the shooting down of the 
korean air liner in september 1983 and the breaking off of arms 
talks in geneva in november that year 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on the middle east gorbachev said for the first time that as 
soon as an international conference on the region is convened we 
are prepared to address ourselves to regularizing relations with 
israel severed in 1967 
in general gorbachev said real possibilities have appeared 
for solving regional problems but gave no specifics 
he cited the afghanistan agreement as an example of what could 
be achieved if the superpowers worked together with warring parties 
to solve the conflicts but noted that if soviet forces now come 
under attack from rebels as they withdraw we shall react 
accordingly and appropriately that should be absolutely clear 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after talking about what he called the contrary attitude of the 
united states on some issues gorbachev singled out economic 
relations 
authoritative parts of american business circles would like to 
do business they are faced with intimidation and all sorts of 
restrictions gorbachev said 
alluding to the jacksonvanik amendment he said there is 
indeed a most unfavored nation status with regard to the treatment 
of the soviet union 
why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living one 
is physically dead the other is politically dead the amendment 
was passed in totally different circumstances a decade ago we 
should base our policies on presentday realities 
the amendment passed by congress in 1974 requires that any 
communist nation give assurance of free emigration to be entitled 
to mostfavorednation trade status

president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev at an impasse this week on strategic arms negotiations 
celebrated a past summit success today by exchanging final 
ratification documents on last decembers pact on 
intermediaterange weapons 
but they deadlocked on the explosive issue of spacebased 
defenses and failed to take steps to cut concentrations of eastern 
and western troops in europe 
we have missed a chance to take an important step forward 
gorbachev told reporters 
while accusing reagan of incomprehensible maneuvers on 
conventional forces gorbachev also registered a lack of progress 
in settling a longstanding dispute over the us strategic defense 
initiative 
he said he had proposed an exchange of data and crossvisits to 
facilities where technology for an antimissile defense is tested 
but he said the problem remained in the path of a new treaty and a 
fifth summit meeting at which it would be signed 
at a glittering ceremony in the kremlins st vladimirs hall 
though reagan and gorbachev signed documents to put their 1987 
treaty to ban intermediaterange missiles in force 
reagan called the accord a first step toward a brighter 
future a safer world while gorbachev declared the era of 
nuclear disarmament has begun 
the soviet leader said he and reagan had agreed at their fourth 
summit meeting that the immediate task before us was to 
complete the start treaty to sharply reduce strategic nuclear 
weapons it can and must be accomplished he said 
future american and soviet leaders cannot reverse course the 
57yearold gorbachev said i dont think anyone can close that 
book and put it aside 
reagan agreed we must not stop here he said there is 
much more to be done 
he said a joint statement to be issued later in the day would 
reflect more progress has been made toward a strategic arms 
treaty in our meetings 
as the two leaders put the unprecedented ban on mediumrange 
missiles and monitoring program into effect they set the set the 
stage for american and soviet monitors to take up stations in each 
others lands to guard against cheating 
two senate leaders democrat robert byrd and republican bob 
dole told reporters the socalled inf agreement was a crowning 
achievement for reagan but both said he should move cautiously on 
the more extensive strategic arms pact 
lets not have a framework adopted that lock us in said 
dole rkan 
reagan and gorbachev are expected to issue a joint communique 
before reagans departure thursday that among other things would 
note progress that has been made in the ussoviet relationship 
since gorbachev took the kremlin helm in 1985 and reagan ceased 
calling moscow the evil empire 
and despite the failure to reach a breakthrough in arms control 
the two sides made some headway on a stubborn issue how to keep 
track of each others elusive mobile missiles in the event of a new 
accord 
we think we have most of the elements secretary of defense 
frank c carlucci said in a cbstv interview were presenting it 
to the soviets some of the elements theyve accepted 
colin powell the presidents national security adviser told 
cnn that theres been quite a lot of convergence in us and 
soviet thinking on the verification of mobile missiles so weve 
made progress 
but powell said not enough to say that the treaty is at 
hand 
anf carlucci said unless the soviets stop trying to block the 
us star wars program obviously we cant get an agreement 
the treaty the leaders are exchanging is the first in history to 
abolish an entire category of nuclear weapons it was ratified last 
friday by the senate and 17 hours later by the soviet presidium it 
bans all missiles in the range of 300 to 3400 miles 
byrd who arrived here tuesday with dole to mark the senates 
ratification of the inf accord said reagans discipline and 
strength prodded the soviets to negotiate the accord i dont 
believe anyone else could have done that he said 
dole called the treaty probably the highlight of his second 
term it is a small step but it is a step towards arms reduction 
gorbachev and reagan had hoped to complete a vastly more 
important treaty to reduce us and soviet armories of longrange 
bombers landbased missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 to 50 
percent but disputes over verifying the pact and the reagans star 
wars program spoiled the plan 
instead they separated out a single provision for advance 
notification of missile launch tests it was signed tuesday they 
instructed their senior negotiators to make as much progress as 
they could on the obstacles to a strategic arms reduction treaty 
start and left open the possibility of a fifth summit meeting to 
sign it before reagan leaves office in january 
progress on the proposed start treaty came on a us proposal 
for verifying limits on mobile missiles and a compromise on 
counting airlaunched cruise missiles said a senior us official 
who spoke on condition he not be further identified 
but no progress was reported on star wars the main impediment 
to a start agreement to cut to cut longrange weapons 
at the december summit both leaders said they hoped to sign a 
strategic arms pact in moscow but talks stalled over star wars 
mobile missiles rules on counting cruise missiles aboard 
warplanes curbs on cruise missiles on submarines and a us call 
to phase out heavy soviet ss18 missiles 
gorbachev expressed exasperation at the pace of the talks 
although both sides said they hoped the treaty could be signed by 
the end of the reagan presidency 
reagan said he would not bargain away star wars formally known 
as the strategic defense initiative 
its never been a part of the negotiations said reagan 
because of difficulties in counting mobile missiles the united 
states had wanted to ban them although it is developing one the 
midgetman the soviets declined to get rid of their two mobile 
missiles the ss24 and ss25 
during the summit american negotiators offered a proposal they 
had been working on for months to restrict mobile missiles to 
carefully defined geographical areas dubbed garrisons which 
would be monitored by onsite inspection as well as surveillance 
from spy satellites 
the soviets reacted positively to our proposal said a us 
official speaking not for attribution

iowas court of appeals has reluctantly 
allowed prosecutors to use handwriting analysis in selecting jurors 
but warned of a possible chilling effect 
citizens may shy away from jury service if they know part of 
serving is to have a determination made from their handwriting that 
they are such things as sexually frustrated or not a hugger 
the court said tuesday 
despite its worries the court refused to order a new trial in a 
burglary case in which handwriting analysis was used in picking 
jurors the defendant merle leroy knerr had claimed that 
prosecutors had gained an unfair advantage 
in refusing to order a new trial the court said it is a 
recognized practice for an attorney to make investigations of 
prospective jurors 
to warrant a new trial it must be shown that prosecutors took 
part in systematic and intentional exclusion of an identifiable 
eligible group the court said 
at the same time the court said of handwriting analysis 
after reviewing the information presented by the expert we find 
it to be of very minimal benefit to the jury selection process 
the appellate court also noted that its already tough to get 
citizens to accept jury duty 
we have concern that the knowledge such procedures are used to 
uncover information on jurors could have a chilling effect on 
citizens response to the call for jury service the court said 
additionally because of the number of persons employed in the 
county attorneys office there is the possibility of inadvertent 
disclosure

a un spokesman said today tear gas fired by 
israeli soldiers has killed 11 palestinians including a 
sevendayold infant and has caused dozens of miscarriages since 
an arab uprising began six months ago 
a spokesman for the army said the report was being checked 
new figures released by israeli officials meanwhile indicate 
the casualty toll in the uprising in the israelioccupies 
territories is higher than previously believed 
the army said tuesday that 207 palestinians had been killed 
including 157 by gunfire from israeli soldiers the united nations 
says 199 arabs have been killed 11 of them from tear gas 
a leftwing legislator quoted a confidential document as saying 
5133 arabs have been injured since the uprising began dec 8 
in washington us state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
called the tear gas report a matter of concern to us 
we have repeatedly urged the government of israel to use 
nonlethal means to control violent demonstrations she said 
bill lee spokesman for the un relief and works agency said 
most of the tear gas casualties were a result of the crowd control 
gas being fired into closed rooms such as shelters clinics and 
homes by troops dispersing demonstrators 
he said 1285 palestinians from refugee camps in the west bank 
and gaza strip were treated in hospitals for breathing problems 
caused by the tear gas 
the gas is not normally lethal when used according to 
prescribed directions but it can be when fired into enclosed 
spaces lee said 
the 11 fatalities were reported through the end of april by 
doctors who work in clinics in un administered refugee camps lee 
said he said most of those killed were either infants one as 
young as seven days or people over 65 
also among the victims was a 35yearold woman in gaza who died 
along with her unborn child after going into labor prematurely as a 
result of inhaling tear gas lee said 
palestinian hospital officials have repeatedly claimed that 
israeli soldiers were using a new more toxic gas on demonstrators 
israeli army officials denied it 
lee said the gas used by israel apparently causes muscle spasms 
which can trigger early labor or miscarriage and that dozens of 
such cases have been reported in the occupied territories 
dr john hiddlestone director of health affairs for the un 
agency that aids palestinians said in vienna on april 14 after 
visiting the occupied territories that the israelis were using a 
gas against palestinians that causes abdominal pain miscarriage 
and muscular weakness 
i am a physician and people are having symptoms other than 
normal tear gas symptoms he said 
oakley the us spokeswoman said the gas sold to israel is 
commonly used by us police and the military she said us firms 
had obtained government export licenses to sell the gas 
the armys death toll of 207 palestinians was not explained and 
brought the toll beyond the 199 counted by the united nations the 
army said it was still investigating how 50 of the 207 died 
un statistics indicate 167 palestinians have been fatally shot 
by israeli troops during the uprising and that 11 were killed by 
jewish settlers lee said the rest died from tear gas beatings and 
other means 
the leftwing member of parliament dedi zucker quoted a top 
defense official as saying military harassment and maltreatment 
of palestinians was the chief reason that unrest continues in the 
occupied lands 
zucker of the liberal citizens rights movement said the 
official whom he refused to identify spoke during a meeting with 
several legislators 
zucker also quoted a confidential government document as saying 
5133 palestinians have been injured in the uprising 
defense minister yitzhak rabin told a closeddoor meeting of 
legislators that the intifadeh uprising has only cooled off on 
the surface while underneath the goals are glowing as hot as 
before the jerusalem post daily reported today 
rabin who held two meetings in the past week with projordanian 
moderate palestinians said tuesday he would continue such talks 
even with people who hold extreme views 
he told israel radio he decided to arrange the talks because he 
was convinced the palestinians now realized that with stones and 
firebombs they can achieve nothing

between the superpowers but his policy remains trust but 
verify 
his fourth summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev over 
reagan told a windup news conference in spasso house home of 
american ambassadors in moscow i am never going to relax my 
belief in the need for verification 
reagan acknowledged that his view of the soviets has changed 
but he said that was due to changes within the kremlin leadership 
and not his own personal beliefs 
the president was reminded that at his first news conference in 
the white house in 1981 he said that communist leaders are willing 
to lie and cheat in pursuit of world domination 
asked if that was still his view he said in 1981 he had merely 
been quoting what communist leaders themselves had said using the 
russian words he said with a smile that his policy remains trust 
the soviets but insist on verification 
reagan repeatedly spoke of the satisfactory relationship 
that had developed between himself and gorbachev who he said i 
have found different than previous soviet leaders 
a large part of it is mr gorbachev as a leader i read 
perestroika and i found much in it that i agreed with reagan

ship discovered off in waters between malaysia and indonesia 
carries about 3 billion in gold and precious stones a newspaper 
reported today 
the haul is believed to be one of the biggest lost treasures 
of the world the chief minister of malacca state abdul rahim 
thamby chik was quoted as saying 
the official quoted by the daily new straits times reported 
the treasure was on board the remains of flor de la mar once the 
flagship of the portuguese navy in the area it struck a reef and 
sank in the straits of malacca in january 1512 a few months after 
an 800ship portuguese armada captured the malacca sultanate 
the ship with a cargo he estimated at 3 billion also carried 
malay weavers and women he said 
rahim said he had held talks with a salvage group this week but 
would not identify the company or disclose further details about 
its location the newspaper said 
the national news agency bernama the star and other dailies 
also reported that rahim said the ship has been found and that 
malaysian officials and those of an unidentified foreign country 
have been contacted in connection with salvaging the treasure 
other officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
foreign government is believed to be indonesia and the treasure is 
lying off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra in the 
straits of malacca 
the state minister was quoted tuesday in malacca about 90 miles 
south kuala lumpur a spokesman at his home said he had gone

of the treasure but he said international laws stipulate that 
treasures found at the bottom of the sea should be divided among 
the country of origin of the treasure the country where the 
treasure was found and the finder of the treasure 
the malaysian government will not pay any cost for the salvage 
other than providing protection for the team he said

the communist party ended a 
threeday conference by issuing an upbeat statement on the nations 
economic crisis that failed to criticize party leaders as 
delegates had demanded 
the party is capable of seeking and finding a way out of the 
political and economic crisis said a 38page document issued 
tuesday at the end of the conference according to the official 
tanjug news agency 
the statement also directed competent institutions and organs 
to complete the reform of the economic system based on strong 
orientation toward market economy by the end of the year the 
news agency said 
at least four delegates among 40 who objected to the final 
text said it failed to single out party leaders responsible for 
the economic crisis 
we have discussed one thing for three days and put down a 
different thing in this document one delegate predrag 
zivanovic said 
many of the 800 delegates at the conference had accused the 
party leadership of bungling and demanded their resignation some 
delegates said the failure to solve economic problems was 
destroying public trust in the party 
yugoslavia launched on saturday its latest economic austerity 
program designed to cope with a foreign debt of 21 billion 
europes highest annual inflation at 170 percent and an 
unemployment rate of 15 percent 
economic problems have caused increasing social and labor 
unrest last year there were more than 1500 strikes involving more 
than 300000 workers who protested low and declining standards of 
living 
young people are reluctant to join the communist party because 
they have no confidence in our organization metka tekavcic a 
slovenian delegate declared during one debate at the conference 
fewer than 10 percent of yugoslavias 23 million people belong 
to the party and the number has been declining rapidly 
in the opening speech of the conference on sunday party chief 
bosko krunic rejected calls for a multiparty system he also 
predicted there will be new social upheavals once the austerity 
measures which include sharp price rises and wage controls begin 
to affect the nation 
the measures were recommended by the international monetary fund 
some delegates also called for an extraordinary party congress 
but ivan brigic a presidium member said such a conngress would 
imply doubt that the plans of this party conference will be 
materialized the news agency said 
he said the central commmittee alone will determine the leaders 
responsible for the economic crisis if there is no improvement by 
years end 
before the document was adopted drasko milicevic a 
representative of serbia said it has too many words too many 
one should one needs one must the words we have all 
become tired of he demanded a drastic reduction of the text 
to two or three pages with clear tasks

videotape retailers plan to use private 
detectives and a boycott threat to strike back at a group that says 
it will picket their stores in support of stricter antiobscenity 
laws taking effect today 
the minnesota cleanup project plans to protest at about 50 
stores throughout the state saturday to urge enforcement said 
robert p heinrich director of the antipornography organization 
the amended law specifically includes videotapes in its 
definition of materials that may be banned as obscene 
david ballstadt president of a firm that runs 10 videotape 
stores in the minneapolisst paul area said store operators would 
retaliate by hiring detectives and tracing protesters license 
plates to find where they are employed 
letters will be sent to the employers telling them their 
products will be boycotted because of their employees activities 
he said 
if these people think they can walk around and express their 
freedoms which they have a right to do theyre going to have to 
pay a price just as we have to ballstadt said 
at issue are amendments approved by the 1988 legislature to 
bring the states law into conformity with obscenity rulings of the 
us supreme court 
the changes technically are not that great but they do 
provide some tools for prosecutors to use said state solicitor 
general norm coleman 
the previous law provided only for civil penalties the new law 
provides for criminal penalties he said conviction on a first 
offense carries up to one year in prison a 3000 fine or both 
subsequent convictions carry a prison term of up to two years a 
fine of up to 10000 or both 
heinrich whose group is an affiliate of the berean league a 
conservative christian lobbying organization said anything on 
film or video is more enticing than a still picture and this 
material is readily available to children of all ages and people of 
all ages 
the protesters heinrich said will picket major hardcore 
pornography outlets that have refused to remove what the group 
considers obscene materials from their shelves

the defense department begins testing all 
military recruits for drug and alcohol abuse today 
all enlisted recruits as well as officer candidates applying to 
the military academies and reserve officer training corps program 
will be tested for alcohol marijuana and cocaine 
applicants attempting to join the national guard and the 
reserves also will be tested 
congress ordered the drug testing program last december when it 
approved the pentagons fiscal 1988 budget bill requiring that it 
start by the first week of june 
defense secretary frank c carlucci decided last january to 
start the testing at military processing stations around the 
country on june 1 
positive findings for marijuana and alcohol will result in an 
enlistment ineligibility for six months on the first test the 
guidelines state positive findings for cocaine will result in an 
enlistment ineligibility for one year a positive second test on 
any of the three drugs will result in a twoyear period of 
enlistment ineligibility 
the army navy marine corps and air force signed up almost 
317000 recruits in fiscal 1987 
the testing has been opposed by some officials in the defense 
department on grounds it is too expensive as well as unnecessary 
since all military personnel on active duty face random drug tests 
at any time 
a teenager planning to join the military can abstain from drugs 
for a brief time and probably pass the test noted one manpower 
official who asked not to be named 
congress approved a budget amendment sponsored by sen ernest f 
hollings dsc who said that a drugscreening program is 
logical and long overdue 
the time to start catching the users is before they join the 
armed forces when the government has no obligation to them 
hollings said 
carlucci in setting out test guidelines concluded recruits 
should be tested for drug and alcohol use during their 
preenlistment physical examinations using a breathalyzer or 
blood alcohol test for alcohol detection and urinalysis for 
marijuana and cocaine detection 
the standard for alcohol impairment will be a blood alcohol 
level of 05 the directive said

was no longer a viable option 
oxford university canon gareth bennett 68 was found dead dec 
7 five days after publication of his preface in the 198788 
edition of the directory 
the essay accused runcie of being indecisive and overly liberal 
although the article was unsigned suspicion quickly fell on 
bennett because of his stature as a leader of the churchs 
conservative wing 
it was widely interpreted as the opening shot in a campaign to 
pressure runcie into retirement and to block any attempt to replace 
him with a liberal 
bennett was found dead in the garage of his home with a hose 
leading into his car from the exhaust church officials later 
confirmed that he wrote the preface 
the church commissioners and central board of finance said they 
considered the possibility of publishing a signed commentary in 
crockfords clerical directory but decided against it 
the essay will be dropped from the 198990 edition of 
crockfords the official biannual list of anglican clergy but no 
decision has been made on whether to eliminate it permanently a

kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev today 
condemned rebel attacks on soviet troops withdrawing from 
afghanistan and said it should be absolutely clear that his 
forces would respond to any further assaults 
he also told a televised news conference at the close of his 
summit talks with president reagan that the soviet union will 
consider restoring diplomatic relations with israel as soon as an 
international conference on the middle east is convened 
gorbachev indicated however that disagreements over 
palestinian representation and other issues still block agreement 
on calling an international conference the kremlin severed 
relations with israel in 1967 over israels sixday war against its 
arab neighbors 
at separate postsummit news conferences reagan and gorbachev 
both cited the agreement on a soviet withdrawal from afghanistan as 
an example of how the superpowers can help settle regional 
conflicts by working with parties that are directly involved 
but gorbachev noted afghan rebel attacks on soviet troops and 
the embassy in kabul including one attack near kandahar on tuesday 
in which several soviet soldiers died 
if soviet forces come under attack as they withdraw we shall 
react accordingly and appropriately gorbachev said that 
should be absolutely clear 
a senior us official speaking only on condition that he not 
be identified said gorbachev clearly meant that his army would 
return fire if attacked by moslem rebels battling the sovietbacked 
government in kabul 
this official said gorbachev complained to reagan during their 
summit talks about the attacks on withdrawing soviet troops 
at the same time however soviet chief of staff marshal sergei 
akhromeyev outlined details of the schedule for withdrawal of an 
estimated 115000 troops from afghanistan by feb 15 
the soviets recently disclosed that 311 of their soldiers were 
missing in action there president reagan told a moscow state 
university students tuesday that the united states was willing to 
assist efforts to find the missing troops 
gorbachev said today that american and pakistani authorities had 
been contacted and that we shall do all we can to return these 
people to their homes 
on the middle east gorbachev said there has been a drawing 
closer of our positions with superpower agreement on the need for 
an international conference problems of palestinian representation 
and an agenda are still to be resolved he said 
weve given the americans several years of opportunity to go 
it alone in the middle east gorbachev said they saw that they 
couldnt 
gorbachev told reporters that real possibilities have appeared 
for solving regional problems but neither he nor reagan 
discussed details of their discussions on central america southern 
africa cambodia and korea

mikhail s gorbachev and president reagan 
concluded four days of summit talks today with an impasse on a 
major arms control agreement but muted differences on human rights 
the soviet leader called their meetings a blow to the foundations 
of the cold war and reagan said we must not stop here 
in remarks after their formal talks ended with smiles and 
handshakes gorbachev said reagan had disavowed his description of 
the soviet union as an evil empire and noted with satisfaction 
that he did it within the walls of the kremlin 
reagan in turn praised gorbachevs moves to open up his 
countrys society to the point of suggesting that soviet refusal to 
permit thousands of dissidents to emigrate over a period of several 
decades may be due to an unresponsive bureaucracy rather than 
deliberate government policy 
asked at a news conference if he wasnt letting gorbachev off a 
little too easy on that score reagan replied i just have to 
believe that in any sort of government some of us do find ourselves 
bound in by bureaucracy 
both men vowed to persist in efforts to negotiate a new treaty 
calling for sweeping reductions in nuclear weapons despite their 
inability to achieve a breakthrough in four days in moscow 
the president said he hopes for an arms control agreement by the 
end of his term in january to supplement the inf treaty that was 
formally ratified during his four days in russia but he quickly 
added i am dead set against deadlines 
we can look with optimism on future negotiations he said 
even he continued to defend his proposal for star wars which has 
been a key stumbling block in superpower armscontrol negotiations 
the conversations are still going on and they are still being 
discussed and i say progress is still being made or we wouldnt be 
talking as we are he said but reagan said i honestly cant 
answer that question when asked whether he thought he and 
gorbachev would meet once more time as the leaders of the two 
superpowers 
it was reagans decision to softpedal differences on human 
rights that seemed likely to be his most memorable comments at a 
news conference televised live in the united states particularly 
after his meeting two days earlier with dissidents who told him 
personally of their imprisonment and internment in labor camps 
during their struggle to emigrate 
the leaders ended their fourth summit by exchanging the 
documents of ratification of the intermediaterange nuclear arms 
treaty inf signed last december they said they will press to 
complete an elusive agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons by 
up to 50 percent 
the first lines have already been written into a book of the 
world without nuclear weapons gorbachev said i dont 
think anyone can close that book and put it aside 
in his news conference the first such session ever held by a 
soviet leader in moscow gorbachev said the presidents strategic 
defense initiative remained as one key obstacle to an offensive 
arms agreement along with a dispute over limits on submarine 
launched cruise missiles 
he said he told reagan that the view that the socalled star 
wars program is strictly a defensive one is just not serious 
the issue snagged dramatic bargaining during the second sumit held 
in 1986 in iceland 
in a brief ceremony in the kremlins st vladimir hall reagan 
and gorbachev shook hands four separate times giving no indication 
that differences on issues had soured the warm personal 
relationship they have displayed here in his remarks to reporters 
gorbachev generally praised reagan although he said american 
economic and arms policies were often contradictory 
gorbachev summarized their meetings as big politics politics 
that affect millions of millions of people he said that with the 
inf treaty the era of nuclear disarmament has begun 
reagan praising the inf treaty as historic because it mandates 
the elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons said we 
must not stop here mr general secretary there is much more to be 
done 
despite the lack of major agreements it was an upbeat windup to 
the fourth summit in 30 months between the two leaders and the 
first visit to moscow by an american president in 14 years 
gorbachev made a point of noting that reagan had said he no 
longer viewed the soviet union as an evil empire reagan said 
tuesday he had been talking about another time another era 
the soviet leader said we take note of this remarking that 
everything flows everything changes 
in the absence in a strategic arms pact gorbachev said we 
will not make any dramatic conclusions at this summit however 
he said they were moving step by step toward an eventual 
treaty 
reagan had made a point during his visit of mixing criticism 
with praise for the soviet record on human rights and freedom 
gorbachev said that when reagan tried to persuade me to change my 
mind i said your explanations are not convincing i am not 
filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit 
in developing his theme gorbachev said but big politics 
means difficult politics a reference perhaps to the strategic 
arms negotiations that remains snagged and to the human rights 
issues that continue to divide the superpower nations 
big politics also means big responsibility he continued 
it cannot be built on pursuing only ones own interest in the 
movements toward a nuclear free and nonviolent world 
president reagan and i have agreed that the immediate task 
before us achievement of a reduction of 50 percent in strategic 
nuclear arsenals can and must be accomplished the soviet 
leader said 
reagan and gorbachev congratulated each other and exchanged 
pens used to sign the inf documents while an audience of 
highranking officials and dignitaries looked on first ladies 
nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev sat next to one another on the 
front row 
decembers intermediaterange nuclear arms treaty requires the 
destruction of all nuclear missiles on each side with a range of 
300 to 3400 miles it was the first superpower nuclear arms pact 
in 16 years 
the far more expansive treaty that eluded reagan and gorbachev 
would have provided for cuts of 30 to 50 percent in the 
superpowers stockpiles of strategic missiles bombers and 
submarines 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva and senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan who present for the exchange of 
treaty documents said it was unlikely the senate would have a 
debate and ratification vote on a strategic missile treaty even if 
reagan and gorbachev negotiated such a pact before reagan leaves 
office next january 
my suggestion would be that we make haste slowly that we not 
go too fast byrd said at a joint news conference with dole 
there are big problems a verification terrain that would be 
strewn with booby traps and minefields

if c rabon martin wants to run for a seat 
on a state regulatory agency he cant do it under the name wilbur 
jimbob rogers 
martin said judge robert caldwell dismissed his request for a 
name change tuesday because he was leery of sanctioning this 
statewide big political joke 
martin an attorney and candidate for the corporation 
commission which regulates state utilities and the oil and gas 
industry said the judge also expressed concern that the intent 
of it is to be confusing to the voter 
he thought it would be a bad idea for me professionally 
martin said 
martin said while his action may help establish parameters for 
buffoonery it was a joke that also has a moral the intent is 
to kick people in the pants and say think before you vote 
in a may 11 court petition martin said he wanted the change 
as a measure of the degree of respect and regard for 
oklahomas political heritage 
he said he selected wilbur in honor of wilbur wright a former 
state labor commissioner often cited as an example of the political 
value of a famous name 
martin liked jimbob for its basic downhome appeal and 
thought anyone named rogers has always been able to get elected 
to anything in oklahoma where the humorist will rogers was born 
he said he would have changed his name back to c rabon martin 
after the election

here is a text of president reagans opening 
statement and news conference wednesday at spaso house 
if just this one time i might speak for all of you as well as 
myself i would like to extend my thanks to general secretary 
gorbachev all of his associates in the soviet government and the 
people of moscow for all theyve done to make our stay here a 
pleasant one and this summit conference the success it has been 
this is my fourth summit for some in our governments and some 
of you in the media the number is higher but a good deal of 
important work has been accomplished here in moscow 
the personal relationship between mr gorbachev and me and the 
various members of our respective delegations has continued to 
deepen and improve the personal relationships and hopes for peace 
are not by themselves enough i think history will note that in our 
approach to the summit process the united states has sought a 
consistency of expression as well as purpose 
out of every turn ive tried to state our overwhelming desire 
for peace ive also tried to note the existence of fundamental 
differences and thats why its a source of great satisfaction 
that those difference in part as a result of these meetings 
continue to recede 
in addition spokesmen for the soviet government have noted the 
change of policy indeed the profound change of policy that has 
occurred in their own government the united states is fully 
cognizant of this change and aware of its implications 
in noting the differences that still stand between us 
therefore my desire has not been to sound a note of discouragement 
but one of realism not to conduct a tutorial but to give the kind 
of emphatic testimony to the truth that over the long run removes 
the illusion and moves the process of negotiation forward from our 
standpoint this approach has borne fruit at previous meetings and 
again at this summit conference 
and here permit me to go back for just a moment to our first 
summit meeting at geneva there we agreed on certain fundamental 
realities that would govern our relations that a nuclear war 
cannot be won and must never be fought that the united states and 
the soviet union bear special responsibilities for the risk of war 
that neither side should seek military superiority over the other 
we affirmed our determination to prevent war whether nuclear or 
conventional and our resolve to contribute in every way possible 
along with other nations to a safer world we also set out a broad 
agenda and initiated a new process of dialogue to address the 
sources of tension in ussoviet relations since geneva we have 
achieved through a sustained effort progress across this broad 
agenda 
our first discussions here in moscow focused on the important 
matter of human rights individual freedoms the united states 
views human rights as fundamental to our relationship with the 
soviet union and all nations from the beginning we stressed this 
point and are encouraged by recent signs of progress in the soviet 
union i believe where people have the right to speak write 
travel and worship freely creative energies are released on 
several occasions ive said that nations do not distrust each other 
because theyre armed they are armed because they distrust each 
other 
for the past three years general secretary gorbachev and i have 
worked to build a relationship of greater trust and we both 
recognize that one way to do that is to improve understanding 
between our two countries through broader peopletopeople contacts 
a series of agreements to expand ussoviet bilateral 
cooperation including cultural exchanges have been concluded we 
agreed to expand our student exchange programs with the goal of 
allowing hundreds and eventually thousands of soviet and american 
high school students to study in each others classrooms for our 
future relations academic cultural and other exchanges are of 
greater importance 
turning to regional issues mr gorbachev and i agreed that 
there must be peaceful solutions to these conflicts our goal is to 
advance independence security and freedom the soviet decision to 
withdraw from afghanistan is significant and we agree that 
building on the afghan settlement leads to an approach to other 
regional problems our discussions also dealt with cambodia 
angola ethiopia the middle east and the persian gulf and central 
america 
each of our summit meetings moved us farther toward an inf 
treaty capped by todays exchange of ratification instruments 
which now makes it a reality each meeting has also moved us 
farther toward meeting the even greater challenge of crafting a 
treaty to reduce our strategic nuclear arsenals 
in geneva the general secretary and i agreed on the concept of 
50 percent reductions and in reykjavik on numerical limits for 
warheads and delivery vehicles in washington on intensive work to 
complete a start treaty including comprehensive verification 
provisions building upon those in inf here in moscow weve made 
important additional strides toward that objective 
verification is one of the most important and most difficult 
issues for us and im pleased to report progress in this area 
too weve moved forward in other areas as well including 
agreements on an experiment to improve the verification of existing 
nuclear testing treaties and notification of strategic ballistic 
missile launches 
finally let me say how deeply moving i have found my 
discussions with various citizens of the soviet union the monks of 
danilov the dissidents and refuseniks the writers and artists 
the students and young people have shown once again that spiritual 
values are cherished in this nation its my fervent hope that 
those values will attain even fuller expression

q mr president i know you touched on this but in your first 
news conference in 1981 you said that the soviets lie and cheat to 
pursue their ends of world domination what has really changed your 
mind can the american people really trust the russians now 
a well helen that was the first press conference that i had 
held since being elected president and the question that came to me 
was could we believe the russians or would they lie to us and my 
answer at that time was not expressing my opinion i said i will 
answer that with their own words and then i cited some of the 
leaders of the communist movement in the soviet union that said 
that the only immorality was anything that slowed the growth of 
socialism and that there was no immorality in lying or cheating or 
doing anything of that kind as long as it advanced the cause of 
socialism now that was my answer so it wasnt my opinion i was 
quoting what their leaders themselves the beginners of that 
particular system had said 
q do you still think that 
a i think right now of course as ive said trust but 
verify but i think that there is quite a difference today in the 
leadership and in the relationship between our two countries and 
we have held very productive meetings that i think were productive 
for both sides 
q on the start treaty what are the areas of progress and what 
was the specific progress that you achieved here and why do you 
think that you can conclude the treaty this year when senate 
leaders are urging you to go slow and this summit with all its 
momentum wasnt able to break the impasse 
a well the senate leaders themselves brought the ratification 
papers here that we just received today on the inf treaty it meant 
changing their own schedules a great deal and speeding up the 
ratification process i think that we can count on them to feel the 
same if we are coming to final agreement on a start treaty but i 
want to remind you of one thing that weve said over and over 
again the start treaty is infinitely more complex than the inf 
treaty and therefore theres going to be continued negotiation on 
a number of points and then it will depend on the senate once if 
we have agreed upon a treaty it is their responsibility to 
thoroughly study that treaty and then issue ratification of it if 
they find it satisfactory 
we can hope i would hope that before the year is out that we 
could eliminate the differences that still exist but if not i 
would hope that my successor would continue because here we are 
getting at i think the most important reduction that should take 
place in nuclear weapons the most destabilizing are the 
intercontinental ballistic missiles in which someone pushes a 
button and minutes later a part of the earth blows up and thats 
why and the thing that i expressed my hope about is that not only 
have we said 50 percent but in that first meeting in geneva the 
general secretary proposed the idea also of reducing by half our 
nuclear missiles 
q could you go over the areas of progresss on start that you 
achieved here 
a no i dont think that i should go on the conversations are 
still going on and there are things still being discussed and as i 
say progress has been made or we wouldnt still be talking the way 
we are 
theres a young lady in the back that i think is native to the 
scene 
q mr president is there something in sovietamerican 
relations that you would advise your successor to leave behind and 
is there something that you would specially advise to take to the 
future 
a yes if these negotiations and so forth are still going on i 
will do everything i can to persuade my successor to follow up and 
to continue and as a matter of fact i think ill tell him that 
he will find the russian people most warm and hospitable and 
friendly

remains dug up this week are those of the green 
river killers 40th victim but the commander of the search for the 
nations worst known serial killer says its unlikely the find will 
lead to a breakthrough in the sixyearold case 
the bones and skull of debra lorraine estes a runaway who long 
had been feared a victim of the killer were identified tuesday 
through dental records 
in addition to the 40 women known dead eight missing women are 
listed as probable victims of the killer who frequently dumped 
bodies in clusters in woods east and south of seattle 
ms estes who was 15 when she vanished nearly six years ago 
had been on the missing list until her remains were found monday by 
workers digging post holes at a new apartment complex in federal 
way a town between seattle and tacoma said king county police 
sgt steve davis 
like everything else that comes up this answers one question 
and poses 100 more said capt robert evans commander of the 
king county police green river task force 
he said it was unlikely the discovery would yield any 
breakthroughsoviet society how do you feel about the fact that 
they have kept dossiers on these dissidents with whom youve met 
and doesnt that contradict your view that there have been 
improvements here and that this is a more open society under mr 
gorbachev 
a well no the figures themselves reveal that improvements 
have been made some 300 people have been freed from imprisonment 
a number of people the lists that we bring are names that have 
been brought to our attention by relatives or friends their own 
relatives for example living in our country now and i have brought 
those names to the general secretary and explained the personal 
interest that we have in them and a great many of them have since 
been allowed to come to our country or to other countries that they 
preferred such as israel and so i think that there has been a 
sizeable improvement and we still are going to continue doing that 
q the very people with whom you met have now been investigated 
by soviet authorities and might be subject to some form of 
retaliation mr gorbachev said today that you no longer feel that 
this is the evil empire that you told him that within the kremlin 
walls doesnt this contradict your new feeling of optimism about 
the soviet union 
a no because as i say he has received the latest list that i 
brought here and previous experiences with this a great many of 
those people have people have been allowed to come to our country 
q yesterday you did say you no longer believe the soviet union 
is an evil empire you said that was another time another era 
whats changed is it just mr gorbachevs succession to the 
general secretaryship or have you yourself changed or expanded 
your view of the soviet union 
a no i think that a great deal of it is due to the general 
secretary who i have found different than previous soviet leaders 
have been but that also as we have pursued this we have found them 
willing to enter into negotiations with us and i think that enough 
progress has been made that we can look with optimism on future 
negotiations 
q is there anything that you have learned that you personally 
have expanded or changed your views because youve had an 
opportunity to learn more about this country and about their system 
or is it just gorbachev 
a well a large part of it is mr gorbachev as a leader and i 
think there have been changes here as they have sought to make 
well i read perestroika and i found much in it that i could 
agree with 
q mr gorbachev said that he thought you could have achieved 
more in this summit specifically he went on to say that on the 
issue of the abm interpretation and treaty he said that you had 
gone back on your word that in geneva you had agreed that you 
would no longer seek military superiority and that by holding to 
the development of sdi you were seeking superiority in outer space 
and that therefore you had gone back on your word are you seeking 
superiority in outer space can you reach a start agreement without 
some accomodation on sdi and the start question 
a sdi in my mind maybe some of my people wouldnt agree with 
me but the whole thing was my idea to see if there could not be 
developed a defensive weapon that would make it virtually 
impossible for nuclear missiles to get through to their targets in 
another country and from the very beginning i have said that if 
and when such a system can be developed i would support the idea of 
making it available worldwide because since we all know how to 
make nuclear missiles sometime there could be a madman come along 
as a hitler came along who could then make those missiles 
but that my idea would be the sharing of the knowledge of sdi as 
a defensive weapon would be accompanied by the total elimination of 
nuclear weapons and i happen to believe that this will be a lot 
better world if we get rid of all the nuclear weapons and that is 
what my dream of sdi is that it can be the tool by which we 
eliminate those weapons 
q gorbachev said today that he did not believe its for 
defensive purposes you failed to convince him despite the fact 
that youre on such good terms with him 
a i know he has said that before well maybe he just doesnt 
know me well enough but from the very first i have said that that 
is my goal for that defensive weapon there is nothing offensive 
about it it cannot hurt or kill anyone it can just make it 
impossible for missiles to get through the screen

q about this effort you again stated today to try to get a 
start treaty before you leave office you have less than eight 
months left in office mikhail gorbachev could have 10 years by 
setting up any kind of deadline no matter how unofficial arent 
you putting all the pressure on the us side 
a oh no no we set no deadline i said we are going to 
continue working toward that and i could hope that maybe in that 
period of time but no i am dead set against deadlines you dont 
make a treaty just to simply have it be achieved at a certain point 
in time the treaty is ready when it is a good treaty and good for 
all sides involved and thats what well do instead of setting a 
deadline and then saying well lets sign it because weve 
reached the deadline it has to be good 
q to prevent ussoviet relations from being mixed up in 
politics are you willing to rule out a summit until the 
presidential campaign is over in november 
a id make any decision of that kind based on how i thought it 
could affect the situation if it gave a promise of success then 
go for it 
q why do you favor repeal on twoterm limit on us presidents 
when gorbachev is promoting the idea of limited terms for the 
soviet union 
a i would hesitate to comment on that this system of 
government here you do not have a national election in which all 
of the people vote to see who would be the leader my objection to 
the constitutional amendment that was passed in our country 
limiting a president to two terms was the fact that that is the 
only office in the united states in which all the people vote for 
the candidates for that office and it seems to me that it is an 
infringement on the rights of our people in a democracy to tell 
them that they cant vote for someone because of a time limit i 
think it impinges on their right to vote for whoever they want to 
vote for for as many times as they want to vote for them that is 
the principle of democracy 
q you talked a lot about how it is a positive thing for 
students from both countries to mix and mingle do you think 
part of your positive feeling about the soviet union these days 
comes as a result of greater tolerance youve developed as a result 
of your meetings with mr gorbachev 
a well i have found that mr gorbachev and i i think have a 
very satisfactory relationship but at the same time i am never 
going to relax my belief in the need for verification of agreements 
that we might make im quite sure that he feels the same way 
q in your first meeting with mr gorbachev he suggested the 
reduction of halfamillion military personnel but there was no 
followup 
a no this proposal this was just a suggestion made of the 
removal of a halfamillion men on the nato line on the european 
front this has to be considered we think that we are coming to a 
point and that he himself is willing to of reductions in 
conventional weapons along that front and conventional forces as 
well as the nuclear forces but the simple removing of a 
halfamillion men would not be exactly equal because his military 
would be moved a short distance back away from the front well 
theres a 3000mile ocean between where our men would have to be 
moved and in the event of an emergency wed have an ocean to cross 
to get our men back there and equal so that has to be considered 
q regarding your comments on human rights gorbachev said he 
i did not have a lot of admiration for that part of the trip 
did he say anything to you specifically about the meeting with 
dissidents or your remarks at danilov monastery or the remarks 
yesterday at the writers union 
a no but i do know that he and others have had a feeling that 
in some way our concern with this is interfering in your internal 
government policies i have explained to him and i think maybe he 
has seen the point our countrys very unique all of us either by 
ourselves or through our ancestors or our grandparents or parents 
came from someplace else were about the only nation in the world 
that can say that as a matter of fact the estimate is that one 
out of eight americans trace their parentage and their heritage if 
not their own emigration to the eastern bloc i have put it this 
way that you dont stop loving your mother because youve taken 
unto yourself a wife so the people in america do have a feeling 
for the countries of their heritage 
in my case it was a greatgrandfather on one side and a 
grandmother and grandfather on my mothers side well americans 
retain that feeling of friendship and loyalty to the countries 
that as i say were are their heritage and so when we feel that 
people are being unjustly treated imprisoned for something that in 
our country would not be a crime calling for such a sentence our 
people get aroused and they come to us and they want help they 
want something done 
a wife whos been waiting for eight years for her husband to be 
allowed to leave this country to join her things of this kind we 
dont think are really interfering with someone elses business we 
think its very much our business to bring it to the attention 
where we feel that theres an injustice to the government and i 
have explained this to the general secretary and i think mhe has 
seen the justice of what ive said because many of the individuals 
that weve brought to his attention have now been released from 
confinement here and have been allowed to emigrate come to other 
countries to our country

an exercise program in the works for 
endangered sea turtles wont have them racing hares but may help 
them dodge sharks scientists say 
scientists at the national marine fisheries service are 
developing a regimen for the more than 1000 kemps ridley turtles 
raised in captivity each year and released into the gulf of mexico 
in an effort to save them from extinction 
in captivity the turtles are too aggressive to be placed 
together in a tank and have to live in onegallon plastic milk 
cartons or other small containers in larger tanks said tim 
fontaine manager of the federally funded program to save the 
turtles 
the turtles get virtually no exercise fontaine said about the 
most they can do is flap inside their containers as a result they 
may not be as expert as they could be at dodging predators once 
they are released into the gulf fontaine said 
scientists fear that the more than 13500 ridleys already 
released into the gulf have been too vulnerable to their no 1 
enemy the shark 
fontaine working with charles caillouet chief of the life 
studies division for the fisheries service has developed an 
exercise system that involves pumping water through the tanks to 
create a current the turtles can swim against 
the flow would be continuous during daylight hours except 
during feeding periods fontaine said there would be no current at 
night 
the program is being tested with 120 hatchlings that will be 
nine to 11 months old at the end of the experiment sixty turtles 
will be tested in the exercise environment and 60 will be in 
regular tanks 
the turtles stress hormone levels will be checked periodically 
fontaine said if we find that it is causing too much stress 
then well have to try some other approaches he said

q gorbachev said he proposed a draft statement using the words 
peaceful coexistence and your first response was i like it 
but after meeting with aides you changed your mind why 
a well i liked the whole tone the general tone of it and 
what it was seeking to achieve was what we were both seeking to 
achieve but i said at the same time i would take it to our people 
and i took it there and they studied it and saw where there could 
have been certain ambiguities in there that would not achieve the 
general thought of what was bring proposed we were in agreement 
with the general thought so some rewriting was done by our own 
people and when the total statement is released to you i think you 
will find that we have achieved what it was he had with the 
paragraph that he proposed and it has been achieved and improved 
to the point that it is clear and unmistakable that it achieves 
the purpose that he had in mind 
q whats the substitute the better term your aides have 
advised you to use 
a no peaceful coexistence both pieces achieved the same end 
but the other one had ambiguities in it and i dont think it was 
intentional but they could have been used to justify doing 
something else that was not in keeping with the entire goal of the 
statement here 
q do you believe that essentially it is just bureaucratic 
lethargy that has caused emigration problems in the soviet union 
a im afraid that i have to confess to you that i think one of 
the sins of government and one with which we must deal and never 
have been able to be completely successful with and this includes 
our own government is that the bureaucracy once created has one 
fundamental rule above all others preserve the bureaucracy and i 
think that governments will always find that they are having to 
check on bureaucracy and make sure that it is not abiding by its 
own rules and taking the easiest course and so i wouldnt picking 
sic on one government other than another 
q gorbachev said he did not find your arguments on human rights 
in the united states convincing 
a i think that there is a mistaken view and oh how i yearn to 
have him come to our country for long enough to see some of our 
country i think theres a mistaken view about the things that 
occasionally dominate the press about prejudice racial or 
religious in our country about people the socalled street 
people that apparently have no place to live and i think these 
problems these are socioeconomic problems in our land we have 
them of course we also try to deal with them but i dont think 
he quite could understand a recent situation a young lady living 
on the sidewalks of new york living out there on the sidewalk 
winter and summer and so for her own sake the police picked her 
up to bring her to where she could be placed in a shelter and she 
took her case to court and won her case in court that she should be 
allowed to go back and sleep on the sidewalk where she had been 
because thats what she preferred to do well when you have a free 
country how far can we go in impinging on the freedom of someone 
who says this is the way i want to live i think we could 
straighten him out if he saw what we did in our country 
q in this room on monday you heard moving stories of people who 
had been in prison dissidents religious people and then you went 
to moscow state university and then you wrote it off to 
bureacuracy is that really your view that it is only the 
bureaucracy it is not a willful policy of the government here to 
keep these people from emigrating 
a no i cant say that it is when i dont know that much about 
the system but the question was presented to me on the basis that 
it possibly was a bureaucratic bungle maybe i should illustrate to 
you why i feel the way i do about bureaucracies 
once during the war i happened to be involved in a situation in 
which one level of the military wanted a warehouse full of filing 
cabinets wanted permission to destroy the files so they could use 
those filing cases and they were able to prove that the documents 
had no historic value they had no bearing on present day 
government at all they were just useless 
and so the message went up through the ranks requesting 
permission to destroy these obsolete files and then back down 
through the ranks from the top command endorsed by each level of 
command came the reply permission granted provided copies 
were made of each file destroyed 
q dont you think youre letting mr gorbachev off a little 
easy on just saying its bureaucracy 
a no as i said i dont the way the question was framed i 
thought there was a possibility of that no but i just have to 
believe that in any government some of us do find ourselves bound 
in by bureaucracy and then sometimes you have to stomp your foot 
and say unmistakably i want it done and then maybe you get through 
with it but i have great confidence in his ability to do that 
q you said if there was progress toward a start treaty you 
would be willing to come together a fifth time have you made 
enough progress that you now think a start treaty is likely within 
your term 
a i honestly cannot answer that i dont know let me just give 
you what the mechanics are our people have been steadily in 
geneva both sides soviet people and our people both sides 
working on this treaty knowing what we hope to achieve and 
theyre working there and as i say theyve made progress there 
is no way to judge and there is no way that i would give them a 
date and say please you have to get this by such and such a 
time because thats not the way to get a good treaty i want a 
good treaty 
q is the only condition under which you would have a fifth 
summit with gorbachev if there was a good start treaty ready to be 
signed 
a well you cant rule out something else might come up that 
necessitates our getting together and settling something other than 
that particular treaty so no one can say no there will be no 
need for a summit 
q what have you learned in your first trip to moscow 
a im going to do one answer because ive wanted to say this 
and i say it every time i get a chance i think that one of the 
most wonderful forces for stability and good that i have seen in 
the soviet union are the russian women

president reagan muted his longstanding criticism 
of the soviet leadership today and said emigration barriers may 
arise from a kremlin bound in by bureaucracy rather than 
willful soviet policy 
at a summit windup news conference the president avoided any 
direct criticism of his host soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
and said kremlin officials believe that raising questions about 
emigration constituted interfering in internal matters 
reagan also held out hope that an agreement on sharp slashes in 
the superpowers nuclear arsenals still could be achieved before he 
leaves office but said he he was dead set against deadlines 
but his comments on arms control were overshadowed by his 
suggestion that soviet leaders should not be personally blamed for 
the restrictions which put soviet citizens in labor camps and keep 
thousands of jews and other russians from leaving 
i just have to believe that in any government some of us do 
find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy reagan said 
he said in such instances a leader must stomp his feet and 
demand that wrongs be set right and he suggested he thought 
gorbachev was doing that 
i have great confidence in his ability to do that reagan 
said noting that gorbachev has been responsive when reagan gave 
him lists of hardship cases 
the president was asked by an american reporter whether he felt 
he was letting mr gorbachev off a little easy on just saying 
its bureaucracy that bars russians from leaving 
the question grew out of reagans reply to a student at moscow 
state university on tuesday about dissidents and refuseniks those 
who have been denied visas and often lose their jobs or are 
otherwise punished merely for seeking permission to leave 
im not blaming you im blaming bureaucracy reagan told 
the student we have the same type of thing happen in our 
country 
on other issues reagan 
expressed optimism that the united states and soviet union 
could come to terms on a treaty to reduce their arsenals of 
strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent 
the conversation are still going on and they are still being 
discussed and i say progress is still being made or we wouldnt be 
talking as we are he said 
refused to commit himself to a fifth summit with gorbachev but 
did not rule out the possibility of one even without a start 
agreement to sign 
said he and gorbachev have a very satisfactory relationship 
but at the same time i am never going to relax my belief in the 
need for verification of agreements that we might make 
maintained that his disavowal of his earlier characterization 
of the soviet union as an evil empire results from changes 
instituted by gorbachev 
i read perestroika and i found much in it that i agreed 
with reagan said perestroika meaning restructuring is the 
title of a book by gorbachev 
but it was his remark about soviet bureaucracy that raised the 
most pointed question 
in this room on monday the reporter said you heard 
moving stories of people who had been in prison dissidents 
religious people and then you went to moscow state university and 
then you wrote it off to bureacuracy is that really your view that 
it is only the bureaucracy it is not a willful policy of the 
government here to keep these people from emigrating 
in response reagan said the the question had been presented 
to me on the basis that it possibly was a bureaucratic bungle 
actually the students question had been why had reagan invited 
only refuseniks and dissidents to meet with him the previous day 
throughout the summit the president has softpedaled his 
customary attacks of the communist system 
he was reminded that at his first news conference in the white 
house in 1981 he said that communist leaders are willing to lie and 
cheat in pursuit of world domination 
asked if that was still his view he said in 1981 he had merely 
been quoting what communist leaders themselves had said using the 
russian words he said with a smile that his policy remains 
trust but verify 
he said he has found gorbachev different than previous soviet 
leaders and that we can look with optimism to future 
negotiations to reduce strategic arms 
reagan met with reporters shortly after gorbachev at the first 
news conference he had ever held in the soviet union noted with 
pleasure that reagan had retracted his characterization of this 
country as an evil empire 
reagan said gorbachev and other soviet leaders have had a 
feeling that in some way american concern with human rights 
conditions in the soviet union constitute interfering in your 
interal government policies 
asked about prospects from agreement on start in his term he 
said i honestly cannot answer that i dont know 
he said negotiators are continuing working in geneva on the 
difficult issues involved but there is no way that i would give 
them a date for completion because that is not the wqay to get 
a good treaty

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said today that 
ousted moscow communist party chief boris yeltsin will be asked to 
account for an interview with western news organizations in which 
he criticized a member of the ruling politburo 
in an unprecedented public airing of highlevel kremlin 
disputes gorbachev also denied reports of a rift between himself 
and yegor ligachev 67 the partys theoretician and no 2 figure 
in the politburo 
gorbachev answered reporters questions at a news conference 
broadcast live from the soviet foreign ministry at the close of 
his summit talks with president reagan it was the first time that 
a soviet leader had held a news conference in moscow 
yeltsin told cbstv and the british broadcasting corp in 
interviews broadcast monday that ligachev was blocking reforms and 
should resign yeltsin said on abctv today that he had been 
misquoted in the bbc interview 
gorbachev said yeltsins position is at variance with that of 
the central committee to which yeltsin still belongs 
we at the central committee will demand from comrade yeltsin 
explanations as to what it is all about and what he is after 
gorbachev said 
yeltsin 57 was ousted as moscow party boss in november and 
from the politburo in february after he made an angry speech before 
the central committee which has more than 300 members and meets 
several times a year to vote on party policy 
gorbachev denied yeltsins charge that ligachev was blocking 
reform and sought to quell rumors of friction between himself and 
ligachev who is widely believed to be leading a conservative 
faction on the ruling politburo 
as for comrade ligachev and his resignation no such problem 
exists either in the central committee or in the polituro that is 
all that is what you should proceed from and that is the way it 
will be gorbachev said emphatically 
in his interviews broadcast monday yeltsin said ligachev should 
step down because processes in the party are too slow because 
the party is still lagging behind because the process of 
democratization is not developing and comrade ligachev is the 
main person responsible 
in an interview taped tuesday and broadcast today on abcs 
good morning america show about the time that gorbachev was 
answering reporters questions yeltsin said the transcript of his 
bbc interview was an outright fabrication 
he said there was absolutely no talk of resignation 
whatsoever and he denied telling the bbc interviewer that he was 
upset with gorbachev 
also apart from politically being well outright fabrication 
i would say this is not the first time theyve let me down from 
purely a human standpoint yeltsin said 
gorbachev today offered some details of the central committee 
meeting at which yeltsin gave the speech which led to his ouster 
just as you are asking me questions the statement he made at 
that meeting had not been planned we had an exchange a 
freeforall gorbachev said 
the soviet leader said that besides yeltsin 27 committee 
members spoke the opinion of all 27 speakers was that the 
generalizations made by comrade yeltsin regarding the central 
committee its secretariat and the politburo were wrong and his 
statement was recognized as being politically erroneous he said 
soviet officials have refused to release the text of yeltsins 
speech citing communist party tradition and rules 
in his earlier interviews yeltsin denied the authenticity of 
versions of the speech that circulated in moscow but confirmed he 
had urged that the reforms be accelerated 
gorbachev said he had not read the yeltsin interviews 
i have asked for the exact wording of what comrade yeltsin has 
said gorbachev told reporters 
in the abc interview broadcast today yeltsin said those who are 
opposing and trying to slow down gorbachevs policy of perestroika 
or economic restructuring are unorganized 
since each of them is going it alone then of course its just 
a group of people which no matter how you try to estimate its 
numbers is not organized he said 
that is its not the kind of organized opposition who has its 
own program or is an organized kind of opposition to perestroika 
or its thesis or anything like that yeltsin said 
even if gorbachevs reforms fail the chances are very good 
that he will remain in power yeltsin said 
there are great difficulties in perestroika he said 
perestroika also has a moral side peoples spirit their 
culture the renewal of society the revolutionary overhaul of 
society are these really things that can happen in one two or 
even three years 
said yeltsin it wont be our generation which will complete 
perestroika thats my opinion 
feodor burlatsky a former central committee member and now a 
commentator for the weekly literaturnaya gazeta told reporters 
tuesday that if ligachev were a true foe of gorbachevs economic 
and social reforms he would face severe punishment 
if ligachev has his own views it is only natural it is 
another thing to lead some conservatives and i think this is not a 
fact burlatsky said if such a person appears on the political 
scene he would be out of the leadership 
alexei arbatov deputy director of the institute for 
international economy and international relations said in an 
interview he did not agree with yeltsin that ligachev is blocking 
reform 
arbatovs father georgy a central committee member and head of 
the institute for the study of the usa and canada told 
reporters that in our point of view i dont think it was too 
correct of yeltsin to use the western news media to mount his 
attack

a government minister today called for 
international action to reduce pollution in the north sea and 
baltic sea after thousands of fish and hundreds of seals were 
reported dead along their shores 
environment minister klaus toepfer told a special parliament 
committee meeting that action to reduce the dumping of wastes was 
needed because of strong suspicions it threatened sea life 
during the meeting the opposition greens party demanded the 
government immediately ban ships from getting rid of chemical and 
other wastes at sea 
about 50 dead seals have been found on west german shorelines in 
the past month while about 300 have been discovered along 
denmarks coasts toepfer said 
he said biologists checking the dead seals discovered they were 
suffering from a virus that caused their deaths experts last 
weekend said pneumonia was the final cause of death 
thousands of tons of fish meanwhile died from a blanket of 
yellow sea algae in the north sea toepfer said 
the algae up to 10 feet thick in some places spread from the 
coasts of norway and sweden and now threatens denmark danish 
officials said 
west german reports have said the fish were dying from slime 
from the algae which coated their gills and prevented them from 
breathing 
experts blamed nitrates from agricultural fertilizers and 
phosphorus from sewage and industrial pollution for the dramatic 
growth of the algae 
in norway fish farmers were advised to kill their fish resort 
owners in western denmark fear news of the algae may ruin the 
summer tourist season

a hospital here is testing a new briefcasesize 
device that allows doctors to save some heart attack victims no 
matter where they are by activating a lifesaving jolt of 
electricity via a telephone hookup 
jewish hospital will use the portable mdphone transtelephonic 
defibrillator on a trial basis for nine months to a year hospital 
officials said tuesday 
the electronic device could free certain patients from long 
hospital stays said dr rodolphe ruffy director of arrhythmia 
services at the hospital 
the mdphone allows heart patients to stay at home while 
retaining immediate access to the treatment base station at the 
hospital he said 
when a patient or another person opens the unit which can be 
plugged into a standard phone jack the hospital base stations 
phone number is automatically dialed and medical personnel can give 
directions over the phone 
upon application of adhesive electrode pads to the patients 
chest doctors at the hospital can monitor the patients 
electrocardiogram on a computer screen at the base station the 
patients history can also be called up 
the doctor then can if necessary activate the defibrillator to 
try to restore a normal heart beat by administering an electric 
shock ruffy said 
the mdphone is the first interactive medical system capable of 
treating lifethreatening arrhythmias irregular heartbeat by 
telephone said s eric wachtel president of medphone corp of 
paramus nj which developed the device 
if treatment is not administered within four to six minutes 
after the onset of fibrillation brain damage is likely to occur 
he said our tests have proven that the mdphone makes it possible 
for patients to be diagnosed and defibrillated at the scene of the 
emergency within two minutes of the onset of symptoms considerably 
faster than ambulance response time 
ruffy said the agreement with medphone corp calls for a fully 
operational 24hour emergency response system at jewish hospital 
within about a month he said the hospital would then begin to 
recruit candidates for the service 
ruffy said that eventually a network of hospitals would have the 
system and that any of them could treat a patient 
mdphone already has been tested on about 100 patients at various 
hospitals and has been approved by the food and drug 
administration ruffy said

on tuesday secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said the 
united nations can help the world disarm by monitoring and 
verifying arms control agreements between the superpowers and other 
countries 
the un leader said that the international body could make a 
significant contribution to disarmament pacts in ways 
agreeable to the parties concerned 
speaking at the opening of the special session perez de cuellar 
said un military observers and peacekeepers could help monitor 
and verify arms agreements 
he said world military spending totals about 1 trillion a year 
while the annual un budget is only about 721 million and about 
700 million is outstanding in unpaid contributions by member 
states 
the united states owes more than 200 million withheld because 
of us fiscal constraints and disagreements with united nations 
policies 
the fourweek disarmament session moved into high gear today 
takeshita was among about 25 heads of state and government slated 
to address the 159member body during the session 
many members such as iran and iraq israel and its arab 
neighbors greece and turkey india and pakistan are feuding or 
engaged in regional arms races 
speakers will include takeshita and president raul alfonsin of 
argentina today and in the course of debate prime minister rajiv 
gandhi of india president mohammad zia ulhaq of pakistan afghan 
leader najib and others 
the current assembly is the third special session on disarmament 
in 10 years and diplomats say numerous issues separate the united 
states and its allies from the soviet union socialist countries 
and the developing world 
no breakthroughs are expected and many diplomats are seeking to 
avoid confrontation and unproductive criticism of the united states 
differences between the superpowers include priorities for 
nuclear and conventional disarmament the urgency of a swift total 
and comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty the united states 
insistence on developing a spacebased missile defense system the 
issue of diverting military spending to development and other 
issues 
lynne m hansen the assistant director of the us arms control 
and disarmament agency said that the united states will continue 
testing nuclear weapons because the concept of deterrence 
undergirds our security 
soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir f petrovsky condemned 
the ongoing us tests and washingtons concept of nuclear 
deterrence not only because of its lack of practical usefulness 
but because of the immoral nature of this kind of deterrence

of its aircraft was endangered by a small plane flying in 
restricted airspace but a federal official says he has only the 
copilots word as evidence 
according to the airline the close call occurred monday at

international airport the destination of flight 283 from boston 
the dc9 was carrying 79 people 
the copilot told continental officials he had finished making 
some notes looked up and saw a small aircraft coming right at 
us said airline spokesman bruce e hicks 
the pilot swerved to avoid the plane a flight attendant hurled 
to the floor suffered bruises 
hicks said the copilot whom he refused to identify described 
the small plane as a piper aztec or seminole 
the first officer copilot the captain vice president of 
flight operations and president of continental are all 
dumbfounded that there is apparently a question as to the details 
of the incident hicks said tuesday 
the federal aviation administration and the national 
transportation safety board are investigating the airlines report 
but an faa official said we cant even confirm there were two 
planes 
dennis ragle air traffic control manager for the faa at 
hopkins said there is no tangible evidence there was another 
plane other than what the copilot said the only thing we 
really have is that a continental copilot said there was a plane 
ragle said that four air traffic controllers were unable to spot 
the second plane on radar after the report he said radar was 
effective at that altitude and that it is not really explainable 
that we dont see the target the second plane 
if there was another airplane it would have been in violation 
of several federal aviation regulations he said 
a continental spokesman ned walker said small planes could be 
missed by radar if they are not using transponders which give 
radar observers specific information

republican robert mcmillan a lawyer who 
lost his only other bid for elective office 24 years ago today 
officially opened his campaign to unseat democratic us sen 
daniel patrick moynihan 
mcmillan 55 emerged only after several prominent republicans 
including us attorney rudolph giuliani and ronald lauder former 
us ambassador to austria refused to challenge the popular 
twoterm senator 
i have been blessed with a wonderful and loving family i live 
in a beautiful home and i have been successful in business 
mcmillan said in a statement now it is time to pay back the 
american system that has been so good to me 
mcmillan conceded that he faces an uphill battle against 
moynihan but said he has one thing in my favor the issues 
for too long the democratic senator from new york has chosen 
to ignore the problems that confront the average family in this 
state he said 
mcmillan pledged to make acid rain day care for working 
families garbage disposal and an antidrug campaign among his top 
domestic policy interests in foreign affairs mcmillan said that 
he would stand behind israel and that the united states should 
battle communism by improving the economies of developing nations 
mcmillan is an attorney in a garden city ny firm his only 
previous attempt at elective office came in 1964 when he was 
easily defeated in a special election for a new york city council 
seat 
mcmillan will be trying to overcome statewide obscurity much in 
the same way fellow republican alfonse damato did when the former 
hempstead town supervisor captured new yorks other senatorial seat 
in 1980 
damatos victory was among the few bright spots in more than a 
decade of often lopsided defeats for republicans seeking statewide 
office in new york where registered democrats outnumber 
republicans by about 1 million 
many times republicans have had trouble just finding candidates

iran is about 
to complete a major new silkworm missile complex in the strait of 
hormuz the top us military commander for the middle east said 
today 
iran despite recent losses in a sea battle with the us navy 
is not out of the game said gen george b crist chief of the 
us central command which has administrative responsibility for 
the region 
the iranians have been very circumspect and careful crist 
said but i dont get any feeling that the iranians have run up a 
white flag or that sort of thing i would not say they have 
given up their thoughts about trying to get to us 
crist said a major silkworm missile complex was under 
construction at kuhestak overlooking the central part of the 
strait of hormuz the gateway to the persian gulf silkworms fired 
from there with a range of 5060 miles would cover the entire 
strait he said 
the fourstar marine general spoke to members of a pentagon news 
media pool aboard the coronado the navys flagship in the gulf 
he said the supersophisticated aegis missile cruiser 
vincennes which arrived in the gulf during last week was deployed 
partly because of the new silkworm facility 
the 9400ton ships longrange air surveillance and weapons 
systems represents a quantum leap forward in our ability to 
handle that threat crist said 
the kuhestak missile site is a fixed installation as opposed to 
the mobile launcher used by iran in the past it could be 
operational by late summer he said 
iran was suspected of having mobile silkworm sites in the faw 
peninsula in the northern gulf and the strait of hormuz crists 
comments indicated more missiles could be positioned at the new 
site 
the silkworm is a chinese version of the 30yearold soviet styx 
missile subsonic and crude by modern standards it nevertheless 
can be devastating to ships 
on april 18 us forces destroyed two iranian offshore 
platforms sank a patrol boat and crippled two frigates in a series 
of gulf battles

i feel that we have now approached a situation where we should 
note that here too insofar as the hot trouble spots on the 
planet are concerned real possibilities have appeared for solving 
these regional problems for untying unraveling these knots 
these tight knots on the basis of political approaches on the 
basis of a balance of interests 
in substance we have noted today that first there is 
afghanistan then secondly there is the processes concerning the 
middle east there is some joining closer together of positions and 
a maturing of understanding that there is a need to resolve the 
problem on the basis of an international conference 
then there is the problem of campuchia thanks to the 
initiatives taken by viet nam and campuchia of late that problem 
too is now becoming one which can be which does lend itself to 
solutions very soon there are processes under way in latincentral 
america in southern africa solutions are possible 
i have always emphasized and i emphasize this in my 
conversations with the president as with all other americans we 
should not we must not lose our chance and in this connection i 
said outright to the president that the signing of the agreement on 
afghanistan is a precedent which goes far beyond the limits of that 
problem alone because it is the first case first example where 
the united states and the soviet union together with those 
directly involved in the conflict signed an agreement which opens 
up an avenue for a political solution of that problem 
in questions concerning human rights humanitarian issues there 
has been some progress in this sense i posed the question in my 
talks with the president i said there are facts relating to this 
sphere individual cases which do appear weve always been giving 
attentive consideration to them and we shall continue to do so 
the more i think over this situation the more i come to the 
conclusion that i can see that the american administration does not 
have a real understanding of the real situation insofar as human 
rights are concerned they just dont know about the processes in 
the sphere of democracy and democratization in this country 
so i suggested to the president lets organize within the 
framework of interparliamentary exchange a permanent seminar 
which would gather together members of our parliaments 
representatives of political circles public circles and they 
should then exchange information and assessments 
the president somebody asked the president whether he still 
considered the soviet union to be an evil empire he said no 
and he said that within the walls of the kremlin next to the 
czars gun right in the heart of that evil empire we take 
note of that as the ancient greeks say everything flows 
everything changes everything is in a state of flux 
today when we were able to see that you cannot resolve any of 
the worlds problems through military means where we came more 
and more to the conclusion that they have to be resolved 
politically by political means on the basis of a balance of 
interest on the basis of respect for the social choice and 
whether we want to or not we must all learn to live in peace in 
this real world of ours 
and proceeding from the fact that there is an understanding 
in fact that there are lessons which we have drawn from the 
events in the past years we suggested let us then make a 
statement to that effect a joint statement to that effect here 
is the draft that i suggested to the president 
both of us proceeding from an awareness of the obtaining 
realities in the present day world believe that no problems in 
dispute are insoluble and that they should not be resolved by 
military means that peaceful coexistence is something that we 
resolve as a universal principle of international relations and 
that the equality of all states noninterference in domestic 
affairs and freedom of sociopolitical choice should be recognized 
as inalienable and mandatory for all 
i gave the president both the russian and english text he read 
it and he said i like it but when today we met in order to 
finalize the text of the joint statement it turned out that not 
everybody likes it among those who surround the president that 
kind of a statement and thats what we were debating this morning 
 
we were not able either to agree on the subject of talks on 
conventional arms in europe 
now im thinking theres so much talk that we should not move 
forward to 50 percent cuts in strategic arms unless we address 
ourselves to reductions in conventional arms and armaments in 
europe but as soon as we try to suggest some make some real 
proposals in order to get that process under way we immediately 
come up against some kind of incomprehensible maneuvers and 
attempts to deviate from that from the issue when everybody 
voiced concern over the fact that the warsaw treaty supposedly has 
a preponderance we said ok lets exchange data lets exchange 
data the other side immediately tried to dodge the issue 
the americans did not accept our bold plan threephase plan for 
eliminating asymmetry and disbalances in europe aimed at building a 
structure of nonoffensive arms and armed forces with a 
considerably lower level of arms we feel that weve missed a good 
chance to impart some good dynamics both to relations between the 
two most powerful military groups and thereby to promote 
international security as a whole

with george bush looking on a 
republican member of a bipartisan deficitreduction commission said 
today the panel would not be swayed from doing its job by bushs 
declaration that he would oppose any tax increase 
rep bill frenzel rminn said he thought such comments were 
premature 
frenzel who is here at bushs vacation retreat for the second 
of two days of talks on economic issues told reporters we are 
not going to get involved in any presidential campaigns 
bush the allbutcertain republican presidential nominee said 
tuesday that he would ignore what he said was a likely 
recommendation from the national economic commission for a tax 
increase to reduce the budget deficit 
during a picturetaking session today on the porch of the vice 
presidents seaside home frenzel was asked if he felt bushs 
remarks would inhibit his own work on the commission 
i took an oath to work on the commission and to do it well 
frenzel said 
at that point bush interrupted saying i hope the commission 
will listen a little bit to the american people in this election i 
think thats what an election is all about the commission can take 
an objective look at taxes and do whatever it wants but id be 
more persuaded by what americans say 
former deputy treasury secretary richard darman one of a 
halfdozen private economists here for the talks said taxes were 
off the table and nobody has raised it yet 
bush was asked to comment on democratic charges that his call 
for closing the budget deficit with a modified freeze on spending 
and with no new taxes was not realistic 
bush said it is not surprising the democrats would say that 
all they want to do is spend and tax there is no change i can see 
or hear out on the campaign that would lead you to believe anything 
other than that on the democratic side 
one day earlier bush who touts himself as a wouldbe 
education president said local taxes may have to go up if his 
call for better schools is heeded 
they may have to bush said tuesday ninetythree percent 
of the money for education comes from sources other than the 
federal government if its taxes thats where it has to be 
bushs comments came as he repeated his oftstated opposition to 
a federal tax increase 
ive pledged no tax increase and im going to stay with it 
period bush said 
the vice president speaking after meeting with a group of 
private economists also cautioned the federal reserve board 
against clamping down too tightly on credit in the name of fighting 
inflation 
im not hypercritical of the fed but i dont want to see 
action taken thats going to shut down economic growth in this 
country bush said 
the deficitreduction panel formed earlier this year plans to 
submit its recommendations to congress on dec 21 in addition to 
members appointed by the reagan administration and by both parties 
in congress the panel will have two members named by whoever wins 
the election in november 
it seems to me that the commission might well come up with a 
tax increase and ill be saying wait a minute ive taken my 
case to the american people to hold the line on taxes 
bush has proposed eliminating the budget deficit with what he 
calls a flexible freeze on spending all programs except 
social security benefits would be held at 1989 levels plus 
inflation increases in one area would have to be offset by 
decreases in another 
the vice president holds a second day of talks today with the 
same group of economic advisers among them is martin s feldstein 
a harvard economist who quit his job as president reagans chief 
economist in 1985 when his advocacy of a tax increase to reduce the 
budget deficit ran afoul of the administrations stance against 
general tax increases 
bush said that during his meeting tuesday with the economic 
advisers there was an expression of hoping that fed policy would 
not be too tight 
i think watching for signs of inflation is fine bush said 
but as a word of caution i wouldnt want to see them step over 
some boundary that would ratchet down tighten down the economic 
growth 
the nation is in its 65th month of economic expansion a 
peacetime record an economic downturn before the election could 
spell big troubles for republicans election prospects most 
economic and political consultants agree 
the bush campaign has been having some economic problems of its 
own lately a shortage of cash 
two months ago bush aides reported that they only had 4 
million left to spend before the republican convention aide robert 
teeter said tuesday that the amount has now dwindled to just under 
15 million 
the vice president said over the weekend that the squeeze may 
mean some curtailing of campaign travel in the weeks ahead 
the bush campaign has had no trouble raising money but it is 
close to bumping up against the preconvention federal spending 
limit of 27 million 
the campaign has raised 295 million of which about 25 is 
not subject to the ceiling

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
may 28 
lewiston maine journal on the commercialization of memorial 
day 
for too many others the meaning of memorial day has been lost 
in the shuffle of commercial interests 
for them the day means little more than time off from school or 
work it means officially opening up the cottage on the lake and 
having a picnic it means a memorial day sale at the department 
store 
congress while admittedly responding to the call of many 
citizens didnt help preserve the days meaning by deciding in 
1971 to change the observance of memorial day from may 30 to 
the last monday of the month in order to give the citizenry a 
threeday weekend 
the call to war may be the most dreaded anyone can face but 
these men and women were there when their country needed them the 
most 
they served in the interest of forging our freedom in the 
revolutionary war or preserving it in subsequent wars 
for this their memory must never be forsaken

intelligencer journal lancaster pa on the summit 
little of substance is promised in the summit between president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev but it is guaranteed to 
be historic 
not since the days of detente has the future between the two 
superpowers so brimmed with hope 
the future appears bright for a number of reasons beginning 
with the fact that the united states and soviet union are speaking 
to rather than at each other glasnost and perestroika have 
dulled the edge of speeches about an evil empire 
increased dialogue has inevitably led to better understanding 
the three previous summits have shown that as leaders from the two 
superpowers get to know each other their actions and responses are 
more predictable and stable 
so the headline value of this summit may be nil but in terms of 
the future it may lay a solid foundation for further negotiations 
which could lead to a notable cutback in nuclear weapons

strategy for the 1988 presidential race is heading straight for the 
gutter 
the letter written by james jatras of the senate republican 
policy committee concerns massachusetts gov michael dukakis the 
democrats likely nominee 
dukakis isnt attacked for his views of foreign affairs or the 
economy instead the letter smears dukakis for his standing with 
the greek orthodox church branding him an apostate 
the jatras letter accuses the governor of being soft on 
communism and violating orthodox teaching because he supports the 
right to abortion but the chief reason dukakis is not a 
communicant of the church jatras points out is his marriage to a 
jew 
this sort of attack is beneath contempt 
attacking a candidates standing with his church has no place in 
presidential politics its time republicans learned that

the honolulu starbulletin on president reagans veto of the

as its written the trade measure is too protectionist 
perhaps its worst effect would be to reduce the presidents 
discretion in trade policy possibly forcing him to impose 
sanctions on trading partners 
surely the united states can conduct business to its advantage 
without risking trade wars 
its probably too late to work up a more palatable version of 
the bill before the congress adjourns oct 8 
passing a trade bill if that happens will probably be the work

gone 
in the past decade confidence in air travel has been flagging 
to the point where some travelers refuse to book seats on certain 
kinds of planes 
certainly after the aloha airlines problem the elderly 737 
will join those ranks 
maybe its like putting a finger in a dike but surely stricter 
inspection practices should be put in force and tests be conducted 
to determine just how old an airliner can be before it is retired

the brunswick ga news on house speaker jim wright 
the concern voiced over speaker jim wrights alleged breaches of 
house ethics rules is no mere teapot tempest as he would have us 
believe 
though some of his conservative opponents have been muttering 
about this for some time and would love to catch him out the 
dispute cannot be shrugged off as a political vendetta 
any such characterization went out the window when common cause 
which has a solid reputation for probity and often takes a liberal 
stance on public questions called for an ethics committee inquiry 
wrights sour claim that common cause was a handmaiden for 
conservatives out to get him is not credible 
the speakership is a powerful position the person who occupies 
it can do a lot for and against members of the house 
but the ethics committee if formally asked to investigate will 
have an overriding responsibility to do so and if wright is 
blameless an investigation reaching this conclusion would serve 
his interests as well as those of the house and the electorate

have considered 
more and more of the wealthy are realizing the danger of cocaine 
and have stopped using it as a party drug 
the message that cocaine is dangerous and addictive is getting 
through to the middle class but that same message is not making 
it to the inner city 
although it might not be as visible as it once was cocaine 
remains a big problem

states should consider legalizing drugs and treating addiction as a 
health not a crime problem 
then addicts would not have to steal to get drugs they argue 
and the drug traffic with all its corrupting influences would 
fade away 
there is a certain superficial appeal to this argument which 
cites the example of prohibition and the crime connected with it 
but it is a desperate solution that only underlines how 
desperate the drug problem is 
the move to legalize drugs is a wellmeaning but misdirected 
effort

the register of orange county calif on the economy 
seven months ago economic doomsayers said the oct 19 stock 
market crash would plunge the nation into a recession possibly a 
depression it didnt happen 
last week the government revised upward its figures for economic 
growth for the first quarter of this year to 39 percent 
so now guess what the doomsayers are chirping that the economy 
is growing too fast and that the growth will spark a new round of 
inflation and interest hikes 
contrary to the doomsayers predictions we continue to enjoy 
strong economic growth with low inflation because we continue to 
make it easier for companies to produce goods 
unfortunately well be lucky just to maintain the status quo 
protectionism which induces distortions that actually hurt our 
companies in the end is in the air next year will probably being 
higher taxes no matter who is elected president and the federal 
reserve itself spooked by the doomsayers inflation scare has 
begun tightening the money supply 
this in turn may dampen growth and could even give us a 
recession 
when will americans realize that government is the cause of our 
economic problems not their solution

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis said today that of 
course rival candidate jesse jackson deserves consideration for 
the no 2 spot but added that hes not ready to make a choice with 
the last batch of primaries coming up next tuesday 
republican george bush meanwhile looked on outside his maine 
summer home as a gop member of a bipartisan deficitreduction 
commission said the panel would not be swayed from doing its job by 
bushs declaration that he would oppose any tax increase 
rep bill frenzel rminn said he thought such comments which 
bush reiterated one day earlier were premature 
bush retorted i hope the commission will listen a little bit 
to the american people in this election i think thats what an 
election is all about the commission can take an objective look at 
taxes and do whatever it wants but id be more persuaded by what 
americans say 
frenzel was among a group of economists and others meeting with 
bush tuesday and today 
dukakis in boston called for expanded college opportunities 
for americans and proposed a new national student loan program that 
would rely on payroll deductions for repayment 
after the speech dukakis said that of course jackson 
deserved consideration for the vice presidency but he answered 
with a blunt no when asked if jackson deserved special 
consideration because of his success during this years primary 
elections 
hes somebody whos done a remarkable job has great gifts and 
great strengths dukakis said when asked if jackson was qualified 
for a spot on the ticket i respect and admire him a lot 
dukakis said he had not given any thought to picking a running 
mate and would not do so until after the final primaries june 7 
the biggest of those primaries will be in california and both 
dukakis and jackson were flying to that state late today for 
finalweekend campaigning 
jackson with virtually no chance of overtaking dukakis in the 
national delegate race is focusing increasingly on the democratic 
national convention in july and the clout he expects to wield there 
i do not foresee confrontation jackson said tuesday as he 
campaigned in new jersey but he added that his supporters may take 
their issues to the full convention if they feel slighted by party 
platform writers 
theres room to take ones case to the floor jackson said 
he also said he has earned consideration for the no 2 spot 
on the ticket although he wont say whether hes interested in it 
dukakis has been discouraging discussion of possible running 
mates i can tell you i have not spent two minutes of my time on 
the subject he told reporters after a baltimore fundraiser 
tuesday night 
as for any claims jackson might have the frontrunner said 
he himself said he thought it was the nominees responsibility to 
pick a running mate and i agree with that 
jackson is continuing to fire up crowds even as he tacitly 
concedes that his presidential bid is all but finished 
when our hope is alive we push back mountains and remove 
ceilings he told a crowd at a shopping center in willingboro 
nj on tuesday night on our way to the white house there are 
no more impossible dreams 
jackson was campaigning in new jersey this morning then leaving 
for california 
dukakis for his part was mapping out his postprimary 
strategy his aides are indicating hell plunge directly into his 
fall campaign after the final round of primaries on tuesday in 
california new jersey montana and new mexico 
those contests are expected to give the massachusetts governor a 
mathematical lock on the nomination rather than taking a 
traditional preconvention break however the dukakis ampaign will 
hit the road again 
we want to spend a good part of june out there in america 
traveling telling people who mike dukakis is and why he would be a 
good president said dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
the massachusetts governor was spending most of today on state 
business then flying to california tonight for two days of 
campaigning 
bush was still at his summer home in kennebunkport maine where 
he has been holding strategy sessions since last week on tuesday 
he met with economists including martin feldstein the former 
chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers 
bush said after the meeting that he would reject any call for a 
federal tax hike even if one is called for by a blueribbon 
bipartisan commission now working on ways to bring down the 
enormous federal deficit 
ill be saying wait a minute ive taken my case to the 
american people to hold the line on taxes the vice president 
said however he said that in order to carry out his education 
policies local school taxes might have to be raised

is your air conditioning working would you like 
to interview any soviet officials do you need to rent a car how 
can i help 
these are strange words coming from soviet managers who have 
elevated the ways of bureaucracy to a high art and service 
employees whose languor is renowned 
but they were jarred into an unusual degree of efficiency and 
solicitous good manners when president reagan hundreds of us 
government officials and nearly 5000 journalists descended on the 
soviet capital 
the effort at being gracious summit hosts has not been flawless 
but neither has it escaped the approving notice of foreign visitors 
who have known moscow in its more natural state 
a stack of preprinted applications sat on a desk at the foreign 
ministrys press center in the international hotel reporters 
covering the summit could apply in writing for interviews with 
anyone from human rights activists to arms control negotiators 
physicist andrei d sakharov a former human rights activist who 
was released from internal exile in 1986 plans to hold a news 
conference friday at the foreign ministrys request because of 
numerous applications from visiting reporters 
at the rossiya hotel where many journalists are housed cooks 
produced plates of three fried eggs tuesday for breakfast guests 
who had grumbled a morning earlier when the dish was unavailable 
lettuce unknown in the soviet union except for a pale bitter 
facsimile called salat has been served at breakfast lunch and 
dinner 
waitresses who usually slouch in the shadows have been scurrying 
about with fresh linen napkins fire prevention workers patrol the 
halls of the rossiya which sleeps 5500 guests 
moscows ubiquitous police who ordinarily arrest offenders with 
a wave of their whitestriped batons have settled for shrugs and 
tolerant smiles this week when confused american motorists make 
illegal turns 
is everything working to your satisfaction a manager at the 
international hotel inquired during his inspection of a room that 
had rented as summit office space 
its warm in here he said is the air conditioning 
working 
soviet political commentators and social scientists have milled 
around the press center giving and taking interviews and 
volunteering occasionally to serve as interpreters 
the official news agency tass went into full gear for its summit 
coverage 
it published a stream of background articles from the history 
of st catherines hall to the menu for gorbachevs state dinner in 
reagans honor monday night ordinarily information about the 
heavily guarded kremlin or the gorbachevs socializing is treated 
like state secrets 
the city which was spruced up for the summit has been 
unusually well maintained and operating smoothly this week but all 
bets are off once reagan leaves thursday to return home 
the tenacious bureaucracy bends now and then but it has never 
been known to break some state services have continued steadfastly 
in their old inefficient ways of doing things 
intourist the monopoly state travel agency urged those 
traveling to moscow for the summit to hire interpreters and 
chauffeurdriven cars payment was required in advance denying 
customers the chance to reduce or withhold payment for 
unsatisfactory service

japans armed forces did not violate the 
constitution when a slain soldier was made a shinto god against the 
wishes of his christian widow the supreme court ruled wednesday 
yasuko nakaya lost a 15year battle when the nations highest 
court reversed lower court decisions upholding her complaint she 
said the self defense forces had violated her constitutional 
freedom of religion by deifying her husband at a shinto shrine 
her husband 1st lt takafumi nakaya was killed in a traffic 
accident while serving in the ground self defense forces in january 
1968 mrs nakaya then 34 and a member of the united church of 
christ in japan laid her husbands ashes to rest at shinai church 
in yamaguchi he was not a christian 
four years after his death nakaya was enshrined and deified 
his widow filed her suit the next year in 1973 
in her legal action the first individual lawsuit contesting the 
government on an issue involving religion mrs nakaya also sought 
8000 in compensation from the government for her mental anguish 
i have long suspected that the supreme court was an 
institution obsequious to the powerful today im sorry to see 
that the court is mrs nakaya told reporters after the decision 
takako doi leader of the major opposition japan socialist 
party told the same news conference i would call the ruling a 
compromise by the guardian of the constitution made in favor of the 
governments way of thinking 
i feel like were being driven back to the past mrs doi 
said 
mrs nakaya has said she filed the suit to challenge the 
possible revival of the militarism that revolved around japans 
traditional shintoism before and during world war ii 
before 1945 soldiers killed in action or while on duty were 
automatically given the status of gods and their names were 
inscribed in shinto shrines 
the practice was discontinued under the new constitution which 
guarantees freedom of religion and was written under us guidance 
after japans defeat but soldiers killed on duty are sometimes 
enshrined at the request of the association of retired self defense 
forces members called taiyukai 
in its 141 vote wednesday the supreme court said the armed 
forces were not directly involved in the case of lt nakaya and 
that the taiyukai had him enshrined the lower courts had ruled 
that the armed forces had a direct role in the enshrinement 
shintoism is said to have emerged at the dawn of japanese 
history and crystalized as a religious system during the nara 
period in the eighth century 
as the state religion before 1945 it stressed the divinity of 
the emperor and the worship of nature ancestors and ancient 
heroes the military used shinto shrines and ceremonies to promote 
nationalism among the japanese 
the rev mototsugu ogata chief guardian of the gokoku shrine in 
yamaguchi said in a telephone interview lt nakaya is one of a 
total of 52099 enshrined in a big tall sacred mirror at this 
shrine established in 1941 they are mostly those killed in 
world war ii 
like the others nakayas name has been written in a sacred list 
as mikoto takafumi nakaya said the shinto priest mikoto 
is the shinto term for god or deity 
the religion respects several types of deities including 
ancestral gods gods revered for virtues gods revered for their 
works and gods whose wrath is to be feared 
shintoism a religion of ceremony rather than dogma coexists in 
japan with buddhism the other major religion the exact number of 
adherents is not known and many japanese practice both religions 
there are also about 1 million christians among the 122 million 
japanese

rapists killers and robbers were among 
113 rebels who surrendered under an amnesty that guarantees 
immunity from prosecution police said wednesday 
officials said the amnesty was a success and they believe 
virtually all the rebels turned themselves in by the deadline at 
midnight tuesday 
i cannot think of any dissidents still remaining in the 
bush wednesdays harare herald newspaper quoted home minister 
moven mahachi as saying 
mahachi said intelligence estimates were that 100 to 120 rebels 
were at large before president robert mugabe announced the amnesty 
april 19 
among those granted amnesty is morgan sango who was zimbabwes 
most wanted man and called himself gayigusu grind the bush in 
the ndebele language 
sango in his 30s fought as a guerrilla in the sevenyear war 
that transformed the whitegoverned british colony of rhodesia into 
blackgoverned zimbabwe on april 18 1980 
he deserted from the army in 1982 after joshua nkomo the former 
opposition leader was fired from a coalition government for 
allegedly plotting a coup against mugabe 
most of the rebels were loyal to nkomos zimbabwe african 
peoples union patriotic front whose power base is the minority 
ndebele tribe mugabes ruling zimbabwe african national union 
patriotic front is strongest in his dominant shona tribe 
as a dissident gang leader roaming the rolling bush country of 
matabeleland province in western zimbabwe the ndebele homeland 
sango was blamed for a wave of murder robbery and rape 
he is alleged to have led the gang that axed 16 white 
missionaries and family members to death six months ago including 
five children and five women on two pentecostal communal farms 
near bulawayo the matabeleland provincial capital 
like the others who surrendered under the amnesty sango is 
immune from prosecution that almost certainly would have cost him 
his life the government has promised a rehabilitation program to 
ease them bak into society 
mugabe offered the amnesty the first since independence after 
he and nkomo signed an agreement dec 23 to merge their political 
parties 
an amnesty britain offered under a ceasefire before 
independence was accepted by about 50000 guerrillas loyal to 
either nkomo and mugabe some of whom were among the 113 who turned 
themselves in this time 
smelling blood mavovonka led the last gang of 12 men to 
surrender hours before the deadline he told reporters in the nkayi 
district of northern matabeleland 
we went out to the bush because of misunderstandings our 
leaders have now seen that what they were doing was wrong and they 
have corrected their mistakes thats why we are here 
mahachi the home minister said last week the amnesty would not 
be extended and rebels refusing it would be hunted down and killed 
i am sure the amnesty is 100 percent successful he said 
tuesday there may be one or two or three still outstanding the 
problem is that we were not certain of the total number but the 
number which we have received is about what we expected it to be

management locked out 20000 striking 
workers at a hyundai motor co plant wednesday and said there was 
little chance of settling a 3dayold strike for higher wages 
meanwhile at hyundai precision and industry co in changwon 
striking workers freed one of the 11 company executives they took 
hostage friday 
both companies are subsidiaries of the massive hyundai group 
conglomerate 
officials at hyundai motor co south koreas largest carmaker 
said they had no choice but to lock out workers in ulsan on the 
nations southeast coast 
the lockout is inevitable because there are little chances of 
resolving the dispute in a short period of time said one company 
executive who spoke on condition of anonymity 
after two days of work slowdown hyundai motor workers struck on 
monday demanding wage increases of up to 180 a month the company 
offered 105 
the company employs 25000 people including 20000 union 
members who went on strike and 5000 management workers who 
remained at work 
after the lockout on wednesday the carmakers unionized workers 
left the plant and said they would not return at least until 
monday they said they would help farmers with the spring rice 
planting during the period 
hyundai workers earn an average of 610 a month after one year 
750 after five years and 960 after 13 years the company said 
hyundai officials said the strike cost them 186 million a day 
in lost sales about twothirds of the hyundai production are 
intended for exports to the united states canada and other 
countries 
at hyundai precision and industry co in the southern city of 
changwon 2000 striking workers released chairman chung mongku 
he was taken from the plant to a hospital where he was treated for 
high blood presure and exhaustion 
company president yoo kichul and nine other highranking 
officials were still being held by the strikers workers blocked 
all gates to the plant where the 2000 workers produce trains and 
unspecified defense equipment 
hyundai precision workers took the officials hostage to press 
their demand for wage increases of up to 180 a month the company 
offered a 55 increase 
company officials and strikers agreed after 10 hours of talks to 
resume negotiations thursday on calls for higher wages the company 
agreed to give yoo full power to negotiate with the union 
hyundai officials said they would ask the government not to 
bring criminal charges against union members who seized parts of 
the plant and held chung hostage the deal followed a government 
warning that police would be used to rescue the executives 
all 2000 workers at another hyundai precision plant in ulsan 
went on strike on friday to demand higher wages a striker who 
stabbed himself in a suicide attempt tuesday was reported in fair 
condition at a hospital 
ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest used to try and 
shame or discredit superiors such as the government or company 
executives 
in another development justice minister chung haechang on 
wednesday ruled out the possibility of releasing more political 
prisoners in the near future 
the government is not considering taking any extraordinary 
actions to release political offenders chung told reporters 
chung pointed out that the government had already released 1275 
political prisoners under three amnesties since summer 1987 and 
reinstrated the civic rights of 8710 people who were blacklisted 
for political offense 
there are few people who are eligible for amnesty another 
exceptional amnesty would be detrimental to maintaining law and 
order chung said 
the opposition demanded that the government of president roh 
taewoo free all prisoners of conscience as a step toward full 
democracy the opposition recently said there are 560 political 
prisoners it wants released 
government officials said the opposition list includes some 
alleged north korean spies and many who were already set free the 
officials say about 200 political offenders are currently in jail 
serving terms or awaiting trial

jewish emigration from the soviet union reached a 
new sevenyear high in may with 1145 jews allowed to leave the 
agency helping them resettle said wednesday 
may marked the fourth straight month of rising jewish 
emigration bringing the total for 1988 to 4547 soviet jews 
arriving at the vienna austria transit center according to the 
intergovernmental committee for migration 
but the number going to israel has declined with only 97 of the 
may arrivals resettling there committee spokeswoman regina 
boucault said in april 1077 soviet jews emigrated and 162 went 
to israel 
the may figure was the highest since april 1981 when 1155 jews 
left the soviet union 
more than 250000 jews have found new homes since the 
intergovernmental committee for migration resettlement program 
began in 1971 in the early years most proceeded to israel but 
recently the number has declined sharply 
the committee did not include figures for the number of soviet 
jews coming through bucharest rumania shmuel binsky of the public 
council on soviet jewry in jerusalem said 24 jews emigrated through 
bucharest in may 
in jerusalem a soviet jewish activist told the news agency itim 
that the number of soviet jewish emigrants who decided against 
coming to israel reached a record high in may when more than 90 
percent chose to settle elsewhere 
chaim chessler head of the public council for soviet jewry was 
quoted as saying on tuesday that soon no soviet jewish emigrants 
will come to israel unless they are flown via bucharest instead of 
vienna where they are free to immigrate to other western countries 
israeli officials are embarrassed by the high dropout figure 
because of their 20yearlong battle for the right of soviet jews 
to emigrate on the grounds that israel is their homeland 
israeli leaders claim 400000 soviet jews want to settle in 
israel but less than 20 percent of those who leave the soviet 
union actually settle there 
chessler said that of the 1169 jews who left the soviet union 
for vienna and bucharest in may just 110 came to israel a drop of 
nearly 7 percent from april

before concluding my statement let me just share with you one 
general impression and if i did not mention this i would not be 
honest with you or truthful if i omitted to say this it is my 
impression there is a lot of contradictions in the american 
position now let me explain where i see this contrariness on 
the one hand we have a joint statement that there should be no 
war that war is inadmissible we are engaged in a businesslike 
dialogue about arms reductions were talking about preferences for 
political solutions and yet on the other hand we keep hearing 
we heard words about a stake made on strength 
this is to be seen in the economic ties also where an 
authoritative part sections of the american business circles are 
in favor of cooperation but they are faced with intimidation with 
all sorts of restrictions there is indeed a most unfavored nation 
treatment in respect to the soviet union we had a very intense 
discussion with the president yesterday on this subject and i 
asked why should the dead hold onto the coattails of the 
living i mean the jacksonvanik amendment one of thems already 
physically dead the others politically dead why should they 
hang onto our coattails i asked this was the amendment was 
passed in a totally different situation a decade ago but in this 
changed world of ours we should think and base our policies on 
present day realities 
q you mentioned twice in your comments just a few moments ago 
you talked about missing chances and you have also talked about 
politics is the art of the possible so i ask you with this 
administration and its president is it going to be possible to 
have a treaty to have a start strategic arms reduction treaty 
if the americans insist on keeping the sdi strategic defense 
initiative program going 
gorbachev i am sure that there still is a possibility to 
achieve a treaty this year and im reinforced in this optimism by 
the headway we have made moscow and washington have made in this 
past period and also the exchange of views here almost around the 
clock it gives me grounds to voice such an optimistic assessment 
 
q mr general secretary several times in the past few days you 
were asked if there would be a fifth summit conference with 
president reagan possible in the fall and you answered usually 
yes it is possible it is possible but it depends on how things 
go at this meeting now that this meeting is about over do you 
see enough headway progress to warrant a fifth meeting with 
president reagan in the fall 
gorbachev i link the possibility to arrive at a treaty and 
therefore i believe that a fifth meeting is also possible and 
that possibility is still at the very real so the whole thing 
hinges upon that one question 
q the arab countries highly assess your recent words about the 
palestinians who are now waging a courageous struggle against the 
israeli occupiers would you tell me what you achieved in your 
meetings with mr reagan on the palestine issue and on the middle 
east settlement as a whole 
gorbachev there is an understanding among the international 
community and in the security council among its permanent members 
that the solution should be solved along the lines of an 
international conference the content of that conference has not 
yet been determined though 
we cannot decide for the arabs how the palestinians participate 
in the international conference let them decide for themselves 
let the arabs decide what we should do the americans and the 
soviet union we should respect their decision its a vast arab 
world out there and we must recognize israels right to security 
we must recognize the right of the palestinian people to 
selfdetermination in what form let the palestinians with their 
friends the arabs decide on that 
q theres been a wide perception that differences over the 
american sdi program have been one of the major obstacles to a 
start treaty have you made any progress in resolving differences 
over sdi at this summit if so exactly what progress has been 
made and do you still continue to believe that that may be a major 
obstacle in reaching a start treaty 
gorbachev in responding to your last question i say yes i do 
because it means destabilization and it doesnt meet normal logic 
to reduce strategic offensive arms on land and to build a bridge 
for such arms into outer space although the americans say that 
this is a purely defensive weapon we do not think that is 
allegedly the us side is ready to share its secrets with us 
and i said to the president at that time i said permit me mr 
president not to agree with you and to call in question that 
statement of yours why because right now we cant even agree on 
how to verify seabased cruise missiles on two types of vessels 
because youre not ready to agree so how can we rely on your 
divulging all of your secrets concerning sdi thats just not 
serious its beyond the framework of reality

the iraqi army set up iran in april for 
one of its worst military defeats with an elaborate monthlong 
deception campaign of troop movements that demonstrated the growing 
maturity of iraqs forces senior pentagon officials say 
having rapidly recaptured the faw peninsula six weeks ago in an 
operation that succeeded beyond all expectation the iraqis since 
have reclaimed another piece of their occupied territory near the 
southern city of basra with a similar surprise attack the 
officials noted 
the victories mean it now is conceivable that iraq can break the 
stalemate in the 7year war with iran the sources continued 
while there is no evidence that iraq will try to invade iran it 
appears iraq now has the ability to systematically evict 
iranian troops from its territory the officials said 
such victories when coupled with the political and economic 
problems confronting iran may be enough to force a truce 
settlement 
the sources ranking defense officials with access to us 
intelligence data agreed to discuss developments in the iraniraq 
war during interviews conducted over the past week the officials 
who spoke only upon condition they not be named suggested the 
administration had new reason to hope the iraniraq war might wind 
down allowing the united states to reduce its own commitment of 
naval forces to the persian gulf 
the sources agreed that iraq had surprised not only iran but 
also us intelligence agencies with the timing of its land 
offensives they further disclosed 
iraq spent the month before the april 17 attack on the faw 
peninsula moving troops all around the country generally toward 
the north when they were ready the iraqis used their superior 
roads and military logistical system to send 50000 to 60000 
troops streaming back south to faw in one coordinated movement 
they set up the iranians masterfully one official said 
the iranians never saw it coming 
they achieved surprise a second official added in the 
course of this plan they moved units around in ways that iranian 
intelligence were likely to be deceived then reassembled these 
units in a stealthy and rather sudden way 
and they just ran over the iranians like a steamroller running 
over a cockroach it was really something they had expected it 
the operation to take five days and it took them a day and a 
half 
this source noted the iraqi military had received an awfully 
lot of bad press in the past but our conclusion has been that 
theyve gotten steadily better we have observed with interest the 
maturation of the iraqi armed forces as an entity 
in the course of retaking the faw peninsula the iraqis 
digested real quickly the fact the iranians really didnt fight 
very well one official said 
thus emboldened the iraqis set up another assault operation and 
punched through iranian lines near basra on may 25 once again 
routing iranian forces 
this was another steamroller an official said it took 
the iranians a couple of months to capture this area with 60000 
to 65000 dead the iraqi army and air force recaptured it in five 
hours 
the iraqis recently provided yet another example of their 
willingness to become more aggressive mounting a major air strike 
against irans larak island oil terminal 
iraqi jet fighters have struck the terminal before what made 
the may 14 attack different the sources said was the willingness 
of the iraqi pilots to slow down fly low and use heavy iron bombs 
instead of guided missiles 
the bombs pack much more explosive power than missiles like the 
exocet and the result was that iraq just drilled several huge 
oil tankers putting them out of commission 
iran appears to be suffering real recruitment problems in 
convincing its youth to join the revolutionary guard for duty at 
the front lines the iranians have been equipmentpoor for some 
time now theyre becoming a peoplepoor armed force one 
official said 
iran is going out of its way to monitor the location of us 
warships and refraining from attacks on merchant vessels if navy 
ships are close enough to intervene the sources said

the church of england said wednesday it will drop 
the traditional anonymous preface from its next directory because a 
theologian committed suicide after using the last one to criticize 
the archbishop of canterbury 
a joint statement by the church commissioners and the central 
board of finance which oversee church investments and assets said 
the commentary was no longer a viable option 
asked to elaborate a spokesman cited a lot of publicity and 
the search by the media for the author and the tragic death of 
gareth bennett he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the preface will be dropped from the 198990 edition of 
crockfords clerical directory the official biennial list of 
anglican clergy but no decision has been made on whether to 
eliminate it permanently the statement said 
it has only been dropped for the 1989 edition to allow us more 
time to consider the spokesman said we shall consider the 
position again later 
bennett a 68yearold oxford university canon was found dead 
dec 7 five days after the 198788 edition of the directory 
appeared with his preface 
it accused archbishop of canterbury robert runcie of being 
indecisive and overly influenced by liberal pressure groups and of 
surrounding himself with liberal bishops runcie is spiritual 
leader of the church and leads the worlds 70 million anglicans 
including 3 million american episcopalians 
the preface attacked moves within the state church toward 
ordaining women as priests an issue it said was spreading disunity 
through the anglican communion 
although the article was not signed suspicion fell on bennett 
because of his stature in the churchs conservative wing his 
influential position and his academic distinction 
runcie 66 often has criticized prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative policies and the preface was widely 
interpreted as the beginning of a campaign to bring about his 
retirement and prevent a liberal from succeeding bishops and 
archbishops customarily retire on their 70th birthday 
bennett denied to colleagues and reporters that he wrote the 
preface but was found dead in the garage of his home with a hose 
leading into his car from the exhaust pipe church officials later 
confirmed he was the author 
he did not leave a suicide note but wrote in a diary four days 
before his death i should be lucky to weather this business 
through without disaster 
a strong clue to authorship was the prefaces informed criticism 
of divisions among episcopalians in the united states following 
ordination of women priests there bennett had been a visiting 
professor at the university of south carolina since 1975 
the church commissioners and central board of finance said they 
considered publishing a signed commentary in the next directory 
but decided against it

nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev dropped all 
pretense of a handholding friendship wednesday in a feisty 
competition for the spotlight that mrs reagan called a mexican 
standoff 
president reagan and general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
traded generous comments as their fourth summit drew to a close 
but their wives managed to erase within minutes the image of a warm 
relationship theyd tried to portray earlier in the week 
although the two women maintained the appearance of cordiality 
during a tour of an icon storage vault their contest for the 
spotlight was the toughest of any of their gettogethers since they 
met in geneva in 1985 
i want to say something i want to say something now ok 
mrs reagan cut in at sharply one point as mrs gorbachev attempted 
to stop reporters from questioning the american first lady 
mrs gorbachev backed away but pointedly looked at her watch as 
the first lady chatted with members of the white house press corps 
the incident recalled a similar one during the december summit 
in washington when mrs gorbachev frequently offered comments 
about history art and political life as mrs reagan attempted to 
get in a few words 
since then press accounts have dwelled on the apparent coolness 
in the womens relationship but during several of their sessions 
this week mrs gorbachev took mrs reagans hand in a public 
gesture of friendship as she did on their sunday stroll about the 
kremlins cathedral square 
during wednesdays session with reporters mrs reagan laughed 
at the maneuvering that had just occurred shrugged and declared 
a mexican standoff 
later the first ladys press secretary elaine crispen said of 
the two women they are from two totally different worlds 
noting that mrs reagan has spoken out more in moscow than she 
did at the washington summit mrs crispen said she believed they 
now had more balance and equality in their relationship 
mrs reagan had requested a viewing of the famed icons at the 
tretyakov gallery which houses the finest collection of russian 
art in the world it was begun by paul tretyakov the son of a 
wealthy moscow merchant who donated it to the state in 1892 the 
museum has been closed for renovation since 1986 
instead of meeting mrs reagan as planned by the outside door of 
the gallery mrs gorbachev had come to the special vault where 
they were to view the art and informed the waiting press corp that 
they could have a dialogue about the masterpieces of medieval 
icon painting 
the guests are late she noted 
the soviet first lady then expounded on the 12th and 13th 
century works quoting the great russian author feodor dostoevsky 
as she pointed to the virgin of vladimir which is revered as 
having saved moscow from the tartars another the trinity by 
andrey roblov is said to be the most beautiful icon ever painted 
after mrs reagan arrived and the two women shook hands mrs 
gorbachev presented her with a bouquet of pink roses and a large 
coffeetable style book of pictures from the gallery 
she also presented reporters with a copy of the same book 
proposing that they give it to whomever has covered the summit 
best 
mrs reagan raised her eyebrows in a look of mild consternation 
she then stepped forward insisting that she had something she 
wanted to say 
she thanked mrs gorbachev and the gallery staff and said she 
was aware few people were granted a chance to view rare icon 
collection 
when reporters then tried to question the two women mrs 
gorbachev tried again to get the tour under way saying we have 
decided there would not be any interviews 
but journalists pressed mrs reagan to respond telling her that 
she should have equal time with the soviet first lady upon 
realizing that mrs gorbachev had spoken at length with reporters 
before she arrived a broad smile crossed mrs reagans face and 
she plunged into her own dialogue 
mrs gorbachev then retreated to the background 
told that mrs gorbachev had not mentioned the icons religious 
heritage mrs reagan responded i dont know how you can neglect 
the religious implications i mean they are there when you see 
them 
asked if shed become a convert to communism during her trip 
the first lady laughed heartily saying oh no adding that 
the soviets werent ready to convert to capitalism either 
we have two different ways of living two different 
philosophies she said

q while 5000 journalists have been here for the summit 
suddenly soviet domestic politics have become rather unusual 
ousted moscow communist party leader mr boris yeltsin in an 
interview on television calls for the resignation of the 
kremlins no 2 man mr yegor ligachev how do you assess 
the current political situation in the soviet union as we move into 
the party conference period and what is your opinion of mr 
yeltsins call for mr ligachevs resignation 
gorbachev comrade yeltsin is a member of the central 
committee of the cpsu after all so what he says and what he talks 
about was in fact a subject for discussion at the october plenary 
meeting last year twentyseven people spoke out at that meeting 
and just as you are asking me questions he suddenly came up and 
his statement the statement he made at that meeting was had not 
been planned the opinion of all of the 27 speakers was that 
the generalizations made by comrade yeltsin concerning various 
aspects of activity of the central committee the activity of the 
secretariat the politburo that opinion was wrong and his 
statement was recognized as being politically erroneous so the 
discussion was there the decision was taken and so comrade 
yeltsin seems to be in disagreement with the decision taken by the 
central committee of the party well then if that is so we must 
ask him in the central committee and we shall demand that he 
explain his position and what hes out for it means that his 
opinion is at a variance with the opinion of the central committee 
of the party 
as for comrade ligachev and his retirement that problem simply 
is nonexistent and thats all thats what you should proceed 
from and thats the way it will be 
q mr secretary when you were in washington you said to mr 
reagan that the soviet union was prepared to stop arms deliveries 
to nicaragua if the united states stopped financing the contras 
then later soviet foreign minister mr eduard shevardnadze and 
secretary of state mr george shultz discussed that issue and 
we were told that the soviet position had changed to an agreement 
to stop deliveries to nicaragua if the united states stopped 
deliveries to the whole of central america can you explain to us 
the reason for the change in that position if its correct and 
what you discussed today on central america did that advance the 
issue 
gorbachev today we had a detailed discussion of this problem 
very detailed we looked back at the history and when we do look 
back into history we have different explanations and views but i 
suggested that we take as a starting point todays reality the 
contadora process is with us the guatemala accords theres been 
an armistice a ceasefire and there is some movement towards a 
political settlement and we must base ourselves on that process 
and lend our support and give an opportunity to the forces opposing 
each other

president reagan to the surprise of some 
refuseniks said wednesday that emigration barriers preventing 
people from leaving the soviet union may be the result of 
bureacratic snags rather than deliberate kremlin policy 
in a summitfinale news conference reagan also said that it was 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev who changed his view of the 
kremlin as an evil empire he said gorbachev his partner at 
four summit meetings was different than previous soviet leaders 
have been 
the president said he hoped to conclude a ussoviet treaty to 
cut strategic nuclear arsenals by half before leaving office but 
said it was more important to get a good agreement than to meet a 
january deadline 
winding up his first visit to the soviet union reagan answered 
questions at a news conference under hot television lights in a 
ballroom of the spaso house the american embassy residence where 
he stayed during his fiveday visit here 
reagan refused to rule out the possibility of a fifth summit 
before leaving office in eight months 
something else might come up that necessitates our getting 
together and settling something other than that particular 
treaty reagan said he was referring to the strategic arms 
reduction treaty start still being negotiated by the united 
states and soviet union 
so no one can say no there will be no need for a summit 
the president added 
avoiding any direct criticism of gorbachev reagan said the 
soviet leadership believed that his meetings in moscow with soviet 
dissidents refuseniks and others constituted interference in 
internal matters the topic had been a centerpiece of his 
activities here but abruptly ended after a speech tuesday at 
moscow state university 
at his news conference reagan was asked repeatedly about his 
comment a day earlier about dissidents and refuseniks people who 
have been denied visas and often lose their jobs or are otherwise 
punished for merely seeking permission to leave or speaking out 
against the soviet system 
im not blaming you im blaming bureaucracy reagan had 
told a soviet questioner we have the same type of thing happen 
in our country 
asked wednesday if he thought the problem merely was one of 
bureaucratic intransigence instead of a deliberate policy reagan 
said no i cant say that its one i dont know that much 
about the system 
the questioner persisted asking if he werent letting mr 
gorbachev off a little easy on just saying its a bureaucracy 
i just have to believe that in any government some of us do 
find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy and then sometimes you have 
to stomp your foot and say unmistakably i want it done 
and then maybe you get through with it but i have great 
confidence in his ability to do that reagan said of gorbachev 
however his answer met immediate skepticism 
abe stolar a chicagoborn jew who has been trying to get his 
family out of the soviet union since 1975 said reagans answer was 
naive maybe thats a bad word to use may its just innocent 
stolar said i personelly believe that it is soviet policy 
none of it is accidental and none of it is purely bureaucratic 
tanya zieman a soviet refusenik asked if she felt the 
bureacracy was responsible said of course not the bureaucracy 
has nothing to do with it 
she speculated that reagan merely did not want to spoil some 
agreement with gorbachev on human rights 
my impression was that he just didnt want to anger our side 
more she said my feeling is as if some agreement is reached 
and he does not want to hamper it by saying nasty things 
ziemans family was to have been visited by reagan until soviet 
authorities passed word that the family would never be allowed to 
leave if reagan paid a call 
reagan met with reporters shortly after gorbachev 
at the first news conference he had ever held in the soviet 
union the kremlin leader noted with pleasure that reagan had 
retracted his characterization of this country as an evil 
empire

afghan moslem guerrillas said they 
overran 32 government military posts around the afghan provincial 
capital of baghlan near a major soviet troop withdrawal route 
the report could not be independently verified and western 
diplomatic sources contacted wednesday in islamabad said they could 
not confirm it 
they said it sounded exaggerated but they agreed it could 
indicate there was heavy fighting around the city 120 miles north 
of kabul and 75 miles south of the soviet union 
the peshawarbased mujahedeen alliance said in a telex statement 
tuesday night that 1500 troops and militiamen fighting for the 
communist government surrendered or were captured around baghlan 
between may 22 and may 28 
it said the insurgents captured nearly 900 automatic rifles and 
machine guns and millions of rounds of ammunition 
the statement said fighting was still going at the time of the 
broadcast on tuesday it did not say whether the fighting involved 
soviet forces or just kabul government troops 
the usbacked guerrillas say they already control the area 
surrounding the southern part of the road below the mountains but 
they say they are letting the retreating red army pass peacefully 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 and replaced 
the communist government with another one more than 100000 troops 
have been helping the marxist government fight moslem rebels 
the soviet union signed an agreement with the united states 
pakistan and afghanistan last month in geneva to withdraw its 
troops and the pullout began may 15

salvadoran president jose napolean duarte 
admitted to walter reed army medical center for treatment of what 
he called a bleeding ulcer of a malignant nature began tests 
today to determine if his condition could be cancer 
duarte 62 was taken to walter reed after arriving tuesday 
night at andrews air force base near washington 
walter reed spokesman pete esker said today that duarte rested 
comfortably last night and began medical evaluation and tests this 
morning 
he is in good spirits and his condition is stable esker 
said in a short statement it is not appropriate to comment 
further until all his tests are completed 
duartes illness has been described by those around him as both 
an ulcer and as a tumor the salvadoran president himself 
said it was an ulcer of a malignant nature 
a physician who is an expert on stomach diseases but who is not 
associated with duartes care said that it often is difficult to 
determine if an illness is the result of an ulcer or is caused by a 
stomach cancer 
it is not at all uncommon for there to be confusion said 
dr j michael hamilton of the national cancer institute when 
you look at the two things they may be very similar 
extensive tests or even surgery may be required to resolve the 
question hamilton said 
as he prepared to leave from illopango military airport in el 
salvador on tuesday duarte told reporters of his illness and 
described himself as a man who fights 
the designs of god are unpredictable duarte said what i 
have is a bleeding ulcer seven centimeters 2 inches long in the 
stomach of a malignant nature 
the doctors have said that the prognosis is reserved until 
studies are made in the united states i dont know what is 
going to happen 
asked how to interpret duartes description of his ulcer 
presidential spokeswoman ana maria ruiz wiped away tears and said 
what do you want him to say cancer he cant ulcers in 
themselves are neither malignant nor benign 
media communications minister roberto viera asked about the 
presidents statement said duarte has a large tumor in his 
stomach the doctors dont want to characterize it until they do 
a biopsy viera said 
duarte told reporters you all know me i have been a man of 
crisis a man of battle a man who fights i have fought against 
all the vicissitudes against dictatorships for so many years in 
search of democracy against the countrys biggest crisis against 
an earthquake three droughts and now god gives me this other 
test 
he traveled to the united states aboard a us air force c141 
transport aircraft converted into a hospital plane for the sixhour 
flight to washington 
duarte bid farewell at the airport to about 200 members of the 
cabinet legislature supreme court and diplomatic corps clasping 
many of the dignitaries in long embraces his wife ines next to 
him on a slightly raised platform wiped away tears 
the climate of the ceremony was one of barely concealed grief 
with members of duartes extended family weeping and rubbing 
reddened eyes 
the absence leaves vice president rodolfo castillo claramount in 
charge 
the president a staunch us ally who is in the final year of 
his fiveyear term leaves a troubled country leftist guerrillas 
are waging an 8yearold campaign to topple the government 
duartes christian democrats suffered a telling defeat in 
legislative and municipal elections in march the rightist 
republican nationalist alliance or arena won control of the 
unicameral congress which had been dominated by duartes party 
the christian democrats are torn by infighting that has 
threatened to split the organization 
former cabinet minister julio adolfo rey prendes was declared 
the party presidential candidate at a convention last month but 
rival fidel chavez mena backed by a significant party sector

although mott did not single out specific threats to the 
national parks increasing pressures include commercial and 
residential development along park boundaries timbering oil 
drilling and pollution of park resources 
several sessions during the next few days will focus on those 
threats and ways park superintendents will try to deal with them 
mott said the park service must reach out to and work with 
adjacent landowners and land managing agencies to let them know the 
potential impacts of their actions on park resources we must 
reach out into the surrounding communities and work with 
government agencies and the private sector to resolve problems 
before they reach crisis stage 
that is our challenge as we move into the 21st century said 
mott 
in a morning news conference rep bruce f vento dminn 
chairman of the house subcommiteee on national parks and public 
lands advocated reorganization of the park service to give its 
director a more independent role 
vento has introduced a bill calling for presidential appointment 
of the director and confirmation by the senate for a fixed term 
vento said such a move would free the director to be an 
advocate and remove him from the political arena 
the meeting comes on the brink of summer as many national parks 
and recreation areas gear up for record crowds it is also the 
latest chapter in the continuing controversy over the nations 
officially preserved natural heritage 
this is not a regional or headquarters agenda this conference 
is by and for the superintendents said george berklacy chief of 
public affairs for the park service 
i think it is a very serious professional thing that they 
have done in holding the conference said t destry jarvis vice 
president of the national parks and conservation association a 
washingtonbased nonprofit citizens group 
i think its very important that the national park service 
enhance the notion that this is a single service with a single 
purpose said jarvis who planned to attend the meeting as an 
observer im sure they will get a lot of business done that 
would not occur if they werent together 
it is in the best interest of the country said steve 
whitney of the wilderness society adding that the superintendents 
shouldnt wait another decade for another one 
the national park system includes 49 fullfledged national parks 
and 292 other units including national recreation areas and 
national seashore areas encompassing 77 million acres 
last week the wilderness society issued a report calling on the 
federal government to move all hotels and other concessions out of 
the parks 
the report also identified what the environmental organization 
deemed were the 10 most endangered parks among them yellowstone 
the national parks and conservation association also recently 
issued a report compiled during three years that recommended a 
50 million annual increase in the park services budget just to 
fix a backlog of resource management problems 
the park service itself issued a 1980 report to congress on the 
state of the parks that identified more than 4000 individual 
threats 
a recent general accounting office survey concluded that the 
agency had an unmet need of 19 billion for maintenance and 
capital improvements in the 1987 fiscal year because of 
advanced continuing deterioration some of these assets may be 
lost permanently the study said 
the reagan administration has proposed a park service budget of 
779 million for the next fiscal year 
one conference session deals solely with the federal budget 
process and the park service 
the tab for the meeting is estimated at 600000 said berklacy 
he noted that this years regional and zone superintendents 
meetings which cost about 300000 in all have been cancelled

aids activist albert bell marched into 
the governors office and offered a handful of condoms to the 
receptionist 
id like to give these to the governor its the only thing 
weve been offered for safety in six years said bell a san 
diego resident who was among those calling for more action against 
aids 
there is growing frustration in california among the medical 
community victims advocacy groups and aids patients over 
government efforts they say are fractured adrift in a leadership 
vacuum and hampered by the governors conservativism 
against that background supporters of political extremist 
lyndon larouche have for the second time placed an aids initiative 
on the statewide ballot that would allow medical authorities to 
quarantine victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
voters will decide the issue proposition 69 on june 7 the 
first such measure was rejected overwhelmingly two years ago 
critics accuse republican gov george deukmejian of worrying 
more about offending conservative voters than saving homosexuals 
and intravenous drug users who are hit hardest by aids 
deukmejian boasts of increasing aids spending up to 65 million 
this fiscal year from 34 million four years ago and almost 50 
percent more than the next four states with high aids caseloads 
combined he has included 75 million in aids funds in his 198889 
budget proposal 
a george washington university study put californias aids 
allocation for the 198788 fiscal year at 58 million lower than 
the governors figure but far higher than new yorks appropriation 
of 164 million florida was next at 125 million followed by 
new jersey at 7 million according to the study 
in the coming year our state will continue its leadership in 
the fight against this deadly disease he said recently 
the 13106 california cases reported to the centers for disease 
control make up 215 percent of the national caseload second in 
the nation to new yorks 15729 or 258 percent 
the state office of aids said 58 percent of the california 
victims or 7744 people had died by april 30 
deukmejian opposes proposition 69 but critics say he is silent 
too often on aids issues allowing state policies to be determined 
by politics rather than public health considerations 
the state has clamped down on graphic aids educational material 
in the wake of protests by conservative organizations that the 
material teaches promiscuity and homosexual sex 
you have to make sure you do not offend people who are in 
essence paying the bill thelma fraziear chief of the state 
office of aids said 
groups professing traditional family values argue that condoms 
arent 100 percent effective and that abstinence should be promoted 
as the best means of aids prevention 
the california medical association supports the use of explicit 
language to reach some audiences but the state republican party 
censured the san francisco aids foundation for educational 
literature that republican leaders considered obscene 
fraziear said aids by its nature is fraught with politics 
we are dealing with subjects that are not generally discussed in 
mixed company you get a lot of builtin fears that you dont 
get with other programs she said 
she characterized the state as balancing opposing interests and 
insisted politics havent interfered with the mission of education 
testing and research 
but with health care for aids victims alone costing an estimated 
1 billion and with the epidemic expected to strike 35000 more 
californians by 1991 aids experts say the state isnt doing nearly 
enough 
stan hadden an assistant to state senate leader david roberti 
and a recognized aids expert in the capitol said the states low 
profile forces county health officers and volunteer groups to take 
the lead 
to put it bluntly i wish we could get rid of the state office 
of aids and put the san francisco county office of aids in 
charge hadden said i think theyre much more aggressive

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev paid tribute to 
president reagan on wednesday for retracting his characterization 
of the soviet union as an evil empire but he blamed the 
american side for the failure to make more tangible progress at the 
fourth superpower summit in 30 months 
in the first nationally televised moscow news conference by a 
kremlin leader gorbachev hailed the continuing ussoviet 
dialogue and said it is vitally necessary that his meetings 
resume after reagans successor takes office in january 
in a goodnatured wideranging session with soviet and foreign 
reporters the communist party chief held forth for nearly two 
hours alternately praising the tone of ussoviet dialogue while 
criticizing specific us positions 
gorbachev noted that within the walls of the kremlin next to 
the czars gun right in the heart of the evil empire reagan had 
responded no when asked if the soviet union still deserved 
the appellation he gave it in march 1983 
reagan explained tuesday that his characterization one of the 
mostquoted of reagans presidency was made in another time 
another era 
we take note of this gorbachev said drawing on an ancient 
greek saying to add everything flows everything changes 
gorbachev said his meetings with reagan were indepth and at 
times intense discussions right up to the last minutes 
he described the talks as respectful and productive but 
indicated emotions ran high at times saying he and reagan were 
standing up at the table to make their points 
i think that the meetings once again demonstrated the fact 
that we are indulging in realistic dialogue the 57yearold 
soviet leader said 
gorbachev said he believed a treaty cutting strategic nuclear 
weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent was still possible this year 
despite the failure to break the logjam that has blocked progress 
toward an agreement since the washington summit last december 
asked if he expected to meet reagan again before the president 
leaves office gorbachev said it was unlikely unless there is an 
unforeseen breakthrough in the strategic arms talks 
he said the united states rejected several soviet proposals for 
inclusion in a 24page joint statement issued on conclusion of the 
talks 
both sides agreed there should be no war between them yet the 
americans objected to describing their goal as peaceful 
coexistence or even coexistence gorbachev said 
gorbachevs remarks were contained in a 50minute opening 
statement followed by a questionandanswer session that ran about 
an hour with questioners picked by foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov from a show of hands of some 300 soviet and 
foreign journalists 
the general secretary reiterated his criticism of ousted moscow 
party boss boris yeltsin a onetime protege and dismissed 
yeltsins suggestion that the kremlins no 2 man yegor ligachev 
should resign 
last october at a closed meeting of the communist partys 
policymaking central committee yeltsin criticized the slow pace 
of perestroika gorbachevs campaign to modernize the soviet 
economy and society and offered to resign gorbachev said 
wednesday that his onetime protege who had risen to nonvoting 
membership on the ruling politburo was overruled by fellow members 
of the central committee 
he said he had not seen yeltsins recent comments in interviews 
with western television networks but would demand from comrade 
yeltsin explanations as to what it is all about and what he is 
after 
as for ligachev and reports he was being pushed from power 
gorbachev said no such problem exists with the man widely 
perceived as the leader of a conservative faction opposing 
gorbachev in the politburo 
perestroika will win out he said of speculation that the 
reform movement could be in trouble he also said he had heard no 
alternative to his reforms and concluded there can be some 
maneuvers but we have undertaken irreversible change 
gorbachev sitting at a table with key members of his summit 
negotiating team dominated the session with a selfconfident air 
speaking off the cuff much of the time he made his points 
gesturing with his hands and flashing a smile 
at one point when he realized that some american correspondents 
couldnt understand because their translation devices werent 
functioning he directed a goodnatured reorganization of the 
seating telling soviet reporters to take chairs where the 
earphones werent working 
many reporters including nbc anchor tom brokaw whom gorbachev 
singled out by name stood up and switched seats in the 
justrenovated auditorium in the soviet foreign ministry press 
center 
the party chief indicated that the united states and soviet 
union had made a recent breakthrough in longstalled conventional 
arms talks in europe but accused the united states of 
incomprehensible maneuvers that scuttled any mention of that in 
the closing communique 
asked about the prospects for a fifth summit gorbachev said 
i like the possibility for a meeting with just one problem if we 
have an opportunity to achieve a treaty concerning offensive 
arms he said the presidents strategic defense initiative was 
one sure obstacle along with a dispute over limits on 
submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
later he said he told reagan the presidents view that the 
socalled star wars program is strictly defensive was just not 
serious 
asked about the middle east gorbachev said for the first time 
that as soon as an international conference on the region is 
convened we are prepared to address ourselves to regularizing 
relations with israel severed in 1967 
he cited the afghanistan agreement as an example of what could 
be achieved if the superpowers worked together with warring parties 
to solve the conflicts but noted that if soviet forces now come 
under attack from rebels as they withdraw we shall react 
accordingly and appropriately 
on human rights he said that when reagan tried to persuade me 
to change my mind i said your explanations are not convincing 
i am not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit 
reagan met with a group of dissidents and refuseniks during his 
fiveday visit here but scrapped a plan to visit a family of 
wouldbe jewish emigrants sources said the soviets warned us 
officials the family would never be permitted to leave the country 
if the reagans followed through with their plan 
after talking of what he called the contrary attitude of the 
united states on some issues gorbachev singled out economic 
relations 
authoritative parts of american business circles would like to 
do business he said they are faced with intimidation and all 
sorts of restrictions 
he cited the jacksonvanik amendment which links trade 
opportunities to emigration freedoms and said he told the president 
why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living 
the amendment was passed in totally different circumstances a 
decade ago we should base our policies on presentday realities 
as he has before gorbachev described the agreement to eliminate 
intermediate range inf nuclear weapons as a watershed political 
event in the sovietamerican dialogue 
earlier in remarks at the exchange of final inf papers the 
soviet leader summarized the proceedings as big politics 
worthy of new times 
the era of nuclear disarmament has begun gorbachev said 
in his news conference statement gorbachev was sharply critical 
of the us stand on reducing the nonnuclear forces in europe of 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
he said reagan had rejected a soviet proposal to exchange data 
on the troops as a first step toward a massive reduction but the 
other side immediately tried to dodge the issue 
gorbachev said the united states engaged in incomprehensible 
maneuvers and we missed a chance to take an important step 
forward to a civil relationship

president reagan and kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev reported progress wednesday over two obstacles to a 
strategic arms deal but ended their fourth summit divided over the 
main impediment the us star wars program 
i would hope that before the year is out that we could 
eliminate the differences that still exist reagan said but 
there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough 
after four days of intense talks the two leaders ordered their 
negotiators to return to geneva on july 12 to work on a proposed 
treaty to cut superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 
percent 
gorbachev told reporters it is still possible to sign an 
agreement in this administration reagan said conversations 
are still going on and they are still being discussed and i say 
progress is still being made or we wouldnt be talking as we are 
in a 24page joint statement the two leaders announced 
achievement of substantial additional common ground on two of 
the five major disputed areas on the proposed strategic arms 
reduction treaty start ways of monitoring mobile missiles and 
counting nucleartipped cruise missiles on warplanes 
besides modest progress on start the two leaders inched ahead 
on other arms control issues 
they exchanged ratification protocols for the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty inf to eliminate mediumrange nuclear 
missiles which was signed at the washington summit last december 
and ratified by the senate last friday and by the soviet assembly 
of presidents 17 hours later 
during the summit gorbachev and reagan also signed two lesser 
arms control agreements one requiring advance notifice of 
ballistic missile tests and another to tighten verification 
procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons 
on the start treaties us officials said they had restated 
opposition to deployment of soviet ss24 and ss25 missiles 
it is the position of the united states that such missiles 
should be banned unless the united states and the soviet union can 
reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective 
verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear 
weapons carried by such missiles us officials said 
us officials in a briefing paper given to reporters said 
that acceptable verification rules would require among other 
things restricting mobile missiles to specific geographical areas 
means to assure that spy satellites can keep tabs on all such 
weapons and the right to inspect sites to investigate suspected 
violations 
the two sides remained far apart on star wars and how to 
negotiate reductions in conventional armies 
we have missed a chance to take an important step forward 
gorbachev told reporters 
the kremlin leader who has used all four meetings with reagan 
as forums to air his opposition to star wars said he had proposed 
resolving the problem by exchanging data allowing mutual inspection 
of facilities where technology for an antimissile defense is 
tested 
but no strategic arms treaty is possible he said without an 
agreement assuring that development and deployment of strategic 
defenses does not violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
and a fifth summit would not be possible without a start deal he 
said 
on the opening day of the talks us and soviet officials said 
gorbachev suggested to reagan that they exchange data on 
conventional arms as a means of making drastic cuts as proposed by 
the russians in 1986 
us officials say they will not directly negotiate conventional 
cuts with the soviets because the matter must be agreed upon by 
the 33 nations taking part in the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe 
those talks also include discussion of alleged soviet violations 
of human rights provisions of the original conference accord 
signed in helsinki in 1975

the government said wednesday its chief 
economic forecasting gauge rose a modest 02 percent in april an 
increase analysts said signaled continued healthy economic growth 
for the rest of this presidential election year 
it marked the third consecutive monthly increase in the commerce 
departments index of leading indicators following an identical 
02 percent rise in march and a giant 15 percent february surge 
which had been the largest gain in more than two years 
in other good news for the economy the government reported that 
orders to us factories for manufactured goods shot up 12 percent 
in april to a seasonally adjusted 2187 billion following an even 
bigger 16 percent march increase indicating that industrial 
production will be increasing during the months ahead 
in a third report the commerce department said construction 
spending rose 01 percent in april to an annual rate of 4018 
billion as a big increase in investment on new factories helped 
offset a decline in government construction projects 
analysts discounted the drop in the volatile government sector 
and focused instead on the strength in factory construction which 
pushed this category up a remarkable 391 percent higher than it 
was a year ago they said this reflected a rush by businesses to 
expand operating plants to meet the heavy demand for us exports 
all of the reports today spell nothing but good news for the 
economy in this election year said allen sinai chief economist 
for the boston co by and large we have got a strong expansion 
in industrial america with the orders suggesting increased 
production more jobs and good income generation 
economists have been busy in recent days boosting their growth 
forecasts for 1988 based on the report last week that the overall 
economy as measured by the gross national product expanded at a 
robust 39 percent rate in the first three months of the year 
this was far better performance than had been forecast 
immediately after oct 19 when the record plunge in stock prices 
raised fears of an imminent recession instead growth has raced 
ahead pushing unemployment down to a 14year low of 54 percent in 
april 
it has been an amazing year said david wyss chief 
financial economist at data resources inc the ability of the 
economy to ignore the stock market crash has really surprised us 
wyss said his company now was predicting the gnp would grow 32 
percent this year which would be the best economic performance 
since a 68 percent surge in 1984 in each of the last two years 
gnp growth has been a more modest 29 percent 
all of this should be good news for vice president george bush 
who hopes his presidential campaign will benefit from a feeling 
among voters that the reagan administration has done a good job 
managing the economy 
the march increase in the leading index originally was reported 
as a much stronger 08 percent rise however weakness in consumer 
and business borrowing pulled the index down sharply 
but analysts said they were not concerned about the big downward 
revision which had been expected they said if the trend toward 
smaller monthly increases in the leading index continues it might 
be signaling slower growth by the end of 1988 or in early 1989 but 
any such slowdown probably would not be evident until after the 
nov 8 election 
many economists still believe that while 1988 will be a good 
year the country is likely to enter a recession sometime in 1989 
brought on by rising interest rates and higher inflation 
the federal reserve already has made three moves in the past 2 
months to tighten credit conditions in an effort to dampen 
inflationary pressures 
lawrence a hunter deputy chief economist for the chamber of 
commerce blamed the fed actions for the slower increases in the 
leading index in the past two months and said the situation is 
similar to mid1984 when fed credittightening brought on a period 
of sluggish growth before the fed relented and started easing 
credit 
let us hope the fed backs off again he said if it does 
the prospects for the us economy remain basically sound 
the 02 percent april rise in the leading index reflected 
increases in five individual indicators and declines in four others 
the biggest source of strength was rise in the length of the 
average workweek followed by gains in the money supply a drop in 
initial unemployment claims a rise in raw materials prices and an 
increase in plant and equipment orders 
the biggest negative factor was a speedup in delivery times for 
business orders which is viewed as indicating weaker demand other 
negative forces were a decline in stock prices a drop in building 
permits and a drop in orders for consumer goods 
the various changes left the index at 1922 percent of its 1967 
base of 100

sinhalese extremists on wednesday 
burned more than 15 government buildings stabbed a policeman to 
death and injured eight people with a bomb in attacks aimed at 
stopping provincial elections 
the government responded by ordering police and security forces 
to shoot on sight anyone caught destroying government property 
the elections are scheduled for thursday to comply with a 
provision of a peace accord aimed at ending the minority tamils 
fiveyear insurgency 
extremists among the majority sinhalese say the pact made too 
many concessions to the tamils and have vowed to kill anyone who 
supports it 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
explosions and fire also damaged three trains bound for colombo on 
wednesday 
one of the trains was stopped by three gunwielding youths in 
nebomob 20 miles north of colombo said the officials and 
travelers the youths believed to be sinhalese extremists ordered 
passengers off the train and then set two of the coaches ablaze 
with gasoline no injuries were reported 
the policeman was stabbed by three sinhalese in the southern 
town of galle said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he said one sinhalese extremist was shot to death in an 
encounter with police north of colombo and a second died when a 
firebomb he was going to throw at a government building just south 
of colombo blew up in his hand 
in another attack four government officials and four policemen 
were seriously injured when a bomb went off in nuwara eilyas town 
hall 60 miles east of colombo as poll workers prepared for 
thursdays voting police blamed the attack on the nationalist 
sinhalese peoples liberation front 
the front told people in the election area to stay inside for 36 
hours and put up posters threatening to kill anyone who tried to 
vote 
the police spokesman said more than 15 government buildings were 
set ablaze by the sinhalese extremists mostly in western and 
southern districts the buildings included post offices 
development offices and town halls he said 
businessmen said extremists ordered them to shutter their shops 
and many merchants said they complied for fear of reprisal some of 
the shops opened later in the day 
government announcements on staterun radio and television said 
police have been given orders to shoot on sight any person 
engaged in the destruction of public property and said the 
elections would go ahead 
the voting thursday is to elect new district councils in the 
western and central provinces the capital at colombo in the 
western province 
more than 36 million voters are eligible to vote in the 
elections to choose 158 representatives 
the balloting was called for in the peace accord signed on july 
29 1987 by prime minister rajiv gandhi of india and sri lankan 
president junius r jayewardene the signing led to rioting in 
which several hundred people were killed or injured 
the government blamed the sinhalese front for instigating the 
riots the violence on wednesday was the worst since those riots 
the front has been blamed for the deaths of more than 300 people 
since the pact was signed many of them government officials or 
members of jayewardenes governing united national party several 
candidates were killed before district council elections april 28 
in four other regions 
tamil rebels have been waging a guerrilla war since 1983 for 
more political autonomy or an independent homeland in northern and 
eastern sri lanka 
tamils who are mostly hindus and make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million population say they are discriminated against 
by the sinhalese who control the government and military 
india has become involved because it is the dominant regional 
power and because its 60 million ethnic tamils are sympathetic to 
the sri lankan cause 
india has sent more than 50000 troops to the island to enforce 
the accord but they are posted in the north and east to deal with 
tamil problems 
the sinhalese front was outlawed after an abortive attempt in 
1971 to overthrow the sri lankan government it has been regrouping 
in recent years and has been blamed for a series of violent acts 
including the attempted assassination of jayewardene in august 1987

moscow ap senate minority leader bob dole raised the 
possibility wednesday that congress might relax trade restrictions 
on the soviet union as kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev complained 
that such restrictions did not reflect presentday realities 
gorbachev blasted the jacksonvanik amendment in which congress 
denied certain us trade benefits to the soviet union as long as 
the soviets restrict emigration by jews and others 
why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living 
gorbachev asked referring to jacksonvanik one is physically 
dead the other is politically dead he said 
the measure is named for its chief sponsors the late sen henry 
jackson dwash and former rep charles vanik dohio 
dole rkan said gorbachev had complained to him about 
congressional restrictions on trade at the dinner party president 
reagan hosted tuesday night 
gorbachev told him at the dinner he was a little frustrated 
by adoption in congress of resolutions condemning the soviet union 
dole said he indicated it made his job that much more 
difficult dole said 
authoritative parts of american business circles would like to 
do business gorbachev said at a news conference they are 
faced with intimidation and all sorts of restrictions we should 
base our policies on presentday realities 
dole did not hold out much hope that congress would relax trade 
restrictions this year but said i think if this relationship 
continues to grow there are always possibilities that changes will 
be made 
at reagans invitation dole and senate majority leader robert 
byrd spent 24 hours in the soviet union where they came to watch 
the ceremonial exchange of the ratified intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty eliminating a class of weapons 
the senators said changes in soviet union paved the way for 
better cooperation between the superpowers but they were 
pessimistic that a treaty cutting longrange nuclear weapons could 
be negotiated or ratified by the senate this year 
but the two senators called for other initiatives such as the 
parliamentary exchanges mentioned by gorbachev 
byrd said he was pleased that gorbachev recently agreed to allow 
the mass distribution of bibles in the soviet union i have 
written to the general secretary commending him on taking this step 
and urging that there be an expansion of this effort byrd said 
byrd also proposed that the superpowers agree to cooperate in 
the war against illicit drugs instead of the suggested joint 
mission to mars we could work jointly on the war on drugs 
he said 
dole whose right arm is crippled because of a war injury said 
reagan and gorbachev should pledge their support for the rights of 
the disabled 
saluting reagan for his part in producing the accord byrd said 
i dont think anyone else could have done that he came along at 
the right moment 
said dole ronald reagan has come a long way since 1981 he 
said reagan was in a unique position to negotiate with the soviets 
because of his conservative credentials

mikhail s gorbachevs news conference on wednesday 
the general secretarys remarks through an interpreter 
gorbachev we have completed the fourth meeting fourth in three 
years between the general secretary of the cpsu communist party of 
the soviet union and the united states president and this alone 
is not simply a matter of arithmetic i would say that this is of 
great political import to have four meetings in just three years 
it signifies the intensity of the political dialogue and it shows 
the character the level of our relations and i guess this in 
itself is meaningful 
the meeting did indeed show how important is the dialogue 
between the soviet union and the united states and it has 
confirmed yet again how right we were in choosing the path we took 
in geneva two and a half years ago to reykjavik and washington 
that path has led us to moscow 
everybody is interested in sovietamerican relations being 
switched on to a normal and healthy track 
and so i ask why has this become possible this intense 
dialogue this process which is of immense importance i think it 
is due to realism im speaking about realism in politics in the 
policies of the soviet union and of the united states of america 
because it is a realistic approach on the one side that has 
ensured the possibility of this process 
the relations which bore within them a terrible threat to the 
very existence of mankind and to peace became more positive and 
acquired positive dynamism the two most powerful nations began to 
reform their relationship in their own interest and in the interest 
of the world community at large 
the major result is a continuation of dialogue which now 
encompasses all of the key issues of world politics of bilateral 
relations this meeting once again demonstrated the fact that we 
are indulging in a realistic dialogue 
also characteristic and this you will find in the final 
document the concept that in this dialogue of ours we are 
laying down prerequisites the bricks so to say for the building 
of our future relationship it is a sign of movement into the 21st 
century 
now what have we achieved specifically i would mention the 
fact that we have completed the process concerning medium and 
shorterrange missiles and this fourth meeting gave an added 
impetus to the process and we exchanged instruments of 
ratification this is not simply a formality and let me just use a 
solemn formula that completion of the procedures and 
introduction into force of the inf intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty has turned the moscow meeting into a watershed 
political event in the sovietamerican dialogue and in world 
politics as a whole 
it is not only the peoples of the soviet union and the united 
states that can congratulate themselves but also their allies and 
the entire world public the entire world community it is a common 
victory for reason and realism and it has become possible because 
today on all continents in every nation in every country 
regardless of social choice and of other values which each people 
chooses for itself there is a common understanding and awareness 
that the world had reached the brink and that it had to be stopped 
that event had to be stopped and the door had to be opened leading 
in another direction towards a nuclear free and nonviolent world 
and towards making international relations more healthy 
many made their real and substantial contribution to achieving 
this major victory and i must note these facts and also mention 
the contribution of the press even when the press posed the most 
difficult questions before the negotiations that too was a 
necessary contribution that helped to make the dialogue more 
concrete more convincing in finding solutions finding new 
arguments in elaborating the forms of verification and control 
the president and i have approved a joint statement it 
summarizes what the advances made since washington and what has 
been achieved here in moscow at the same time this statement 
confirms a sort of agenda for the sovietamerican dialogue for the 
future it is in short an important political document which 
hallmarks a whole phase in our relations the most important points 
in it are those clauses which relate to the importance of building 
up political dialogue between the nations intensifying the talks 
and negotiations and then i would mention further i would note 
progress made in the sphere of disarmament this is a very 
difficult process especially if you take the question of strategic 
offensive arms its not an easy dialogue 
i must state very firmly that stepbystep we are moving toward 
a treaty on strategic offensive arms i will say that if we 
effectively conduct our business and if the present administration 
and of course this applies to both countries if we act 
effectively using all of our possibilities and opportunities we 
can achieve a treaty

construction spending advanced 01 percent in 
april as a boom in factory construction helped offset weakness in 
government projects the commerce department reported wednesday 
the department said building activity rose to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4018 billion in april up 14 percent 
from a year ago 
the april advance followed a big 13 percent jump in march and a 
04 percent february increase 
but analysts tended to discount the weak overall change and 
instead focus on a big 88 percent rise in spending on industrial 
plants which put activity in this sector up a remarkable 398 
percent above where it was a year ago 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers said the gain reflected the boom in export sales 
which has meant plants in many industries are operating near full 
capacity 
industry was trying to cut costs in 1982 and 1983 by slashing 
capacity and closing down plants he said the growth in 
construction is a reflection of increased international demand 
running against a production supply that had been cut back too much 
in previous years 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc said that 
while the construction figures so far this year have been strong 
he expected weakness in the months ahead in both residential and 
nonresidential building because of the recent increases in 
interest rates 
government construction after soaring 5 percent in march fell 
by 31 percent in april to an annual rate of 793 billion but 
analysts said this swing in a volatile category was not worrisome 
and they predicted further gains in the months ahead based on 
increased federal money for highway projects which congress 
approved last year over president reagans veto 
residential construction posted a 04 percent advance in april 
to an annual rate of 1919 billion this reflected a 08 percent 
increase in construction of singlefamily homes and a 14 percent 
drop in apartment construction 
apartment building is now 222 percent below the level of a year 
ago as this sector continues to be hurt by changes in the tax law 
and high vacancy rates 
nonresidential construction climbed 21 percent in april to an 
annual rate of 944 billion in addition to the big 88 percent 
advance in industrial construction office construction posted a 
11 percent increase while construction of shopping centers and 
other commercial buildings rose 29 percent

traffic scofflaws are getting relief not from 
the fines but from lines at court 
three first independent money stores soon will accept fine 
payments in a program that will help clear 36th district court 
which processed more than 400000 traffic violations last year 
chief judge adam a shakoor said 
the money stores owned by first independence national bank 
detroits only minorityowned bank will get a 50cent fee from 
each ticket 
traffic violations can be paid by mail but people too poor to 
maintain bank accounts are unable do so because fines must be paid 
with a check or money order thirty percent are paid in person 
shakoor said 
the 36th district court is a peoples court and we intend to 
provide more communityoriented services that will ultimately make 
the court run more smoothly shakoor said 
beginning june 13 motorists can pay fines on all traffic 
violations the program may be expanded for parking violations 
first independence which opened the money stores more than a 
year ago to provide banking services to lowerincome detroit 
residents lost 500000 on the stores last year and expects to 
lose 230000 this year 
the fees collected from the fine payments will help said don 
davis chairman of first independence 
the money stores were chosen for the program because the 
facilities have computer systems that are compatible with the 
courts shakoor said adding officials eventually hope to make the 
service available at other banking institutions shakoor said he 
knew of no other program like detroits in the country

tape sheer fabric and grease are no 
longer enough between topless dancers and their audience 
city council has amended a pornography ordinance that previously 
specified what body parts had to be covered but not that the 
covering had to be opaque the council changed that on tuesday 
some women were covering their breasts with vaseline or 
grease because the ordinance did not say what type of covering was 
needed said brenda nichols assistant city attorney there also 
were reports that women used seethrough fabric or clear tape to 
skirt the ordinance 
city council is trying to stamp out adult businesses said mike 
gibson a lawyer who represents some of the businesses 
if you comply with the first ordinance they pass they change 
it to make sure no one can comply he said 
the amendment takes effect immediately and anyone violating it 
is subject to arrest strip shows are allowed by law but the adult 
entertainment business has to be at least 1000 feet from homes 
schools churches parks or other adult establishments

theyre alive and well but children who undergo 
kidney transplants are also extremely short because the medication 
they take to ensure the transplant isnt rejected hinders their 
growth doctors say 
since young kidney recipients want to grow normally doctors are 
trying new therapies with some success to help them in body and 
spirit 
theyre taller and theyre much happier said dr amir 
tejani director of renal services at the state university of new 
york health science center at brooklyn 
about onefourth of all young kidney recipients can be treated 
successfully without a steroid commonly combined with the potent 
antirejection drug cyclosporine tejani reported tuesday at the 
annual conference of the american society of transplant physicians 
the steroid known as prednisone inhibits the growth plate in 
the bone from functioning normally it also causes acne and 
puffiness most noticeably in the face 
this is a very important study since the whole point of doing 
transplants is to achieve growth said dr william harmon a 
nephrologist at childrens hospital in boston 
even for a third of them to grow normally then by all means 
we should be doing this for our kids or at least trying said dr 
lawrence g hunsicker the societys president 
like children suffering from other serious illnesses children 
with kidney failure tend to be extraordinarily short sometimes 
barely topping 4 feet 
by the time they undergo a transplant its often too late for 
these children to catch up on past growth even if they receive 
transplants at a very young age the medication necessary for 
helping to prevent their bodies immune systems from attacking the 
new organ stunts their growth 
perhaps the bestknown case involves gary coleman star of the 
former television series diffrent strokes the 19yearold 
actor whos undergone two kidney transplants is under 5 feet tall 
the issue is a big one for these children said dr ira 
greifer medical director of the national kidney foundation a 
lot of the patients especially the younger ones want to take the 
risk of rejection for the extra inches 
some patients in fact cheat on their medication in a desperate 
attempt to improve their appearance according to tejani 
you cant tell them it doesnt matter if theyre short when 
it matters to them greifer said you cant tell them the world 
is made up of small people when americans are getting taller 
about 1200 youngsters 16 and under experience kidney failure 
every year in the united states according to greifer six hundred 
to 800 of them eventually receive new kidneys they comprise fewer 
than 9 percent of the total number of kidney transplants performed 
annually 
the operation is quite successful one year after 
transplantation up to 85 percent of them still have properly 
functioning kidneys according to experts 
for his research tejani studied 53 children and selected 30 
whose transplanted kidneys were functioning well enough to undergo 
the experiment the 30 were taken off prednisone 
twentythree of them proved to be treatable solely with 
cyclosporine at the time however nine of the 23 had to return to 
prednisone later after experiencing mild episodes of organ 
rejection tejani said 
the remaining 14 a little more than onefourth of the original 
53 children in the study have been off prednisone for up to 4 
years without any episodes of organ rejection or side effects 
according to tejani more important all of them have grown 
including one 17yearold boy who has reached 5 feet 8 inches 
in patients unable to be weaned off prednisone tejani has 
administered growth hormone enabling them to catch up on some of 
their lost growth 
doctors at the university of california at los angeles also have 
begun giving growth hormone to certain kidney transplant patients 
as well as children on dialysis 
the data seems good said dr vera h koch a clinical 
fellow at ucla there seems to be hope

president reagan and kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev reported progress wednesday over two obstacles to a 
strategic arms deal but ended their fourth summit divided over the 
main impediment the us star wars program 
i would hope that before the year is out that we could 
eliminate the differences that still exist reagan said but 
there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough 
after four days of intense talks the two leaders ordered their 
negotiators to return to geneva on july 12 to work on a proposed 
treaty to cut superpower nclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 
percent 
gorbachev told reporters it is still possible to sign an 
agreement in this administration reagan said conversations 
are still going on and they are still being discussed and i say 
progress is still being made or we wouldnt be talking as we are 
in a 24page joint statement the two leaders announced 
achievement of substantial additional common ground on two of 
the five major disputed areas on the proposed strategic arms 
reduction treaty start ways of monitoring mobile missiles and 
counting nucleartipped cruise missiles on warplanes 
but us arms negotiator edward rowny said there was a lot of 
room to go in the two areas 
and he said we didnt get anywhere on the two biggest 
obstacles to a treaty keeping track of submarinefired cruise 
missiles and soviet objections to reagans star wars 
missiledefense program formally known as the strategic defense 
inititiative 
besides modest progress on start the two leaders inched ahead 
on other arms control issues 
they exchanged ratification protocols for the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty inf to eliminate mediumrange nuclear 
missiles which was signed at the washington summit last december 
and ratified by the senate last friday and by the soviet assembly 
of presidents 17 hours later 
during the summit gorbachev and reagan also signed two lesser 
arms control agreements one requiring advance notifice of 
ballistic missile tests and another to tighten verification 
procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons 
on the start treaties us officials said they had restated 
opposition to deployment of soviet ss24 and ss25 missiles 
it is the position of the united states that such missiles 
should be banned unless the united states and the soviet union can 
reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective 
verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear 
weapons carried by such missiles us officials said 
us officials in a briefing paper given to reporters said 
that acceptable verification rules would require among other 
things restricting mobile missiles to specific geographical areas 
means to assure that spy satellites can keep tabs on all such 
weapons and the right to inspect sites to investigate suspected 
violations 
the two sides remained far apart on star wars and how to 
negotiate reductions in conventional armies 
we have missed a chance to take an important step forward 
gorbachev told reporters 
the kremlin leader who has used all four meetings with reagan 
as forums to air his opposition to star wars said he had proposed 
resolving the problem by exchanging data allowing mutual inspection 
of facilities where technology for an antimissile defense is 
tested 
but no strategic arms treaty is possible he said without an 
agreement assuring that development and deployment of strategic 
defenses does not violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
and a fifth summit would not be possible without a start deal he 
said 
on the opening day of the talks us and soviet officials said 
gorbachev suggested to reagan that they exchange data on 
conventional arms as a means of making drastic cuts as proposed by 
the russians in 1986 
us officials say they will not directly negotiate conventional 
cuts with the soviets because the matter must be agreed upon by 
the 33 nations taking part in the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe 
those talks also include discussion of alleged soviet violations 
of human rights provisions of the original conference accord 
signed in helsinki in 1975

delegates to a special united nations 
session on disarmament on wednesday urged the united states and the 
soviet union to ban underground weapons tests and scrap their 
nuclear arsenals 
speakers began addressing the special session as president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev concluded their moscow 
summit meeting with an impasse on achieving major cuts in strategic 
nuclear weapons 
but the assembly praised the superpower treaty eliminating 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons as a breakthrough because it 
scraps a whole class of nuclear weapons for the first time 
prime minister ingvar carlsson of sweden called for complete 
nuclear disarmament and said the use of nuclear arms could threaten 
the survival of civilization 
one cannot reach peace by frightening other countries he 
said 
the united nations could and should have a central role in the 
sphere of disarmament and is the most appropriate organization to 
carry out verification functions on behalf of the international 
community he said 
it can provide unique services as a repository of data and 
source of impartial observers and experts he said 
he called for 50 percent cuts in strategic weapons complete 
abolition of all tactical nuclear weapons prevention of a nuclear 
arms race in outer space a comprehensive nuclear test ban the 
signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and the removal of 
nuclear weapons from naval vessels 
carlsson also condemned the use of chemical weapons in the 
iraniraq war and said the buildup of antipersonnel lasers also 
must be stopped 
prime minister noboru takeshita of japan the only nation that 
has been the target of an atomic attack said his people pray for 
disarmament japans constitution prohibits the presence or 
development of nuclear weapons 
takeshita announced that japan plans to convene an international 
conference with the united nations to share japanese technology in 
seismology to verify nuclear testing he said it could serve as 
step toward establishing a global system for verification of 
nuclear testing 
he said japan would increase its assistance to the united 
nations to prevent conflicts noting that japan recently 
contributed 20 million to the united nations including 5 million 
for use in afghanistan where the world body mediated a settlement 
the japanese leader said he was considering the dispatch of 
personnel for election supervision transportation communication 
and medical services to afghanistan 
president robert g mugabe of zimbabwe delivered the opening 
address as chairman of the nonaligned movement he condemned the 
superpowers for the nuclear arms race and said military spending 
should be diverted to development 
he said the international community must work toward achieving a 
nuclearfree world with the help of the united nations and the 
multilateral conference on disarmament 
mugabe called for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty a 
measure opposed by the united states and he opposed the 
militarization of outer space a reference to the us spacebased 
missile defense initiative or star wars he called for the 
establishment of nuclearfree zones including africa 
more than 25 heads of state and government will address the

president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev acknowledged after five days of summit talks wednesday 
that they remain divided by serious differences over efforts to 
end regional conflicts from central america to the middle east 
nonetheless us officials held out hope for progress in 
southern africa and the two leaders cited the soviet pullout from 
afghanistan as an example of what the superpowers can achieve if 
they work together with warring factions 
gorbachev sent a strong signal that soviet forces withdrawing 
from afghanistan would return fire if subjected to continuing 
attacks from moslem rebels battling the sovietbacked government in 
kabul 
we shall react accordingly and appropriately said 
gorbachev referring to recent assaults on soviet troops and the 
soviet embassy in kabul that should be absolutely clear 
the soviets disclosed last week that more than 13000 of their 
troops had been killed since they intervened in afghanistan in 
december 1979 
a senior us official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said gorbachev raised the issue of attacks on 
withdrawing troops directly with reagan this week on saturday the 
soviet foreign ministry publicly protested continued arms shipments 
to the afghan rebels from pakistan 
another us official also speaking privately well stand by 
pakistan 
soviet chief of staff marshal sergei akhromeyev was reported to 
have presented a detailed plan for withdrawal of the estimated 
115000 soviet troops in afghanistan indicating that moscow 
intends to abide by the geneva agreement to remove all its forces 
by feb 15 
the final communique issued by reagan and gorbachev said their 
talks had revealed serious differences both in the assessments of 
the causes of regional tensions and in the means to overcome them 
the leaders were able to agree only that these differences 
need not be an obstacle to constructive interaction on regional 
conflicts the statement said 
in other developments 
gorbachev told a televised postsummit news conference that 
the soviets are ready to consider restoring diplomatic relations 
with israel once an international conference on the middle east is 
convened but he said several issues yet to be resolved included 
palestinian participation in the conference and topics to be 
discussed 
the soviet union and all its eastern bloc allies except romania

a progovernment newspaper wednesday 
published what it claimed was a 2yearold us document calling 
for the destabilization of panama and refusal to turn over the 
panama canal in 1999 
the us embassy called the publication of the alleged 1986 us 
national security council document in the newspaper critica an 
obvious and gross falsification and a continuation of the 
permanent campaign of propaganda of the noriega regime against the 
united states of america 
the paper said the document was secret and sensitive and 
that only seven copies were made for distribution at an nsc meeting 
april 8 1986 the newspaper said president reagan took part in the 
meeting although the reproduction of the alleged document made no 
mention of reagan 
the reproduction of the document said the basic issue is 
still to guarantee us control over the interoceanic waterway 
keeping it free from soviet influence after the year 2000 
it said the panamanian government might be exposed to cuban and 
soviet intervention after the united states turns over the canal 
reports of corruption among some panamanian officers provide 
an opportunity to launch a campaign to destabilize panama and 
legitimately abrogate the treaties said the reproduction which 
contains several mispellings and typographical errors 
the panama canal treaties returned the panama canal zone to 
panama in 1977 and call for panama to take over the waterway itself 
at the end of 1999 
since the united states and panama began a dispute about a year 
ago panamanan officials often have accused the united states of 
planning to back out of the agreement 
the united states is seeking to oust gen manuel antonio 
noriega who is head of the 15000member panama defense forces and 
the power behind the civilian government noriega was indicted in 
february by a federal grand jury in florida on drug smuggling 
charges 
the reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions on 
panama in an effort to force noriegas ouster

presidential hopeful jesse jackson 
walked on a garbagecovered beach wednesday and called on 
corporations and the federal government to battle pollution more 
vigorously 
jacksons campaign stop capped five days of seeking votes in new 
jersey which has its primary next tuesday the biggest delegate 
prize on that day is california though and the democratic 
contender headed back to that state late wednesday 
in new jersey stepping over broken glass plastic bottles 
fastfood containers and a womans shoe jackson described this 
onetime popular resort beach along the arthur kill as an example 
of economic and environmental violence 
if the russians were poisoning our air if they were dumping 
sludge in the water if they were killing fish we would call that 
chemical warfare and we would negotiate tough said jackson 
nearly all the trash on the beach here including such hospital 
waste as used syringes and plasma bags floats across from the 
fresh kills landfill in staten island ny and residents speak 
harshly of new yorks disposal practices 
but jackson said corporations and the federal government were 
most to blame for the pollution he said that cleaning up the shore 
and toxic waste dumps would create jobs and protect the publics 
health 
this idea that its coming from one state to another is one 
focus but in my judgment its too narrow a focus said jackson 
the federal government has an obligation we must invest in 
recycliong plants we must challenge these corporations and offer 
them incentives to build these recycling plants 
jackson who lags far behind democratic frontrunner michael 
dukakis in new jersey polls used his stay in the state to further 
define what he would want at the party convention in atlanta 
on wednesday he said the party needs him if it wants a victory 
in november and said again he deserves consideration as vice 
president should he not get the presidential nomination 
dukakis campaigning in new jersey over the memorial day 
weekend also called for steppedup efforts to battle ocean 
pollution jackson asked how he differed from dukakis on 
environmental issues said the massachusetts governors reputation 
as a good manager is not enough to battle pollution 
i take the position that we cannot just manage these 
corporations as they exist their behavior must change they must 
be much more accountable said jackson 
as he walked along the beach a helicopter from the 
environmental protection agency skimmed the water local officials 
said they had never seen one before 
jackson attributed the helicopters arrival to action 
jackson a phrase he urges crowds to chant during rallies and 
said the agency has been ineffective against polluters 
richard cahill a spokesman for the epa in new york said the 
helicopter was part of the agencys routine shore monitoring 
program and its appearance wednesday was coincidental

some human rights observers questioned 
president reagans assertion wednesday that soviet emigration 
barriers are the result of bureaucratic bungling but gave the 
president high marks overall on his handling of the issue at the 
moscow summit 
its really hard to know where reagan was coming from on 
that said dawn mann a fellow at the center for strategic and 
international studies an independent policy research institute 
the fact that there still are several hundred prisoners of 
conscience is not attributable to bureaucratic snafus 
at his news conference in moscow reagan said emigration 
barriers may arise from a kremlin bound in by bureaucracy 
rather than deliberate soviet policy 
i think its unfortunate that the president was not more 
direct about the real reasons for human rights violations in the 
soviet union said juliana pilon a soviet scholar at the 
conservative heritage foundation after all who is he kidding 
it just isnt true 
but a democratic congressman who studies human rights issues 
rep gus yatron dpa dismissed reagans comments as stemming 
from a desire not to criticize his host too harshly while still in 
the soviet union i think it was more protocol than timidity on 
human rights said yatron chairman of the house foreign affairs 
human rights subcommittee 
i can think of no one in congress or the administration who 
feels that moscows repressive policies are not the results of the 
repressive nature of a communist government yatron said i 
would want to give the president the benefit of the doubt 
reagans comment which declined to pin responsibilty for 
emigration denials directly on soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
really was a skillful diplomatic gesture said rep gerald solomon 
rny the senior republican on yatrons panel 
that gives wiggle room for gorbachev to react and without 
confrontational demands solomon said im confident that it 
will work 
solomon and others said overall reagan had made human rights a 
far higher priority at this fourth summit meeting than at previous 
meetings with gorbachev and predicted improvements in soviet 
emigration and other human rights areas 
i thought he was very forceful in his presentation of human 
rights yatron said i am cautiously optimistic that the 
presidents aggressive posture will spark more reforms 
we couldnt have hoped for more as a human rights 
organization said jeri laber of helsinki watch in new york 
the president has certainly made this an important issue by 
meeting with dissidents in the soviet union and making strong 
statements about us human rights values 
but she said being diplomatic isnt always the best approach 
when dealing with such an issue of inalienable rights youve got 
to be vocal and verbal and insistent even to the point of 
irritating those you are dealing with said laber we recognize 
he has a balancing act to do given all of that hes done a very 
good job 
only time will tell said mann if more people are 
released in the next several weeks if there are concrete actions 
then we can say reagan was right to have been so tactful theres 
so much that we dont know

orders to us factories surged for the second 
consecutive month in april the government said wednesday 
indicating that us manufacturing plants will be humming in the 
months ahead 
the commerce department said orders for durable and nondurable 
goods rose a strong 12 percent to a seasonally adjusted 2187 
billion in april the advance followed an even bigger 16 percent 
increase in march 
the boomlike conditions in factory america continue pretty 
much unabated said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
there was no change in order levels in february and a modest 06 
percent drop in january but that was one of only two declines in 
the past year 
most economists had been forecasting only modest growth in new 
orders of 05 percent in april the biggerthanexpected number 
likely will do little to alleviate concern among some analysts that 
strong demand particularly for exports will trigger greater 
inflation 
david wyss chief financial economist at data resources inc a 
lexington mass forecasting firm noted the continuing increase 
in the backlog of unfilled orders indicating manufacturers have 
been getting more orders than they can meet 
this should be good news for production in coming months 
wyss said 
the backlog of 4181 billion was 108 percent higher than a 
year ago it jumped by 1 percent in april following a smaller 
increase of 04 percent in march 
the strength in new orders in april came in electrical 
machinery lumber and wood products and in petroleum chemicals and 
paper 
the department revised its estimate of new orders for durable 
goods big ticket items expected to last three or more years 
to 1164 billion up 10 percent the previous estimate for april 
released 10 days ago was 08 percent the gain in march had been 
08 percent 
orders for nondurable goods increased 15 percent to 1022 
billion in april following a 25 percent rise a month earlier 
excluding the volatile category of military goods orders were 
up 12 percent in april the third consecutive increase and the 
sixth rise in seven months 
defense goods rose 22 percent to 100 billion in april 
following a whopping 146 percent rise in march 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a 
barometer of business expansion plans rose 19 percent in april to 
331 billion following a drop of 38 percent 
analysts are looking for businesses to boost capital spending to 
meet the rising demand abroad for us goods which have become 
more competitively priced because of the devalued dollar 
orders for electrical machinery climbed 42 percent following a 
38 percent slide in march most of the april strength in that 
category came from a large 254 percent rise in orders for 
communication equipment most of them from the defense department 
orders for primary metals such as steel declined 03 percent in 
april while orders for transportation equipment climbed a slight 
01 percent and nonelectrical machinery fell 06 percent 
shipments of manufactured goods were unchanged at 2146 billion 
in april following a 27 percent increase in march

here is a transcript of soviet communist party 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachevs remarks wednesday on 
exchanging documents with president reagan putting the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty into effect 
esteemed mr reagan distinguished ladies and gentleman 
comrades 
we are approaching the end of the meeting between the leaders of 
the soviet union and the united states of america the fourth such 
meeting in three years the visit of the united states president to 
our country is drawing to a close 
the president and i have summed up the results of a dialogue 
between our two countries at the highest level we have discussed 
both the immediate and the longer term prospects for sovietus 
relations 
we have signed documents which record what has been achieved and 
provide guidelines for the future among them a historic place 
will belong to the ratification documents which give effect to the 
treaty and intermediate and shorter range missiles 
the exchange a few minutes ago of the instruments of 
ratification means that the era of nuclear disarmament has begun 
assessing the work done over these past few days we can state 
our satisfaction say what has been happening these few days in 
moscow is big politics politics that effect the interests of 
millions and millions of people 
each such meting dealt a blow at the foundations of cold war 
each of them made huge breaches in the cold war fortress and opened 
up passages to modern civilized world politics worthy of the truly 
new times 
but big politics means difficult politics in which every step 
is not easy to take weighing carefully each one of our new steps 
we measure it against the security interests of our two nations and 
of the world as a whole for that is the only way to achieve truly 
substantial results with the necessary margin of viability 
big politics also means big responsibility and so it cannot be 
built on pursuing ones own interest which is always inherently 
onesided 
such politics also needs a great idea humankind has conceived 
that idea in the pangs of wars and disasters tragedies and 
calamities strivings and discoveries of the 20th century 
this is in our view is the idea of a nuclearfree and 
nonviolent world it is that idea that is inscribed in the mandate 
which the soviet people give to their representatives at the start 
to any negotiations this particularly applies to our negotiations 
with the united states of america 
addressing the soviet people and the americans addressing all 
nations from these hallowed steps of the moscow kremlin i hereby 
declare we have been working honestly and with perseverance and we 
shall continue to do so to fulfill that historic mandate 
the first lines have already been written into the book of a 
world without violence and wars and nuclear weapons i believe that 
no one can now close that book and put it aside 
president ronald reagan and i have agreed that the immediate 
task before us which is to conclude a treaty on 50 percent 
reduction in strategic offensive arms can and must be accomplished 
in our joint endeavors and discussions we have learned to 
understand each other better to take into account each others 
concerns and to search for solutions 
the atmosphere in our relations is improving we are working to 
make it a constant not only in our official contacts but also in 
the daytoday management of sovietus relations in this too we 
are guided by a mandate from our peoples 
thanks to the atmosphere of the meetings in washington and 
moscow and as a result of agreements reached americans and soviet 
people now have more opportunities for communication and for 
getting to know each other im convinced that scientists 
students schoolchildren cultural personalities ordinary 
tourists athletes and of course businessmen will continue to 
enlarge and add new colors to the fabric of cooperative and even 
friendly relations sometimes they can do that better than 
politicians 
historians who will one day describe and evaluate what is now 
being done have probably not yet been born but every day babies 
are being born who will live in the 21st century and to whom we 
must bequeath a safe and humane world 
on behalf of the soviet leadership and the soviet people i wish 
to tell all those who are concerned and yet hopeful about the 
future we shall work to achieve that goal and we can only do it 
by working together 
thank you

here is the text of president reagans remarks 
wednesday after he and mikhail gorbachev exchanged instruments of 
ratification on the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
mr general secretary these are historic moments as we 
exchange these documents the instruments of ratification on this 
treaty the terms of which we formally agreed to last december in 
washington enters into force mr general secretary you know that 
our way here has not been easy at crucial moments your personal 
intervention was needed and proved decisive and for this we are 
grateful 
so too mr general secretary you are aware of how important 
the objective not just of arms control but of arms reduction has 
been to my own thinking and to the policy of my administration 
since its outset seven years ago when i first suggested the 
concept of a double zero treaty there were those who said that 
this was so unrealistic an idea that it was irresponsible to even 
propose it others simply dismissed the proposals as a propaganda 
ploy or a geopolitical gambit skepticism and doubt bring a barren 
harvest today on this table before us we see the fruits of hope 
evidence of what candor and realism can accomplish we have dared 
to hope mr general secretary and we have been rewarded 
for the first time in history an entire class of ussoviet 
nuclear missiles is eliminated in addition this treaty provides 
for the most stringent verification in history and for the first 
time in history inspection teams are actually in residence in our 
respective countries but while this treaty makes possible a new 
dimension of cooperation between us much remains on our agenda we 
must not stop here mr general secretary there is much more to be 
done as will be seen in our joint statement later today more 
progress has been made toward a strategic arms treaty during our 
meetings we must try to move forward in the months ahead to 
complete this start treaty as soon as possible so let us continue 
to expand the frontiers of trust even as we verify mr general 
secretary even as we verify 
mr general secretary we have agreed many times that there 
remain differences important fundamental differences between 
us yet as we work over the long run to narrow these differences 
as we work for what i hope will be a new era of peace and expanded 
human freedom we must also acknowledge our solemn responsibility 
to take steps now to reduce the chances of conflict and to prevent 
war this we have done today the first step toward a brighter 
future a safer world 
americas allies and friends welcome this treaty too we 
consulted them fully during its negotiation we made clear that we 
would never put their security or their interests at risk that on 
the contrary we would sign a treaty only if it enhanced their 
security as this one does 
and finally if i may i would like to take a moment to thank 
the united states senate for their work on this treaty the way of 
democracy is sometimes a complicated way sometimes trying but it 
is a good way and we believe the best way and once again mr 
general secretary i want to extend to you and to all those to who 
labored hard for this moment my warmest personal thanks

physicians are overpromising success to women 
desperate to have children and there is need for congressional 
oversight of the 30 million to 40 million testtube baby 
industry congress was told wednesday 
under the best of circumstances infertile couples already 
face invasive medical procedures the risk of dangerous 
complications and low success rates said rep ron wyden dore 
frustrated couples many at an emotional breaking point 
shouldnt also have to face those who would exploit their faith in 
modern medicine 
wyden chairman of the house small business subcommittee on 
regulation and business opportunities said he wants to determine 
what role the government should play in protecting wouldbe parents 
from unscrupulous clinics 
he called attention to a recent study that found more than half 
of the 169 clinics in the united states performing invitro 
fertilization ivf in 1987 never produced a baby 
despite advances in technology and the claims made by some 
clinics the chance of having a baby from ivf still hovers at one 
in ten wyden said this slim opportunity costs most couples 
thousands of dollars the subcommittee has heard of couples 
spending over 22000 without yielding a baby in the bassinet 
the infertility study for the congressional office of technology 
assessment showed americans spent 1 billion last year to combat 
infertility 
gary ellis who directed the ota study told the subcommittee 
the chances of becoming clinically pregnant when a fetuss 
heartbeat is detected by ultrasound machines is about 17 percent 
and a woman still faces a one in three chance that the pregnancy is 
ectopic or that it will end in a miscarriage or stillbirth an 
ectopic pregnancy is one outside the uterus 
therefore he said a womans chance of taking home a testtube 
baby is about 6 percent 
he said that infertility generally defined as the inability of 
a couple to conceive after 12 months of intercourse without 
contraception affects an estimated 24 million married couples and 
an unknown number of wouldbe parents among unmarried couples and 
singles 
wydens subcommittee also heard from a woman vicki eckhardt 
who said a fertility expert over a fouryear span told her seven 
times that she was pregnant but that each time would find the 
fetus had been absorbed her husband bill said they had spent 
35000 on infertility treatments only to learn from another 
doctor that mrs eckhardt probably never had been pregnant 
the doctor she said out and out lied to use telling us i 
was pregnant 
each time i felt like i had failed again that my own body was 
killing our baby mrs eckhardt said but then i would get that 
little urge again and want a baby so badly that i would go through 
anything 
its hard to explain to other people but when you want a baby 
so badly and youre afraid you may never be able to have one its 
all you can think about it affects the way you see the whole 
world

against gov michael dukakis and his top budget officer contending 
spending cuts ordered to balance the state budget were 
unconstitutional and would delay community placement of state 
hospital patients 
the suit by the alliance for the mentally ill said human 
services programs bear too much of the burden in the cancellation 
of nearly 250 million in planned state spending for the fiscal 
year that ends june 30 
the suit filed with the state supreme court also asserted that 
dukakis and state secretary of administration and finance fran 
keefe acted unconstitutionally in rolling back spending without the 
approval of the legislature 
the alliance asked for an injunction prohibiting the dukakis 
administration from ordering the reversions cuts that do not 
affect basic services but cancel or trim planned program expansion 
no hearing date was set 
dukakis whose state budget problems have become an issue in his 
democratic presidential campaign has defended his administrations 
record in aiding the mentally ill 
he has said the past three years have seen the most 
significant expansion in the history of the state in spending for 
the mentally ill 
well do everything we can to make sure patient care is first 
class in our state hospitals dukakis said that is a 
commitment i feel very strongly

pill an intrauterine device or male or female sterilization a 
medium level of use in comparison to the other countries that 
showing is largely due to widespread use of sterilization

to get american military forces out of the 
philippines soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev should offer much 
more than shutting down the biggest soviet overseas base at cam 
ranh bay vietnam us military strategist brent scowcroft said 
wednesday 
a cam ranhphilippines tradeoff by the superpowers would be 
very much in the soviet interest but not necessarily ours said 
scowcroft a retired air force lieutenant general and national 
security adviser in the ford administration 
the russians dont need that cam ranh nearly as much as we 
do the philippines he said 
scowcroft spoke at a news conference marking the issuance of a 
new expert study on forthcoming usphilippines base negotiations 
produced for the us council on foreign relations a nonprofit 
nonpartisan organization 
the study noted that the massive soviet military presence at cam 
ranh bay is used as justification for the us military presence in 
the philippines and vice versa analysts have said gorbachevs july 
1986 asian policy speech suggesting a us pullout from the 
philippines implied an offer to reduce the soviet presence in 
vietnam 
the philippine bases clark field air base and subic bay naval 
station are vital for deploying us forces to the indian ocean 
and persian gulf while the soviets can get to the indian ocean 
through the back door from the other direction scowcroft said 
he predicted that practical benefits to both countries are 
likely to result in enough accomodation to produce a new 
usphilippines base agreement when the current one expires in 
1991 there is a fair chance that cool heads will prevail he 
said 
scowcroft and prof fred greene a williams college asian 
affairs expert and editor of the 155page study emphasized that 
the issues are complex tangled and emotional 
ever since 1947 washington has handled base arrangements with 
the philippines through executive agreements requiring majority 
votes in congress for implementation 
however a twothirds senate vote is required to ratify a 
treaty and many in the philippines are demanding this form for the 
next base agreement so as to highlight philippine sovereignty and 
us payment obligations greene said 
that would play into the hands of american senators and others 
who for budget or policy reasons would like to have reductions 
around the world especially if the philippines insists on a 
treaty greene said 
estimating that 20 percent of filipinos oppose the bases he 
said many are very intense and eloquent in their opposition

iii will remain at the justice department until the end of the 
reagan administration 
during his first day on the job christensen said i dont have 
any sense of crisis at all and that the department is 
functioning well despite a wave of departures in the past few 
months

charge this week at the justice department with meese leaving on a

dont have any today

resign before labor day but said he first wants to respond to 
allegations concerning his ties to scandalplagued wedtech corp 
and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project

criminal investigation of meese for the past year is expected to 
issue a report this month raising questions about meeses ethical

deputy attorney general arnold burns and excriminal division chief 
william weld who resigned in protest march 29 over meeses 
continued tenure

us farm exports in march climbed to a 
3year high of 148 million tons valued at 33 billion the 
agriculture department announced wednesday 
agriculture is making an important contribution to the trade 
balance of the united states agriculture secretary richard e 
lyng said in a speech to the national press club before the figures 
were released 
in his remarks lyng predicted around 33 billion in export 
sales this year and a positive farm trade balance of perhaps 12 
billion 
march exports easily topped figures for the same month last 
year which were 114 million tons valued at 24 billion it was 
the best monthly performance since december 1984 
the nation posted an agricultural trade surplus in march of 
138 billion the fifth straight month that the balance sheet has 
been 1 billion or more in the black the department said it said 
the march surplus was the largest since december 1984 also 
fiscal 1988 agricultural exports through march totaled 773 
million tons valued at 178 billion usda said it said that 
represented an increase of 136 million tons and 33 billion from 
the same period last year 
agriculture department economists are forecasting fiscal 1988 
exports totaling 1455 million tons and valued at 335 billion 
that represents an increase over initial estimates the higher 
forecasts are due to additional sales of animal and horticultural 
products as well as wheat feeds and fodders and soybeans 
animal products are likely to set a record of 56 billion 
attributable to surprisingly strong demand for hides skins red 
meats and fats the department said 
exports are expected to be 16 million tons and 56 billion 
higher than fiscal 1987 the department said it attributed the 
bulk of the increase to diminished supplies among competitor 
nations and the export enhancement program 
the export enhancement program established by congress in 1985 
pays exporters in government surplus commodities to ship american 
grain overseas 
meanwhile the department increased its estimate of us 
agricultural imports from 205 billion to 21 billion it said 
imports for march totaled 195 billion a gain of 35 million or 
2 percent over the comparable figure for march 1987 it also was 
24 million or 1 percent over the february level 
volume of agricultural imports are virtually unchanged since 
last year and fruit juices nursery products and alcoholic 
beverages actually posted declines the department said but it 
said the lower dollar has pushed up the total import bill

eli lilly amp co has dealt a serious setback to 
the reagan administrations anticocaine program by refusing to 
allow use of a safe and effective herbicide against 
cocaproducing areas in south america the state department said 
wednesday 
we think the shortterm impact is serious said state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley alluding to lillys decision 
last week not to sell to the us government the herbicide 
tebuthurion in a coca eradication campaign focused mainly in perus 
huallaga valley 
she said the firm which is the sole manufacturer of the 
chemical should reconsider its decision in light of the serious 
cocaine problem in the united states on capitol hill rep glenn 
english dokla expressed outrage over lillys decision 
the indianapolisbased company gave no reason for its decision 
in making the announcement last week citing only a number of 
practical and policy considerations 
but mrs oakley told reporters lilly apparently was worried 
about possible retaliatory measures by traffickers or 
terrorists the company also had come under pressure from 
environmentalists who were concerned about the ecological impact of 
the herbicide 
mrs oakley said the state department would have preferred to 
have worked with the company on resolving its security concerns 
she said the united states and latin american governments have 
been conducting field tests to identify a safe effective herbicide 
for use against coca for several years 
tebuthurion known informally as spike was considered to be 
among the safest and most effective but no final decision had been 
made about which herbicide should be used mrs oakley said 
according to our information the safety and effectiveness of 
spike has been clearly demonstrated and defended by the company 
numerous environmental tests have been carried out in compliance 
with federal regulations she said 
meanwhile ann b wrobleski assistant secretary of state for 
international narcotics matters said lilly made the decision even 
though the herbicide has been manufactured for more than 15 years 
has been proven safe by us standards and is widely available in 
this country for projects such as clearing brush for rights of way 
the chemical is sold to other government agencies including the 
interior departments bureau of land management she said 
testifying before a house government operations subcommittee 
assessing the war on drugs ms wrobleski said state department 
lawyers are researching whether to propose legislation that would 
compel lilly to sell the state department the chemical in the 
vital national interests of the united states government 
the safety of lillys employees must be weighed against public 
concerns about the 5 million regular users of cocaine and our 
desperate need for a chemical solution to widespread coca 
cultivation in the andes she said 
english chairman of the subcommittee said he was stunned and 
outraged at lilly and called the company a deserter in the 
war on drugs he insisted that company representatives appear 
before his panel to explain their decision 
were going to go to any length possible to get our hands on 
the herbicide for use in spraying programs in peru bolivia and 
colombia ms wrobleski said 
she said coca crops currently are destroyed by chopping them 
down a slow process that eradicates less than 1 percent of the 
total 
unless we push the chemical button we cannot dent that 
problem appreciably ms wrobleski said

general hospital he was expected to remain in the pediatric 
intensive care unit several days 
three surgeons from the university of south florida college of 
medicine spent from 315 pm tuesday until 1220 am in the 
operating room 
preliminary procedures had been performed said dr thomas 
e mckell vice president of medical affairs regrettably the 
injury was so severe with so much destruction of the tissue that 
it was not possible to rejoin the extremity

city had gone to a barn at singletary farms where his mother was 
working according to a coowner of the 75acre vegetable farm 
he stuck his arm into the machine and it got caught under 
the conveyor belt on the roller said earl singletary who was

team were called in 
singletary said tuesday that the child should not have been in 
the barn

the federal aviation administration plans to 
play a greater role in keeping aviation out of the drug trafficking 
business the agencys chief said wednesday 
faa administrator allan mcartor announced he is assigning 13 
people within the faa to a special office that will deal 
exclusively with illegal drug trafficking issues 
this is a serious problem and we want to be a serious 
player mcartor told reporters after disclosing his antidrug 
plans in a speech to the international aviation club 
mcartor said he wasnt ready to provide details as to exactly 
what the new faa office would do except to say it would coordinate 
the agencys efforts to battle the smuggling of illegal drugs by 
air 
were going to be developing their mission as we go along 
mcartor said adding that the group may be expanded in the future 
he said the faa officials would have no enforcement or police 
powers and that he had no intention of confiscating commercial 
aircraft should small amounts of drugs be found 
the coast guard and customs service recently have been 
criticized for confiscating expensive yachts under a zero 
tolerance antidrug enforcement program when only small amounts 
of an illegal drug were found 
mcartor said the new faa office would consist of agency security 
officers inspectors and perhaps even air traffic controllers 
the shift of manpower from the inspector and controller ranks 
comes at a time when the faa has acknowledged shortages in both 
areas mcartor conceded that the commitment of 13 people is a big 
deal for the agency but that he wants the faa to become a full 
player in the war against illegal drugs 
he also suggested the airlines and private pilot groups begin 
to help police themselves to keep illegal drugs out of our 
industry

an aviation industry stunned by the inflight 
breakup last month of an aloha airlines jet began a formal 
reexamination wednesday of how to ensure that aging aircraft are 
kept safe 
more than 350 representatives from airlines aircraft 
manufacturers government agencies and various aviation safety 
groups launched a threeday conference by debating whether the 
industrys approach to maintaining the safety of older planes is 
adequate 
faa administrator allan mcartor suggested that a central 
question which must be resolved is whether to continue the current 
philosophy that relies heavily on inspections or shift the focus to 
a system of mandatory repairs or at some point mandatory aircraft 
retirement 
concerns about aging aircraft among the commercial airliner 
fleets surfaced last month when a 20foot section of an aloha 
airlines boeing 737 tore away at 24000 feet a flight attendant 
was swept to her death but the pilots managed to get the plane on 
the ground 
the 19yearold aloha plane was one of the oldest boeing 737s in 
service and had accumulated nearly 90000 takeoffs and landings 
investigators believe cracking and corrosion in the upper forwared 
part of the cabin likely caused the section of the plane to peel 
away during flight 
the central question confronting wednesdays conference centered 
on why the apparent cracking and corrosion on the aloha plane were 
not detected by inspectors an faa directive last year had required 
closer inspection of older aircraft for cabin skin cracking and 
corrosion 
during the threeday meeting the industry representatives are 
expected to debate whether aircraft design improvements need to be 
made and what steps need to be taken to improve the maintenance and 
inspection process so that such failures will not occur in the 
future 
i think we might find that the procedures are adequate but 
im not convinced the procedures are being done with as much 
discipline as we might expect mcartor suggested in remarks to 
reporters he said he did not expect any conclusive findings to 
come out of the conference but said it likely will spawn 
additional private sessions in the coming months on the aging 
aircraft issue 
several members of congress addressed the group and raised 
concerns about the maintenenance of older jetliners 
rep dan glickman dkan suggested that the faa buy old 
jetliners and test them to determine when a plane no longer can be 
considred safe 
only by answering the question how long can airplanes really 
last will we be able to put into place guideines which could save 
thousands of lives said glickman 
but william hoover of the air transport associaton the airline 
trade group said that aircraft if properly maintained and 
inspected can be flown safely throughout their economically 
useful life and well beyond their design life 
one of the questions confronting the conference however is 
whether the industry should continue to use economic life as 
the key factor in determining when a plane should be taken of 
service suggested john enders an aviation consultant for the 
flight safety foundation 
as for the heavy emphasis on inspections glickman said the 
aloha accident demonstrates the inadequacies of the faas 
maintenance inspection system aloha airlines officials have said 
repeatedly that they followed all required inspections on the 
boeing 737 that broke apart in flight 
it obviously wasnt sufficient said enders the aviation 
consultant the aloha inspections were not enough to give the 
early warning signs

the soviet union has barred the entry of 
several israeli and british lawyers invited to a june 57 moscow 
conference on trade and human rights a jewish emigration group 
said wednesday 
yoram dinstein an israeli expert on emigration was listed on 
the advance meeting schedule as the western participant with two 
soviet lawyers in a public discussion of human rights said jerry 
goodman director of the national conference on soviet jewry 
however soviet authorities did not grant visas to dinstein and 
three other israeli legal experts and also barred several 
prospective participants from britain including david winter a 
lawyer who has visited the soviet union more than 35 times goodman 
said 
the association of soviet lawyers and the londonbased 
international bar association are sponsoring the conference 
goodman said 
the national conference on soviet jewry issued a statement 
quoting the chairman of the groups lawyers committee herbert 
teitelbaum as saying dinsteins absence will leave the human 
rights session without a western respondent a situation which 
simply cannot be tolerated in the age of purported glasnost or 
openness 
he said there would be a call for a boycott of the human rights 
portion of the conference unless the soviets grant visas to the 
israelis 
this throwback to a hardline preglasnost era is 
troublesome especially on the heels of the just completed 
ussoviet summit meeting which sought to develop a more 
harmonious relationship in many areas teitelbaum said 
a man who answered the telephone at the soviet embassy said no

an explosion ripped through a coal 
shaft in central west germany today killing at least 16 miners and 
trapping 40 of their comrades more than 300 feet underground 
there is little hope that other miners can be found alive 
said gottfried milde the hesse state interior minister 
its horrible my husband is down there said ingrid henke 
35 my daughters are aged just one and two 
one woman who would not give her name but said her husband was 
not in the shaft said all the women in this part of town are 
doing their best to comfort each other 
mayor bernd hessler of borken told a news conference wednesday 
night the bodies of 16 miners had been found and the search 
continued for about 40 others 
what caused the blast had not been determined some reports said 
explosives stored in the shaft detonated and others said it was due 
to a buildup of coal dust 
i have no real hopes i think well have to bury a lot of 
people said klaus hausmann a mechanic who has worked at the 
mine for 20 years 
reports of the number of men trapped in the mine varied 
throughout the day with some officials putting it as high as 60 
and others as low as 54 milde said the total number including the 
confirmed dead was 56 
rescue crews managed to get about 300 feet underground before 
the shaft collapsed this reduces the chance of finding many 
survivors a police spokesman who requested anonymity told 
reporters 
he said rescue crews were pumping oxygen into the shaft 
gerhard heinz an engineer for mine owner preussen elektra said 
the explosion occurred in a pit between 200 and 450 feet below 
ground preussen elektra of hanover is one of the largest utility

a western diplomatic source said today that 28 
refusenik cases have not been cleared for emigration contrary to 
information that a jewish refusenik leader provided earlier to 
members of the news media 
the diplomatic source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the jewish leader had misunderstood information exchanged at a 
meeting of six refuseniks and assistant secretary of state richard 
shifter 
yuli kosharovsky who has been refused permission to emigrate 
for 17 years said in a telephone interview that the refuseniks 
gave shifter a list of 400 refusenik cases in a meeting saturday 
the americans made a presentation about these cases and on 28 
of them they received positive answers he said 
but the diplomatic source said there had been a misunderstanding 
in the meeting and that the 28 cases had not been resolved 
other jewish refuseniks said today that more than a dozen 
families who previously had been denied permission to emigrate were 
told immediately before and during the moscow summit that they 
could leave 
refusenik bella gulko said the boris weinshtock and iosif 
pilmenshtein families of moscow had received permission to emigrate 
this week as well as a retiree she only could identify by the last 
name brave 
she said seven leningrad families also had receive permission to 
emigrate within the past week or 10 days 
the soviet decisions seemed to have been related to reagans 
visit mrs gulko said adding that usually there are only one or 
two approvals of exit visas in that length of time 
it was not known whether any of the names mentioned by mrs 
gulko were on kosharovskys list 
another refusenik leader sergei mkrtchyan said he was summoned 
to the moscow visa office on saturday and was given permission to 
emigrate on monday 
mkrtchyan is a leader of the poor relatives group of family 
members who refuse to waive financial claims to allow them to 
emigrate 
mkrtchyan his wife and yearold daughter demonstrated daily in 
downtown moscow last week he said he was called to the moscow visa 
office after the last demonstration on saturday 
mkrtchyan said he believed that reagans visit absolutely 
influenced the soviet authorities decision to allow him to leave 
the country after he was denied permission for three years he said 
pressure from other westerners and his own activities also helped 
kosharovsky said his list apparently did not include yuri and 
tanya zieman and their daughter vera the president had considered 
visiting the ziemans on sunday the day he arrived for summit talks 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev but decided against it 
us sources have said that soviet deputy foreign minister 
alexander bessmertnykh warned us ambassador jack f matlock last 
week that if reagan visited the ziemans they would never would be 
allowed to leave 
among others who met with reagan on monday and who apparently 
are not on the list approved for exit visas were benjamin charney 
valdimir kislik and abe stolar according to kosharovsky

the reagan administration has been unable to 
stem the flood of drugs into this country because of budget cuts 
and delays in making crucial detection equipment operational two 
federal agencies said wednesday 
coast guard commandant paul a yost and william rosenblatt the 
customs service enforcement chief told a house government 
operations subcommittee they increasingly were frustrated by their 
inability to throw more resources into the antidrug effort 
they gave the panel a long list of problems they encountered 
patrol boats and planes sitting idle due to a money shortage 
surveillance airplanes with cracks in their wings construction 
delays at new intelligence centers and delayed installation of 
radar balloons along the nations border with mexico 
yost whose new fast patrol boats and airplanes are operating 
at only 55 percent of last years levels said it was ironic that 
congress is ready to spend huges sums for an escalation of the 
militarys role in the drug war but cant find 60 million to get 
his vessels in the water and planes in the air full time 
turn me loose and dont give my mission away he told the 
government operations subcommittee on information justice and 
agriculture 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the panel was sharply 
critical of the customs service blaming the agency for delays in 
installing five radar balloons along the porous southwest border to 
detect airborne drug smugglers only one of the five balloons 
called aerostats is in operation 
this is a terrible failure he told rosenblatt you are 
costing us dearly theres no sense of urgency about this thats 
the problem 
rosenblatt described a series of delays in site selection 
environmental problems competitive bidding and even roadblocks 
from other government agencies 
we had to work around interference with the military and other 
agencies rosenblatt said in alpine texas he said there was a 
problem of interference with a private observatory in another 
instance rosenblatt said the national science foundation a 
government agency initially declined to allow an aerostat on a 
site 
that agency has changed its mind rosenblatt said 
two years later english interjected 
when rosenblatt said he spent four months seeking competitive 
bids for the radar balloons in an effort to save money english 
said in effect you cost us a heck of a lot of money because 
air force awacs surveillance planes have had to patrol the 
southwest border to pick up the slack english said that an awacs 
costs 7500 an hour to operate 
without a detection system interceptors and bust arrest 
teams are nearly worthless english said you hired pilots 
purchased aircraft and hired bust teams who have to sit on the 
ground for up to two years before they will be able to do their 
mission 
it calls into question whether the air interdictioin war is 
capable of being more than a skirmish in the next two years 
rosenblatt replied were trying our darndest to get these 
things in there i share your frustration 
yost called it an outrage that his agency had to cut back 
drug patrols he blamed congressional appropriations committees 
complaining that money was taken from the coast guard budget to pay 
for mass transit programs 
president reagan has asked for 60 million to be switched to the 
coast guard from other programs of the transportation department 
the parent agency but congress has not yet acted yost said 
my budget needs to be protected against mass transit yost 
said 
when yost told the panel that coast guard law enforcement teams 
stationed on navy ships seized just 20 drug vessels last year 
english said it doesnt seem were setting the world on fire 
he suggested reducing the program and using the money for fuel 
for the coast guards idle patrol boats

the head of a national academy of sciences 
committee on aids said wednesday that federal legislation shielding 
carriers of the virus from discrimination is crucial to fighting 
the epidemic 
calling that the first of equals among several other 
recommendations in a new report theodore cooper said providing 
adequate protection against discrimination would form the 
foundation for many other things that need to be done such as 
expanded voluntary testing for the virus 
the reagan administration opposes federal antidiscrimination 
laws to protect aids carriers and such protections were dropped 
recently from aids legislation working its way through congress 
cooper who is also chairman and chief executive officer of the 
upjohn co acknowledged that winning passage will not be easy he 
said the solution is to get the message to the attention of both 
the president and congress reiterate it and make it strong 
enough 
he called such a federal law banning discrimination 
fundamental to the success of the program to combat aids 
cooper said the need for strong guidance on such basic policy 
areas as discrimination legislation is one reason the committee 
recommended creation of a new highlevel aids commission to replace 
the white house panel that goes out of business later this month 
robin weiss staff director of the academys aids committee 
noted that the report issued wednesday places much greater 
emphasis on expanded voluntary testing than a 1986 report in 
part as a way to get a better handle on the extent to which the 
virus has spread 
such an expansion she added rests on comfort of people being 
protected against discrimination if they test positive 
indeed a major new element in the updated report a joint 
project of the academy and its institute of medicine is a call 
for revising the definition of aids as a disease to include the 
hundreds of thousands of americans unknowingly infected with the 
virus 
the committees recommendation to focus on the numbers of those 
infected with the virus rather than actual aids cases reported 
reflected what the panel said was a growing consensus that the 
vast majority of persons with the virus will eventually 
progress to aids if no treatment is found to slow or halt the 
progression of the infection 
the centers for disease control estimates that as many as 14 
million americans are infected with the virus 
the report said evidence is now scientifically conclusive 
that the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv is what causes aids 
the panel said many people infected with the virus suffer from 
clinical syndromes and laboratory test abnormalities that signal 
the presence of disease but do not meet technical guidelines for 
being listed as either aids or aidsrelated complex known as arc 
the committee believes that the term arc is no longer useful 
either from a clinical or a public health perspective and that hiv 
infection itself should be considered a disease said the report 
viewing hiv infection as a disease is important because it may 
eventually be amenable to treatment and patients will need to be 
diagnosed and treated as early as possible 
clinically it is more accurate to describe hiv infection as a 
continuum of conditions associated with immune dysfunction it 
said from a public health perspective the important event is 
infection rather than fullblown disease because even asymptomatic 
infected persons are capable of infecting others 
the report also called for development of federal standards for 
labs doing aids testing and spelled out that the only mandatory 
aids testing the committee backs is that involving the donation of 
blood and organs for transplant 
in the section calling for a new aids commission the committee 
singled out surgeon general c everett koop for continuing superb 
leadership and cited biomedical researchers the cdc and food and 
drug administration as areas of progress within the federal 
government 
nevertheless the committee has concluded that the federal 
response has been too uneven it said 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
as of may 23 aids had been diagnosed in about 62740 americans 
of whom more than half or 35188 have died since june 1981 
according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered from aids

reagan muted his criticism of soviet leadership and said soviet 
emigration restrictions may be bound in by bureaucracy rather 
than the result of deliberate kremlin policy 
the president said gorbachev was different than previous 
soviet leaders have been and that has eased differences between 
the superpowers but i am never going to relax my belief in the 
need for verification 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gorbachev characterized the summit as in depth at times 
intense and hailed reagan for disavowing his view of the soviet 
union as an evil empire 
on human rights he said that when reagan tried to persuade me 
to change my mind i said your explanations are not convincing 
i am not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit 
gorbachev also said the americans objected to describing the 
superpowers goal in the joint communique as peaceful 
coexistence or even coexistence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
although progress was reported on mobile missiles and 
airlaunched cruise missiles the two sides were still divided on 
the us star wars program submarinefired cruise missiles 
and reductions in conventional forces 
gorbachev told reporters it is still possible to sign an 
agreement in this administration reagan said progress is still 
being made or we wouldnt be talking as we are

than soviet policy for restrictions on emigration remarks that

here are some excerpts from the institute of 
medicine report on aids issued tuesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the committee believes that aids is a special case among current 
diseases it is a fatal infectious disease for which there is now 
no cure and its sufferers appear to remain infectious for life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the committee believes that the evidence that hiv causes aids is 
scientifically conclusive current information suggests that 
the vast majority of persons who are seropositive that is 
carrying antibodies for hiv will eventually progress to aids if 
no treatment is found to slow or halt the progression of the 
infection 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it has long been apparent that many hivinfected persons 
suffer from clinical syndromes and laboratory test abnormalities 
that signal the presence of disease but do not meet cdc centers 
for disease control criteria for aids earlier in the epidemic 
certain clusters of symptoms were said to belong to an aidsrelated 
complex arc which was incorporated in a cdc definition but never 
used for case reporting by now however the committee believes 
that the term arc is no longer useful either from a clinical or a 
public health perspective and that hiv infection itself should be 
considered a disease 
viewing hiv infection as a disease is iportant because it may 
eventually be amenable to treatment and patients will need to be 
diagnosed and treated as early as possible from a public 
health perspective the important event is infection rather than 
fullblown disease because even asymptomatic infected persons are 
capable of infecting others 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the committee believes that the fear of discrimination is a 
major constraint to the wide acceptance of many potentially 
effective public health measures 
the committee supports the enactment of a federal statute 
specifically designed to prevent discrimination on the basis of hiv 
infection or aids 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the committee believes that the gravity of the hiv epidemic is 
such that cdc should be allowed to purchase advertising time 
and space and should be supplied with the funds to do so 
explicit information on the risks associated with gay sex and 
the way those risks can be minimized does not promote or 
encourage homosexual activities 
one obstacle to more effective aids education has been the 
longstanding refusal of the media to accept commercial condom 
advertising 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the committee recommends expanded voluntary testing combined 
with counseling of all those whose behavior may have put them at 
risk for exposure to hiv those who test positive have a moral 
obligation to inform and protect their sexual or needlesharing 
partners 
the committee believes that at this time the only mandatory 
screening appropriate for public health purposes involves blood 
tissue and organ donation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the committee believes that the gross inadequacy of federal 
efforts to reduce hiv transmission among iv drug abusers when 
considered in relation to the scope and implications of such 
transmission is now the most serious deficiency in current efforts 
to control hiv infection in the united states 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the committee proposes the establishment of a national 
commission on aids with a fiveyear renewable term the commission 
chair should be a senior recognized leader engaged full time in 
this capacity and reporting directly to the president in addition 
to the chair the commission should consist of eight other members 
each of whom is a senior expert of national stature in one of the 
areas of particular relevance to aids each commissioner should in 
turn head a panel of experts

the reagan administrations chief negotiator 
in efforts to oust panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
said wednesday that noriega has not been strengthened by the 
collapse of the talks last week 
i dont think hes stronger by any means said michael 
kozak a deputy assistant secretary of state dispatched to talk to 
noriega and other panamanian officials in recent weeks 
hes not on a winning curve right now hes treading water 
thats something thats not gone away and its not going away 
kozak told the house foreign affairs western hemisphere 
subcommittee 
general noriega is a pretty skillful guy its not a stable 
situation for him he said 
kozak in his first public appearance since the talks began 
commented only generally on the situation in panama and declined to 
answer specific questions in open session about deals the united 
states had offered noriega or even how many times he had met 
personally with the military chief 
kozak deferred giving his answers until a closeddoor meeting of 
the subcommittee immediately after the public session saying he 
had given his word to noriega that the negotiations would be 
confidential 
he said only that the discussions were not aimed at dictating 
the composition of the panamanian government or the role of the 
panamanian defense forces which noreiga heads 
those were issues to be decided by panamanians perhaps with 
latin american mediation but not by the united states kozak 
said 
we continue to discuss with a number of governments in latin 
america the efforts they and we can undertake in pursuit of the 
goal of reestablishing constitutional government in panama he 
said 
kozak also declined to say specifically what other latin 
american countries were doing to help persuade noriega to 
relinquish power although he said there is strong support 
generally for the effort 
a number of latin american countries are sending their own 
emissaries to talk to noriega he said there is a fair degree of 
solidarity 
asked by subcommittee members to comment on rumors that noreiga 
has been able to cling to power because he has adverse information 
used to pressure us officials including vice president george 
bush kozak said he had no evidence that such information exists 
he has said nothing to me about any information on the vice 
president or anything else as far as i know theres nothing to 
it he said 
kozak said there is a danger that the united states might appear 
too impatient to be rid of noriega and conceded it had been a 
mistake to promote the belief that the problem could be solved 
quickly 
american impatience emboldens him he said of noriega

among those making errors were 13yearold awilda m cintron of 
ceiba puerto rico who did not begin learning to speak english 
until the third grade 
the eighthgrader misspelled the word strisciando a musical 
direction to play in a slurred smooth manner 
as the competitions second round began bee officials began 
handing to reporters a list of the words that had been asked during 
the first round 
but the distribution ceased when a reporter pointed out to a 
tournament official that the list misspelled the word 
hitchhike on the list the word was spelled hitchike 
it was a typing error said bee spokeswoman susan h miller 
the first entrant to drop out of the tournament was monekia l 
gause 11 of shallotte nc who misspelled the word jargon 
the sixthgrader spelled it jargin told she had 
misspelled the word she tugged at the sleeves of her pink dress 
and left the stage 
i never heard it before monekia said afterward 
the first rounds only other dropout was brian yates 11 of

by muting his criticism of soviet human rights 
abuses president reagan may be trying to speed up negotiations 
that would substantially cut red army forces in eastern europe 
reagan who built a political career bashing reds and in his 
first term called the soviet union an evil empire confounded 
observers on tuesday and wednesday by attributing kremlin human 
rights abuses to bureaucratic inertia and praising mikhail s 
gorbachev for trying to reform it 
reagan and his aides attributed the softening of the presidents 
rhetoric to gorbachevs efforts to reform the system 
but the answer to the riddle may lie in reagans oftenstated 
preference for quiet diplomacy and the link that us officials 
have established between human rights and the professed desired of 
both sides to reduce conventional arms in europe 
gorbachev at the opening of the summit on sunday night 
repeated to reagan his 1986 proposal for cuts of 500000 soldiers 
in the opposing armies of the north atlantic treaty alliance and 
the kremlinled warsaw pact 
nice idea said the americans but such reductions must come 
through negotiations involving all the allies on both sides and 
the ideal forum is the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe now under way in vienna 
those talks grew out of the 1975 helsinki accords in which the 
soviets pledged to observe human rights for 13 years the united 
states has accused the kremlin of violating the accords and soviet 
officials are now conceding as much releasing political prisoners 
and allowing greater public discussion of formerly taboo subjects 
many americans including sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee believe that sharp reductions in 
conventional forces should accompany the 30 percent to 50 percent 
cuts in longrange nuclear missiles envisioned in the proposed 
strategic arms reduction treaty 
from the american point of view the main objectives of reducing 
conventional arms would be a reduction in the 2to1 advantage the 
warsaw pact holds on tanks and a reduction in the 380000 red army 
troops in east germany 
although the edge may have dulled on reagans anticommunist 
rhetoric his schedule was designed to emphasize us concern with 
human rights he met with nearly 100 soviet dissidents at the 
residence of the american ambassador he pointedly praised the 
virtues of american democracy at every turn he chatted with with 
writers artists and students 
and us officials let it be known that reagan had canceled a 
meeting with the zieman family of jewish refuseniks because a 
highranking soviet official had warned that a visit to their home 
would kill their application to emigrate 
much of the hardball was being played behind the scenes said a 
senior administration official noting that the american and the 
soviet regularly but quietly were engaged in discussion of human 
rights issues 
the presidents statements would be hard to explain unless 
there was something going on behind the scenes and his spoken 
words were particularly puzzling in light of his extracurricular 
activities at the summit which appeared designed to focus 
attention on soviet human rights policy especially the 
difficulties that jews face in emigrating 
but on tuesday reagan told students at moscow state university 
that recalcitrant bureaucrats were to blame for soviet human rights 
abuses and under pointed questioning at a news conference on 
wednesday reagan said similar problems could be found everywhere 
i just have to believe that in any sort of government some of 
us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy reagan said 
and after four days of talks with gorbachev he expressed 
confidence that the kremlin leader was trying and would succeed in 
improving the situation 
soviet human rights activists attributed reagans comments on 
human rights to naivete 
the bureaucracy has nothing to do with it said tanya 
zieman whose family had waited in vain for reagans visit on 
sunday 
reagan and his aides may have been calculating that having made 
their views known in moscow they should tone down the rhetoric in 
hopes of winning longsought cuts in soviet conventional forces in 
eastern europe

there is new hope for hundreds of americans who 
are being passed over for kidney transplants because old blood 
tests showed them to be extremely sensitive to donor organs 
doctors said wednesday 
transplants can be successfully done in these patients as 
long as the sensitivity tests have turned up negative in the 
previous six months said dr arthur j matas a kidney transplant 
surgeon at the university of minnesota 
now youre not penalizing anybody said dr robert soberman 
a nephrologist at montefiore medical center in new york where the 
study was conducted 
matas reported at the annual meeting of the american society of 
transplant physicians that patients whose blood no longer tests 
positive for extreme sensitivity to donor organs enjoy just as much 
success with transplanted kidneys as anyone else 
in the past such patients usually were turned down on the basis 
of their old sensitivity tests even if more recent tests show a 
change because doctors have been reluctant to waste precious donor 
kidneys on such patients 
about half of the 13000 people awaiting kidney transplants in 
the united states are considered particularly sensitive to 
transplants because of a previous transplant pregnancy blood 
transfusion or other circumstances that result in an unusually 
large amount of cytotoxic antibodies in the bloodstream said dr 
lawrence g hunsicker president of the american society of 
transplant physicians 
until now the best hope for sensitized patients was to receive 
a perfectly matched kidney with all six antigens or genetic 
markers identified such perfect matches are extremely rare 
however 
but matas said that in about a fourth of these sensitized 
patients the level of cytotoxic antibodies drops on its own for no 
known reason his research concluded that these people do as well 
with a transplant as those who were never sensitized 
from 1983 to 1987 kidney transplants were done on 64 people at 
montefiore medical center who had shown sensitivity to transplants 
at one time but had negative sensitivity tests for at least six 
months 
matas and soberman compared their transplant success rates with 
those of 166 other kidney transplant patients at montefiore who 
all had never tested positive for sensitivity 
the success rates were about the same one year after 
transplantation 79 percent of the 64 formerly sensitive patients 
had a properly functioning kidney as did 77 percent of the regular 
patients at three years the success rates for both groups was 
around 70 percent 
the findings were similar regardless of whether it was a 
patients first second or even third transplanted kidney matas 
said 
while such findings can give hope to many people who are forced 
to exist on dialysis for years awaiting a transplant the shortage 
of donor organs remains a problem for all kidney patients the 
experts said 
the worst part of the new study is that it only enlarges the 
pool of people to get kidneys soberman said 
last year 8972 kidney transplants were performed in the united 
states down slightly from than the year before according to the 
us department of health and human services early indications are 
that even fewer kidneys are being offered for transplantation in 
1988

dacha in a verdant area just outside moscow the reagans stopped at 
red square and walked across the cobblestone plaza between st

reagan holding hands with his wife described his soviet 
evening on the town as wonderful very warm and hospitable 
he said the couple decided to stop at red square because nancy 
hasnt seen it were leaving tomorrow and i didnt want her to 
miss it 
earlier the gorbachevs and reagans shared the royal box in the 
worldfamous bolshoi theater for 90 minutes of ballet many in the 
audience of about 2000 people waved and applauded when they 
arrived at the opulent red and gold theater and again before they 
departed 
reagan and gorbachev sat next to each other even moving their 
seats closer together as the ballet began and clasped arms around 
each others waists briefly as they left the theater 
by contrast mrs reagan and raisa gorbachev whose relationship 
was described by the presidents wife as a mexican standoff 
seemed cool and did not speak mrs reagan dressed in a short 
white dress and pearls sat by gorbachevs side and mrs gorbachev 
wearing blue sat next to reagan 
it was the first nonpolitical evening the reagans have enjoyed 
in three consecutive days of summitry the gorbachevs gave a 
toastfilled state dinner for their guests monday night and reagan 
returned the favor with a dinner for the gorbachevs at spaso house 
the us ambassadors residence 
the royal box in the bolshoi theater was draped with us and 
soviet flags and the orchestra played the national anthems of both 
countries reagan mouthed the words to the american national 
anthem and mrs reagan held her hand to her heart 
the reagans both used opera glasses to watch the bolshoi ballet 
perform excerpts from sleeping beauty swan lake and 
romeo and juliet the last was performed by nine ananiashvili 
and andris liepa winners of a 1986 world ballet competition in 
jackson miss 
when it was over the dancers applauded the superpower leaders 
from the stage 
the bolshoi theater founded in 1776 has six tiers of box 
seats it was the first permanent theater in moscow and its ballet 
and opera companies gained an international reputation in the 1950s 
and 1960s 
tickets cost about three rubles 5 but are nearly impossible 
for soviets to obtain without contacts in the theater or luck 
enough to receive an allocation at their jobs

in the mean material world of the 44th 
precinct hard against the harlem river tireak ghandy was stabbed 
to death at age 12 over his 200 bike 
that was nine years ago 
sometimes people get away with murder sometimes everyone 
walks away except john hennessy and gerard dunn detectives in the 
selfproclaimed home of the worlds busiest cops 
were what they call off the chart said hennessy were 
not catching cases were just trying to solve the old ones 
hennessy dunn and their supervisor lieutenant donald 
stephenson received cop of the month commendations wednesday 
for the dogged work that led to an arrest in april in the 1979 
slaying of tireak ghandy with their families looking on the three 
received the awards and 500 each from first deputy police 
commissioner richard j condon 
the statute of limitations never runs out for homicide in new 
york state murder cases never die and the 44th precinct has ones 
sitting around from 50 years ago time heals some old wounds but 
this case still lay open and bleeding when the detectives inherited 
it 2 years ago 
partly it was because he was his mothers only child and his 
mother carol was a decent hardworking person mostly it was 
because he was a child who died the kind of death usually reserved 
for people who see it coming 
the kid was doing what every kid who ever grew up in the bronx 
did said hennessy 49 who grew up in the bronx and used to do 
the same when he was tireaks age he rode his bike to yankee 
stadium 
on a warm night at the end of july 1979 tireak pedaled his new 
200 10speed to the stadium to a place in the back where kids 
play basketball he was on his way home when a teenager demanded 
his bike 
he was a frail little kid hennessy said this guy was a 
lot bigger than him he was four or five years older he could have 
smacked the kid in the mouth and taken the bike thats all he 
really had to do he didnt have to stab him 
but he did stab him plunging a knife into the smaller boys 
chest 
a lot of people heard him yell dont take my bike and 
starting to scream right he was trying to pull the bike away from 
him and when the kid wouldnt give up the bike he stabbed him 
hennessy said 
as tireak fell the attacker snatched the basketball from his 
hands and escaped on his bike the child was bleeding so badly that 
police didnt wait for an ambulance but drove him to the hospital 
themselves he was dead before they reached the emergency room 
he was so young and innocent to lose his life over a 
basketball and a bicycle said dunn 43 who has a daughter 
tireaks age he didnt have a chance he just didnt have a 
chance 
people saw the killers face they left the neighborhood but 
couldnt shake the memory they remembered for all the good it 
did the police had no leads 
we asked everyone brought in from that area and 99 percent of 
them didnt know anything hennessy said 
about 2 years ago the detectives received some information off 
the street not much just a fairly common nickname flaco the 
thin man the informant told them the guy who did it had lived two 
blocks from the scene the detectives persisted they came up with 
a name and a photograph 
the next job was to find the witnesses most of whom had left 
the area and persuade them to testify 
we have witnesses to homicides if you go back two months from 
now theyre gone hennessy said most of the murders in the 
citys most murderous precinct a record 81 last year are over 
drugs money means more than human life and civic responsibility 
smothers under fear 
witnesses dont want to get involved in a neighborhood like 
this hennessy said theyre afraid we have people all the 
time tell us look hennessy dunn id gladly testify against 
this guy and id like to see this guy in jail 
but you know whats going to happen theyll go after my 
mother or my brother or my wife and im not going to do it and 
you can sympathize with them 
mothers see their sons murdered and refuse to testify wives see 
their husbands murdered and free their killers by lying in court 
thats the kind of thing that makes you mad hennessy said 
they still keep trying 
the partners spent a year tracking down the witnesses they knew 
of and turning up new ones most still lived within 25 miles of the 
crime in at least one case they had to travel 200 miles to find 
the person they wanted 
with the witnesses in line hennessy and dunn arrested pedro 
lozada 26 as he visited his parole officer on april 20 lozada 
released from prison last december after serving three years for 
criminal possession of stolen property never said a word but the 
detectives could see the shock on his face 
he couldnt believe that after all these years it had caught 
up with him dunn said i guess he figured hed beat it 
two days later three witnesses identified lozada in a lineup as 
the youth they saw stab tireak ghandy to death he pleaded innocent 
to charges of seconddegree murder and firstdegree robbery 
a preliminary hearing was held wednesday in the bronx but it 
was adjourned until june 22 to allow the defense to prepare a 
motion 
a few of the witnesses felt like they had lived with this 
thing so long and the kid was such a nice kid and he had such a 
bad death we got the feeling these people were really glad let 
me help the cops out and get this thing off my shoulders 
hennessy said 
sometimes people get away with murder sometimes they only 
think they have 
we never gave up on it dunn said it was only a matter of 
time

iran is still a threat 
despite military setbacks and is building a new missile site that 
threatens the entire strait of hormuz the us commander for the 
middle east said wednesday 
gen george b crist said construction of the silkworm site was 
one reason for deploying a sophisticated us aegistype missile 
cruiser in the persian gulf with longrange air surveillance and 
weapons systems 
he said the ship is a quantum leap forward in our ability to 
handle that threat in hormuz the gulfs narrow gateway 
iran remains a formidable presence in the gulf despite losing 
six naval craft april 18 in clashes with the us navy crist said 
the fourstar marine general heads the central command based in 
tampa fla administrative headquarters for us military 
activities in 19 countries of the middle east and north africa 
tehran has been very circumspect and careful since april 18 
he said but i dont get any feeling that the iranians have run 
up a white flag or that sort of thing i would not say they have 
given up their thoughts about trying to get to us 
in an interview with members of a pentagon news media pool on 
the coronado the navy flagship in the gulf crist also said 
military analysts determined no enemy missiles were 
launched at three us warships in the strait of hormuz during the 
fighting april 18 despite reports from shipboad officers that five 
were fired the confusion resulted from multiple radar contacts of 
missiles and bombs from us forces and what you were getting 
was hits on the system as they picked up seekers and missiles 
moving through the air 
a us navy h2 helicopter from the destroyer obrien took 
evasive action to avoid a missile fired by the us missile 
frigate jack williams it obviously wasnt hit so theres a 
little bit of mystery as to who was firing at what 
investigators found no evidence that a marine corps helicopter 
gunship lost later in the day was shot down as iran claims we 
dont know and probably never will know the cause of the crash 
in new york diplomats at the united nations said iran agreed to 
hold more un talks on ending the gulf war but repeated that iraq 
must be branded the aggressor as the first step toward peace the 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity provided a copy of a 
letter from iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar dated tuesday stating 
iranian conditions 
in other developments wednesday the death toll rose from one to 
two in a mine explosion tuesday that destroyed a fishing boat in 
the gulf of oman off the united arab emirates lloyds shipping 
intelligence unit in london said a second vessel was damaged 
a net apparently dredged the mine up from the seabed shipping 
executives said six fishermen were injured but it was not known if 
the second dead man had been included in that total 
the mine exploded near a busy tanker anchorage just south of the 
entrance to hormuz near where soviet warships and tankers stop and 
north of the usual staging area for americanflag kuwaiti tankers 
and their us navy escorts 
crist said the new iranian missile site at kuhestak overlooking 
central hormuz is a fixed installation rather than using mobile 
launchers as iran has done in the past 
he said it might become operational in late summer but thats 
a guess it could be used anytime theyre building one hell of a 
big silkworm site down there and theyve got silkworms 
from kuhestak all the inner strait and the northern tip of the 
oman peninsula would be within the silkworm range of 5060 miles 
the silkworm officially known as the hy2 is a chinese version 
of the 30yearold subsonic soviet styx although crude by modern 
standards it can be devastating to ships 
us officials are on record as saying they would respond with 
force if any us vessel was fired on or even tracked by a silkworm 
batterys radar 
there are no signs of work progressing on another suspected 
silkworm site on abu musa island in the southern gulf crist said 
silkworms on abu musa would threaten the main gulf shipping 
lanes and the united arab emirates coast clearly we were 
concerned so we watched it like a hawk and nothing happened 
crist said 
he said assignment of the aegistype missile cruiser uss 
vincennes to the gulf provides a much greater surveillance 
capability the 9400ton vessel arrived during the past week 
from san diego 
with its stateoftheart longrange air surveillance radar 
system we can see a lot farther crist said and the vincennes 
also has excellent capability against silkworms 
so if they decided to use those missiles over there aegis 
really represents a quantum leap forward in our ability to handle 
that threat he said

a coalition of broadcasters and other first 
amendment advocates told a federal appeals court panel wednesday 
that the governments rules on indecent broadcasts are 
unconstitutionally vague 
attorney timothy b dyk said the groups do not challenge the 
federal communications commissions authority to govern indecency 
on the air but he said the fccs policy does not give broadcasters 
a clear idea what they can air without fear of sanctions 
what we would like is some guidance on what can be 
broadcast he told a panel of three us court of appeals judges 
broadcasters do not want to risk their licenses 
the result of the fccs policy has been to chill fully protected 
speech dyk said 
the fcc in april 1987 cracked down on indecent broadcasts with a 
new policy that went beyond simply prohibiting the seven dirty 
words that comedian george carlin once used in a radio broadcast 
his monologue led to a 1978 supreme court decision on indecency 
the agency said it would enforce the supreme courts definition 
of indecency language or material that depicts or describes in 
terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community 
standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory activities 
or organs 
the fcc said broadcasts that fit that definition and not just 
programs that used the seven dirty words could be subject to 
sanctions unless the programs were broadcast after midnight when 
children were not likely to be in the audience 
the policy serves the governments compelling and well 
established interest in protecting childrens exposure to salacious 
material said diane killory fcc general counsel 
killory said the decision to set aside the early morning hours 
after midnight as safe harbor represents a balancing of a 
number of interests and doesnt lend itself to a precise 
mathematical formula 
judge ruth ginsburg said the fccs evidence on the number of 
children in the latenight radio audience appeared to be 
flimsy but killory countered that even with all the 
resources in the world it would still come down to a judgment 
call 
killory said the commissions policy was aimed at helping 
protect minors from indecent material but was not designed to 
displace parents as the primary protectors of children 
it would be unrealistic to assume parents can supervise their 
children at all hours of the day and night killory said 
among the groups joining the petition challenging the fccs 
policy are capital citiesabc cbs national broadcasting co the 
national association of broadcasters action for childrens 
television public broadcasting service national public radio the 
new york times the reporters committee for freedom of the press 
and people for the american way

here at a glance are the latest developments on the aids front 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the aids virus probably did not jump from 
monkeys to humans but could have infected the common ancestors of 
humans and monkeys millions of years ago researchers say 
japanese biologists who have determined the entire genetic code 
of the aids virus that infects african green monkeys found that the 
monkey aids virus differed from the two known human aids viruses 
if the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recent times as 
some have suggested the viruses would be identical or nearly so 
the findings appear in thursdays issue of the british 
scientific journal nature 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
researchers studying four aidsinfected men who 
appeared to stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease 
said the virus may have stopped reproducing in those patients 
tests to pinpoint aids are based upon detection of the 
antibodies produced by the body to fight the virus but alfred j 
saah epidemiology professor at the johns hopkins school of public 
health said the findings do not imply increased dangers of blood 
supply contamination since the instances of aids victims who stop 
producing detectable antibodies to the disease are very very 
rare 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
an aids hotline has expanded 
from 130 operators to 220 to accommodate a rush of calls generated 
in part by a government educational pamphlet understanding aids 
mailed to 10 million us homes officials said 
the 24hour hotline 1800342aids offers referrals in english 
and spanish for people seeking help in their areas for acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome officials expect 2 million calls in 
1988 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the national academy of sciences committee on 
aids said federal legislation shielding carriers of the virus from 
discrimination is crucial to fighting the epidemic 
the report also said the hundreds of thousands of americans 
unknowingly infected with the virus should be considered as 
suffering from the disease even if they dont have fullscale aids 
the panel said there is a growing consensus that the vast 
majority of persons with the virus will eventually progress to 
aids if no treatment is found to slow or halt the progression of 
the infection 
the report called for development of federal standards for labs 
doing aids testing and recommended that aids testing be mandatory 
only in cases involving donations of blood or organs for transplant

an infusion of state money enabled 
this financially strapped city to pay most of its 300 workers 
wednesday five days after their paychecks were due the citys 
treasurer said 
but city treasurer charlotte moore said unless mayor carl e 
officer authorized the transfer of additional funds into the citys 
general revenue account about 30 city employees would not get paid 
for a few days more 
officer was in a meeting and could not be reached for comment 
his office said 
on wednesday morning mrs moore said the town received its 
regular quarterly personal property tax payment from the state 
totaling 93464 the payment supplemented money already on hand 
and allowed it to meet most of its 274000 bimonthly payroll 
but mrs moore said east st louis still was 55000 short of 
being able to pay all workers 
well pay all police all firefighters all public works 
employees and then well go from there she said the checks were 
issued early in the afternoon she said 
the remaining employees might have to wait a few days for their 
paychecks until the citys regular state sales tax payment arrives 
she said unless the mayor authorizes the transfer of motor fuel 
tax funds into the payroll account a move that a state official 
said could jeopardize future state support 
employees in this mississippi river town of 55000 were supposed 
to be paid this past friday it was the second time in less than a 
month that paychecks were delayed 
though officer could not be reached by the associated press he 
told the st louis postdispatch on tuesday that there was enough 
money in the citys various bank accounts to cover the paychecks 
if the treasurer would cooperate and issue the checks he did not 
elaborate 
officer contended that the late paychecks were an unfortunate 
situation that is not necessary and blamed mrs moore contending 
that she was angry because her entire staff was laid off in april 
to help save money 
mrs moore countered that officer was upset because she was 
enforcing sound accounting policies 
dale klohr spokesman for the state transportation department 
said that motor fuel tax funds could be used to pay city employees 
who do road work but not for other employees a transfer of motor 
fuel funds for other workers would violate department guidelines 
and the department could withhold future motor fuel tax payments

energy department forecasts on demand for 
electricity are only half as large as they ought to be a private 
forecaster said wednesday 
one utility said the industry can easily meet the extra demand 
the forecaster sees and avoid brownouts by contracting with 
independent producers for power but another company said it would 
be foolish to rely on such a strategy 
the two views were presented at a forum for reporters sponsored 
by americans for energy independence a group of energy companies 
and supporters 
already there have been predictions of brownouts by industry 
groups in the pennsylvaniamarylandnew jersey area this summer 
new yorks long island could see similar brownouts now that the 
state and long island lighting co have agreed not to open the 
800megawatt shoreham nuclear plant 
the forecaster john siegel of the us council for energy 
awareness a nuclear industry group said electricity demand would 
grow 4 percent this year as manufacturing continues its exportled 
boom 4 percent again next year and in 1990 before falling back to 
2 percent annual growth growth last year was 45 percent 
the energy department originally projected 2 percent growth last 
year and in april forecast 2 percent and 21 percent growth for 
this year and next 
john d pearson director of energy analysis and forecasting for 
the department said the department had assumed a slowdown in 
economic growth this year which isnt going to happen 
pearson commented on siegels remarks he has a point 
especially in regard to manufacturing were going to take a look 
at this for the july forecast 
but 4 percent hes off his gourd we may go up but i dont 
see going above 2 or 3 percent 
in the 1990s the nation will need to add 135000 to 210000 
megawatts of generating capacity siegel said current capacity is 
about 680000 megawatts and 11500 megawatts are scheduled to be 
installed this year and next 
the energy department earlier this year said the most likely 
need in the 1990s is for 55000 additional megawatts starting in 
1992 
i dont think the number is all that crucial said william 
w berry chief executive officer of dominion resources inc 
parent company of virginia electric power co 
the question is where is that going to come from first not 
much is going to come from utility construction second as much as 
needed will come from the competitive sector 
it can be built in time provided we dont study it for the 
next two years berry added 
bruce beam washington representative of american electric power 
co the nations largest private utility noted that aep was 
vocally against efforts by the federal energy regulatory 
commission to encourage independent producers 
beam said aep would be very much in favor of berrys 
strategy if regulators could relieve the electric utility 
industry of its obligation to serve all who want to be customers

less than a year ago katherine taylor trudged 
through the rough terrain of sudan a captive of rebel soldiers 
now shes giving out food and clothing to desperate people in 
an urban ministry in hopes of developing skills to use as a 
christian missionary in mexico city 
the 32yearold tennessee native who went to sudan to teach 
english and work as a missionary says the seven weeks she spent as 
a hostage are behind but not forgotten 
a lot of people dont have certain freedoms and suffer a great 
deal its one thing to know about it cognitively but its another 
thing to experience a little of it yourself ms taylor said 
wednesday 
she was kidnapped last july 7 she and her three fellow 
hostages including two americans were freed seven weeks later 
thanks to appeals from former president jimmy carter and the us 
and kenyan governments ms taylor said after a 100mile walk 
they arrived safely in kenya on aug 25 
ms taylor remembers being roused from sleep in the middle of 
the night by soldiers who claimed they were saving our lives 
the captors members of the sudanese peoples liberation army 
planned to attack the village and did not want the three caught 
in the crossfire ms taylor said 
the sudanese rebels have waged a fiveyear civil war against the 
government which is dominated by moslems from the predominantly 
arab northern section of the country 
the sudanese peoples liberation army is fighting for government 
reforms and autonomy for sudans three southern provinces where 
most people are christian or animist 
after packing malaria medicine some firstaid supplies a bible 
and a few other belongings ms taylor was led out of the house she 
was living in at bishop gwynne college near the southern sudanese 
town of mundri 
ms taylor said she and three other hostages were forced to walk 
through the countryside of sudan the largest country in africa 
they slept on the side of the road or in rebel camps ate 
sporadically drank bad water and trudged through waterways she 
recalled 
certain aspects of the physical parts were hard long walks 
and bad water she said but the psychological parts were hard 
too not knowing how long we would be kept not knowing what 
each day was going to bring 
in october ms taylor arrived in chicago to work with the 
circle urban ministries providing emergency food clothing and 
housing to poor people in the austin neighborhood on the citys 
rough west side 
ms taylor said she and four friends are volunteering in the 
urban mission as preparation for a missionary project theyve been 
planning for more than a decade 
the five a nurse an architect two teachers and a 
businessmanaviation mechanic plan to leave for mexico city after 
another year of training and language classes in spanish 
our commitment to the lord is the underlying thing she said 
everything isnt rosy but theres a commitment underneath it 
ours is strong 
ms taylors mother martha taylor of johnson city tenn said 
in a telephone interview wednesday that the first thing her 
daughter wanted to do when she got home was eat broccoli 
we really expected her to be different but she was the same

tear gas fired by soldiers into enclosed spaces 
has killed 11 arabs in the occupied territories including a 
7dayold infant and caused dozens of miscarriages a un 
official said wednesday 
col ranaan gissin a military spokesman said the statement was 
based on unfounded rumors and the army could not check it 
because no details of the casualties were provided 
also wednesday a 12yearold boy was killed when he and other 
youngsters in tulkarem on the west bank tried to dismantle an army 
roadblock made of oil drums and a drum struck him in the head the 
army said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin discussed political issues 
wednesday night with four prominent palestinians in the gaza strip 
his third such meeting in a week a defense official said 
authorities would not give the names of palestinians who 
participated saying their lives might be endangered several 
prominent gaza arabs said they were not invited including former 
mayor rashad shawwa of gaza city and lawyer faiz abu rahme 
gissin said medical tests show tear gas can only cause 
temporary disablement never death and the miscarriages resulted 
from increased blood pressure after women took part in violent 
protests not from tear gas 
burl alison a vice president of transtechnology corp of 
sherman oaks calif which supplied tear gas to israel has said 
the gas is safe when used properly but can cause death if high 
doses are fired into enclosed areas 
transtechnologys gas canisters carry a warning not to use it in 
enclosed spaces it stopped selling to israel last month citing 
concern about improper use 
un figures say hospitals have treated 1285 palestinians for 
breathing problems since a rebellion against israeli occupation 
began dec 8 among the 15 million palestinians of the west bank 
and gaza strip 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the report about tear gas was a matter of concern to us we have 
repeatedly urged the government of israel to use nonlethal means 
to control violent demonstratons 
before the latest death the army said 207 palestinians had been 
killed in the six months of violence an israeli soldier and a 
jewish settler also have been slain 
bill lee spokesman for the un relief and works agency which 
cares for palestinian refugees said tear gas had killed 11 arabs 
in the territories he said most casualties from tear gas occurred 
when soldiers fired it into rooms of clinics homes and schools 
while dispersing protesters 
the gas is not normally lethal when used according to 
prescribed directions but it can be when fired into closed 
spaces he said in an interview 
in other developments 22 palestinian employees of the west bank 
military administrations autolicensing department resigned 
wednesday underground leaders of the uprising demanded they quit 
to protest a requirement that arabs pay their taxes before they can 
obtain driving or building permits 
police determined that an army private broke regulations by 
taking two teenage members of a paramilitary training group into a 
detention center near nablus last month where one youth clubbed an 
arab prisoner the army reported it said the soldier would be 
reprimanded 
according to the daily yediot ahronot police also will charge 
rabbi moshe levinger of hebron a leader of jewish settlers with 
attacking an arab family 
an israeli reserve soldier filed a complaint against levinger 
accusing hin of breaking into the home of ishak rahman grabbing 
rahmans daughter by the throat and beating his wife on the back 
the paper said 
levinger told the paper the girl shouted insults at the rabbis 
13yearold daughter in the street 
according to lee doctors at un clinics said the 11 tear gas 
fatalities were recorded through april he said most were infants 
one only 7 days old or people over 65 
the people on this list are those doctors believe wouldnt 
have died at that particular time if it werent for tear gas being 
fired he said thats my bottomline criteria 
among the victims was a 35yearold woman in the gaza strip who 
died along with her unborn child after going into labor prematurely 
as a result of inhaling tear gas the un representative said 
he said the gas apparently causes muscle spasms that can cause 
miscarriage and dozens of such cases have been reported 
the army spokesman gissin countered according to doctors 
not just israeli doctors when pregnant women participate in riots 
their blood pressure goes up and they have miscarriages caused by 
overexcitement not by tear gas lee said most victims of 
miscarriages werent involved in protests but were at home when 
tear gas was fired into their homes into a closed confined space 
gissin said soldiers fire the gas into closed quarters only in 
rare accidents 
there is no intentional policy to fire into closed quarters 
he said it may happen that a gas canister can hit a window and 
fall into a house but one canister cannot cause such results 
he said the state department issued its statement without 
checking the facts and had been manipulated by the media

under the glare of chandeliers and television 
lights 200 youngsters spelled their way through nainsook 
univocal and other exotic words wednesday in the 61st annual 
national spelling bee 
at the end of the third round that wrapped up the days 
activities 485 words had been spelled or misspelled and 144 
contestants remained in competition in a hotel ballroom 
now when i go back home ill never hear the end of it 
because i told everyone i was going to win said angela martin 
13 of st petersburg fla im going to try next year she was 
eliminated in the second round for spelling thuggery with only one 
g 
the competitors ranged in age from 8 to 14 and in dress from 
shorts and blue jeans to ties and party dresses 
one girl judy shieh 13 of richmond va wearing a cardboard 
crown from a fast food restaurant looked puzzled by her 
assignment foozled meaning bungled 
does this word have an origin she asked 
perhaps replied pronouncer alex cameron an english 
professor at the university of dayton judy spelled it right 
two of judys sisters have been spelling champions and 
participated in national bees but judy brought her own brand of 
showmanship this year a different hat for each round a lucky 
toothbrush hanging around her neck and a magic bracelet around her 
wrist 
im the first to wear the hats she said she correctly 
spelled flagitiously meaning scandalously in the third round 
wearing mickey mouse ears 
the contestants came from diverse backgrounds some the children 
of professors doctors and engineers others the offspring of 
restaurant and farm workers custodians and bus drivers 
some were so shy their voices were barely audible others 
adjusted their microphones demanded definitions and boomed their 
answers with supreme confidence 
one boy robert pryor 11 of washington dc clutched his 
stomach in pain as he approached the microphone escorted by his 
grandfather and a spelling bee official entourage he 
exclaimed and still bent over headed for a comfort room stocked 
with cokes couches and consolers 
robert was still in contention at the end of the day correctly 
spelling utilitarian as he leaned on his grandfathers arm 
the words in the opening rounds included commonplaces such as 
comply calcium and barnyard they were followed later by 
lessfamiliar terms such as nainsook a thin lightweight cotton 
fabric and univocal or unambiguous 
cameron said the slow attrition rate was bound to accelerate 
thursday the final day of the event when the survivors were 
scheduled to tackle words not included in a book they had been 
given to study 
there will be a big difference in the mortality rate he 
said 
the first casualty of the spelling bee was monekia gause 11 of 
shallotte nc i never heard it before she said tearfully after 
spelling jargon with an i instead of an o 
monekia and the others eliminated on day one were not the only 
ones who made mistakes a list of correct spellings distributed by 
spelling bee officials showed hitchhiker with one h in the 
middle instead of two 
it was a typing error explained susan h miller a bee 
spokeswoman 
the winner of the bee receives 1500 and other prizes second 
prize is 1000 third is 750 fourth is 500 fifth is 400 
sixth is 300 seventh through 10th is 200 11th through 20th is 
100 and the remaining 180 are 50 
the bee is sponsored by the scripps howard newspaper group

dozens of members of a group that proclaims itself 
an alternative to the communist party demonstrated downtown 
wednesday demanding a multiparty political system and an end to 
what they called political repression 
the protest by members of the democratic union a group formed 
in moscow last month attracted a crowd of about 200 by a boulevard 
near a statue of 19thcentury russian writer nikolai gogol 
i think it was the first time there was a political meeting 
without repression and i think it was because of the presence of 
mr reagan democratic union member yuri mityunov said later in a 
telephone interview 
several demonstrations daily have taken place in moscow during 
president reagans visit none of them were broken up by police 
mityunov said the group carrying banners marched hundreds of 
yards to the end of the boulevard and returned to the gogol statue 
in a 1hour demonstration 
police watched the group closely when it held meetings in moscow 
early in may they arrested dissident journalist sergei grigoryants 
shortly before he was to act as host at a final meeting of the 
group 
grigoryants accused of disobeying a police officer served a 
sevenday jail term

george bushs flexible freeze 
plan to end the federal budget deficit by 1993 depends on an 
optimistic outlook and a reduction in interest rates by at least 2 
percentage points his economic advisers said wednesday 
we all concluded that a flexible freeze is the right way to 
go that is indeed doable said former deputy treasury secretary 
richard darman as bush ended four days of private talks with 
republican leaders and advisers at his seaside vacation retreat 
darman said bush would contrast his plan to the massachusetts 
mirage of michael dukakis a slap at the democratic 
frontrunners references to a massachusetts miracle of 
homestate revival while he has been governor 
bushs plan also depends on a reduction in the budget deficit 
that is occurring anyway and a fastrising surplus in the nations 
social security trust fund the consultants said 
the vice president has said he would reduce the deficit by the 
end of a first term by freezing most spending and without raising 
any taxes 
martin feldstein who quit his job as president reagans chief 
economist in 1985 because his advocacy of a tax increase was at 
odds with white house policy told reporters he was a convert to 
the bush proposal 
if bush is elected financial markets will rally on the 
assumption that the deficit will be attacked seriously feldstein 
suggested 
the markets will respond and bring down interest rates another 
notch 2 percentage points and that will get us down and get us 
within inches of budget balance in 1993 said feldstein a 
harvard economist 
however bushs declarations that he would reject the advice of 
a bipartisan commission studying the federal deficit if it should 
call for a tax increase drew skepticism on wednesday from one of 
those he met with rep bill frenzel 
frenzel a minnesota republican and a member of the blueribbon 
panel said the commissions work would not be swayed by bushs 
comments 
we are not going to get involved in any presidential 
campaigns frenzel told reporters during a picturetaking session 
wednesday with the vice president 
bush interrupted frenzel at one point saying i hope the 
commission listens a little bit to the american people in this 
election 
thats what i think an election is about the commission can 
take an objective look and come up with whatever it wants id be 
much more persuaded by what the american people say 
the national economic commission made up of appointees of the 
reagan administration as well as members of both parties in 
congress was formed earlier this year to try to come up with a 
bipartisan package of deficitreduction proposals 
the panel which will also include two members appointed by the 
new presidentelect in november will submit its report in 1989 
democratic critics as well as many private economists argue 
that it is unlikely the budget deficit 150 billion last year can 
be eliminated without some form of new taxes 
bushs proposal calls for a flexible freeze that would keep 
overall spending except for social security payments at levels in 
the budget approved by congress for fiscal year 1989 plus 
inflation 
the freeze would be flexible because some spending could go up 
but increases would have to be offset by identical reductions in 
other areas 
so far bush has not provided details on which programs he would 
like to cut and which ones he would like to see expanded 
the vice president who has clinched the republican nomination 
has also proposed a reduction in the tax on capital gains profits 
from the sale of real estate stocks or other assets to 15 
percent from its current maximum of 28 percent 
many economists have suggested that bushs proposals would not 
go far enough in trimming the budget deficit 
im not surprised that the democrats would say that bush 
said wednesday all they want to do is spend and tax there is no 
change i can see or hear out of the campaign that would lead you to 
believe anything other than that on the democratic side 
bush held two days of talks on economic issues on tuesday and 
wednesday they followed similar discussions with outside advisers 
last friday and saturday on other domestic issues 
he has been at his retreat overlooking the atlantic ocean since 
last thursday and will remain here until friday combining strategy 
and issues sessions with a vacation 
bush said that the economists who advised him assured him that 
the us economy was strong 
on wednesday the commerce department reported that the index of 
leading indicators a major guage of the countrys economic health 
was up in april for the third consecutive month 
bush said that none of the half dozen private economists 
visiting him foresaw a recession in the coming months 
bush who has frequently trumpted the 65month economic expansion 
as a sign of success for reagan economic policies policies he 
derided in 1980 as voodoo economics cautioned the federal 
reserve board on tuesday not to do anything that would jeopardize 
that expansion

mikhail s gorbachev and ronald reagan concluded 
their fourth summit wednesday in conflict on arms control and human 
rights but still satisfied that their new relationship had 
eliminated evil empire from the superpowers vocabulary 
they hailed the progress they achieved in what was probably 
their final summit sessions but gorbachev grumbled about reagans 
attempts to change soviet policy toward dissidents and refuseniks 
those denied visas and punished for seeking them 
gorbachev said that he told reagan your words are not 
convincing when the president tried to persuade him to modify 
soviet policy and reagan speaking later abandoned that tack 
the president said bureaucracy not willful soviet policy may 
be responsible for baring thousands of jews and others from leaving 
the soviet union 
i just have to believe that in any government some of us do 
find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy he told a windup news 
conference in the ballroom of spasso house the moscow home of 
american ambassadors 
the reagans leave thursday for a day in london en route home 
his summit work over reagan strolled handinhand with wife 
nancy in the moonlight through red square at midnight after a night 
out on the town with the gorbachevs 
their motorcade stopped between st basils cathedral and the 
russet walls of the ancient fortress about 1000 onlookers were 
held back as the reagans took in the scene and walked across the 
cobblestone plaza 
if the leaders put new warmth in their relationship their wives 
did not 
nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev engaged in a feisty competition 
for the press attention with mrs reagan cutting in at one point 
while mrs gorbachev was talking said the first lady i want to 
say something i want to say something ok mrs gorbachev fell 
silent 
mrs reagan characterized their relationship as a mexican 
standoff a tie 
a satisfied gorbachev held a 110minute news conference his 
first ever on soviet soil and called the summit a blow to the 
foundations of the cold war 
for his part reagan said again that his characterization of the 
soviet union as the evil empire no longer applies 
the reagans and gorbachevs got together wednesday night to take 
in the bolshoi ballet then shared a private moment over a cozy 
dinner at a governmentowned dacha outside moscow 
at the ballet many in the audience of about 2000 people waved 
and applauded when they arrived at the opulent red and gold theater 
and again before they departed the first ladies did not speak to 
one another 
the human rights issue took an odd turn in backtoback news 
conferences that followed the final summit talks 
gorbachev said he was not filled with admiration at this 
aspect of the visit referring to reagans meetings with soviet 
dissidents and refuseniks reagan dropped his cudgel suggesting 
that soviet failure to allow free emigration might stem more from 
bureaucratic problems than kremlin policy 
a great deal is due to the general secretary the president 
said of his remarkably softer tone toward the kremlin the 
statement raised eyebrows among several refuseniks including tanya 
zieman who has been waiting 11 years to gain an exit visa 
gorbachev at his own news conference said the two leaders in 
what will be their final summit unless the remaining arms impasses 
are bridged by negotiators in geneva have freed themselves from 
all sorts of propaganda gambits 
in fact reagan said im going to do everything i can to 
persuade my successor to follow up and continue the policy of 
reconciliation there was no palpable optimism that an offensive 
weapons pact can be reached in reagans term but both leaders 
pledged to try 
the first lines have already been written into a book of the 
world without nuclear weapons gorbachev said upon exchanging 
finals papers the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty a 
lesser arms accord that was completed at the 1987 summit i 
dont think anyone can close the book on that and put it aside 
he said 
in remarks after a ceremony punctuated with smiles and 
handshakes gorbachev said reagan had disavowed his description of 
the soviet union as an evil empire with satisfaction he said 
somebody asked the president whether he still considered the 
soviet union to be an evil empire he said no and he said that 
within the walls of the kremlin next to the czars gun right in 
the heart of that evil empire we take note of that he said 
as the ancient greeks say everything flows everything changes 
everything is in a state of flux 
it was once hoped that this weeks summit would be crowned by an 
agreement to slash longrange nuclear weapons 30 to 50 percent 
instead the leaders deadlocked on the accord and instead exchanged 
final papers on the treaty eliminating intermediaterange nuclear 
weapons 
edward l rowny a senior us arms control adviser said we 
didnt get anywhere on sealaunched cruise missiles we did not get 
anywhere on the sdiabm problem 
he referred to a disagreement over how to monitor cruise 
missiles carried on warships and on the link the soviets have made 
between the us strategic defense initiative and the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
the two disputes are the key obstacles to completing the treaty 
the sdi program which seeks a spacebased defense against 
soviet ballistic missiles will involve technology tests that the 
soviets say threaten the 1972 treaty 
reagan said tuesday its never been part of the negotiations 
on the other hand a joint communique issued at the end of the 
formal talks said common ground had been reached during the 
moscow summit on verifying mobile missiles and cruises carried by 
airplanes 
us and soviet negotiators were instructed to record these 
gains in the text of the start treaty when they return to geneva 
on july 12 from a sixweek vacation 
reagan eased off his criticism of the soviets apparently because 
he expects favorable action on the 14 human rights cases he 
presented in a list to gorbachev instead of condemning the 
communist system he chided bureaucracy

advocates for the homeless wednesday criticized 
president reagans remarks at a moscow news conference defending 
the nations treatment of the homeless by citing the case of a 
street woman who fought new york citys efforts to hospitalize her 
they said reagan inaccurately described the case of joyce brown 
the homeless woman who waged the muchpublicized battle against the 
city 
reagans remarks came in response to a reporters suggestion 
that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev was not convinced by the 
presidents statements that serious human rights deficiencies did 
not exist in america 
he said he wished gorbachev would visit the united states long 
enough to correct the mistaken view about the things that 
occasionally dominate the press about prejudice racial or 
religious in our country about people the socalled street 
people who apparently have no place to live 
but i dont think he quite could understand a recent 
situation a young lady living on the sidewalks of new york living 
out there on the sidewalk winter and summer and so for her own 
sake the police picked her up to bring her to where she could be 
placed in a shelter and she took her case to court and won her case 
in court that she should be allowed to go back and sleep on the 
sidewalk where she had been because thats what she preferred to do 
well when you have a free country how far can we go in 
impinging on the freedom of someone who says this is the way i want 
to live i think we could straighten him out if he saw what we did 
in our country 
brown also known as billie boggs was taken off second avenue 
in manhattan last year under a city program regarding mentally 
disturbed street people 
homeless who are believed to threaten the safety of others or 
themselves are taken off the streets and put in a special ward of 
bellevue hospital they are not taken to a shelter as the 
president said 
brown it was alleged defecated on the street shouted at 
passersby and burned money that was given to her 
a judge ruled that brown was competent to decide where she 
should live on appeal she was found to be incompetent but was 
released when another judge found that the city could not force her 
to take medication 
she has not returned to the streets but is receiving disability 
payments and living at a private shelter for the homeless 
although i have my freedom i still do not have adequate 
housing why doesnt the president assist me in getting permanent 
housing brown said in response to the presidents remarks 
according to norman siegel her attorney and executive director of 
the new york civil liberties union 
he said she was hoping someone from the white house would call 
and help her find an apartment 
siegel said browns case showed that the system was forced to 
work to protect her right to individual liberty but it also served 
to show in a broader context of the failure to provide adequate 
housing 
today in america there are thousands of homeless on the 
streets and he attributed it to the failure of the reagan 
administration to provide meaningful programs 
peter smith president of the partnership for the homeless 
which operates shelters in new york and elsewhere also decried 
reagans comments 
the presidents statement suggesting that the shameful 
problem of growing homelessness in america is the result of what he 
referred to as street people who are homeless by choice totally 
ignores the fact that the vast majority of homelessness has been 
caused by his own policies which have gutted the principal federal 
programs to provide affordable housing for lowincome and 
moderateincome people smith said 
the most authoritative national survey of 47 of our largest 
cities shows that less than 7 percent of the homeless are so by 
choice and most homeless are members of families who simply cannot 
find affordable housing 
edward abrahams associate director of the coalition for the 
homeless in new york agreed that reagan had misrepresented the 
homeless problem many of the homeless are families he said he 
estimated there were 750000 homeless children and their average 
age is 6 
if mr gorbachev was to visit this country he wouldnt be 
here long before he saw homeless people he would see them at 
kennedy airport where he might arrive he would see them living 
across the street from the white house where he would be 
greeted abrahams said

government regulation is hobbling the three 
major television broadcast networks in the face of unregulated 
competition from the cable industry the president of toprated nbc 
said wednesday 
given the economics of the network business today the 
depressing fact is that you have to be the firstplace network to 
keep your head above water because second or thirdplace doesnt 
do it for you anymore robert wright said in a speech to 
representatives of the cable and broadcast industries 
and without some new sources of income the future of the 
networks to put it charitably is uncertain he said 
wright said nbc the primetime leader is in a better financial 
position than cbs and abc because of a few more hit shows than 
the other guys have and a gentleman named bill cosby who cannot be 
expected to carry us over the top forever the cosby show is one 
of tvs toprated shows 
the nbc president said the networks are being hamstrung by 
outdated federal regulations that bar the networks from having a 
financial interest in programs produced by others and limit what 
they can produce themselves the government also prohibits the 
networks from owning cable systems syndicating programs 
domestically and sharing in the profits of syndication of shows 
produced by networkowned stations 
supplying cable programming and operating cable networks are two 
of the few opportunities available to the networks to broaden their 
business bases he said 
we can do in cable what we cant do in broadcasting wright 
told reporters after his speech 
nbc last month announced that it had agreed to buy the tempo 
television cable channel from telecommunications inc and use it 
to launch two new cable services the services a 
sportsprogramming network and a businessnews service will rely 
on the resources of nbc news and nbc sports 
capital citiesabc inc also has stepped into the cable arena 
with ownership of espn 
the fresh breeze of deregulation hasnt blown much over the 
networks weve felt very little benefit wright said the 
network rules still stand like an aging colosseum were inside 
looking over the walls at the young lions who have been set free to 
enjoy an open marketplace

former attorney general griffin bell testified 
wednesday that his private investigation of check kiting at ef 
hutton didnt fault senior management because he couldnt find 
evidence of wrongdoing at the top 
bell sued for defamation for identifying a former hutton branch 
manager as a wrongdoer in a 1985 report stoutly defended the 
investigation his atlanta law firm conducted after hutton pleaded 
guilty to 2000 mail and wire fraud charges 
i thought i could catch a high person but i never could 
bell said 
though he was suspicious that top officials were aware of 
illegal overdrafting practices bell said he found no evidence of 
intentional wrongdoing by senior executives 
im not going to put my name on something charging somebody 
with wrongdoing if they did not have the intent to do something 
wrong bell testified in the federal court trial of the case 
brought by former hutton branch manager john m pearce 
pearce now a sarasota fla businessman claims bell 
negligently ignored evidence that cash management practices that 
led to huttons guilty plea were approved by top executives 
pearce who ran hutton branches in bethesda md and st louis 
alleges that bells report put false blame on him and the eight 
other branch and regional officials who were identified as 
initiating illegal overdrafting 
but bell testified that pearce never told me that anybody 
authorized him to do that 
i asked him about paying a penalty he said he didnt think he 
should have to pay a penalty because he was a manager and not an 
account executive 
the former attorney general quoted pearce as saying why dont 
you take it out of my bonus 
bell a senior partner at the atlanta law firm of king amp 
spalding was hired by hutton to conduct the investigation after 
the brokerage firm pleaded guilty to the charges on may 2 1985 
his report was issued on sept 4 1985 
hutton now part of shearson lehman hutton inc agreed to pay a 
2 million fine and reimburse banks for interest lost on checks 
written for amounts greater than funds it kept in its checking 
accounts 
the company also agreed to stop certain cash management 
practices that investigators said gained hutton as much as 250 
million a day in interestfree loans 
bell said that when he had trouble getting documents from the 
companys law firm he visited hutton chairman robert m fomon to 
get the material for his investigation 
i told him there was going to be an historical marker in front 
of the hutton building saying this is where the company was they 
lost the company because their lawyers were claiming 
attorneyclient privilege bell said 
at that point i started getting documents said bell a 
former federal appellate judge who also served as president 
carters first attorney general 
although bell did not find wrongdoing by top managers he 
faulted senior executives for not properly monitoring the cash 
management procedures being followed at lower levels in the company 
they didnt have any controls at all bell testified the 
company was just letting people go wild doing whatever they 
wanted to do 
the report recommended that thomas p morley the money 
mobilizer who devised aggressive cash management systems be 
relieved of any duties involving huttons banking activities 
everybody disowned mr morley bell said nobody owned up 
that they had anything to do with him 
thomas p lynch executive vice president was identified in the 
investigation as the companys chief financial officer and forced 
to resign for failing to maintain proper controls 
bell said his investigation had trouble identifying which top 
executive ultimately was responsible for the firms financial 
procedures because nobody wanted to be known as the chief 
financial officer 
many overdrafting procedures used by large companies including 
hutton are legal because the banks are aware of them bell said 
but he conceded in questioning by pearces lawyer stephen 
milliken that in the case of many hutton accounts most banks 
or many banks did not know what was happening to them 
my best information was they did not tell the banks except in 
a few instances bell said

the army appears to have prematurely ruled 
out the possibility that radio wave interference can cause its new 
uh60 blackhawk helicopter to crash the pentagons inspector 
general said wednesday 
the inspector general in a longawaited 25page report said 
laboratory and field testing had established that high levels of 
electromagnetic energy such as radio or radar transmissions 
can affect the flight control systems of the blackhawk 
the question the pentagons independent auditor continued is 
whether such radio interference can become severe enough to cause 
one of the choppers to crash 
the army has determined that electromagnetic interference is 
not a safety of flight issue the inspector general noted but 
the army safety center seems to have taken a different position 
it stated that while electromagnetic interference has not 
been demonstrated to be a safety of flight issue it has not been 
definitively ruled out we agree with the position of the army 
safety center that test data available to date are not sufficiently 
conclusive 
a negative safety of flight determination has been made 
prematurely 
the audit report also went on to criticize the armys handling 
of the problem disclosing 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
army investigators have never identified electromagnetic 
interference as a cause of or even a contributing factor in any 
accident in the aircraft reviewed 
the army has been slow in addressing the blackhawks problems 
with radio interference and is now pursuing a questionable approach 
to solving the matter 
most of the testing to date has involved only simulated 
conditions and the army appears to be planning assembly line 
improvements that would address only those problems that have 
cropped up to date 
thus the army appears to be concentrating on the symptom and 
ignoring the illness the auditors wrote testing has not been 
sufficient or timely 
the army could have obtained detailed technical and cost 
information on what it takes to harden the blackhawks systems 
against radio interference from the navy two years ago but failed 
to do so 
the navy which uses a variant known as the sh60 seahawk has 
specified a level of protection against interference that is 10 
times greater than the armys the auditors said 
the release of the inspector generals report comes just a week 
after the army announced it was accelerating plans to shield one 
key control system of the blackhawk against interference 
maj phil soucy an army spokesman said the service intended to 
study the new report closely but he disputed some of the reports 
conclusions 
the report implies that we have been suppressing 
recommendations from the safety center soucy said 
our approach to this has been anything but cavalier the 
director of the safety center has supported our approach and we 
have moved as expeditiously as the evidence allowed and any 
suggestion the army is placing dollars in front of safety is a 
gross error 
the blackhawk is a twinengine singlerotor helicopter that is 
replacing the aging uh1 huey copters of the vietnam era as the 
armys primary air assault and air cavalry craft 
last november knightridder newspapers reported investigators 
were convinced radio wave interference had caused five blackhawk 
accidents since 1982 killing 22 servicemen the army and the 
aircrafts maker the sikorsky aircraft unit of the united 
technologies corp denied that report

michael dukakis publicly saluted jesse jackson on wednesday for 
great gifts and great strengths but said his democratic 
presidential rival is not entitled to special consideration when it 
comes time to pick a running mate vice president george bush 
reaffirmed his opposition to tax hikes 
dukakis also said in a private meeting with fundraisers that he 
would consider geographical balance in deciding his vice 
presidential running mate and would look for someone with a 
substantive background that supplements my own according to 
one person who attended the session 
the massachusetts governor has come under pressure from some 
democats to select a running mate from the west or the south to 
provide geographical balance to the ticket he frequently has been 
advised to pick someone with greater experience in foreign policy 
and defense matters than he has accumulated in 10 years in the 
boston statehouse 
jackson nearing the end of his remarkable but losing primary 
campaign walked along a garbagestrewn beach in new jersey and 
called on corporations and the federal government to take a more 
active role in fighting pollution 
dukakis is expected to clinch the democratic nomination next 
week when the final primary elections of the democratic campaign 
are held in california new jersey montana and new mexico 
both dukakis and bush worked wednesday at unifying their parties 
for what both sides predict will be a tense tight fall election 
the massachusetts governor enlisted the support of nearly 30 
democratic national convention delegates many of whom earlier 
supported dropout candidate albert gore jr dukakis also met over 
breakfast with fundraisers for gore and rep richard gephardt as 
part of his campaigns effort to help raise 50 million for use by 
the national and state parties in the fall campaign 
bushs campaign which sewed up the republican nomination 
several weeks ago showed off a little unity of its own when sen 
charles grassley and gov terry branstad formally announced their 
decision to head the gop effort in iowa 
we know it wont be easy to carry the state said branstad 
but it can be done bush finished third in the states caucuses 
in february with grassley backing the winner sen bob dole and 
branstad professing neutrality 
as the long primary season was coming to a close a candidate 
from the past former democratic sen eugene mccarthy of minnesota 
announced his fourth try for the presidency mccarthy whose 1968 
candidacy was a rallying point for americans opposed to the vietnam 
war said he was running on the consumer party ticket 
mccarthy speaking to reporters and about 100 tourists near 
independence hall in philadelphia said he sees no real choice 
between the democratic and republican candidates 
bush was at his oceanside home in kennebunkport maine where he 
has been meeting with economists and other outside advisers for the 
past several days 
the vice president looked on as republican rep bill frenzel of 
minnesota a supporter who is also a member of a bipartisan 
deficitreduction commission expressed skepticism over bushs 
campaign pledge to reject any taxraising proposal the group might 
come up with 
thats what i think an election is about bush said the 
commission can take an objective look and come up with whatever it 
wants id be much more persuaded by what the american people say 
bush also took a swipe at democrats saying all they want to 
do is tax and spend there is no change i can see or hear out of 
that campaign that would lead you to believe anything other than 
that on the democratic side 
former deputy treasury secretary richard darman who was among 
the advisers meeting with bush on wednesday took a slap at 
dukakis fiscal policies the economic boom in dukakis state is 
frequently referred to by the governor as the massachusetts 
miracle darman called it the massachusetts mirage 
jackson spent much of his day in new jersey before flying to 
california for the final few days of his primary candidacy he 
stepped over broken glass plastic bottles fastfood containers 
and other debris as he walked along a oncepopular resort beach to 
dramatize his call for environmental cleanup 
if the russians were poisoning our air if they were dumping 
sludge in the water if they were killing fish we would call that 
chemical warfare and we would negotiate tough he said 
but campaign rhetoric aside the final days of the democratic 
primary campaign were taking on the appearance of an elaborate 
public and private negotiation between dukakis and jackson over the 
partys vice presidential candidate and national convention 
jackson said tuesday that he had earned consideration for the 
vice presidential nomination and dukakis said emphatically on 
wednesday that he agreed 
hes somebody whos done a remarkable job has great gifts and 
great strengths dukakis said i respect and admire him a lot 
but asked if jackson deserves special consideration to be on the 
ticket he said no 
dukakis spent most of his day in boston where he called for the 
creation of a new national student loan program that would ensure 
repayment through payroll deductions 
we need a president who will end the annual assault on pell 
grants and loans and programs for disadvantaged students he said 
in other developments 
the dukakis campaign said dukakis wife kitty will undergo 
tests at a boston hospital to determine the cause of pain and 
numbness she has been experiencing a preliminary diagnosis 
indicated two herniated disks in the neck area 
democratic national committee chairman paul kirk said rep 
william gray of pennsylvania has been named chairman of the partys

a bedouin couple demanded the death 
and mutilation of their unwanted soninlaw to avenge their honor 
prosecutors said wednesday but the defense accused authorities of 
blowing up a tragic family problem into a murder conspiracy case 
suad and ghada tarawneh now of toledo ohio are accused of 
plotting to kill their daughters husband and his family because in 
1986 the 17yearold girl spurned a marriage they arranged and 
instead married her syrian cousin 
the tarawnehs asked a private detective ron petrillo to cut 
off the soninlaws finger and genitals and return them to the 
couple along with color photos of the bodies assistant state 
attorney william dimitrouleas said in his opening arguments 
the alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt but the 
parents were accused of murder conspiracy and solicitation to 
commit murder the tarawnehs were arrested last february in toledo 
after petrillo contacted authorities about the case 
id like to keep the photos of the body as a souvenir 
dimitrouleas quoted tarawneh as saying on secretly recorded tapes 
youre italian petrillo you understand family you understand 
honor thats why we asked you to help us 
dimitrouleas quoted tarawneh as telling the detective we are 
moslem and when you are in the desert honor is very important to 
you 
the prosecutor took aim at defense contentions that the threats 
against the soninlaw were only empty words he noted that the 
cautious tarawneh had even called petrillo to toledo because he did 
not want to use the word kill over the telephone 
in his opening arguments defense attorney don spadaro disputed 
the prosecution version saying the tarawnehs were not killers but 
tragic victims wrapped up in the emotions of their family crisis 
and the fathers drinking 
the first tragedy was the drinking problem the second was the 
loss of their daughter in 1986 and the third was the hiring of this 
investigator said spadaro 
petrillo he said had been hired to find the daughter and 
located her in nearby tamarac but when she refused to see her 
parents the detective turned their angry initial reaction into a 
murder plot spadaro said 
tarawneh 46 a gynecologist and his wife 44 a nurse left 
jordan 18 years ago when their daughter raniah married her syrian 
cousin mouataz abdulsalam in 1986 over their objections the 
angered parents said their honor had been blackened and had to be 
avenged abdulsalam is the son of mrs tarawnehs sister 
the daughter testified wednesday that her father once sent her 
uncle to kill her in syria and had tried to cut off her hand when 
she first told him she wanted to marry her cousin he also had her 
jailed briefly on what she said were trumpedup charges of stealing 
her mothers jewelry 
he said id regret it hed kill me hed kill my husband 
that i would regret it for the rest of my life she testified 
but she said he also wrote her a card apologizing saying i 
never meant to hurt you you are my blood and flesh she said 
her father abused both alcohol and prescription drugs and had lost 
jobs at hospitals because of his habits 
at first the tarawnehs planned to kidnap their daughter and sell 
her into a prostitution ring in jordan but that fell through and 
they switched to the murder plot according to investigator mike 
breece of the florida department of law enforcement 
the alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt but the 
parents were accused of murder conspiracy and solicitation to 
commit murder against abdulsalam his mother and his younger 
sister the tarawnehs were arrested last february in toledo after 
petrillo contacted authorities about the case

the city shipped bottled water to half of its 
elementary schools wednesday after state health officials found 
lead concentrations in drinking water exceeded federal limits 
officials also plan to test schools outside the city following a 
report that drinking water in 40 boston grade schools is unsafe and 
that water in another 19 schools contained lead levels just below 
environmental protection agency limits said deborah 
prothrowstith state public health commissioner 
obviously there is a problem and theres going to have to be 
more testing to insure that the public health and welfare is 
protected said paul g keough epa deputy regional 
administrator we are concerned because some of the levels were 
very high 
some parents gave their children bottles of water to take 
wednesday and school officials said they were concerned about the 
dangers of extended consumption of leadtainted water for the 
citys 30000 students in prekindergarten through fifth grade 
this is another situation where urban schools are left 
behind said william ubinas principal of the william blackstone 
school in the citys south end now we not only have to deal with 
the drug problem and the traffic outside but the lead when will we 
be allowed to educate 
the state department of public health sampled water at 79 public 
and two private elementary schools over the memorial day weekend 
after a television station reported high lead content at eight 
schools 
water at 40 schools exceeded the epa limit of 50 parts per 
million of lead in drinking water the tests revealed a level of 
2300 parts per million at the water supply source in one school 
and 1400 ppm at a water fountain in another 
keough said the epa in july plans to recommend reducing the 
unsafe lead content level to 20 ppm the tests showed an additional 
19 schools had lead concentrations of between 20 and 50 ppm 
lead poisoning attacks the brain kidneys nervous system and 
red blood cells and can lead to brain damage and death health 
officials said lead occurs in food air soil dust paint and 
water 
officials said poisoning is rarely caused by contaminated water 
alone but overexposure to lead can stunt physical and mental 
development in children causing nervous disorders learning 
disabilities and mental problems children under 8 are especially 
vulnerable they added 
ralph timperi director of the state laboratory institute in 
boston which analyzed the water samples said three likely sources 
for the lead are lead pipes lead solder used from 198086 and 
electric cooling systems in water fountains some lead pipes in 
boston schools are more than 50 years old he said 
schools are more susceptible to high lead levels because water 
sits in pipes after school and on weekends allowing greater lead 
absorption 
in a 1976 study the epa found that 25 percent of bostonarea 
households exceeded federal lead safety limits 
keough said officials will attack the problem on a fountain by 
fountain basis by repairing or replacing pipes solder and 
cooling systems 
the great bear spring co of canton wednesday delivered 680 
fivegallon bottles of water 136 coolers and 272000 paper cups to 
city schools great bear sales manager donna piresdonaghy said

business boomed on broadway during the 198788 
season with a record 253 million worth of tickets sold to more 
than 81 million theatergoers the league of american theaters and 
producers announced wednesday 
the figures solidified the upturn in ticket sales that began 
during the previous season when grosses totaled 209 million and 
some 7 million people saw a broadway show the league said 
but while the grosses and attendance were up production was 
down with only 32 shows opening on broadway between june 1 1987 
and may 29 1988 compared to 40 the previous season still the 
shows that managed to get to broadway during the 198788 survived 
longer 
theres a lot of choice on broadway which is probably why 
there are so many people going said george wachtel director of 
research for the league we sold almost 200000 tickets in each 
of the last three weeks thats about as good as it ever gets 
musicals particularly the phantom of the opera again 
dominated the year but several plays were also very strong at the 
box office phantom which had a record 19 million advance 
sale is expected to have as long a life in new york as such hardy 
holdovers from other seasons as les miserables cats 
42nd street and a chorus line 
there were 12 new musicals on broadway during the 198788 
season compared to 11 the previous year although phantom was 
the seasons biggest musical hit several other musicals were 
popular including sarafina a south african musical 
chess the tim riceabbatrevor nunn extravaganza about 
international chess matches and into the woods a fairy tale 
musical written by stephen sondheim and james lapine of the 
seasons six revivals the most successful was the lincoln center 
revival of cole porters anything goes 
there were eight new plays on broadway down from 13 the 
previous season but of the eight only one serious money 
was a quick flop five others are still running including the four 
tony nominees for best play a walk in the woods by lee 
blessing joe turners come and gone by august wilson m 
butterfly by david henry hwang and speedtheplow by david 
mamet 
how many seasons have there been where a show like burn this 
would not be nominated for best play wachtel said referring to 
the seasons fifth new play still running in that sense i think 
it was a rich season 
if box office receipts were up so were costs and ticket prices 
as well as risks to producers the 50 ticket for a musical is now 
the norm rather than the exception a 40 top ticket for a play on 
weekend nights is also not unusual the average paid admission 
according to the league was 3110 up from 2986 for the 
previous season 
the flops were more costly too carrie a musical based on 
the stephen king horror novel lost a record 8 million and closed 
after five performances the most expensive failure in broadway 
history 
wachtel looks for the increase in ticket sales to continue 
in terms of attendance i think we will do very well because 
the last three weeks have been extraordinary he said we have 
the momentum to keep going a lot of that may be from tourism and 
the weakness of the dollar the pick up we usually get from tourism 
during the summer is happening earlier

a judge has struck down a congressional 
provision that bars the reagan administration from requiring 
government workers to sign secrecy pledges during the first 10 
months of this year 
us district judge oliver gasch ruled that the provision 
contained in a spending resolution passed by congress last december 
unconstitutionally intruded on the presidents power to protect 
government secrets 
with a tug of the purse strings section 630 of the spending 
resolution establishes a precedent unrestrained by discernible 
standards and intrudes dramatically upon presidential authority 
gasch said in a may 27 ruling made public this week 
the judge made the decision in suits by seven members of 
congress and three federal employee organizations charging the 
reagan administration flouted the continuing resolution by 
requiring employees with access to classified information to sign 
security forms 
sf189 already signed by more than 17 million federal 
employees is a pledge never to divulge classified or classifiable 
information without permission the other form sf4193 requires 
employees to seek prepublication review of contemplated 
disclosures 
the forms are criticized by members of congress who contend that 
they stem the flow of information to capitol hill 
gasch found that the sensitive and complicated role cast for 
the president as this nations emissary in foreign relations 
requires that congressional intrusion upon the presidents 
oversight of national security information be more severely limited 
than might be required in matters of purely domestic concern 
gasch said he found particularly offensive provisions of the 
continuing resolution that barred the president from preventing 
federal employees from communicating with congress or interfering 
with the legislative branchs ability to get secret information 
from government employees 
another provision gasch found objectionable bars any secrecy 
agreement that is at odds with existing law 
read together these provisions of section 630 permit the 
president to ensure the secrecy of national security information 
only by those means authorized by congress gasch said 
the suits were filed by the american federation of government 
employees the american foreign service association and the 
national federation of federal employees they were joined by sens 
david pryor dark charles grassley riowa and william 
proxmire dwis as well as reps barbara boxer dcalif jack 
brooks dtexas patricia schroeder dcol and gerry sikorski 
dminn 
gasch dismissed all suits except several claims by afge that the 
secrecy agreements violated employees first and fifth amendment 
rights 
patti goldman an attorney for public citizen litigation group 
which represented the foreign service officers said the plaintiffs 
planned to appeal what she called an unprecedented limit on the 
power of congress in this area 
usually courts defer to the president in the absence of any 
action by congress she said i dont know of any situation where 
congress acts and the president says nay nay i am not going to 
do it this is a new twist

johns hopkins university capitalized on soviet 
errors to post a 152 victory wednesday in the first ussoviet 
baseball game ever played on russian soil 
johns hopkins struck immediately in the first inning when 
leadoff batter tom finegan doubled then scored on two successive 
wild wild pitches by the soviets alexei koshivoy the hopkins 
squad put the game out of reach in the third when first baseman dan 
durocher walked advanced to second on a koshivoy wild pitch and 
scored on a single by second baseman andy bernstein 
after two successive errors loaded the bases third baseman john 
horner hit a drive that eluded center fielder alexander 
krupenchenkov and horner came all the way home to make the score 
70 
the soviets scored their runs in the fifth and seventh innings 
on errant pickoff attempts 
the soviet team from the di mendeleyev institute of chemical 
engineering was outmatched from the start by the americans 
pitching as a result the soviets had trouble hitting the ball out 
of the infield 
but the matchup seemed to be less a sporting event and more an 
exercise in good will since the johns hopkins squad had offered 
instruction to the soviets earlier in the week and given the 
soviets souvenir tshirts before the game 
and the american team even provided excuses for their 
opposition noting that the soviets were hampered because they 
practice indoors and have to make do with old gloves made in cuba 
or gloves sewn by hand and field hockey balls and baseballs used 
over and over again 
still the crowd of about 300 people in the lenin komsomol 
automobile factory stadium seemed to enjoy the game cheering both 
sides but also whistling in displeasure at the many errors by the 
soviets 
johns hopkins alumnus max flaxman a dealer in skins and hides 
in moscow is responsible for arranging the game 
president reagan busy elsewhere was unable to throw out the 
first pitch 
the soviets began their baseball program in 1987 with an eye on 
the olympics of 1992 when the game will be part of the 
competition a national soviet squad played a team from nicaragua 
last summer with disastrous results the soviets lost by scores of 
220 and 302 
but johns hopkins coach bob babb said the soviets are making 
noticeable improvements each day each day they get a little 
better 
steven holland who is acting as the johns hopkins trainer on 
the trip said that during the joint practice session on monday 
even guys who dont speak a word of russian after a while were 
saying molodetz molodetz well done well done after 
the russians made a good play 
still other members of the hopkins squad said they were 
surprised at the russians lack of basic baseball fundamentals 
such as catching and fielding although they competed with the 
intensity of a pete rose now manager of the cincinnati reds or 
kirk gibson an outfielder with the los angeles dodgers 
they have a desire to play they come out in the snow to 
practice theyre really nuts about baseball said jim timmerman 
the johns hopkins shortstop 
horner had said he was impressed by the toughness of the soviet 
players most of whom are good athletes who play basketball 
volleyball or compete in track 
i saw one of their pitchers get hit in the back by a line 
drive one of the hardest ive ever seen hit and he didnt even 
flinch he said before the game theyre not afraid of the 
ball 
the soviet media publicized the game and several newspapers ran 
stories that caught the spirit of good will 
a frontpage article in tuesdays editions of the newspaper 
sovietsky sport carried the headline when the score doesnt 
count

heavy thunderstorms dumped more than 10 
inches of rain on this northcentral texas town overflowing a 
creek obliterating an earthen dam and forcing the evacuation of 
about 60 people early wednesday authorities said 
the storm waters also damaged homes businesses and bridges and 
briefly shut down some highways elsewhere in the area late tuesday 
and early wednesday 
a wall of water came through here and these people barely got 
out in time said gayle godfrey as he stood amid torn furnishings 
and soggy carpet drying on the shore of lake eans 
the floods apex came between 3 am and 6 am and by 830 
am residents were allowed to return to their homes 
all that remained of the former 100acre private lake at 
daylight were acres of mud tons of debris and fallen trees 
maida godfrey pointed to grass and mud stains 4 feet high on 
the white walls of her home which she estimated sustained about 
30000 in damage 
we had to leave out the back door when the water came pouring 
in she said weve lived here 22 years and its never gotten 
this high before 
mrs godfrey 40 and her 18yearold son sheridan ran up a 
hill to the home of a neighbor from the top of the hill she said 
she heard a loud roar about 5 am as water broke through the dam 
that was built in the 1930s in a water reclamation project 
floodwaters also overflowed the banks of indian creek tearing 
through homes and businesses in comanche and knocking chunks of 
pavement from bridgets 
i looked outside my trailer house to see how the rain was and 
saw water flowing over my tires said terry donald who evacuated 
his home about 4 am my parents came over in a fourwheel drive 
and got me a fire truck came into the indian creek area later and 
evacuated everybody else 
at the trailer house across the street they had to get a boat 
to find that man water was chesthigh in his house donald said 
at lake comanche about four miles southeast of this town of 
12600 a dam held but water spilled over its lip said duane ogle 
a teacher at comanche high school where the evacuated residents 
stayed until the floodwaters subsided 
north along us 377 the floodwaters blocked several 
underpasses and bridges with logs and debris the driver of an 
18wheeler reportedly swam to safety as floodwaters washed his 
truck off the road 
streets in several other counties in the area also were flooded 
by the storms the national weather service reported 
comanche and 42 other texas counties most of them in the 
northcentral part of the state remained under a severe 
thunderstorm watch until late wednesday night

the united states said wednesday it 
supports granting concessions to some of the worlds poorest 
nations to make it easier for them repay billions of dollars in 
loans 
treasury secretary james c baker told a news conference at the 
annual meeting of the african development bank that lower interest 
rates or more liberal terms of repayment could help ease the 
pressure on those countries 
baker said members of the paris club a group of lenders 
including the united states britain and france should be able to 
negotiate their own terms of financing 
it is important to realize that what we are talking about here 
is a change in the policy of the paris club which would permit 
creditor governments to differentiate in the approach to 
rescheduling he said 
concessions would involve only official debt owed by the 
poorest of the poor he said 
most of the money owed by the poorest countries is official 
debt funds lent by developed countries 
many african nations cannot repay foreign debts that now exceed 
200 billion for the continent and have urged western nations to 
write off part or all the obligation baker made clear he does not 
propose that kind of relief 
he said the us proposal will continue to require that each 
country be looked at on a casebycase basis it is therefore not a 
call for a generalized debt relief proposal or a global approach 
if you will but it does represent a change it certainly does as 
far as official debt owed by the poorest of the poor 
in effect this means the united states will not block efforts 
by the other paris club member countries to draw up debt concession 
agreements with certain countries 
asked if other members of the club of paris are likely to favor 
his proposal baker said i think it is a major step in the 
direction of some suggestions that have been heretofore made by 
some of our paris club partners so i believe they will welcome 
this 
those governments that felt free legally or from a policy 
basis to grant concessional or perhaps more concessional interest 
rates would be free to do so whereas other governments could 
perhaps look at a broader range of maturities as a means of 
contributing baker said 
baker said the us administration does not have the authority 
to write off debt 
one of the difficulties the united states has with a 
proposal to move to concessional interest rates on official debt is 
that that constitutes to a degree debt forgiveness which the 
executive branch is not empowered alone to grant he said 
we are permitted to negotiate more liberal terms of repayment 
we have been doing that and my remarks indicate a willingness on 
our part to consider moving along that same path in the future 
baker said

poor maintenance of the air conditioning system 
and extensive construction in the vicinity were responsible for a 
fatal outbreak of legionnaires disease at bbc headquarters 
investigators said wednesday 
thirtynine people contracted the disease in and around the 
british broadcasting corp offices from midapril to early may and 
two died according to the westminster public health office 
bbc executives and engineers who made up the investigating team 
recommended improved maintenance procedures relating to its 
watercooled air conditioning system and examining links between 
the disease and local construction and demolition projects 
the outbreak appears to have been due to a combination of 
internal and external factors said chairman charles sandbank 
deputy director of engineering the external factors included the 
extensive demolition and building activity in the vicinity of 
broadcasting house 
shortcomings were revealed in the procedures associated 
with the applications of water treatment chemicals and biocides to 
the cooling tower he said 
legionnaires disease was first diagnosed in 1976 when 221 
people contracted it at an american legion convention in 
philadelphia it produces symptoms similar to pneumonia and often 
caused by bacteria from watercooled air conditioning units 
the bbc has said air systems in its buildings have been 
disinfected

a major investor in the seabrook nuclear 
power plant said it would pull out of the troubled project 
wednesday a setback that one opponent claimed could kill the 
controversial plant 
our many successes have been hidden by the shadow of 
seabrook said gary l hunt general manager of the massachusetts 
municipal wholesale electric co after its eightmember board of 
directors voted to withdraw 
mmwec with its 116 percent stake in the plant is seabrooks 
fourthlargest investor its action will enable mmwec to get on 
with its business hunt added 
the 54 billion seabrook reactor is completed but lacks 
approved evacuation plans required for commercial operation 
in addition its largest investor public service company of new 
hampshire filed for us bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors on jan 28 psnh owns 36 percent of the project 
seabrook spokesman rob williams said the action would have no 
immediate effect but he said the projects joint owners would meet 
soon to discuss it 
the rest of the owners remain committed and the bottom line 
remains the plant is very much needed for new england he said 
we will overcome this and the plant will be brought on line 
bob backus a lawyer for the seacoast antipollution league 
which has fought the project since its inception said mmwecs 
action could doom the project 
i believe theres a major funding problem for the project and 
it is so grossly uneconomic right now that this may be the end of 
it backus said 
the top three owners of the seabrook project psnh united 
illuminating and eastern utilities associates said wednesday that 
they wouldnt pick up mmwecs 116 percent stake in the plant 
the new hampshire plant has been dogged by troubles since psnh 
announced its intention to build it 20 years ago the company 
shelved its original plans and environmental impact hearings 
delayed the project in the 1970s 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis has opposed evacuation 
planning for communities in his state near the plant in an effort 
to prevent it from going into service 
mmwecs action comes less than one week after new york state 
reached an agreement with long island lighting co to abandon the 
53 billion shoreham nuclear plant which also has never generated 
a watt of electricity 
mmwec which supplies power to 34 municipalities across the 
state bought its shares in seabrook on behalf of 28 utilities in 
massachusetts and eight in other northeastern states 
the company has sunk 875 million into the stalled plant so far 
hunt said several utilities have asked mmwec to withdraw because 
of the steady rise in electric rates required to meet seabrooks 
costs 
the company pays about 90 million a year for its longterm 
seabrook debt and payments of about 15 million to 20 million 
annually to support the idle plant 
mmwecs board voted to stop further payments for seabrook but to 
continue to service the debt 
by pulling out of the project mmwec hopes the state will allow 
it to issue taxexempt bonds to refinance its seabrook borrowings 
officials said previously dukakis has refused taxexempt 
financing for the project 
hunt declined to speculate on the effect the withdrawal would 
have on the project saying it was of secondary consideration 
rep edward j markey dmass another seabrook opponent said 
the decision reflects the bottomline reality that seabrook is a 
teetering financial dinosaur about to become extinct 
hunts plan calls for mmwec to ask other seabrook owners to 
assume its share of construction and maintenance costs or buy its 
shares outright he declined to say what might happen if they 
refuse 
hunt estimated that mmwec had three months worth of payments in 
an escrow account that the other investors would exhaust before 
taking any action the joint owners also usually grant a fivemonth 
grace period before declaring another owner in default he said

criticism of the reagan 
administrations national parks policy over alleged budget cuts is 
based on a pernicious mythology a top interior department 
official said wednesday 
william horn assistant secretary for fish wildlife and parks 
told a conference of more than 300 park superintendents he was 
tired of a continuing drumbeat of critics claiming the 
administration is antipark and committers of sins 
horn said the national park services 1980 operating budget was 
391 million compared with 734 million that the administration has 
proposed for the next fiscal year begining july 1 
that constitutes the largest operating budget in the history 
of the national park service and represents 29 percent 
postinflation real growth over the past seven years horn said 
during the carter administration he said the park service got 
9 percent of the interior departments aggregate budget compared 
with the current 14 percent 
further horn said the park service employees 16414 people 
the highest level in its 72year history 
these numbers he said bespeak a commitment to a first 
class national park system and they are at odds with the current 
pernicious mythology 
earlier horn challenged rep bruce f ventos introduction of a 
bill to reorganize the park services hierarchy to make it 
independent saying it wasnt necessary because if it aint 
broke dont fix it 
vento dminn opened the fourday conference by telling the 
park superintendents that they do the nearly impossible job day 
after day of protecting the greatest treasures in the united 
states the national park system 
vento chairman of the national parks and public lands 
subcommittee of the house interior and insular affairs committee 
has introduced a bill in congress to take away the interior 
secretarys power over the national park system the bill would 
give that power directly to the park service director and a 
threemember oversight board that would report to congress and the 
president 
currently national park service director william penn mott 
reports to interior secretary donald hodel through horn 
mott addressed the parks superintendents earlier in the day 
saying the park service must become more effective in dealing with 
outside threats to park resources because we cannot achieve our 
goals if we continue to try and solve problems in a crisis 
atmosphere 
if the last decade has taught us anything it is that parks 
are no longer islands mott said i have often told you park 
superintendents that i want you to be risktakers then even if 
the risks are high select the one that most benefits the resources 
of the park 
vento spoke in the same vein during his address he said 
increasing pressures on the park system due to diminishing natural 
resources and a burgeoning population have led to pressures of 
certain segments of society to take actions detrimental to basic 
laws which protect the national park system 
environmental and citizens groups cite logging oil drilling 
and commercial and residential development near parks as well as 
manmade pollution as just some of the threats to the 341 sites in 
the national park system 
the result of these conflicts has been a rapidly escalating 
process whereby professional resource managers decisionmaking has 
been overshadowed by political decisionmaking said vento 
he said such interference tempts park managers to make choices 
based on shortterm needs rather than longterm protection goals 
at an informal news conference wednesday prior to his speech to 
the superintendents horn said ventos bill to reorganize the park 
service hierarchy is unnecessary 
if it aint broke dont fix it said horn when you marry 
up senior political management with senior career management 
thats the healthiest combination to separate that good 
marriage i think would be a mistake 
vento said his proposal would protect park managers with some 
degree of independence so they can freely and publicly voice 
opposition to an action that might degrade park resources without 
fear of being fired demoted or punished 
this would provide for a management framework that permits a 
witness to testify before a congressional subcommittee and present 
a professional viewpoint rather than a political one imposed by 
others with little professional knowledge or interest said vento 
asked about ventos statement that implied park service 
personnel appearing before congress are constrained from 
disagreeing with park service management policies if they feel they 
are detrimental to their park horn said i reject that 
categorically 
during the three years he and mott have been in their respective 
jobs said horn the interior secretary has had a standing order 
that if you are asked you can relate personal views about park 
policy whether it agrees with the administration agenda or not 
paul pritchard president of the national parks and conservation 
association a nonprofit citizens group that focuses on the 
national parks system said we are 100 percent behind 
congressman ventos bill we are completely committed to it 
t destry jarvis the associations vice president described 
the last seven years of the reagan administrations management of 
the park service as a constant tug of war between a citizenry 
that is committed to the parks system a congress which is quite 
protective of the parks system and an administration which is 
not

eli lilly amp co has dealt a serious setback to 
the reagan administrations anticocaine program by refusing to 
allow use of a safe and effective herbicide against 
cocaproducing areas in south america the state department said 
wednesday 
we think the shortterm impact is serious said state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley alluding to lillys decision 
last week not to sell to the us government the herbicide 
tebuthiuron in a coca eradication campaign focused mainly in perus 
huallaga valley 
she said the firm which is the sole manufacturer of the 
chemical should reconsider its decision in light of the serious 
cocaine problem in the united states on capitol hill rep glenn 
english dokla expressed outrage over lillys decision 
the indianapolisbased company gave no reason for its decision 
in making the announcement last week citing only a number of 
practical and policy considerations edward west manager of 
corporate communcations at lilly said wednesday the company had no 
further comment 
but mrs oakley told reporters lilly apparently was worried 
about possible retaliatory measures by traffickers or 
terrorists the company also had come under pressure from 
environmentalists who were concerned about the ecological impact of 
the herbicide 
mrs oakley said the state department would have preferred to 
have worked with the company on resolving its security concerns 
she said the united states and latin american governments have 
been conducting field tests to identify a safe effective herbicide 
for use against coca for several years 
tebuthiuron known informally as spike was considered to be 
among the safest and most effective but no final decision had been 
made about which herbicide should be used mrs oakley said 
according to our information the safety and effectiveness of 
spike has been clearly demonstrated and defended by the company 
numerous environmental tests have been carried out in compliance 
with federal regulations she said 
meanwhile ann b wrobleski assistant secretary of state for 
international narcotics matters said lilly made the decision even 
though the herbicide has been manufactured for more than 15 years 
has been proven safe by us standards and is widely available in 
this country for projects such as clearing brush for rights of way 
the chemical is sold to other government agencies including the 
interior departments bureau of land management she said 
testifying before a house government operations subcommittee 
assessing the war on drugs ms wrobleski said state department 
lawyers are researching whether to propose legislation that would 
compel lilly to sell the state department the chemical in the 
vital national interests of the united states government 
the safety of lillys employees must be weighed against public 
concerns about the 5 million regular users of cocaine and our 
desperate need for a chemical solution to widespread coca 
cultivation in the andes she said 
english chairman of the subcommittee said he was stunned and 
outraged at lilly and called the company a deserter in the 
war on drugs he insisted that company representatives appear 
before his panel to explain their decision 
were going to go to any length possible to get our hands on 
the herbicide for use in spraying programs in peru bolivia and 
colombia ms wrobleski said 
she said coca crops currently are destroyed by chopping them 
down a slow process that eradicates less than 1 percent of the 
total 
unless we push the chemical button we cannot dent that 
problem appreciably ms wrobleski said

a british nobleman who managed a 
billionaires private game preserve testified wednesday that he 
knew hawks and other protected birds were being killed on the 
estate but denied killing any himself 
sir richard musgrave 66 the huntsman of the preserve said he 
never saw any hawks killed but he knew his gamekeepers were doing 
their jobs if they were killing the birds which preyed on 
pheasants raised for hunters 
ive not killed a thing sir he said in us district court 
here 
musgrave also testified that he never told the owners of the 
850acre albemarle county property businessman john kluge and his 
wife patricia about the killings 
kluge 73 is chief owner of metromedia a telecommunications 
and technology holding company last fall forbes magazine listed 
him as the secondrichest man in america putting his worth at 3 
billion 
he and his wife were not charged 
earlier wednesday gamekeeper david amos 20 admitted killing 
as many as 25 hawks and owls on the preserve over the past two 
years saying he knew killing hawks was illegal but did not realize 
the seriousness of the offense 
musgrave amos and fellow gamekeeper paul shardlow 25 face 
misdemeanor charges of conspiring to violate federal game laws all 
three defendants are british citizens 
musgrave owned a sporting consultant business and was hired to 
manage the albemarle county preserve he carries the title sir 
because he is a baronet a holder of a hereditary title in british 
nobility 
amos testimony on the trials fifth day paralleled that of 
shardlow who told the court tuesday that he killed about 25 hawks 
and owls during his two years as gamekeeper 
under crossexamination by us attorney john perry alderman 
shardlow denied being ordered to kill the birds he also said the 
kluges knew nothing about the killings 
like amos shardlow said he knew killing the birds was illegal 
but thought it was equivalent to a speeding ticket 
asked why he killed the birds shardlow replied to keep my 
job sir 
if the predator birds had not been destroyed pheasants and 
ducks stocked at the preserve to be hunted by guests would not have 
survived and and the preserve would have been closed shardlow said 
the chief prosecution witness former gamekeeper brian heath 
has said as many as 400 hawks were killed on the preserve during 
the past two years 
amos and shardlow testified that heaths estimate was much too 
high 
if convicted musgrave faces a maximum sentence of 3 years in 
prison and a 35000 fine shardlow could get 2 years in prison at 
a 25000 fine amos could be sentenced to a year and fined 10000

the subject in local news media castillo claramount said i ask 
for a minimal expression of humanity of charity a fellow mans 
pain cannot be toyed with no one can doubt the word of a man on 
the verge of death who has had the courage to say it 
just before that he read part of the 41st psalm 
he quoted the psalm as saying my enemies speak badly of me 
saying when will he die those who hate me murmur against me 
castillo claramount added unfortunately in the past days 
this kind of situation has come up in the country 
he said duarte would decide what treatment to follow after being 
informed by doctors 
the acting president said that when it was believed the cancer 
was limited to the stomach there was a tendency to operate but 
that may have changed with the results of the subsequent 
examinations

three more people were arrested wednesday on 
charges that they were part of a scheme to mail cocaine to the 
united states from a us military post office in panama and 
officials said more arrests were expected 
the three georgian women arrested wednesday and two new york 
city women arrested last week appeared before a federal magistrate 
a sixth suspect the husband of one of the new york women was in 
custody in new york city 
authorities said the scheme came to light last week when a 
former soldier stopped for a traffic violation admitted that he 
was carrying cocaine and agreed to cooperate with police his 
information led to the arrests of the six 
colquitt county sheriff gene beard said investigators seized two 
packages of cocaine that were mailed to moultrie ga from the 
military post office in panama the drugs were to be taken from 
moultrie to new york city he said 
it was the fifth case in recent months in which drug smuggling 
from panama has been linked in some way with the us military 
presence there there are about 10000 us servicemen deployed in 
panama 
in december two civilian security guards who worked for the 
us navy in panama were arrested at kennedy international airport 
in new york city after customs agents allegedly found cocaine in 
their suitcases 
the other three cases all in late january or early february 
involved cocaine found on military airplanes flying out of panama 
or someone with drugs attempting to board such a plane 
in the most recent case beard said two packages of cocaine an 
18pound package seized from jackie lee bigelow of colquitt county 
on may 24 and a 29pound package seized friday at the moultrie post 
office had been mailed to moultrie from a military post office in 
panama 
army spokeswoman paige eversole in washington said investigators 
were in georgia on tuesday and planned to go from there to panama 
to investigate any military involvement in the cocaine shipments 
the army has investigations going on and has had for some 
time into drug trafficking by service members and by people posing 
as service members in panama she said there was no evidence so 
far that anyone on active duty was involved in the georgia scheme 
she said 
an fbi affidavit released wednesday said bigelow an informant 
told investigators he had traveled to panama twice this year to 
meet with two members of the drug operation he said he arranged 
for cocaine packages to be mailed to the three georgia women 
fbi agent david parker of macon said the drug operation appears 
to have been going on for some time and more arrests are 
expected 
we consider it a very significant investigation he said 
were investigating importation into this country by two methods 
handcarrying and mailing it 
parker said bigelow who was stationed in panama while serving 
in the army likely will face federal charges stemming from his 
alleged involvement in the operation the sheriff said he could 
also face state drug charges 
taken before us magistrate nathan davis in albany on wednesday 
were maxine williams 24 brenda mcgee 25 and betty howard 31 
all residents of colquitt county and regina carmela smith and 
julia thom both of new york city 
they were charged with conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent 
to distribute said assistant us attorney deborah fowler 
davis scheduled a bond hearing for the defendants thursday 
afternoon ms fowler said the government plans to argue that they 
should not be released 
ms smiths husband oscar smith was arrested in new york city 
on the same charge and is being held there said us attorney 
edgar w ennis jr who added that other warrants have been issued 
after he was arrested in the traffic case and agreed to 
cooperate with police bigelow called smith to arrange for couriers 
to pick up the cocaine in georgia the affidavit said ms smith 
and ms thom were arrested friday after they arrived in moultrie 
and met bigelow at a motel 
beard said it appeared that moultrie was one of several us 
towns where cocaine was mailed from panama he said he didnt know 
what measures would have been in effect at us military post 
offices in panama to prevent unauthorized people from mailing 
packages 
parker declined to say whether the two men named by bigelow in 
the affidavit ricardo brown and ferdson allister smith were in 
the military ferdson smith oscar smiths brother has been 
arrested in panama on unrelated drug charges 
its bound to be a larger operation but our man says he 
doesnt know any of the other players beard said

condition 
salvadoran vice president rodolfo castillo claramount who 
became acting president when duarte was flown to washington for 
treatment on wednesday described duarte as a man on the verge of 
death 
it has been confirmed that president duarte has a cancerous 
bleeding ulcer in the stomach todays wednesdays examination of

when he departed for medical 
treatment in washington this week president jose napoleon duarte 
left behind a country ravaged by war and a christian democratic 
party torn by infighting 
on wednesday night rodolfo castillo claramount the acting 
chief executive told journalists duarte has cancer and was a man 
on the verge of death 
but in his final year in office duarte already had become a man 
devoid of much power and one whose absence was not expected to have 
a profound effect on el salvadors problems 
the 62yearold president arguably washingtons staunchest ally 
in the western hemisphere is in walter reed army medical center 
for diagnosis and treatment he told reporters before departing 
tuesday that he was suffering from a bleeding ulcer of a 
malignant nature 
vice president castillo claramount who became acting president 
tuesday when duarte was flown to washington told reporters at the 
presidential residence in san salvador late wednesday after 
meeting with us ambassador edwin corr 
it has been confirmed that president duarte has a cancerous 
bleeding ulcer in the stomach todays wednesdays examination of 
his whole body the abdomen and thorax showed that the liver is 
also affected by cancer 
he said to the correspondents i ask for a minimal expression 
of humanity of charity a fellow mans pain cannot be toyed with 
no one can doubt the word of a man on the verge of death who has 
had the courage to say it 
the farewell ceremony tuesday had the air of a funeral at which 
the deceased was on hand to say goodbye many of duartes family 
members were openly crying and the president gave long embraces to 
friends and associates 
duarte appeared lean and haggard and at times on the verge of 
tears 
leftist guerrillas said in a broadcast by their clantestine 
radio station duarte leaves the country with an incurable 
political disease because of the failure of the counterinsurgency 
plan duarte leaves and the people remain to carry out the 
revolution 
the rebels are waging an 8yearold war against usbacked 
government forces 
whether the governments campaign against the revolutionaries 
has failed remains to be determined but almost all of the vows 
duarte made upon assuming the presidency in june 1984 remain 
unfulfilled 
the guerrillas still carry out attacks and sabotage throughout 
the country and exercise a significant degree of political control 
and open activity in two northern provinces 
the economy is in a shambles the average salvadorans real 
income is almost 40 percent below what it was at the start of the 
war about 500000 people 10 percent of the population has been 
displaced to squalid shantytowns and refugee camps 
because of the lack of security investment is virtually nil 
duartes christian democrats suffered a scathing defeat in 
municipal and legislative elections in march 
the electorate in what was seen as a massive popular rejection 
of the incumbents performance gave control of the legislature to 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena 
a surging arena appears in good shape to win the presidential 
election next march the constitution prohibits duarte from running 
again in any event 
the christian democrats are trying to keep their party from 
splitting two former cabinet ministers and party founders julio 
adolfo rey prendes and fidel chavez mena claim the partys 
presidential candidacy 
duarte tried last month to avoid a split by calling on both to 
back a unity candidate they ignored his appeal 
he left castillo claramount in charge of the executive branch 
castillo claramount delivered duartes stateoftherepublic 
address wednesday to the new legislature 
he promised to pursue duartes project to meet with leaders of 
other parties unionists businessmen and peasants to draft a 
united proposal to the guerrillas for ending the war 
but the proposal if and when it is worked out is expected to 
be a new version of old calls to lay down arms and participate in 
elections the guerrillas have rejected such a call claiming the 
conditions for democracy do not exist 
they demand a share of power which the government refuses to 
consider 
the conservative daily prensa grafica said wednesday of duartes 
illness the absence of the chief executive for very worrisome 
motives makes for even more uncertainty as to what will happen 
during the next year

writing a book about television evangelists is 
as risky as writing about politics yesterdays conclusions have a 
way of becoming quickly outdated 
jeffrey hadden a university of virginia sociologist who has 
established himself as one of the countrys leading students of 
electronic religions took both risks in televangelism power and 
politics in gods country written with anson shupe of indiana 
university 
in their book hadden and shupe make the case that pat robertson 
could win the republican party nomination for president by the 
time hadden came to new york to promote the book he was trying to 
explain how robertson lost 
robertsons candidacy was dead after he finished third in south 
carolina a state he had once boasted of winning and buried after 
he came up empty in the super tuesday primaries in the south 
robertson failed to mount a serious challenge to george bush 
even though he beat the vice president in the iowa caucuses and 
hadden believes it is an open question whether the christian right 
is capable of electing a candidate 
hadden and shupe argue that a candidate from the christian right 
stands to benefit from these factors 
president reagan has legitimized religious conservatism 
the religious right overhwelmingly dominates religious 
broadcasting 
ministries such as robertsons 700 club have developed 
impressive fundraising skills 
there is evidence of a conservative shift in the electorate 
the reality though was that pat robertson couldnt win this 
year 
robertsons failure hadden said in a recent interview was a 
combination of mistakes and a miscalculation of his base of support 
he got so tangled up in his own words and his own gaffes 
that once he had attention there was never a moment to say this 
is why i have a better vision for america 
he also erred very badly hadden said in not addressing 
the religion issue headon very early john f kennedy was able 
to wait until he had the nomination before he felt he had to do 
that pat should have done it very early 
robertson also overestimated the size of his base hadden said 
he had measured the size of the evangelical christian vote 
and mistook it for his core constituency which is charismatic 
he said 
even the charismatics upon seeing the way he was performing 
in new hampshire basically but between iowa and south carolina 
began to shake their heads and say this does not look like a man 
who is presidential so he didnt get the turnouts 
that suggests hadden said that there is no monolithic 
christian right bloc 
there is a huge conservativeevangelicalchristian sentiment 
out there there is no doubt in my mind about that but it is 
itself divided he said they are not warring in quite the way 
they warred in earlier times they are loyal around particular 
clusters and leaders 
it is not a matter of pat robertson and jerry falwell vying 
for the leadership of the christian right they are respectively 
leaders of the charismatic and fundamentalist contingents neither 
of which has a whole lot of influence over the southern baptists 
who in turn are split into at least two very significant camps nor 
the people who are roughly aligned with the national association of 
evangelicals which is yet another sector 
politically if you can do what bush was successful in doing 
getting significant figures lined up to support you then you help 
keep them polarized 
it may be he said that someone like president reagan who is 
not identified with any particular denomination will have more 
success in courting that vote 
i think there is a very important lesson there hadden said 
he speaks their language without being one of them

mormon elder joseph freeman today guides 
his white brethren through sacred temple rituals that just a decade 
ago were denied him because of his black skin 
i think i have been greatly blessed i feel my life has been 
very much fulfilled said freeman who twice monthly performs 
rites in the churchs denver temple 
i may never be a rich man but i dont care to be the riches 
i have are to have a good family to teach my children the gospel 
the ban ended june 9 1978 when the late church president 
spencer w kimball announced hed received a revelation from god 
opening the priesthood held by all worthy mormon males older than 
11 to black members of the church of jesus christ of latterday 
saints 
but despite the churchs startling success among blacks since 
then particularly in africa it still labors at home to overcome 
the bans legacy a lingering perception that mormonism is a faith 
for whites 
the church numbers 8500 members in nigeria and 5000 in ghana 
and is growing by about 2000 converts a year in each country new 
missions have opened recently in zaire liberia zimbabwe and 
sierra leone 
in predominantly black haiti the church reaps more than 70 
converts monthly 
blacks in the american south hold leadership positions once open 
only to whites 
i started out being exotic and ended up being generic said 
alan cherry one of the few american blacks baptized before 1978 
nor does the legacy of the ban appear to have slowed the 
churchs overall growth since 1978 the church says its membership 
has nearly doubled from 38 million to 65 million worldwide 
black members say deliberate racism is extremely rare among 
white mormons rather they say blacks and whites struggle with 
cultural and economic barriers that can undermine the most sincere 
fellowships 
the first question i get is where did you play ball said 
van williams a black employed in the churchs public 
communications department when i say i didnt then in their 
minds im either a pimp or a drug dealer im still struggling with 
people who wont accept me for who i am but i wont let that 
affect my beliefs 
like many black mormons williams is skeptical of the churchs 
claim of a divine origin for the doctrine i choose to look at it 
as something that man placed and god removed he said echoing a 
view shared by independent mormon scholars and at least one 
highranking church official 
the late hugh b brown a member of the council of the twelve 
and a counselor to former church president david o mckay never 
accepted the ban as doctrine and nearly engineered its reversal 
said browns grandson edwin b firmage 
ten members of the twelve which assists the governing first 
presidency voted to lift the ban in 1969 firmage said the vote 
was nullified when the councils senior active member harold b 
lee returned to town 
little evidence indicates the policy originated with church 
founder joseph smith it was not among the dozens of written 
revelations he left before his 1844 assassination in illinois as 
articulated by smiths successor brigham young the ban was rooted 
in the belief that black africans were descendants of the biblical 
cain cursed by god for murdering his brother abel 
church leaders in 1969 reiterated the policy was divine doctrine 
taught by smith and every succeeding mormon prophet but by 1978 
months before the bans demise they were saying that only god knew 
the reason why 
a decade later that apparently remains the official view elder 
dallin h oaks a member of the twelve said in an interview that 
theological arguments trying to buttress the doctrine were largely 
speculative god doesnt give reasons for his revelations he said 
we can put reason to revelation we can put reasons to 
commandments when we do were on our own some people put reasons 
to the one were talking about here and they turned out to be 
spectacularly wrong oaks said 
mormons define priesthood as the authority to act in the name of 
god and membership is a prerequisite to any appointment in the 
churchs lay leadership or to performing such rites as baptism 
temple marriage and healing the sick 
freeman for instance was not permitted to bless his infant 
sons before kimballs revelation a white member of the priesthood 
gave the blessings instead 
there were restrictions which in a worldly sense were hard 
to accept said freeman who two days after the ban was lifted 
became the first black ordained to the faiths priesthood since the 
faiths infancy when at least two blacks held priesthood offices 
among africans the restriction appears to have made less 
difference they dont seem to take it the way i think i would if 
i had been involved said reed clegg a missionary in ghana and 
nigeria in the early 1980s 
as early as 1946 the church was receiving inquiries from 
nigerians who had read church missionary tracts or articles the 
nigerian government however refused to admit missionaries until 
the policy was dropped 
the appeal of mormonism also spread to ghana when missionaries 
arrived in the two countries they were greeted by thousands eager 
for baptism 
among american blacks memories of the ban haunt missionary 
efforts but black and white mormons alike say economic and social 
barriers are more divisive than church doctrine 
i would say that where you have black middleclass converts 
coming into middleclass congregations the prognosis is good 
said armand mauss a washington state university sociologist who 
has monitored the progress of black mormons where you have 
lowerclass blacks being converted to middleclass congregations 
thats not good 
mauss cited surveys taken from 1972 to 1985 by the national 
opinion research corp that suggested white mormons were slightly 
more tolerant of blacks than nonmormon whites but when racial 
tensions flare they take their toll of fledgling black converts 
alreay sensitive to the churchs image among nonmormon friends and 
relatives 
in greensboro nc black baptisms averaged six to 12 a month 
in the early 1980s but a majority fell away after racial 
incidents said john mccoy a black who sits on the high council of

a very few whites two or three were still prejudiced and 
they let the blacks know it it made the rest of the whites feel 
bad because the blacks were judging the church by them said

as promised as long as a decade ago the 
deregulation of the financial services industry has given 
savers and investors many new ways to go about the business of 
managing their money 
if you want a traditional bank product like a certificate of 
deposit for example you may well find it these days at a 
securities brokerage firm 
conversely when you shop for an investment vehicle like a 
mutual fund you might end up buying it through a bank 
the benefits in convenience seem clear and the enhanced 
competition in theory at least should work to the investors 
benefit 
but observers of the financial scene say the new entrants in a 
given field dont always offer a better deal than their oldline 
counterparts as the choices have multiplied they say so have the 
number of variables to be considered and questions to be asked 
before you commit your money 
consider cds sold by brokers an idea that raises some 
intriguing possibilities a large brokerage firm can comb the 
country for certificates with attractive yields and then make them 
available to customers in any of its branches 
wherever it goes the cd carries with it federal deposit 
insurance covering up to 100000 per account since the bank pays 
the brokerage firm for its services you normally dont have to pay 
any commission to buy a cd from the broker 
now suppose you run into circumstances that make it desirable 
or necessary for you to cash in the cd before it matures if you 
go directly to the issuing bank you will have to pay the legendary 
substantial penalty for early withdrawal 
but the broker may be able to circumvent that problem by selling 
the cd for you to some other customer 
the emphasis in that last sentence however should be placed on 
the may be able some but not all brokers handling cds offer 
this option 
even if you can unload the cd this way you may have to sell it 
at a loss from your purchase price if interest rates have risen in 
the interim that loss may be increased by fees or markdowns 
charged by the broker in handling the transaction 
it also bears remembering that the broker is only an 
intermediary if the issuer of the cd gets into financial 
difficulty it will be left to you to deal with the bank or federal 
regulators 
when you buy through a broker this way furthermore you open an 
account that makes you part of the firms customer base 
says the newsletter 100 highest yields if you open your 
account at a fullservice brokerage house theres a good chance 
youll be getting occasional sales calls from your brokerage firm 
on the other side of the coin what about buying mutual funds 
through a bank technically banks are still legally barred from 
selling securities products like these but many have found ways to 
do so by forging links with mutual fund sponsors 
a bank may offer a handy way to do your mutual fund investing 
it may sweeten the pot by counting your fund balance as an offset 
to fees it might otherwise charge you for services such as checking 
but does a given banks selection include all the bestrun funds 
that are available directly from fund sponsors are the banks 
funds new lacking performance records to serve as a rough gauge of 
how they might fare in the future 
while there may be many good reasons to consider buying mutual 
fund shares at a bank says the newsletter wiesenberger mutual 
funds investment report it is almost certain that funds offered 
through joint ventures will have higher distribution expenses 
after all there is another middleman who has to be paid for 
taking your money 
also it adds trying to resolve statement errors or 
purchasesell requests could be a big headache if bank personnel 
are not well versed in the mechanics of handling fund accounts

going into the california primary the 
democratic presidential candidates still running include gov 
michael dukakis jesse jackson and jack tanner 
jack who you remember jack tanner that upandcoming dark 
horse the former congressman the baby boomer candidate whose 
slogan is for real 
you wont find tanner on the ballot but hes listed in 
newspaper television schedules tanner is running only on home box 
office 
michael murphy stars in tanner 88 an hbo series being 
filmed on the campaign trail and occasionally mixing fiction with 
reality it is a collaboration between doonesbury cartoonist 
garry trudeau who is writing it and director robert altman 
mash nashville 
a new episode has premiered once a month since the series made 
its debut the eve of the new hampshire primary hbo will run all 
five episodes so far in a tanner marathon this saturday hbo 
viewers will be able to vote for tanner or any of the real 
candidates by calling an 800 number on saturday linda ellerbee 
will anchor little news breaks giving updates on the poll 
the first of two episodes shot in california will run on hbo on 
monday the day before the california primary 
a postcalifornia primary show will premiere monday june 20 
the first california show includes a candidates debate 
moderated by ellerbee footage was taken from an earlier reallife 
debate and the other candidates cut out and tanner edited in 
you see me getting ready for it said murphy who plays the 
attractive if somewhat hapless candidate you see me talking to 
two people sitting on stage the way they cut the tape together it 
looks like the real thing then linda ellerbee comes backstage and 
we play a scene together its so unbelievably wellshot that it 
appears realistic 
tanner who is divorced has a girlfriend who had been a secret 
until it was discovered that she worked for the dukakis campaign 
we do get found out in california so as the second episode 
ends the press is madly on my tail because they think a scandal is 
about to break he said i keep defending myself i say im not 
gary hart i dont want to be compared with him i say im going to 
marry the girl a wedding is planned but it looks like it might 
fall through 
murphy talked by telephone from maine where he had gone for a 
few weeks rest after filming the california episodes 
we film two weeks and then take two weeks off he said so 
its not as brutal as working every day its set up very much like 
a real campaign we have advance men who go in and set things up 
garry writes the scripts although we do adapt things as we see 
them its like found art 
murphy describes tanner as an idealistic decent person whos 
a kind of amiable goofus he said hes gotten stronger hes 
taken lessons from the same people who worked with dole and 
babbitt the one thing i safeguard is to see that tanner stays a 
decent guy 
the drift of the show is that you see a guy being pushed and 
pulled by his people and the media and other politicians and how 
he reacts to it 
he called it a dream job with absolutely no interference 
from anyone 
altman said on a recent visit to new york that he would like 
tanner to keep running even after the democratic convention by 
becoming an independent candidate 
i dont know anything like it that has ever quite been done 
before he said of the series i think we are breaking a little 
ground i know im having the most fun ive had in 20 years 
murphy who starred last year in the shortlived cbs series 
hard copy appeared in many of altmans early films most 
recently the two teamed up for the cbs special the caine mutiny 
courtmartial in which murphy played a judge

they are being bombarded with sales pitches 
for everything from bookofthemonth clubs to cognac 
like blacks and hispanics before them asians in the united 
states have become a hot market for advertisers triggering a media 
blitz that aims to penetrate cultural differences within the group 
and tap a wellspring of discretionary income 
weve gone up 100 percent for the past five years in a row 
said advertising executive holmes stoner whose artesa media 
services specializes in asian and hispanic advertising 
his firms billings for advertising to filipinos chinese 
koreans japanese vietnamese and other asianamerican groups range 
between 350000 and 400000 up from 35000 to 50000 just five 
years ago stoner said 
much of the advertising is for ethnic products local merchants 
real estate agents and other businesses catering to us asians 
but more mainstream companies are testing campaigns in korean 
chinese japanese and other asian languages 
companies that are driven by numbers say it is too small a 
segment to contend with said paul sladkus a new york 
advertising representative for 30 asian print and broadcast media 
nationwide other companies are looking at them very seriously as 
new consumers 
general motors atampt new york life united airlines and remy 
martin cognac are among advertisers who have crossed over with 
appeals geared to asianamerican consumers 
the reason although asianamericans are a relatively small 
piece of the us population their steep growth rate and favorable 
demographics make them bluechip consumers for many products 
the advertising upswing has touched off sharp growth in 
asiantargeted media especially in los angeles and orange 
counties which topped the nation with 550000 asianamericans as 
of the 1980 census when the national figure was 35 million 
that was up from 14 million in 1970 according to an american 
management association report that projected asianamericans will 
total 65 million by 1990 and 10 million by 2000 
we used to have two chinese newspaper dailies in los 
angeles said stoner now we have six three fullbore korean 
dailies three japanese dailies and even a vietnamese daily 
though broadcasting has not developed as sharply some radio 
stations and los angeles television station ksci broadcast programs 
in japanese korean chinese filipino vietnamese and cambodian 
cable television is the next step said stoner and as 
of 1989 there will be pay television in their languages in every 
major asianamerican metropolitan area in the country new york 
chicago honolulu los angeles and seattlevancouver 
jerry walters whose los angeles agency researches the 
asianamerican market for major advertising campaigns said about 
75 percent of asianamericans were born outside the country 
except for the japanese which are 20 percent first generation 
newcomers are said to be more responsive to advertising about 
what to buy and where to find it 
with larger household sizes and more workers in the home median 
family income for almost all asianamerican groups is better than 
average they also have more education and better jobs than 
national norms 
but differences in language culture nationality and 
assimilation level can make reaching and persuading asianamericans 
a tough job for advertisers different languages mean they cannot 
be targeted with just one appeal as hispanics are in spanish 
many times the current copy just doesnt fly with the asian 
population said walters the word chevy was not recognized 
by firstgeneration koreans so we translated it to its a 
chevrolet americas finest line of cars 
other campaigns lose something in the translation or communicate 
the wrong message walters said playboy magazine ran a new years 
greeting in chinese that had the characters in the wrong order 
some overseas campaigns ran into even more trouble colonel 
sanders fingerlickin good fried chicken slogan once was 
translated something like eat your fingers off and pepsi 
colas come alive generation became wakes your ancestors up 
from the dead walters said 
some agencies have solved that problem by tailoring ads to suit 
the peculiarities of different subgroups 
and even while wooing new consumers madison avenue still could 
improve its image of asians in mainstream advertising said doug 
alligood bbdos vice president for special markets in new york 
advertisers are approving a lot of ads that are in 
questionable taste the japanese in particular said alligood 
japanese men with little round glasses and buck teeth theres no 
room for that

it will be hard to top the color and drama of 
his fourth ussoviet summit but president reagans aides and 
backers say he will have plenty to keep him busy until he leaves 
office 7 months from now 
theres just a chance that his schedule might include a fifth 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to sign a treaty 
reducing superpower arsenals of longrange nuclear missiles 
i think what we are seeing is that ronald reagan has not yet 
reached the peak of his powers or his accomplishments says 
martin anderson the presidents former top domestic policy adviser 
and author of a book about his administration 
reagans agenda will include an economic summit meeting with 
leaders of the industrialized western democracies and japan 
campaign trips on behalf of george bush and other republican 
candidates and a brief appearance at the gop convention in new 
orleans 
he is also expected to squeeze in four more vacation trips to 
california before he turns over the reins to his successor at noon 
next jan 20 
as they have for many months the president and his aides also 
say that efforts continue to secure the freedom of nine american 
hostages held in lebanon 
administration efforts to force gen manuel antonio noriega from 
power which collapsed as reagan was on his way to the summit may 
also be resumed 
on the presidents immediate schedule are a couple of speeches 
in washington in which he will report on his moscow visit 
details of the speeches had not been announced as the president 
prepared to leave moscow 
still up in the air was the future of a proposed treaty reducing 
intercontinental ballistic missile arsenals by 30 to 50 percent 
which both sides had originally said they hoped might be signed 
during the meetings in the kremlin 
we are both hopeful that it can be finished before i leave 
office reagan told students at moscow state university but i 
assure you that if it isnt i will have impressed on my 
successor that we must carry on until it is signed 
anderson interviewed by telephone at the hoover institution at 
stanford university where he is a senior fellow said i would 
predict that he and general secretary gorbachev are going to be 
working even harder to put together a reduction in the big 
weapons 
they may not get to the full 50 percent but i wouldnt be 
surprised if they did get some agreement said anderson who in 
his recent book revolution depicted nuclear arms reduction as 
reagans overriding concern during his presidency 
gorbachev and reagan who first met in geneva in 1985 and 
subsequently got together in reykjavik iceland and in washington 
before their session in moscow have indicated they would be 
willing to meet again to sign such a treaty 
with difficult negotiations still ahead no concrete plans have 
been made but some sources have suggested budapest hungary as a 
possible site 
more immediately reagan will meet in toronto june 1921 with 
heads of government from canada japan west germany britain 
italy and france for the 14th annual economic summit with the 
exception of britains prime minister margaret thatcher he will 
have been in office longer than any of them 
there are no burning issues said one administration 
official its a where we have been and where we are going kind 
of thing 
reagans speech at the republican national convention in new 
orleans aug 1518 is expected to be a brief dropin enroute to his 
annual august vacation at his ranch north of santa barbara calif 
he is also expected to visit the ranch in july and as usual 
spend thanksgiving there and round out the year at the home of old 
friend walter annenberg in rancho mirage calif 
the president is expected to make campaign appearances on bushs 
behalf after the vice presidents expected nomination at the 
convention 
nothing has been scheduled but he will be doing campaigning 
for the vice president and a lot of campaigning for senate and 
house candidates deputy white house press secretarty bj cooper 
said 
it does not sound as dramatic as meeting with refuseniks in 
moscow dueling with gorbachev inside the kremlin walls or 
answering barbed questions from soviet students 
but as reagan said in a may 2 speech to the us chamber of 
commerce reviewing his administrations accomplishments we 
arent at the end yet

macmillan incs new billiondollar 
restructuring plan designed to thwart a hostile takeover bid by 
texas investor robert m bass leaves the door open for higher bids 
from bass or other potential suitors some analysts believe 
the venerable publishing giant announced tuesday that its board 
of directors had adopted a plan to split the companys publishing 
and nonpublishing operations into two separate publicly owned 
corporations and to pay special dividends to shareholders 
macmillan valued the dividends and securities to be paid under 
the restructuring plan at more than 64 a share or over 166 
billion some analysts who follow the company estimated the plan 
would be worth 65 to 70 a share 
bass who leads a group of texas investors that launched a bid 
for macmillan in midmay offered 64 a share for macmillans 
roughly 26 million outstanding shares the bid by the bass group 
which holds 91 percent of the companys shares was rejected as 
inadequate by macmillans board 
the investor group had no comment on macmillans restructuring 
proposal said dee kelly an attorney at the law firm kelly hart amp 
hallman of fort worth that is representing the group 
the proposed restructuring still leaves room for bass and other 
potential suitors to bid for macmillan but makes the possibility 
of an offer being supported by management more remote said bruce 
thorp an analyst for provident national bank in philadelphia 
this really puts pressure on potential suitors for time 
thorp said 
other possible bidders cited by market watchers are competitors 
gulf amp western inc mcgrawhill inc and british media tycoon 
robert maxwell 
bass is keenly interested in macmillans information services 
business the companys fastestgrowing and most profitable area 
according to analysts the business which publishes reference 
books such as whos who and trade guides for lawyers had sales of 
229 million in 1987 up from 146 million two years before 
under the restructuring plan the two new companies would be 
called macmillan publishing co and macmillan information co 
macmillan information now a subsidiary of the parent would be 
spun off as a dividend to shareholders 
for each share of existing macmillan stock shareholders would 
receive a cash dividend of 5235 a halfshare of common stock in 
the new macmillan information and 450 principal amount of 
macmillan information subordinated debentures 
the cash dividend of 5235 consists of 2520 from macmillan 
inc and 2715 from macmillan information 
macmillan stock dropped 225 a share tuesday to close at 7025 
on the new york stock exchange there had been rumors on wall 
street that macmillans management might be planning to buy the 
company from shareholders speculation that had sent the stock up 
237 a share on friday 
macmillan said it had obtained commitments for all the financing 
needed to pay the special dividends 
the company said the restructuring plan had been under study for 
a year but analysts suggested the timing of the decision likely 
meant it was taken to counter the bass bid 
i think the timing was a reaction to bass said bert boksen 
an analyst for raymond james amp associates in st petersburg fla 
he called the restructuring a reasonable deal 
a takeover by bass boksen suggested would have boosted 
macmillan shares to 80 to 90 while the restructuring could lift 
them to around 80 
macmillan chairman edward p evans told shareholders at the 
annual meeting on may 18 that the company was not for sale the 
shareholders approved a proposal by management to authorize the 
issuance of additional stock in macmillan as a defense against 
hostile takeovers 
under the restructuring plan macmillan information would 
include the information services textbook and retail businesses 
currently owned by the parent the operating managements of 
macmillan publishing and macmillan information would remain the 
same as in the current subsidiaries and senior management would 
continue in their positions 
the company had revenue of 4694 million from its publishing 
operations and 4864 million from its information businesses in 
1987

the stock market broke out of its may doldrums 
with a buying spree that carried the dow jones industrial average 
to its second biggest gain of the year 
but analysts were hardpressed to come up with an explanation 
for tuesdays surge which came on the heaviest daily volume since 
late january 
sometimes its better just to enjoy and not analyze things 
like this said john l manley jr a portfolio strategist for 
smith barney harris upham amp co its been a bad may 
peter dapuzzo manager of retail equity trading for shearson 
lehman hutton inc said the warm weather over the memorial day 
holiday may have brightened investors outlooks and prompted them 
to put some cash to work 
youve got to start a summer rally sometime and memorial day 
is usually the threshold to the summer he said 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 7468 on tuesday 
to 203112 its highest level since it closed at 203631 on may 4 
it was the biggest oneday advance in the markets most 
widelyfollowed index since a 7642point gain on jan 4 the first 
trading day of the year and the sixth biggest rise ever 
the gain in the dow jones industrials was so strong that a 
voluntary limit on computerized program trading was triggered when 
the dows rise swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading 
but even after the socalled collar went into effect for the 
rest of the day the bluechip average extended its gain it was 
the third time the collar had gone into effect since it was adopted 
in the aftermath of the oct 19 market crash in a bid to curb 
market volatility 
gainers outpaced losers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 1211 up 333 down 
and 401 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 24761 million shares 
up from 13359 million in the previous session and the highest 
since 27525 million shares were traded there on jan 25 two 
utility stocks with dividend deadlines approaching accounted for 
about 90 million shares of volume 
nonetheless volume was up from the sluggish pace of recent 
weeks that has prompted speculation that brokerage firms may resort 
to a round of layoffs 
analysts had been saying that the slow pace of trading reflected 
investors uncertainty about the implications of continued strength 
in the economy 
while a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits 
some investors worried that it could also reignite inflation and 
prompt the fdederal reserve to choke it off by encouraging higher 
interest rates 
even as stock prices and trading volume swelled on tuesday some 
potential ingredients for a new surge in inflation were evident 
commodity futures prices surged propelling a key inflation 
indicator the commodity research bureaus index of 21 commodities 
to a threeyear high 
but that failed to dampen enthusiasm in the stock market 
analysts said stock traders were heartened by the dollars 
continuing stability and the bond markets resilience in the face 
of rising commodity prices 
recent declines in bond prices have pushed their yields higher 
and made them more competitive with stocks for investors money 
they also cited relief that the fed failed to boost its discount 
rate its interest charge on loans to financial institutions as 
some feared it would after the markets closed last week 
eldon a grimm a senior vice president at the brokerage birr 
wilson securities inc said there is an enormous amount of cash 
around out of the market due to wariness in the wake of last 
octobers crash 
but every time we get a little rally going people think they 
will miss the boat and buy something he said

usair said normal flight schedules would 
resume today after numerous holiday weekend flights were canceled 
when flight attendants refused to work endofthemonth overtime to 
protest an impasse in contract negotiations 
the airline based at national airport in arlington va 
canceled about two dozen of its 1600 flights tuesday said 
spokesman dave shipley the washington dcbased airline also 
canceled one flight saturday 81 on sunday and 61 on memorial day 
its a very very small percentage of the total shipley 
said theres not chaos at the airports 
shipley said flight attendants overtime is governed by federal 
regulations that limit them to 85 hours per month he said flight 
attendants may fly five extra hours per month as overtime at the 
request of airlines but they are not required to do so 
since today is the first day of the new month the flight 
attendants would revert to their normal work schedules 
usair has yet to complete an agreement for a new contract and 
seniority list with its flight attendants and those employed by 
pacific southwest airlines which usair acquired last year and 
merged into its system on april 9 
apparently there is a protest but its not a 
unionorganized protest i think its a spontaneous protest i was 
as surprised as anyone else said juliette lenoir vice president 
of the washington dcbased union and a usair flight attendant 
my best sense is that flight attendants are just very upset at 
this whole issue of pay parity for the former psa flight 
attendants that may have been the straw that broke the camels 
back she said 
ms lenoir said usair also has been asking attendants to do more 
work such as serving travelers before takeoff without a raise in 
pay since at least 1985 
shipley said most passengers booked on the canceled flights 
switched to other usair flights or to other airlines 
usairs central operating hub is greater pittsburgh 
international airport

floor brokers on the new york stock exchange 
posted their best year ever in 1987 despite the slashing of stock 
prices during the october market crash a published report said 
today 
quoting confidential exchange records the new york times said 
the 54 specialist firms collectively lost 1667 million in 
october but still managed to post profits of 3693 million before 
taxes for the year 
specialists are appointed by the exchange to make markets in 
individual stocks they are charged with making sure that market is 
orderly even if it means buying and selling equities from their 
own accounts 
they have been criticized for not doing more to smoothe out the 
market during the crash but specialist advocates have commended 
their performance during the crisis 
financial data on specialists are kept secret and are not 
reported to the securities and exchange commission because they are 
private enterprises the paper said 
the times said it obtained the data from congressional staff 
sources who received the confidential records from the exchange as 
part of a continuing investigation into the crash 
according to figures provided to the times specialists earned 
185 billion before taxes from 1981 through 1987 while their 
equity capital amounted to 923 million at the end of last year 
the times said that indicates they took out of their businesses 
138 billion not including salaries and expenses 
specialists returns have not dipped below 30 percent this 
decade the paper said 
meanwhile exchange members who deal with the public and are not 
specialists had capital of about 229 billion last year but their 
pretax return amounted to 48 percent the paper reported 
richard grasso presidentelect of the exchange noted that 
several new rules have been instituted to boost slightly the 
capital specialists must have on hand 
he told the times the earnings figures should have been lower 
because they did not take into account payments partners in the 
specialist firms made to themselves as a return on their 
investments

bill malone is urging soontobelaidoff 
general motors corp workers to do as he says and as he did stop 
using credit cards and pay off all the debts they can while theyre 
still working 
malone prepared for his layoff two years ago by paying off 
3000 in bills in one month so he wouldnt end up hitting the 
wall losing his home or other possessions after layoff benefits 
run out 
i knew it was easier to pay them off when i was working 
11hour days than after i was laid off said malone who was 
recalled in may and is using his experience at the uawgm crisis 
center 
malone counsels laidoff gm workers who already have hit the 
wall but gm the uaw and local agencies including oakland family 
services and credit counseling centers inc also are trying to 
teach workers how to avoid it 
about 8500 pontiacarea workers are on layoff or will be by 
1990 a portion of more than 30000 gm workers whose jobs will 
disappear in closings of at least 16 plants nationwide 
among the advice they receive stop using credit cards and 
prepare a realistic budget that takes into account lower income 
while benefits are coming in and potentially drastic reductions in 
income afterward 
the lessons are hard for some workers to learn malone said 
losing a job is a loss just like the other losses we 
acknowledge like the loss of a loved one said barbara la fonz 
employment projects coordinator for oakland family services 
victims experience the same stages of grief denial anger 
depression and finally acceptance as with other major losses she 
said but with a job loss people have a tendency not to reach 
out for help available to them 
there is a desire to hide from the situation they might bring 
in the mail but they dont really open up the bills imagination 
takes over and makes it seem a worse situation than it is la 
fonz said 
laidoff workers have hit the wall if they are being threatened 
with foreclosure eviction repossession or bankruptcy 
some give up la fonz said but many are directed to credit 
counseling centers inc a nonprofit counseling agency that 
provides free assessments 
giving up can lead to bankruptcy filings as many as 50 percent 
of which are unnecessary said credit counseling spokeswoman nancy 
leahey citing a recent study by purdue university 
the study showed half of 1199 bankruptcy petitions surveyed had 
no ability to repay debts 20 percent could have paid all but 
mortgage debts in three years and 25 percent could have repaid 75 
percent of their debts in three years leheay said 
once filed a bankruptcy stays on the credit record for 10 
years and indefinitely for life insurance policies and mortgage 
credit requests she said

strength since last november employment continues to rise noted 
conference board economist kenneth goldstein 
the labor department reported aprils unemployment rate was 54 
percent down from 56 percent in march

measured with the east south central region posting the largest 
gain of 55 percent it was followed by the south atlantic where

american businesses continue to attract high 
levels of foreign investment in part because of the cheaper dollar 
and favorable us economic conditions the government says 
foreigners spent 305 billion in 1987 to acquire or establish 
businesses in the united states the commerce department said 
tuesday that was down 22 percent from the record 392 billion in 
1986 but nearly four times greater than the 1983 level of 81 
billion 
the driving force behind the big jump in foreign investment has 
been this countrys huge trade deficit which hit a record 1712 
billion last year 
foreigners have looked for ways to invest their dollars earned 
through sales to americans as a consequence the united states has 
moved from the worlds largest creditor to the worlds largest 
debtor 
the report identified four factors that made us businesses 
attractive to foreigners last year 
the continued depreciation of the dollar encouraged foreign 
companies to shift operations to the united states so that their 
expenses as well as sales were paid in dollars 
moderate inflation and an expanding economy made prospects for 
us businesses look good 
continuing takeover activity created opportunities for 
purchases 
and fear that congress would enact legislation to restrict 
imports likely motivated foreign companies to produce in rather 
than export to this country 
analysts read little significance into the decline from 1986 
cautioning that tax law changes and other factors may have held 
down the reported number for 1987 
everybody was trying to close deals in 1986 because of tax 
considerations so its quite possible that 1986 just borrowed some 
sales from 1987 said david wyss an economist with data 
resources inc of lexington mass 
ellen m herr a commerce department analyst said if past years 
are any guide the 1987 total will be revised upward by 10 percent 
or more as additional deals are reported to the government 
the 1986 figure had originally been reported at 315 billion 
nearly 20 percent less than the revised figure released tuesday 
wyss said foreign investment would likely increase again in 1988 
because of the continued fall of the dollar which has lost about 
half of its value since 1985 as measured against the japanese yen 
the us right now looks like a very competitive place to 
produce us companies especially when you look at them in yen 
terms look very cheap and youre going to see continued strong 
buying he said 
foreigners also have been buying corporate bonds treasury 
notes stocks and other investments that do not show up in the 
report released tuesday it tracks money spent to establish new 
businesses or purchase a 10 percent or greater stake in existing 
companies 
us businesses acquired or established by foreigners in 1987 
employed 346000 workers and owned 316000 acres of land 
the report showed that great britain was the largest purchaser 
at 115 billion up from 86 billion in 1986 it was followed by 
japan with 53 billion down from 54 billion a year earlier and 
west germany 41 billion up from 14 billion investment by all 
european nations dropped to 195 billion from 211 billion 
canadian investment which was 65 billion in 1986 was 
reported at 849 million last year 
wyss cautioned that the figures for individual countries can 
swing widely from year to year based on a single large deal or on 
difficulties in collecting information 
the largest investment by industry group was in manufacturing 
particularly chemical and food companies at 163 billion down 
6 percent from 1986 
overseas investment in banking and finance dipped to 19 
billion from 21 billion in retail trade purchases by foreigners 
totaled 682 million a big drop from 52 billion in 1986 
real estate investment was 29 billion in 1987 down from 52 
billion 
according to the report much of the japanese investment was 
concentrated in real estate particularly new york city office 
buildings and hotels in hawaii and the southwest

percent above the april average and 47 percent over those of the 
same time last year the agriculture department reports 
prices paid to farmers averaged 134 percent of a 1977 base used 
for comparison according to the preliminary figures released 
tuesday by the departments agricultural statistics board a year 
ago the index was 128 
higher prices for hogs oranges soybeans and broilers were 
partially offset by lower prices for tomatoes onions milk and 
upland cotton it said 
hog prices reached their highest levels since october while 
cattle rose to their highest since may 1979 soybeans shot up 
sharply 
livestock and poultry prices were up 27 percent from both april 
and may 1987 according to the preliminary figures based mainly on 
midmonth averages 
higher prices for hogs broilers and beef cattle more than 
offset lower prices for milk eggs and calves usda said 
crop prices overall were up 45 percent from april and 74 
percent above the levels of a year ago 
for oilbearing crops primarily soybeans the price index was 
up 74 percent from the previous month and 26 percent above the may 
1987 level 
but there was a 12 percent drop in prices paid to commercial 
vegetable producers from aprils levels and 11 percent from last 
year usda attributed most of the change to lower prices for 
tomatoes onions and sweet corn 
the report also said 
cattle averaged 70 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally up 
from 69 in april and above the 63 reported for may 1987 those 
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4690 per 100 pounds compared with 4190 in 
march and 5440 a year earlier 
corn at 189 a bushel was up from 188 in april and well 
over last years mark of 166 
wheat prices at the farm according to the preliminary figures 
averaged 283 a bushel up from 279 last month and 266 a year 
earlier 
rice averaged 827 per 100 pounds down slightly from 833 
last month but still far above the yearago figure which was 371 
soybeans were reported at 698 a bushel compared to 640 last 
month and 520 in may 1987 
upland cotton averaged 564 cents a pounds a decrease from 594 
cents in april and 60 cents a year earlier 
eggs were 431 cents a dozen down from 455 cents in april and 
493 cents in may 1987 
milk was reported at 1175 per 100 pounds an increase from 
1172 last month but a decrease from 1237 a year earlier 
broilers were 335 cents a pound up from 28 cents last month

the agriculture department is indicating that 
it is prepared to assist farmers by easing curbs on the use of land 
idled under conservation programs 
the department indicated tuesday it is prepared to ease a ban on 
hay production and cattle grazing on such land in counties found to 
be suffering from a natural disaster that harms pasture and forage 
crops 
the statement reflected rising concern over a drought hitting 
major portions of the midcontinent from south texas to the canadian 
border and as far west as idaho thus far however no disaster 
counties have been declared 
the statement from milton hertz administrator of the 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service mainly 
outlined possibilities already open to usda it contained no new 
programs 
the 1985 farm act requires farmers to devote part of their land 
to conservation uses if they are to be eligible for federal 
payments the acreage involved varies from one crop to another for 
example it is 275 percent for wheat 
producers also receive payments for placing certain land in the 
longterm conservation reserve program 
haying and grazing are banned on acreage devoted to conservation 
programs mainly because farmers already derive economic benefit 
from the land in the form of government payments but usda may make 
exceptions 
in counties found to be suffering from a disaster hertz said 
haying and grazing will be allowed for any consecutive fivemonth 
period between april 1 and october 1 
he said determination of eligible counties will be made on a 
casebycase basis

centel corp officials dismissed a 28 billion 
cash takeover bid from an investment group as not credible and as a 
mere tactical device in a proxy fight 
reaction on wall street was also skeptical 
centel stock rose 487 a share to close at 50 on the new york 
stock exchange on tuesday but that was 15 below the price offered 
by the investment group led by asher b edelman and george l 
lindemann 
john p frazee jr centels chairman said the offer was an 
apparent attempt to aid efforts by lindemann and edelman to gain 
three seats on centels 11member board of directors 
edelman and lindemann said in a letter to centel management that 
their investment group was willing to pay 65 a share for each of 
centels approximately 43 million shares outstanding 
but they conditioned the offer on centels canceling an 
agreement to pay 763 million to buy united telespectrum the 
cellular telephone subsidiary of united telecommunications of 
kansas city mo they said they would drop the bid to 60 a share 
if centel held to the deal which was announced friday 
we believe the investment community overall reacted favorably 
to our announcement regarding our proposed acquisition of united 
telespectrum frazee said in a statement our decision was part 
of our strategic repositioning that follows closely our overall 
business plan to emphasize three main lines of business cellular 
communications cable television and local exchange telephone 
service 
that business plan in the long term would provide a far better 
return for investors than any shortterm gain under lindemann and 
edelmans proposal to sell off company assets to boost stock value 
frazee said in a telephone interview 
edelman is a financier who lives in new york lindemann is 
chairman of metro mobile cts inc a new yorkbased mobilephone 
business 
their group holds 55 percent of centels stock 
centel also announced plans friday to sell its centel business 
systems division which executives had said could quiet dissident 
shareholders who have called for a breakup of the company 
in their letter edelman and lindemann criticized centels plan 
to acquire united telespectrum and its 95 million debt 
in light of that plan they wrote it is apparent to us that 
management is not operating the company with shareholder values in 
mind this acquisition is overpriced and substantially reduces 
shareholder values 
the letter said the takeover offer was designed to maximize 
the values of the company but edelman and lindemann also said 
the offer was subject to financing being arranged and to regulatory 
approval 
they said said that if the offer were accepted the group would 
seek to dispose of centel assets under the program they previously 
urged 
this is a friendly overture towards acquiring the company 
edelman said in a telephone interview from new york its very 
friendly to the company im not sure it would be friendly to the 
management 
he would not comment on the groups next move if centel offered 
no response by the june 10 deadline set in the letter 
in a statement frazee said we feel the actions by lindemann 
and edelman today should not distract attention from the basic 
issue before the shareowners regarding centels future and the need 
to reelect directors who are committed to our strategic plan to 
maximize shareowner values 
and in an interview he said we believe that our track record 
of enhancing shareowner value in the past is very solid 
in an earlier statement centel said the acquisition of united 
telespectrum would increase centels presence in cellular phone 
markets in the southeast and give it a foothold in the northeast 
including new york city and nearby areas of new jersey

koppers co inc which waged a threemonth 
war to avoid a takeover bid by british industrialist brian beazer 
now appears ready to accept a slightly improved offer to sell the 
company to beazer affiliate bns inc 
koppers officials reportedly favor a bid 1pershare higher 
than bnss latest offer over an internal plan to restructure and 
remain independent the pittsburgh postgazette reported today 
koppers president glen tenley refused to confirm an agreement 
had been reached between the two companies which battled publicly 
for months via advertisements in major newspapers and trade 
publications 
we havent decided what to do yet tenley said were 
still reviewing our options were reviewing capitalization our 
litigation and any other options 
the companies would confirm only that serious negotiations 
aimed at reaching an agreement began in new york over the memorial 
day holiday weekend 
before the negotiations began bns had twice raised its bid for 
the pittsburghbased construction and chemical company from an 
original 45 per share to 60 per share the weekend talks 
reportedly produced a 61pershare offer 
such negotiations are expected to continue although there can 
be no assurance that such negotiations will result in a mutually 
acceptable agreement the companies said tuesday in a one 
paragraph statement 
koppers spokesman robert ogara said koppers goal is still to 
keep the outcome of the discussions in the best interests of 
shareholders employees and the pittsburgh area 
all i can say is that serious negotiations and talks are 
continuing he said 
bns had extended its 17 billion or 60 per share tender 
offer through wednesday saying it either owns or has offers to buy 
80 percent of koppers common shares bns is owned by beazer plc 
and shearson lehman hutton 
as part of the deal beazer has agreed to compensate koppers 
top officials and employees a package reportedly worth from 70 
million to 100 million over 12 months the postgazette reported 
earlier beazer said a federal appeals court in california had 
lifted one of the legal roadblocks to bns takeover bid of koppers 
beazer said the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last 
friday that bns may proceed with its attempt to acquire koppers 
stock once a trustee is appointed to control koppers sullymiller 
contracting co subsidiary a quarry and road materials supplier in 
irwindale calif 
but ogara said the decision imposes further delays on the 
takeover bid because it said the trustee cannot take over the 
subsidiary until bns acquires a controlling interest in koppers 
also ogara said the order states that an injunction issued by 
chief us district court judge manuel real in los angeles will 
remain in force until the trustee is appointed 
roger beidler koppers vice president for communications and 
investor relations said the firm is pleased with the ruling 
because it recognized reals authority to decide the antitrust 
issues raised in the case 
sullymiller is a direct competitor of a company owned by beazer 
plc a british construction firm koppers had filed challenges 
before real alleging antitrust violations 
real is scheduled to hold a hearing on the koppers matter on 
wednesday 
another legal roadblock to beazer exists in us district court 
in pittsburgh where judge maurice b cohill halted the bns bid 
because of his concerns over financing he has scheduled hearings 
for monday on the legality of the financing involved

us officials have dismissed as inadequate a 
new japanese proposal in the dispute over admitting more american 
beef to the japanese market 
we dont feel progress has been made a us spokeswoman 
said tuesday as the two countries opened a new round in their 
prolonged negotiations 
japanese deputy agriculture minister hidero maki who arrived 
from tokyo during the weekend met for nearly three hours with 
assistant us trade representative michael smith they agreed to 
continue talks today said smiths spokeswoman kelly winkler 
makis new proposal involved raising tariffs on beef to protect

nelson bunker hunt once one of the wealthiest 
men in the world is telling a federal court jury his version of 
what led to the world silver market crash in 1980 
in his first day of testimony tuesday in a multimillion dollar 
civil trial in federal court hunt essentially repeated assertions 
made by defense lawyers in their opening statements last february 
lawyers for the other side in the lawsuit will get a crack at 
trying to shake his story possibly as soon as today 
hunt 62 his brothers william herbert hunt 59 and lamar hunt 
55 are being sued by a south american silver concern that claims 
they manipulated the world silver market eight years ago 
minpeco sa a mineral marketing company owned by the peruvian 
government claims the three brothers conspired to corner the world 
silver market in 1979 and 1980 
lawyers for minpeco claim the hunts and several codefendants 
were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about 9 
an ounce to more than 50 an ounce between september 1979 and 
january 1980 
minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused the company to 
lose more than 100 million when the world silver market collapsed 
in march 1980 with prices falling back to about 10 an ounce 
but the elder hunt brother claimed he began investing in silver 
bullion and silver futures because of continuing inflation and 
certain political events 
hunt who said he began investing in silver in 1973 said that 
by the fall of 1979 he was still telling people that silver was 
an overall good investment 
but 1979 was a very unsettling year politically hunt said 
in a low texas drawl noting the iranian revolution that ousted the 
shah and took american diplomats hostage in teheran a continuing 
increase in oil prices the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the 
seizure of the grand mosque at mecca by islamic radicals 
hunt whose legendary father hl hunt made the family fortune 
in oil said as oil prices began climbing to about 30 in late 
1979 he bought more and more silver 
but he claimed that new commodity exchange rules limiting the 
number of futures contracts that could be held as well as 
increasing the amount to be put down on margin accounts was a 
difficult thing for the market

negotiators for chrysler corp and the united 
auto workers will sign their new 66000worker twoyear contract 
on monday the last flourish on a pact that has been in effect 
since may 16 
uaw president owen bieber uaw vice president marc stepp and 
chrysler vice president anthony st john along with the elected 
10member uaw bargaining committee will sign the contract in a 4 
pm ceremony at chryslers highland park headquarters company and 
union officials said 
in ratification voting may 11 the contract was approved by a 
slim 54 percent of those voting overall and rejected by chryslers 
10000 skilled trades workers 
but the contract was ratified later that week by the uaws 
executive board following a skilled trades council meeting in 
chicago because the skilled trades objections were not based on 
issues that applied solely to them 
the contract has been in effect since may 16 replacing a 
threeyear pact that would have expired sept 14 st john said 
like the general motors corp and ford motor co pacts on which 
it is based the contract guarantees a set number of jobs at each 
plant warehouse or office except in cases of cuts in production 
volume because of slow sales 
it also requires the corporation to recall or hire one worker 
for every two who quit retire or die in turn uaw leaders agreed 
to end their resistance to plantlevel agreements that organize 
workers into teams 
chrysler has begun taking its initial snapshot of guaranteed 
jobs at most locations local union officials will be given lists 
of workers names for approval and discussion st john said 
unlike the ford and gm pacts the chrysler contract also covers 
salaried workers including engineers office and clerical employees 
and nurses 
the two sides began early negotiations april 18 in an effort to 
ease building tensions sparked by chryslers consideration of a 2 
billion offer to sell its 28000worker acustar inc parts 
subsidiary and chryslers decision to close a 5500worker assembly 
plant in kenosha wis 
chrysler backed down from the sale and agreed to early talks in 
march despite several disruptions that nearly prompted the uaw to 
break off talks chrysler and the union reached a tentative 
agreement may 4 
the early settlement eliminated the chance of a strike in 
september which observers said would have been very likely because 
of the accumulating anger among chrysler workers 
the new contract expires in 1990 making it the first chrysler 
contract in a decade to expire simultaneously with the ford and gm 
pacts

lee iacocca is back in print grumbling about 
japanese trade practices volunteering to pay more taxes and 
revealing that he once considered a takeover of general motors 
the new book talking straight arrived in bookstores today 
about four years after his autobiography conquered the best seller 
lists 
its initial printing is 750000 booksellers can only hope that 
it measures up to iacocca an autobiography which has sold 26 
million hardcover copies and 35 million paperbacks worldwide 
talking straight picks up about where the autobiography left 
off where the latter retold his firing from ford motor co the 
new book starts with the chrysler chief executive being canned as 
head of the statue of libertyellis island centennial commission 
over 324 pages iacocca also discusses the death of his first 
wife mary and his brief second marriage chryslers indictment on 
charges it sold cars that had been test driven by executives with 
the odometers disconnected and his decision not to run for 
president 
but most of the book is given over to iacoccas musings on 
americas problems rendered in iacoccas feisty sometimes profane 
style education farm policy the importance of family the 
failings of ronald reagan uncle lido has a whole lot of things he 
wants to get off his chest 
im willing to pay more taxes i can afford it but what i 
cannot afford is to bury my kids under a dung heap of public debt 
that will smother them and their kids and their grandkids 
forever 
american history consists of 20year upheavals followed by 
eight years of calm and the current quietude is ending i dont 
know if all the banks are going to go out of business or if were 
going to start a shooting war but something pretty bad is likely 
to happen 
japan should be told to limit its trade surfeit with the united 
states the idea really constipates freetrade purists of 
course he said 
corporate takeover specialists often gut wellrun companies for 
quick gains weve got to tell our kids to get away from this 
fastbuck mentality and to start thinking about other people beside 
themselves 
still iacocca does not eschew all mergers chrysler has merged 
with american motors since the last book was written 
and he writes that last spring automobile dealer victor 
potamkin and alliedsignal chairman ed hennessy approached him 
separately to suggest an unsolicited takeover of the industry 
behemoth general motors 
at first iacocca says he dismissed the idea but talks 
continued and iacocca even met secretly with investment banker 
felix rohatyn he consulted a takeover lawyer and investigated 
financing before dropping the proposal 
i concluded that it might be easier to buy greece he said 
talking straight was written with new york times reporter 
sonny kleinfield and published by bantam books it is a main 
selection of the bookofthemonth club and foreign rights have 
been sold so far in the united kingdom australia germany norway 
italy and japan 
it costs 2195 but as with the first book iacocca has 
promised to give all his profits to charity 
iacocca was one of the publishing phenomenons of the 1980s 
the book has been published in 18 languages in countries where 
they could not properly pronounce iacoccas name said bantam 
publicist stuart applebaum 
iacocca was on the new york times best seller list for 80 
weeks 40 of them in the top position

new englands maple syrup industry is 
threatened by an insect that usually chews on fruit trees but has 
found sugar maples more to its liking this spring a plant expert 
says 
if youve got a maple tree youre in trouble said terry a 
tattar a plant pathologist at the university of massachusetts 
shade tree laboratory 
widespread defoliation blamed on the insect called a pear 
thrips has been reported across new york and new england in the 
past 10 days he said tuesday 
its everywhere from litchfield conn to eastern and western 
new york and the hills of massachusetts vermont and new 
hampshire tattar said and we just dont know very much about 
it we never had a population blowup of the insect similar to 
this 
the pear thrips was introduced into california from europe in 
1904 and found its way from there into east coast cherry apple and 
pear orchards he said 
im looking out of my window and i can see bare tops all over 
the hills said richard chandler coordinator of the 
massachusetts maple producers association this certainly will 
have an adverse effect on next seasons production 
after four years of early thaws that cut short the sugaring 
season and sent prices of syrup to nearly 40 a gallon new england 
maple sugar producers reported nearnormal yields from their taps 
this spring

rising interest rates have come knocking on the 
housing and construction industries threatening to blow down five 
straight years of solid gains in nationwide sales 
but economists say the cyclical big bad wolf isnt likely to 
cause too much damage in 1988 although the outlook for the next 
couple of years remains in question 
it will be a weaker year than it could have been because of 
interest rates but were still expecting a good year said 
john tuccillo chief economist for the national association of 
realtors 
tuccillo estimated that sales of existing homes would total 33 
million and new home sales would total 650000 in 1988 down from 
365 million and 690000 respectively last year 1987 but still 
among the strongest years this decade 
a report released tuesday by the commerce and housing and urban 
development departments said that newhome sales climbed 4 percent 
in april to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679000 the 
third consecutive rise and the fastest pace since new homes sold at 
a rate of 728000 in april 1987 
in a report last week the national association of realtors said 
sales of existing homes rose 45 percent last month after increases 
of 25 percent in both march and february 
while economists said the reports show solid gains they 
cautioned that consumers rushed to do their buying then before 
interest rates headed higher they said may might not be as strong 
people are trying to negotiate a settlement and get a mortgage 
in the face of a fairly certain rise in interest rates said 
george a christie chief economist with the fw dodge division of 
mcgrawhill information systems co 
mortgage rates are actually slightly lower now than they were a 
year ago averaging about 1046 percent for a 30year fixedrate 
conventional mortgage vs an average 1060 percent in may 1987 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp known as freddie 
mac 
but after falling sharply since the oct 19 stock market crash 
rates started to creep up again over the past several weeks on 
fears that the economy may be overheating and inflation might be on 
the rise the 30year mortgage rate for instance has risen more 
than half a percentage point since february when it averaged 989 
percent freddie mac said 
many economists predict mortgage rates will continue to rise 
through the summer and top 11 percent by the end of the year a 
handful are forecasting rates in excess of 12 percent in 1989 at 
the same time experts are calling for moderate inflation of around 
5 percent this year 
frank nothaft deputy chief economist for freddie mac said the 
rise in fixedrate mortgages may cause some wouldbe homebuyers to 
switch to adjustable rate mortgages he said some savings and loan 
associations also will become more accommodative for instance by 
requiring smaller down payments or lowering closing costs to 
encourage sales 
tuccillo also remains optimistic he said that the baby 
boomers the large segment of the population born after world war 
ii should remain interested in home buying as their families and 
incomes expand 
but david h resler chief economist for nomura securities inc 
said i think were heading downhill in this industry and 
eventually the fate of the housing market will filter through 
the rest of the economy as well 
new homes need to be furnished with durable goods like 
refrigerators or washers and dryers he said 
the higher rates also threaten new construction contracts 
including residential and nonresidential units said christie 
fw dodge reported tuesday that contracting for new projects 
declined 6 percent in april from the previous month to an annual 
rate of 22697 billion extending a downward slide that began last 
fall 
bhristie said high vacancy rates in commercial properties 
particularly offices and apartments were responsible for reversing 
the industrys fiveyear upswing but he said rising interest rates 
will only aggravate the situation since they translate to higher 
borrowing costs for contractors 
the export boom which is pumping up the 1988 economy isnt 
much help to the construction industry and could even prove 
troublesome christie said as economic activity heats up 
rising interest rates imply still lower building later in the 
year

a magistrate wednesday continued bail until july 
11 for former guinness plc chairman ernest saunders and five other 
men facing charges relating to the british brewing giants 1986 
takeover of distillers co 
saunders attorney said he planned to appeal to britains high 
court over the magistrates courts refusal to grant the fired 
executive legal aid 
wednesdays court date was set in april in order to speed up the 
presentation of the evidence after the defending lawyers 
complained about delays in bringing the guinness affair to trial 
the six accused free on bail equivalent to 915000 were not 
required to appear in court wednesday and only saunders was 
present 
the other accused are former henry ansbacher and co ltd 
director lord spens stockbroker anthony parnes roger seelig 
former corporate finance director at morgan grenfell and co ltd 
financier sir jack lyons and gerald ronson chairman of heron 
international 
all six are to appear in court on july 11 together with david 
mayhew senior corporate finance partner at stockbrokers cazenove 
and co who has been released on bail separately 
the prosecution said it has presented details of its evidence to 
defense lawyers but saunders attorney norman turner said the 
substantial job of studying the evidence was blocked by saunders 
inability to pay his defense costs 
he said this could delay bringing the case to trial 
guinness has said its former management under saunders arranged 
for third parties to repurchase the companys stock apparently to 
boost its price illegally and make guinness cashandstock offer 
for distillers a gin and whisky maker more attractive than a 
rival bid 
the defendants face varying charges including aiding and 
abetting a sharesupport operation theft and false accounting

commodity futures prices have been rising and analysts are 
blaming the recent hot dry weather in the midwest 
weathers the story thats the whole ball game said victor 
lespinasse a trader with the investment firm dean witter reynolds 
inc 
on tuesday advances in prices for future delivery of soybeans 
corn oats hogs pork bellies and platinum propelled the commodity 
research bureaus index of 21 commodities to a 550point gain to 
24839 the inflation indicators highest mark since february 1985 
meantime the agriculture department reported that prices 
farmers got for raw products in may averaged 31 percent over april 
levels and were 47 percent over their mark for the same month last 
year 
higher prices for hogs oranges soybeans and broilers were 
partially offset by lower prices for tomatoes onions milk and 
upland cotton the departments agricultural statistics board 
said 
may farm commodity prices averaged 134 percent of a 1977 base 
used for comparison according to the preliminary figures a year 
ago the index was 128 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent 
this year compared with a 42 percent average increase in 1987 
but some analysts say if this springs dry weather turns into a 
drought foodprice inflation could go higher 
analysts said the buying surges in tuesdays commodity trading 
appeared to hit the markets in domino fashion beginning with 
grains and soybeans 
soybean futures opened and closed up the 30centabushel limit 
allowed for daily trading on the chicago board of trade in response 
to the midwests hot dry weekend and predictions for more of the 
same 
the agriculture department reported soybean planting was about 
74 percent finished as of sunday traders fear a drierthannormal 
summer could lead to tight supplies next year analysts said 
wheat corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of 
little rain but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made 
that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions 
tuesdays gains brought the nearmonth soybean contract for 
delivery in july to within easy striking range of 8 a bushel for 
the first time since the spring of 1984

a rash of good news greeted investors today in the form of a 
rejuvenated stock market reports of steady growth in the economy 
and a perception that interest rates may have stopped rising 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average which on 
tuesday shattered a prolonged postcrash lull by surging nearly 75 
points was up another 13 points by late morning broader market 
indices also extended gains 
also today the commerce department said in washington that its 
chief forecasting gauge of economic activity rose a moderate 02 
percent in april signaling solid growth but no danger of recession 
this year 
economists said the performance of the index of leading 
indicators was consistent with their belief that the economy was 
headed for its best year since 1984 as smokestack america benefits 
from a boom in export sales 
that strength also was reflected in another commerce department 
report today that showed orders to us factories rose a strong 12 
percent in april the second straight substantial monthly gain the 
strength came in electrical machinery lumber and wood products and 
in petroleum chemicals and paper 
a third commerce department report showed construction spending 
rose 01 percent in april the slowest pace since january but the 
figure masked a big rise in factory investment which was offset by 
a decline in public spending industrial construction is now 391 
percent higher than a year ago 
in recent weeks the financial markets have interpreted signs of 
surging us economic strength as a harbinger of inflation and 
rising interest rates eroding stock and bond prices but after the 
threeday memorial day weekend investors seemed to reject that view 
and rushed back to buy stocks and bonds 
the spree pushed the dow jones industrial average to its 
secondbiggest gain of 1988 the closely watched bluechip 
barometer climbed 7468 points tuesday to 203112 the highest 
level since it closed at 203631 on may 4 
it was the biggest oneday advance in the dow average since a 
7642 point gain on jan 4 the first trading day of the year and 
the sixthlargest rise ever 
the rally in the dow was so strong that a voluntary limit on 
computerized program trading was triggered when the averages rise 
swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading but even after 
the socalled collar went into effect for the rest of the day 
the bluechip average extended its gain 
new confidence about the nearterm outlook for inflation also 
pushed interest rates lower and lifted bond prices the treasurys 
bellwether 30year bond closed about point higher or 625 for 
every 1000 in face value while its yield dropped to 923 percent 
from 931 percent late friday 
interest rates on shortterm treasury securities however rose 
in a government auction to the highest level since the october 
stock market crash 
in other economic developments tuesday 
the agriculture department reported that prices farmers got for 
raw products in may averaged 31 percent over april levels and were 
47 percent over their mark for the same month last year 
contracting for new construction projects declined 6 percent in 
april from march extending a downward slide that began last fall 
according to a survey by the fw dodge division of mcgrawhill 
information systems co 
the government said foreign purchases of us companies dropped 
22 percent to 305 billion in 1987 the first dip since 1983 in 
the rush by overseas investors to acquire us assets 
the government reported that new singlefamily homes sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679000 last month the fastest 
pace since new homes sold at a rate of 728000 in april 1987 it 
was the third consecutive increase coming atop a 12 percent rise 
in march and an 114 percent jump in february

the government said today its chief 
forecasting gauge of economic activity rose a moderate 02 percent 
in april in what amounted to a signal of steady economic growth 
with no danger of a recession this year 
the commerce department said its index of leading indicators 
rose for the third consecutive month following a revised 02 
percent march increase and a 15 percent february surge the 
biggest gain in more than two years 
economists said the performance of the leading index was 
entirely consistent with their belief that the economy was headed 
for its best year since 1984 as smokestack america benefits from a 
boom in export sales 
the rise in the leading indicators indicates the economy is 
experiencing continuous expansion based primarily on improving 
trade and greater capital investment said jerry jasinowski 
chief economist of the national association of manufacturers 
in other good economic news the commerce department said that 
orders to us factories rose a strong 12 percent in april 
following a 16 percent march increase 
the department also reported today that construction spending 
edged up 01 percent in april as a big jump in investment on new 
factories offset a decline in spending on government projects 
all of this should be good news to vice president george bush 
who hopes to benefit from a feeling among voters that the reagan 
administration is managing the economy well 
the march increase had originally been reported as a much larger 
08 percent rise analysts had expected both the big downward 
revision to the march figure and the small increase in april 
they said the gains reflected a return to more normal economic 
activity following a rollercoaster period after the october stock 
market crash 
at one point the leading index actually fell for three 
consecutive months the traditional signal of an impending 
recession later revisions however showed the index posted big 
declines in both november and january but registered increases in 
other months 
fears of a recession this year have largely evaporated as the 
economy shook off the jolt from the market collapse to turn in 
surprisingly strong growth for this advanced stage of a 
fiveyearold economic recovery 
the government reported last week that the overall economy as 
measured by the gross national product raced ahead at an annual 
rate of 39 percent for the first three months of the year 
based on this gnp performance many economists are now 
predicting the gnp will grow at an annual rate of around 35 
percent for the whole year which would be the fastest expansion 
pace since 1984 also a presidential election year when the gnp 
rose 68 percent 
the 02 percent april rise in the leading index reflected 
increases in five separate business indicators and declines in four 
others 
the biggest source of strength was a rise in the length of the 
average workweek 
other sources of strength came from gains in the money supply a 
drop in weekly unemployment claims a rise in raw materials prices 
which is seen as a positive sign for future economic growth and an 
increase in plant and equipment orders 
the biggest negative factor was a speedup in delivery times for 
business orders seen as a sign of weaker demand this was followed 
by a decline in stock prices a drop in building permits and a drop 
in orders for consumer goods 
the various changes left the index at 1922 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
michael evans head of a washington consulting firm said he has 
boosted his gnp forecast to 37 percent for 1988 a far cry from 
the recession he had expected in the wake of the stock market 
collapse 
a lot of people used to think the stock market was one of the 
better indicators of the economys performance but it fell on its 
face this time he said 
the administrations official forecast is for gnp growth of 29 
percent this year but beryl sprinkel the presidents chief 
economic adviser said recently that the administration may boost 
that assessment when it issues its midterm economic review in 
august 
while the economic strength has caused economists to put away 
their recession scenarios for 1988 many analysts still believe 
that a downturn is likely sometime in 1989 
the national association of business economists said last week 
that its latest member survey found that 57 percent were looking 
for a recession to begin in 1989 
this pessimistic view is based on a belief that the economic 
strength this year will ignite inflationary pressures leading in 
turn to higher interest rates that could topple the country into a 
recession the federal reserve already has tightened credit twice 
in the past two months in an effort to dampen demand 
but michael penzer senior economist at bank of america in san 
francisco said that was too pessimistic an outlook 
the key is whether the fed can gradually tighten and slow the 
economy down without sending it into a recession he said they 
are walking a tightrope but they may be successful in their 
attempt at fine tuning

at the energy pool bar in the heart of tokyos 
business district office workers worn out by the daily grind are 
seeking a solution at the bottom of a bottle a tonic bottle 
a fixture at drugstores and kiosks in commuter stations tonics 
are the kick that refreshes the hardworking japanese famous for 
toiling long hours and shunning paid holidays 
taking a tonic here is not like popping open a cola for 
breakfast or sneaking a nip at lunch in the united states its 
more akin to taking your vitamins 
but its in fashion and besides some of the tonics are laced 
with alcohol caffeine or nicotine derivatives which makes them a 
whole lot easier to swallow 
whether the drinks are regarded as soft hard or somewhere in 
between depends on the kind of punch they pack some do contain 
vitamins but none is seriously regarded as an antidote for what 
ails you despite their advertising claims and many contain 
enough stimulants to worry doctors that the drinks could become 
mildly addictive 
so how do they taste well they vary popular now are some 
resembling nonsweetened cough syrup or as one westerner described 
them dr pepper without the fizz 
while the content of the drinks is regulated by the government 
few restrictions have been placed on their sale the strongest 
tonics are mostly sold in drugstores drinks containing alcohol are 
required to say so on their labels 
the energy pool bar offers over 180 varieties ranging in price 
from 100 yen 80 cents to 3000 yen 24 and containing such 
exotic ingredients as cobra extract or essence of seal 
industry sources estimate the market nationwide has swelled to 
nearly 1 billion an increase of 13 percent from 1986 over half 
that figure came from sales of tonics in tiny bottles of 50 
milliliters 15 fluid ounces or less according to takanori 
fujimoto spokesman for takeda chemical industries japans largest 
drug maker 
alinamin v a vitamin b1 tonic introduced by takeda chemical in 
march 1987 sold 10 million bottles its first year fujimoto said 
the response was much greater than we expected 
in developing alinamin v takeda sought to imitate the success 
of coca cola originally a tonic derived from coca leaves which 
revolutionized the beverage industry worldwide 
tonic names often suggest medicinal qualities while catchy 
advertising phrases make the drinks out to be something fit for a 
samurai warrior going into battle can you fight for 24 hours 
asks a commercial for regain a drink introduced in april 
many workers may be asking themselves the same question in 
japan where workers averaged 2150 work hours for 1986 compared 
with 1924 in the united states and 1655 in west germany sixday 
work weeks are common 
over 80 percent of 400 tokyo businessmen polled by the fukoku 
life insurance co in february were found to suffer workrelated 
fatigue though most said they battled the blahs with sleep baths 
or alcohol vitamin and tonic drinks were mentioned by over 25 
percent more than exercise a healthy diet and sick leave 
combined 
why tonics takeda chemicals fujimoto said the current boom in 
tonic sales reflects a break with the past 
people now buy the drinks before they get tired as a kind of 
preventative action fujimoto said and though men over the age 
of 50 have traditionally made up the bulk of the market sales 
are way up among young office workers particularly women 
miyako nakanishi pharmacist and manager of the energy pool 
said tonics claim to cure or alleviate a long list of whitecollar 
woes stomachaches and poor appetite caused by stress minor colds 
brought on by lack of exercise or hangovers from bouts of 
workrelated socializing 
but according to ms nakanishi the immediate boost from tonics 
is what brings in the customers 
most of our customers are after instant energy she said 
as sales grow however so do concerns that the drinks may not 
be as healthy as their makers claim takashi higuchi a 
physiologist at fukui medical college said the tonics may be good 
for their vitamin content but he wouldnt recommend them highly to 
sufferers of fatigue or anything else 
ms nakanishi admitted the drinks may be habitforming but 
added theyre safe if consumption is limited to one bottle a 
day recently some customers have asked specifically for drinks 
that dont contain alcohol or caffeine but most arent concerned 
with longterm effects 
after all most tonic drinkers are lured by the mystique not 
the ingredients 
businessmen work long hours theyre tired said hisako 
yoshizawa a commentator often quoted by japanese media often 
they dont eat breakfast and they dont care really what the 
drinks contain

toyota motor co will decide soon whether to 
build a truck plant in the united states a move that would halt 
japanese truck exports to the american market a toyota executive 
said 
negotiations have progressed to a rather considerable extent 
and a decision is expected soon tsutomu oshima executive vice 
president of toyota said in an interview in todays los angeles 
times 
such a move would result in the end of toyotas truck exports to 
the united states he said although he refused to disclose the 
export value of toyota trucks he said the company sent 280000 
pickup trucks to the united states last year with an average 
retail value of 9000 
sites under consideration for the plant oshima said include 
fremont calif where toyota operates a joint venture producing 
passenger cars with general motors georgetown ky where toyota 
just opened an independent passenger car production plant or a new 
location 
startup costs could eliminate the possiblity of a new location 
oshima said 
before the yen started appreciating in value japan developed 
the small pickup market in the united states even with a 25 
percent tariff we could sell our trucks at inexpensive prices 
he said 
toyota has been forced to raise its retail truck prices an 
average of 267 percent since 1985 and the prices have become a 
burden on the user oshima said 
american sales of toyota trucks totaled about 250000 in 1987 
down 30000 from 1986 this year sales have continued to decline 
oshima said

interest rates could rise further in the united 
states in the coming months and there is little likelihood of any 
easing of rates in west germany japan canada and italy the 
organization for economic cooperation and development said 
wednesday 
france is the only member of the group of seven 
industrialized countries where the cost of credit is expected to 
decline the oecd said in the latest issue of its publication 
financial market trends 
the interest rate outlook for britain is less clear because it 
depends on how the government allows the pound to move in relation 
to other currencies the report said 
the oecds observation on us rates was made before the us 
federal reserve tightened credit last week by pressuring up the 
overnight rate charged among banks for overnight loans to meet 
reserve requirements 
the oecd said it based its forecast for us rates on concerns 
about a pickup of inflationary pressures strong credit demand and 
the countrys large trade deficit 
total credit demand in the united states is expected to 
strengthen over the coming months as the economys expansion 
continues chiefly due to an anticipated steep rise in corporate 
borrowing the oecd said 
turning to britain the organization observed that britains 
trade gap widened sharply in the first quarter while stemming the 
deficit would perhaps require bringing the pound to a more 
competitive level implying lower interest rates such a move 
would clash with the governments antiinflation policy the report 
said 
the oecd predicted all major segments of japanese financial 
markets would remain very active in the coming months suggesting 
that the growing financing needs of the economy should be met 
without any particular strain on current credit conditions 
the scope for lower rates remains limited because japans 
money supply is already expanding at an unprecedented rate and its 
possible inflationary implications are giving rise to concern the 
report said 
west german interest rates are also unlikely to come down 
further because of the strength of overall loan demand and growth 
in the money supply that is running ahead of the target rate the 
oecd said

a federal judge set for june 20 a proxy vote 
to decide who will control consumer products maker allegheny 
international inc 
district judge alan bloch on tuesday set the date for the 
companys annual meeting at which shareholders will choose between 
slates of directors put forth by management and dissident 
shareholders 
the fight to gain control of allegheny international is being 
waged by two new york investment houses that are heavily invested 
in ais preferred stock 
the investment houses spear leeds amp kellogg and bomar holdings 
say the companys managers are trying to entrench themselves while 
ignoring shareholder interests they contend management plans to 
appease creditors by giving them large amounts of company stock 
thus diluting the holdings of present stockholders 
management says spear leeds cannot be trusted to run allegheny 
international and that its candidates have no experience in running 
a consumer products company 
a judge supervising ais bankruptcy delayed the may 20 proxy 
vote bloch overruled the bankruptcy judge but an appeals judge 
delayed the meeting again until the full appeals court could 
consider the matter 
ruling on a narrow legal issue the appeals court last week 
refused to further delay the meeting but left room open for 
further arguments 
unsecured creditors wanted to halt the proxy vote claiming a 
change of management would delay the companys emergence from 
bankruptcy while the campaign would drain money from the 
financially ailing company 
in rescheduling the meeting bloch said the courts should not 
interfere in corporate democracy absent a compelling showing of 
need

for example shutting off a bank of elevators or turning off the 
hot water for a few hours 
as a result the utility estimates it could save 10 megawatts or 
enough to meet a years electrical needs in 5000 homes 
boston edison has 640000 residential and business customers in 
40 cities and towns within a 30mile radius of boston 
in addition to cutting back their electricity bill the members 
of the northeast energy cooperative as the group is called will 
be paid as if they are electricity providers thats not new 
however 
what is different is that the arrangement combines peer pressure 
and altruism to save money and energy to reinforce the cooperative 
spirit each member of the group will be graded by the other 
members 
if successful the experiment will generate longterm contracts 
and more companies will be invited to join the cooperative 
the cooperative will be headed for its first year by john 
phillips a former engineer who heads the nonprofit california 
energy coalition which runs eight such utility cooperatives 
the era of building power plants is over and the time for 
better utilization of resources is here he said at a news 
conference explaining the cooperative plan which he said also is 
being used on new yorks long island 
a selfdescribed archconservative phillips said in an 
interview later that he has explained the dea to visiting planners 
from the soviet union and sweden he said they all found the notion 
novel 
what we have here is a democratic society in a more 
socialist environment he said you cant force people to do 
things 
bernard reznicek president of boston edison said the 
experiment is an attempt to deal with changes in demand for power 
we have been an industry in a supply side mentality that 
strategy has been a highcost strategy he said intelligent 
people stop and take a look and say there has to be a better way

fina oil and chemical co has unveiled an 
incentive plan in its 22state gasoline distribution network that 
will give independent distributors as much as 35000 annually in 
retirement benefits 
under the plan which analysts say is unprecedented in the 
industry distributors who buy at least 2 million gallons of fuel 
annually can receive retirement benefits of 10000 per year those 
who purchase 30 million gallons per year or more can be eligible to 
receive up to 35000 per year in benefits 
the benefits accrue to the owners of the fina distributorships 
or to the employees they designate officials said tuesday 
this will motivate our jobbers to do a better job for 
themselves as well as for fina said stuart pearman finas vice 
president of marketing and developer of the plan 
analysts said the move also will help the company polish the 
outdated image of some locations and upgrade a retail network that 
includes gas stations in iowa nebraska and kansas in the midwest 
and in texas new mexico and arizona in the southwest 
i think it benefits the company and the dealers mary anne 
sudol investment analyst with fitch investors service in new york 
told the dallas times herald 
she called the retirement plan an imaginative carrotandstick 
approach that will require distributors to improve the quality of 
their stations to take advantage of the retirement program 
the retirement program which began wednesday and runs through 
may 1993 is provided at no cost to the distributors although they 
must meet certain companyimposed requirements fina a unit of 
dallasbased american petrofina has about 4000 service stations 
nationwide 
to be eligible distributors must buy at least 2 million gallons 
of gasoline or other refined products annually from the parent 
company and reinvest available building funds in accordance with 
finas ongoing building program 
retirement fund participants also are required to increase their 
fuel purchases by at least 5 percent through may 31 1989 similar 
annual requirements must be met for distributors to continue in the 
program until its expiration on may 31 1993 
all of finas 460 distributors who own or operate about 3850 
stations in 22 states are eligible for the program pearman said 
pearman said the program is being financed through several 
insurance companies and other lenders and that fina may decide to 
continue the program after the initial fiveyear period 
the retirement benefits are guaranteed for the qualified 
participant for life and are payable starting june 1 1998 but not 
before the participant reaches 65

the stock market swept ahead for the second 
straight session today in buying inspired by waning fears about 
rising interest rates and inflation 
interest rates fell for the second straight day in the credit 
markets reducing yields on longterm treasury bonds to the 91 
percent to 92 percent level 
analysts said revived enthusiasm for both stocks and bonds was 
prompted in part by talk that the federal reserve was eager to 
avoid raising its discount rate despite its other moves of late to 
tighten credit 
aside from that rationale many wall streeters openly expressed 
surprise at the markets sudden show of strength on tuesday 
unexpected as it was the rally raised hopes that stocks had 
pulled out of the slump they been suffering through for the past 
several weeks 
the governments report that the index of leading economic 
indicators rose 02 percent in april was in line with expectations 
and brokers said it had little discernible effect on the market

if youve been hearing for weeks about the 
postcrash stock markets malaise youre probably wondering what 
has sent prices surging higher so suddenly welcome to the crowd 
seasoned market watchers expressed surprise at the buying spree 
following the long memorial day weekend that sent the languishing 
dow jones industrial average up more than 100 points in two days 
it soared nearly 75 points tuesday the biggest oneday rise 
since the beginning of the year and tacked on 33 more on wednesday 
many analysts said the rally once again proved the adage that 
you cannot outguess the market but some veteran economists warned 
that they saw no development that should so radically improve wall 
streets gloomy outlook for inflation and higher interest rates 
evidence of rising inflation persists from the chicago 
commodity pits to the neighborhood grocery checkout strains on 
americas productive abilities coupled with fears of a profound 
farm drought this summer are intensifying upward pressure on 
prices 
theres only one way to start writing this story once upon a 
time robert brusca chief economist of nikko securities co 
international in new york said in response to the stock markets 
abrupt surge its a bit of a fairy tale out there 
explanations for the turnaround included speculation that the 
federal reserve will not tighten credit further a realization that 
the economy is healthy and a postholiday tendency to buy stocks 
some economists said the markets reversal confirmed their view 
that inflation is not a big problem 
a few even suggested president reagans performance at the 
moscow summit injected a euphoric mood into the market that hasnt 
been seen since last summer well before the stunning collapse of 
oct 19 
but others said they simply did not know why the market had 
reversed course 
its a very good question said robert stovall a new 
yorkbased stock market forecaster the serenity could be 
shortlived everything thats happened has been given a positive 
bias or ignored 
some economists who scrutinize the links between markets were 
disturbed by wall streets big gain partly because it defied a 
logical pattern that had developed between stocks bonds and 
commodity prices 
in that relationship when commodity prices rise bonds fall 
over the consequent fear of inflation and depress stocks as well 
but on tuesday commodity prices jumped while stocks and bonds 
also rose 
on balance whats going on with the stock and bond markets 
does not ring true brusca said the trap door is going to open 
up again and suck everybody down 
michael moran chief economist at daiwa securities america in 
new york speculated the wall street rally reflected growing 
investor hopes of no further moves to tighten credit by the federal 
reserve he said rising commodity prices were based on fear of 
drought not a broad inflationary move 
in that environment inflation fears subside and the market 
can do a bit better moran said 
the fed already has moved a few times this year to nudge 
interest rates higher through its control of the amount of money in 
the banking system there had been speculation last week that the 
fed would take a more drastic step by announcing an increase in the 
discount rate the loan fee it charges financial institutions the 
rate has remained at 6 percent since sept 4 
some market watchers said it was pointless to speculate about 
the shortterm ups and downs of stock prices because meaningful 
trends can only be detected over a long period 
robert sobel a wall street historian and professor who has 
written several books on the market said he would advise investors 
to ignore most economists predictions of stock behavior because 
they are so unreliable 
theyd be better off using nancy reagans astrologist sobel 
said i think these people are vastly overpaid they dont know 
what theyre doing most of the time

a west german fugitive accused of defrauding 
volkswagen of more than 280 million will be escorted home friday 
by federal german police us authorities said wednesday 
hans joachim schmidt 38 a former currency trader from 
frankfurt has exhausted his extradition appeals said jim sanders 
of the us attorneys office 
in the warrant for schmidts arrest and the extradition request 
he is charged with forgery of documents and instigation of 
embezzlement in a scheme in which employees of volkswagenwerk ag 
were persuaded to enter into foreign currency transactions as part 
of a secret profitsharing agreement 
schmidt was arrested on a fugitive warrant in november 1987 at 
his hollywood apartment where he was living under an assumed name 
a special team of west german federal police was created a year 
ago to hunt for schmidt who fled in march 1987 after the discovery 
of alleged fraudulent foreign exchange deals that cost volkswagen 
about 2824 million 
volkswagen said it first discovered the fraud when the national 
bank of hungary refused to honor a contract calling on it to buy 
dollars from volkswagen 
while he was a fugitive schmidt traveled through switzerland 
several southern european countries and the caribbean west german 
police said 
prosecutors in the northern west german city of braunschweig 
have alleged that schmidt and several former volkswagen employees 
defrauded the giant automaker by falsifying financial instruments 
known as forward contracts 
such contracts are used by large international companies like 
volkswaggen to protect themselves from currency fluctuations 
schmidt is accused of putting profits from the currency exchange 
deals into secret bank accounts in switzerland and lichtenstein

the securities and exchange commission decided 
wednesday to give securities industry officials a month to press 
their objections to a proposal aimed at protecting investors 
option to sue their brokers 
the commission had been scheduled to vote to ask congress to 
pass a law barring brokerage firms from requiring customers to 
agree in advance to submit disputes to stock exchangesponsored 
arbitration panels 
but the vote was postponed after commissioners charles cox 
edward fleischman and joseph grundfest said the matter required 
more deliberation commissioners agreed to decide the matter during 
the first week of july before one of the advocates of the change 
aulana peters leaves the commission 
peters and sec chairman david ruder argued it was unfair to 
require investors to give up the right to sue before they have any 
idea of the nature or size of a dispute that may later arise 
peters and ruder also said that providing an alternative to 
arbitration will serve as an incentive to keeping the system fair 
cox said he was inclined to support ruder and peters but wanted 
to give the brokerage firms a chance to argue their case 
a survey by the sec staff of 65 firms handling 90 percent of 
all customer accounts showed that virtually all require customers 
to arbitrate disputes particularly customers who borrow money 
through margin accounts or trade in stock options 
the north american securities administrators association a 
group of state regulators has been pressing to do away with 
mandatory arbitration clauses staff members of the finance 
subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee are working 
on an arbitration bill that would among other things forbid 
forced arbitration 
however the securities industry association representing 
brokerage firms says it is unfair to dictate to brokers how they 
must do business and that it makes little sense to force cases on 
an overburdened and costly court system

i think the market was primed for any kind of even mildly 
bullish fundamental news and they got it last night said richard 
levine vice president of elders futures incs precious metals and 
foreign exchange group 
peru is a major silverproducing country but the effective 
shutdown of a single mine hardly qualifies as a major disruption in

combustion engineering inc announced in 
moscow wednesday that it had reached an agreement to help build and 
manage a multibilliondollar petrochemical complex in two western 
siberian cities 
this is the stamfordbased companys second deal with the soviet 
union in the last six months 
in november the company announced the first sovietamerican 
joint venture established under the soviet unions new policy 
allowing western concerns to own a share of soviet industries 
charles hugel president and chief executive officer of 
combustion engineering said engineering and site preparation in 
the cities of tobolsk and surgut probably would begin later this 
year 
these two complexes will probably be the largest created in 
the world hugel said 
analysts applauded wednesdays announcement 
im pleased but it is too early to tell what the full impact 
will be on combustion engineerings financial statements said 
candice eggerss an analyst with morgan stanley in new york i 
think it has the potential for being a very big market but because 
of the lack of a track record in soviet union joint ventures 
its hard to know now 
theyve put a very small amount of capital at risk for large 
potential rewards in the future she added 
the plants will produce synthetic rubber and plastics for 
consumer goods he said the western siberia site was chosen 
because of its abundance of natural gas he said 
hugel said he met with soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov last 
week about the project and mr ryzhkov would like to see the 
first plant completed by the end of 1991 or early 1992 and all of 
it done by 1995 thats a very ambitious schedule but its the 
schedule we are committed to 
ryzhkovs involvement in the project reflected the attention 
that highlevel officials are giving to improving the supply of 
consumer goods as part of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
effort to restructure the soviet economy 
gorbachev has promised that his reforms will lead to an 
improvement in supplies of goods and services to consumers who 
struggle with a system of shortages and shoddy quality 
there appears to be unusual urgency to get this project under 
way hugel said in the last several months it obviously has 
become much more important and the need to get on with it has been 
made clear by soviet officials 
hugel said the project is worth many billions of dollars 
but he could not give exact figure he said its much bigger than a 
joint venture to build a pair of plastics factories in the soviet 
ukraine announced april 13 by occidential petroleum co occidental 
estimated the value of its project at 200 million 
combustion engineering will lead a consortium that also will 
include mcdermott international the japanese firms mitsubishi and 
mitsui and the ussr ministry of oil refining and petrochemical 
industries 
tobolsk is located about 1100 miles east of moscow surgut is 
located about 270 miles to the northeast of tobolsk 
the western companies will receive payments in convertible 
currency for their design engineering and construction work and 
then will be invited to participate in a joint venture that 
actually will manufacture the petrochemicals hugel said 
the soviet ruble is not convertible making it difficult for 
foreign companies to export profits but the soviet union earns 
much of its hard currency through sales of oil and natural gas and 
certain ministries recently have been given the right to use hard 
currency as an incentive to attract foreign companies into joint 
ventures 
the plastics will be made both for soviet domestic use and for 
export officials said the percentage to be exported has not been 
determined but that most of the plastics may go to the domestic 
market if gorbachevs effort to stimulate consumer products is 
successful 
combustion engineering provides equipment and services for the 
power and process industries such as paper mills and oil 
refineries the company reported sales in 1987 of about 3 billion

having taken his potshots at the white house 
former treasury secretary donald regan is now zinging merrill lynch 
amp co the giant investment firm he headed during its rapid growth 
in the 1970s 
in the june 20 issue of fortune magazine regan blasts the 
current management at merrill lynch and suggests the company be 
taken over 
how long does it take to get your act together regan asked 
you guys have had over three years 
the threeyear period refers to william a schreyers tenure as 
chief executive of the firm schreyer added the job of merrill 
lynch chairman to that of chief executive in june 1984 succeeding 
roger birk who had followed regan in the top job 
merrill lynch said wednesday it was surprised and disappointed 
by some of the statements attributed to regan 
perhaps they reflect the fact that regan has been away from 
business for eight years a period marked by dramatic and complex 
changes merrill lynch spokesman fred yager said we believe 
merrill lynch is well positioned for the near and longterm 
future 
regan quit merrill lynch to take the treasury post in 1980 and 
became white house chief of staff in 1985 he left the reagan 
administration last year and recently published a book highly 
critical of president reagan and his wife nancy 
now head of regdon amp associates an investment firm based in 
alexandria va regan asserts in the fortune article that merrill 
lynchs costs went out of control under birk 
some of the people under roger got a little too headstrong and 
a little fat and lazy regan said merrill was not exactly run 
in a spartan manner eventually costs became a problem they 
maagement got too used to limousines and perks 
as for merrill lynchs direction under schreyer regan takes 
issue with managements approach of investing for the long term 
you dont have the luxury of the long term he said its 
a cold cruel world out there after all would merrill recommend 
to its customers that they buy the securities of a company whose 
business isnt improving 
as with its wall street competitors merrill lynch has been 
buffeted by heightened competition in financial services and the 
aftermath of the stock market crash its first quarter profit of 
683 million was off 37 percent from a year earlier while its 
1987 earnings of 3906 million dropped 14 percent from 1986 
regan argued that merrill lynch should be taken over by a 
commercial bank or some other big financial services company to 
cope if deregulation ever allows banks to compete in the brokerage 
business 
it would give the firm a hell of a competitive edge in 
servicing the full range of corporations financial needs he 
asserted merrill is not smart enough to start lending money de 
novo 
regan cited morgan guaranty trust co and general motors 
acceptance corp the automakers financial arm as prospective 
buyers 
our strategy has been to build our capital base from within 
through steady growth and selected acquisitions and that remains 
our strategy merrill lynchs yager said

rc bigelow inc a maker of herbal 
teas said wednesday it filed a lawsuit seeking to block thomas j 
lipton incs acquisition of kraft incs herbal tea subsidiary on 
grounds the merger would violate federal antitrust laws 
in its complaint filed last week in us district court in new 
haven norwalkbased bigelow claimed liptons acquisition of 
krafts celestial seasonings division would join the nations two 
largest sellers of herbal tea leaving lipton in control of about 
82 percent of the us herbal tea market 
bigelow also claimed lipton agreed to pay a bonus price for 
celestial seasonings in order to acquire a monopoly said paul 
windels jr a lawyer for bigelow 
us district judge jose a cabranes on tuesday entered a 
temporary restraining order delaying the acquisition until a 
hearing on bigelows complaint could be held june 10 
bigelow was established in 1945 by ruth c bigelow who 
developed the recipe for an herbflavored tea known as constant 
comment the company is now owned by family members 
bigelow introduced its line of herbal teas containing no tea 
but herbs and spices in 1979 and ranks third in the herbal tea 
market with about a 13 percent share the company said 
a call to liptons legal department seeking comment on the 
lawsuit was not returned wednesday 
a kraft spokesman scott horne said we remain optimistic 
about the deal and we intend to close the transaction as soon as 
possible 
lipton based in englewood cliffs nj is owned by the 
dutchenglish company unilever group 
it markets lipton and oriental treasures herbal teas and is the 
dominant company in traditional black teas with more than 50 
percent of the us market 
celestial seasonings purchased by kraft in 1984 accounts for 
more than half of us herbal tea sales according to bigelow 
kraft based in glenview ill had sales of 99 billion in 1987

a woman who died of lung cancer after 
smoking for 40 years knew the risks but chose to smoke anyway a 
tobacco company lawyer said wednesday as final arguments began in 
the product liability trial of three cigarette manufacturers 
the companies are charged with misleading the public about the 
dangers of cigarettes and contributing to the 1984 death of rose 
cipollone 58 
defense summations came exactly four months after the case 
opened in federal court with a lawyer for widower antonio cipollone 
outlining the case against liggett group inc lorillard inc and 
philip morris co 
the case rests on the simple proposition that if you believe 
the testimony of rose cipollone and her family that she smoked 
cigarettes because she wanted to and because she liked to even 
though she knew the risks then the jury should return a 
verdict for liggett and myers said donald j cohn an attorney 
for liggett 
mrs cipollone enjoyed smoking and that was why she continued 
to smoke and she didnt want anyone to tell her not to do it he 
said 
cohn reviewed testimony by mrs cipollones relatives including 
her brother thomas defrancesco who said their mother blamed their 
fathers death on smoking 
the point is before mrs cipollone even started smoking she 
was hearing these kinds of stories from her mother cohn said 
shortly after mrs cipollone met her husbandtobe she told him 
she had a bad habit smoking cohn said of cipollones own 
testimony on the stand 
she knew what she was doing she knew what she was saying she 
was an intelligent strongminded person cohn said noting that 
mrs cipollone took a job over her husbands objections 
mrs cipollone knew that other family members had quit cold 
turkey and that she was able to control her habit not smoking in 
the bedroom at dinner or on the job said cohn the point is 
she did not want to quit he said 
cohn in his 3hour summation asserted that cigarettes are not 
a proven cancer cause and said controversy on the issue still 
rages 
its a free country people have a right to express their 
opinion based on the evidence cohn said its their first 
amendment right and corporations have the right too 
closing arguments for the other companies attorneys were 
scheduled for thursday 
cipollone charges that the companies through inadequate 
research and a failure to publicize what they did know about the 
dangers of smoking should be held liable for damages in his wifes 
death 
about 150 spectators including lawyers financial analysts 
reporters and others packed the courtroom for final arguments 
if the jury decides for cipollone and awards him damages it 
would be the first time a tobacco company has been ordered to pay 
liability claims brought by smokers and their families 
the lawsuit filed in 1983 is one of fewer than a dozen by 
smokers or their relatives to reach a jury 
a cipollone victory could spur similar lawsuits some lawyers 
say their tobacco industry opponents argue that a defeat for 
cipollone could perhaps stifle for good such lawsuits because of 
the effort time and expense 
antismoking advocates and lawyers have already hailed the 
cipollone case as a victory of sorts because of the unprecedented 
look into the inner workings of the industry through a wealth of 
confidential documents introduced into evidence by cipollones 
lawyers 
antitobacco litigators say these documents will help them in 
future lawsuits health groups said the revelations have already 
spurred members of congress to step up legislative action limiting 
the tobacco industry 
for example an industry trade group executive wrote in a 1972 
memorandum that the defense against critics of smoking included 
creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying 
it tobacco company lawyers have denied such a strategy 
through a series of pretrial rulings and a major decision last 
month by the trial judge h lee sarokin most of cipollones 
claims were cut from his lawsuit 
essentially the jury in the civil case must decide two types of 
claims against all three companies and two specifically against 
liggett 
they must determine whether each company intentionally 
misrepresented claims about the health consequences of smoking and 
whether each conspired to do so as for liggett the jury will 
consider claims under state liability laws whether the company 
failed to warn the public about the risks of its products and 
whether liggett violated its warranty duties 
mrs cipollone smoked liggetts cigarettes before 1966 the year 
warnings were put on cigarette packs which the courts have said 
preempted failuretowarn claims after that year 
both sides presented two dozen witnesses including top tobacco 
company executives company researchers physicians medical 
experts advertising and marketing experts and cipollone family 
members 
cipollone 64 in his testimony tearfully described the 
progression of his wifes lung cancer and their final moments 
together in the hospital where she died 
the jury also heard pretrial testimony from mrs cipollone who 
spoke of her infatuation with cigarettesmoking movie stars and 
desperate fear of illness caused by cigarettes

seven ethanol producers filed a 21 
billion antitrust lawsuit in district court on wednesday alleging 
that four major oil companies conspired to discourage the sale of 
ethanol 
the defendants are shell oil co marathon petroleum co amoco 
oil co and chevron usa inc 
bob wright of lafayette la one of the attorneys who filed the 
lawsuit charged that the oil companies made inaccurate and 
misleading statements against gasohol a blend of 10 percent 
ethanol and 90 percent gasoline 
the clearest evidence of what the oil companies have done is 
labeling wright said at a news conference 
he said signs at some of the oil companies service stations 
say our gasoline contains no alcohol or ethanol or our 
gasoline is clean 
those sorts of signs and labels would clearly infer there 
is something wrong with alcohol or ethanol wright said 
spokespeople for the oil companies had no immediate comment 
as a result of the oil companies campaign wright said the 
ethanol market has effectively dried up with producers 
suffering significant economic damages 
the plaintiffs include greater rockford energy and technology 
corp of rockford ill shepherd oil inc of jennings la 
vidalia ethanol ltd of vidalia la alpebo inc of jennings 
la shreveport ethanol inc of shreveport la lakefield ethanol 
inc of lakefield minn and a e montana inc of amsterdam mont 
ethanol is made from corn and if the ethanol industry had been 
allowed to grow wright said it would have had a tremendous 
effect on agriculture 
wright said ethanol also is good for the environment since it 
can reduce harmful emissions from automobile exhausts 
the lawsuit also said the defendants refused to accept 
creditcard invoices from gasohol sales and terminated some 
retailers or distributors who did accept creditcard invoices for 
gasohol purchases 
the companies also limited the availability of gasohol to 
consumers and refused to communicate or deal directly with the 
plaintiffs the lawsuit contended 
the ethanol manufacturers are asking for three times their 
actual damages of 700 million and for an injunction to stop the 
defendants from engaging in practices allegedly designed to hurt 
the ethanol market 
where this industry be without oil companies negatively 
advertising against our product would be speculation but i believe 
it would be a lot larger said steve wentworth first vice 
president of the national corn growers association the bottom 
line here is marketshare the major oil companies dont want to 
give it up to independent blenders
