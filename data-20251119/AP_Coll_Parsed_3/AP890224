a bookstore chain caught up in the controversy of the satanic 
verses went on the offensive thursday with writers and 
booksellers decrying death threats against its author and islamic 
groups seeking compassion for their faith 
lets not be stampeded by this kind of intellectual terrorism 
lets vote with our wallets buy the book said poet and novelist 
michael anania at a rally at the chicago public librarys cultural 
center 
writers nationwide have rallied in support of salman rushdie 
whose novel has enraged moslems and brought a death sentence from 
irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and offers of a 52 million 
bounty 
moslem leaders in the united states while denouncing the death 
sentence and threats of violence against bookstores said the book 
was intolerable to followers of islam and called for withdrawal of 
this slanderous work 
we simply expect the media to accord muslims the same rights 
that have been generally extended to other religious minorities 
said ahmad zaki hammad president of the islamic society of north 
america in plainfield ind it is regrettable that viking penquin 
inc the us publishers has shown insensitivity to the concerns 
of muslims 
three us bookstore chains had yanked the book off shelves but 
b dalton and barnes amp noble bookstores which are under common 
ownership decided wednesday to stock the book 
the third chain waldenbooks the nations largest with 1200 
stores placed fullpage advertisements in fridays editions of the 
new york times and eight other newspapers saying it will continue 
to sell the book despite many threats of violence 
in the text of the ad waldenbooks complained that it was 
subjected to unfair castigation for telling its outlets to 
remove the book from their shelves for security reasons 
waldenbooks noted that it continued to sell the book while not 
displaying it until its supply ran out also late last week it gave 
store managers permission to display the book at their discretion 
we will continue to sell the book when it comes back in stock 
at the publisher waldenbooks said we will continue to use 
discretion in displaying the book 
the chains president harry hoffman has said it has received 
about 60 bomb threats 
the times reported in fridays editions that demand for the 
satanic verses has been strong among independent booksellers who 
report taking orders for nearly 200000 copies of the book 
yet all of the more than 300 independent booksellers surveyed by 
the times said they did not have copies of the book for sale 
protests also came from groups in washington 
the ayatollah hasnt only taken out a contract on salman 
rushdie he has taken out a contract on our american freedoms to 
read to write and to express ourselves as we choose said arthur 
j kropp president of people for the american way the 
275000member organization has opposed efforts by american 
fundamentalists to censor textbook and school reading lists 
an ad hoc group calling itself the international committee for 
free expression also issued a statement in washington decrying 
irans threats against the british author 
we can not and will not tolerate a threat to assassinate a 
writer for his ideas or others for disseminating those ideas 
declared the committee which includes the american library 
association and american booksellers association 
at the chicago rally 300 writers and supporters heard pulitzer 
prizewinning author studs terkel compare rushdie to john scopes 
who was tried for teaching darwinism and author john steinbeck 
criticized for his grapes of wrath 
rushdie a british citizen born in india into a moslem family 
went into hiding in england because of the death threats 
the president of chicagos muslim community center mohammed 
kaiseruddin said after the writers speeches that he objects to the 
death sentence but doesnt believe such very strong profane 
passages about people moslems respect the most should be tolerated 
by society 
a writer in seattle was organizing a public reading of rushdies 
work for march 9 the day he was supposed to give a reading during a 
us promotional tour that was canceled 
at a public reading wednesday night at ohio university in athens 
those who read the passages said their intent was not to offend 
islam but to protest censorship 
we are here to confirm our right as americans to read whatever 
we want said graduate student ed allen

to the rest of the world he was known as emperor 
hirohito but in japan his given name was seldom used in japanese 
he was simply called tenno heika meaning his majesty the emperor 
the foreign habit of using his name rankled some japanese who 
found it impolite and unnecessary since to them there is only one 
emperor some japanese complained that after his death it even 
became inaccurate to call him hirohito because he has been given the 
posthumous name showa 
in japanese histories he will be recorded as emperor showa the 
name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926 it 
means enlightened peace and has been succeeded by heisei or 
achieving peace the name the government chose for the reign of 
hirohitos son akihito a few hours after the emperor died jan 7 
but for the convenience of the rest of the world which is not so 
able to keep track of the person behind the changed name even 
official agencies have used the name hirohito in englishlanguage 
publications 
the obituary issued in english by the foreign press center which 
is supported by the foreign ministry was headed his late majesty 
the emperor hirohito 
englishlanguage newspapers published in japan quickly began 
using the name showa for hirohito after his death but it did not 
become truly official until jan 31 when emperor akihito conducted 
a ceremony in which showa became the late emperors posthumous name 
a stone tablet placed in his tomb is engraved only with the 
posthumous name and the dates of his death and burial 
the custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their 
reigns began after the death in 1912 of emperor meiji hirohitos 
grandfather 
in japan years are numbered according to the emperors tenure on 
the throne thus 1926 became showa 1 as crown prince hirohito 
ascended to the throne on dec 25 when his father emperor taisho 
died the year 1927 was showa 2 and 1989 was showa 64 until 
hirohitos death on jan 7 now this year is heisei 1 
the japanese custom of changing imperial names is not unique 
among world royalty where an individual may have a variety of names 
and titles in a royal career in britain prince andrew became the 
duke of york upon his marriage in 1986

the heads of amherst college and the 
university of massachusetts have joined forces to condemn an annual 
snowball fight that nearly blinded a student in one eye this winter 
the two school leaders released a statement thursday blasting the 
dec 14 fight as amherst college prepared a lawsuit against its 
neighbor umass for building damages and medical costs incurred by 
the injured student gary e gonya 19 of toledo ohio 
the freshman student had to undergo emergency surgery to save 
an eye in light of this incident it has become clear to us that we 
can no longer tolerate the continuation of this tradition 
amherst president peter r pouncey and umass chancellor joseph d 
duffey said in the statement 
pouncey estimated damage to the school at more than 10000 in 
the last several years the two school leaders promised to educate 
our students about the dangers of this event and plan other 
measures to deter students from participating 
amherst spokeswoman terry allen said it was unclear what further 
measures the schools will take she said police have been unable to 
identify gonyas assailants from videotapes of the snowball fight 
the fights usually take place on the first significant snowfall 
of the year university students march to the amherst campus a mile 
away and engage in battle 
amherst college will seek a preliminary injunction to allow 
campus and town police to arrest anyone found instigating a snowball 
fight at the school said school spokesman douglas wilson 
the complaint against umass is expected to be filed with 
hampshire superior court in the next few days according to wilson 
duffey and pouncey contended that the violence has escalated as 
students have begun packing snowballs with rocks that have broken 
several dormitory windows gonya who may have been hit with a 
snowcovered rock spent five days in hospitals in northampton and 
boston doctors say his vision is blurry but he will regain sight 
in a few months 
in 1987 umass paid more than 3000 to amherst college for 
damages from that years snowball fight the college claims umass 
still owes 1788 from last years bombardment 
i dont think this university as an institution is liable for 
the behavior of its students once they leave the campus duffey 
has said

not routine japan buries emperor hirohito on friday the first 
imperial funeral in 62 years despite memories of aggression 
committed in hirohitos name in world war ii his funeral has 
brought dignitaries from more than 160 countries to tokyo 
university of tokyo political science professor seizaburo sato 
said there were two reasons for so many countries to come one is 
the increasing interdependence of the countries throughout the 
world and the second is the increasing importance of japan in the 
world community 
japan is rich it is exerting international influence through 
financial power while its military strength is held in check by a 
postwar constitution that rejects force as a way of dealing with 
international disputes 
in many ways japan is about as up to date as you can get its 
industrial prowess has made its automakers into global operators who 
produce more motor vehicles than us competitors in high 
technology the japanese are at the forefront of superconductivity 
research and computer developments 
the robust economy is propelled by the renowned diligence and 
managerial skill of the japanese at the governments urging the 
economy is being restructured to depend more on domestic consumption 
than on the export drives that led to trade imbalances and friction 
with other countries 
one problem is politics which is widely held to have been 
corrupted by the tide of cash that has accompanied japans rise to 
economic superpower 
a headline in thursdays mainichi shimbun questioning of 
political figures looms the story said that prosecutors 
investigating suspected bribery are on the verge of deciding whether 
to question 17 politicians about ethically dubious share 
transactions that benefitted them or their aides 
among those politicians is prime minister noboru takeshita the 
chairman of the committee organizing hirohitos funeral and playing 
host to the presidents kings prime ministers and other foreign 
officials now in tokyo also on the list are takeshitas 
predecessor yasuhiro nakasone and other leaders of the liberal 
democratic party 
all have denied any wrongdoing but some japanese media are 
speculating that takeshita will not last long despite his announced 
intention to clean up political ethics starting right away 
still looming are those prosecutors who arrested eight 
businessmen and bureaucrats in the last two weeks for questioning on 
suspicion of bribery or securities law violations but havent 
touched the politicians yet 
the conservative party has governed since world war ii with the 
exception of 10 months of socialist cabinets in 194748 it holds 
fat majorities in both houses of the diet or parliament 297 of 
512 seats in the house of representatives and 143 of 252 in the 
upper house of councillors 
in july however elections will be held for half the upperhouse 
seats and the ruling party is worried a setback would probably 
send takeshita to the back benches of the diet and the recruit 
scandal has tainted so many leaders of his party that its hard to 
guess who would succeed him 
another of thursdays headlines ldps man quits race for 
governor over recruit funds recruit co is the conglomerate at 
the center of the stocktrading scandal threatening the ruling 
party and it has become anathema to have received its donations 
the news story says that takeshita persuaded his candidate kazuo 
aichi to withdraw from the miyagi prefecture gubernatorial race 
because aichi had received 60000 in donations from recruit since 
1975 
the conservatives long grasp on power has both stultified 
politics and encouraged corruption analysts say its also widely 
held that the conservatives probusiness policies helped make japan 
the peaceful economic giant it has become after being laid waste in 
the war 
this conundrum of money politics linked with economic strength is 
making the japanese especially thoughtful as they close a long 
chapter of history in burying their emperor of 62 years

an indiana house committee has approved a 
bill that would permit a jail sentence to be suspended for a 
convicted rapist criminal deviate or child molester who undergoes 
surgical castration 
rep richard l worden an investigator for the public defender 
in allen county and a former constable said he introduced the bill 
out of frustration that current criminal sanctions against rapists 
and child molesters dont deter criminals from committing those acts 
again 
you take the part away from the man that starts the process in 
the first place said worden a republican 
the crimes now carry prison sentences of six to 50 years 
depending on the circumstances 
the bill which the house county and township committee approved 
by a 53 vote on thursday calls for a convicted rapist child 
molester or criminal deviate to be set free if after sentencing the 
person volunteers for surgical castration the measure now goes to 
the full house 
an opponent of the bill democratic rep john gregg pointed out 
that many child molestation cases dont involve intercourse 
offenders castrated after those crimes might still commit child 
molestation again he said 
i dont think we ought to be setting our policy in indiana to 
follow islamic countries said gregg 
another opponent ruth peters of the indiana civil liberties 
union argued that rape often is a crime of violence not one 
motivated by sexual drives under wordens proposal she said a 
convicted rapist who had been castrated could go free to commit 
other violent acts

federal health officials have reported for the 
first time that some leather tannery workers exposed on the job to a 
controversial solvent are at increased risk for testicular cancer 
an estimated 90000 or more us workers are exposed to the 
chemical solvent dimethlyformamide or dmf the national centers for 
disease control said thursday that while tannery workers exposed to 
the solvent are at elevated risk dmf cannot currently be shown 
as a definitive cause and the exact risks require further 
evaluation 
dmf is also used in the aircraft industry the national institute 
for occupational safety and health believes that about 94000 us 
workers are potentially exposed to the solvent 
three cases of testicular cancer were diagnosed in workers at a 
leather tannery in upstate new yorks fulton county between 1982 and 
1984 triggering a state and federal investigation the tannery had 
used dmf to help dyes seep into the leather being processed there 
three such cases among 80 workers on the plants finishing line 
between 197587 is 41 times greater than would be expected 
statistically which indicates an elevated risk for testicular 
cancer among finishing line workers the cdc said 
further a survey of medical records found seven additional cases 
of testicular cancer in fulton county males aged 2054 between 1974 
and 1987 five of the 10 casepatients had been employed in 
leatherrelated occupations the cdc said in its report thursday 
prepared with niosh 
two of those five patients were from tanneries other than the 
original investigation site calvert said 
the cdc report noted that the tannery identified in news reports 
as the pan american tannery of gloversville had withdrawn its dmf 
dyes and replaced them with other materials and other nearby 
facilities have done the same or are considering it

democrats and republicans alike say they are 
concerned that the white house forced health and human services 
secretarydesignate louis sullivan to forgo nearly 300000 he was 
entitled to from his medical school job 
i feel what is being asked of you has not been asked of others 
in the past said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
senate finance committee which endorsed sullivan on a 190 vote 
thursday 
sen john danforth rmo agreed saying it is grossly unfair 
to him my hope is we can reopen this issue with the white 
house 
the issue of sullivans severance pay from the morehouse school 
of medicine in atlanta came to light earlier this month when 
president bush was trying to fend off ethical questions about 
several of his other top appointees 
committee members said they think the white house overreacted and 
forced sullivan to give up the severance pay even though he was 
entitled to the money and accepting it would not have violated any 
ethical rules 
at the time bush was on the defensive on ethics issues with 
questions being raised about defense secretarydesignate john 
towers relationships with defense contractors white house ethics 
chief c boyden grays links to a communications corporation 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemps acceptance of 
speaking fees exceeding house limits and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutters acceptance of a lavish reception from a tobacco 
company 
sullivan said during his confirmation hearing wednesday that he 
decided to forgo the severance pay because conflictofinterest 
questions were raised in news reports about the arrangement he said 
such questions could hamper his effectiveness and damage the image 
of morehouse 
i felt it was more important to clear up those questions by the 
action i took he said 
donald campbell deputy director of the office of government 
ethics has said the office concluded that sullivan was entitled to 
take the severance pay but that he surrendered it before the 
opinion could be written 
the white house did not return calls for comment on the senates 
concerns thursday 
bentsen said after the hearing that it appeared the nominees 
decision to forfeit the money has been pressed on him adding 
that sullivan is not in any kind of position to make that kind of 
sacrifice 
bentsen suggested that the senate governmental affairs committee 
might look into the matter and if appropriate clarify that ethics 
rules were not intended to apply to the kind of contractual 
arrangement sullivan had with morehouse 
the severance pay generated more interest among committee members 
than sullivans position on abortion which had produced the most 
public controversy over bushs only black cabinet nominee 
in his opening statement to the committee sullivan said he holds 
the same views on the issue as bush i am opposed to abortion 
except when the life of the mother is threatened or cases of rape 
or incest 
he also said he supports an antiabortion amendment to the 
constitution with the same exceptions and would like to see the 
supreme court overturn its 1973 roe vs wade ruling that legalized 
abortion 
sullivan apologized to sen bob packwood rore for having 
misspoken his position on abortion in a private meeting with the 
senator when he reportedly said he favored retaining roe vs wade 
he did not address remarks he made in an atlanta newspaper that he 
supported abortion rights 
david j andrews acting president of planned parenthood 
federation of america said following the committee vote that he was 
deeply troubled by sullivans testimony it is obvious that 
much political maneuvering has gone on in the weeks since dr 
sullivans appointment was first announced andrews said 
the national right to life committee which was riled by 
sullivans earlier remarks welcomed the secretarydesignates 
statements opposing abortion 
however douglas johnson legislative director of the 
antiabortion group said he was disappointed that sullivan refused 
to say whether he would extend a moratorium barring federal funding 
of medical research involving the transplant of fetal tissue 
questioned by sen william armstrong rcolo sullivan said i 
certainly would not want to do anything that would encourage 
abortion to be done in order to get fetal tissue 
however sullivan said he would not venture further on the issue 
until he reviews the recommendations of an advisory committee and 
consults with others about when if ever it might be appropriate to 
use fetal tissue for medical research 
armstrong said he was disappointed in sullivans reply and when 
the time came to vote on sullivans confirmation the senator simply 
voted present

democrats who control congress now dominate the 
means of getting there having spent more money raised more and 
received more from special interests than the republicans 
the federal election commission put the price tag for electing 
the 101st congress last year at 458 million not appreciably higher 
than it was to finance the campaigns of the 100th congress two years 
earlier 
however the commission in a report issued thursday found that 
the democrats now have surpassed the republicans in raising money 
for senate campaigns from political action committees in the house 
the democrats have widened the lead they held previously 
one result is that republicans suddenly are sounding like 
threadbare populists while democrats say they have made peace with 
the captains of industry who once regarded them with suspicion 
all of the democrats expressions of concerns about the 
republicans being the party of moneyed interests are shown up by 
these figures to be absolutely false said john buckley a 
spokesman for the national republican congressional committee which 
provides money and other help for gop house candidates 
however anita dunn spokeswoman for the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee said her party was able to recruit stronger 
candidates and they in turn were able to attract greater 
contributions 
in the senate democratic candidates got almost 249 million 
from political action committees or pacs while republicans 
received 215 million according to the fec report 
until last year the senate republicans had raised more money 
from pacs than did democrats in 1986 the gop raised 49 million 
more than democrats from pacs and in 1984 the margin was 16 
million 
the differences were far more pronounced in the house where the 
democrats control is more lopsided house democratic candidates 
received more than 669 million from pacs while republicans got 
barely half that amount 349 million the gap between democrats 
and republicans in 1986 was 22 million and in 1984 it was 17 
million 
i think that pacs take a look at races and they take a look at 
candidates and i think frankly we just had better candidates 
ms dunn said they are not perceived as hostile to the business 
community as they arent 
i think this is a party that realizes that certainly business 
is important to this country 
overall the democrats raised 1074 million for senate campaigns 
and spent almost 1075 million in 1987 and 1988 the twoyear 
period the election commission uses for compiling figures on the 
most recent election the republicans raised 913 million and spent 
932 million 
in the house democrats raised 1598 million and spent 1451 
million while the gop received 1166 million and spent 1105 
million 
another 13 million was spent by the 264 candidates who ran for 
congress as independents or on minorparty tickets 
republicans in congress have called for reform of the campaign 
finance system saying it gives an unfair advantage to incumbents 
most of whom are democrats but while backing some means of limiting 
spending the republicans are against any reform that would involve 
public financing of congressional campaigns as is now the case with 
presidential candidates 
ms dunn said republicans have become recent converts to the idea 
of finance reform 
the republicans didnt complain about the pac system in 1986 
when they controlled the senate and their incumbents outspent our 
challengers 21 or 21 ms dunn said 
among senate candidates sen pete wilson rcalif spent far 
more than anyone else to keep his job nearly 13 million wilsons 
democratic opponent leo mccarthy spent almost 7 million 
that was considerably less than in the 1986 campaign when 
wilsons colleague from california democratic sen alan cranston 
spent nearly 108 million to fend off republican ed zschau who 
spent some 113 million 
its just because its so damned expensive to run in 
california said linda royster a spokeswoman for wilson the 
media market in california is so massive and so expensive it 
virtually compels a candidate for statewide office there to raise 
more money than some would think is humanly possible 
ms royster said wilson accepts fundraising as something he has 
to do to be in politics but it drives him crazy 
wilson raised 18 million from pacs second only to sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas who raised more than 23 million 
he says while he does not believe there is a conflict of 
interest involved in accepting pac contributions as long as there 
is a public perception that it is creating a conflict of interest 
the congress has a responsibility to do something about reform 
ms royster said 
in the house two democrats who unsuccessfully sought an open 
seat in a tennessee special election topped the spending list jane 
eskind spent nearly 26 million while philip bredesen spent almost 
19 million bob clement who beat them spent just 938492 but 
that brings the total spent on that one seat in congress to nearly 
54 million 
wisconsin democrat herb kohl won a seat in the senate and a 
distinction in the 1988 campaign he spent nearly 74 million on 
his campaign and some 61 million of that was his own money a 
record for the year much of the remainder was borrowed

more than a month after taking office the bush 
administration is still marking time on major foreign policy issues 
while the soviet union takes the initiative in the middle east and 
nuclear weapons reduction talks remain on hold 
the funeral diplomacy president bush is conducting in tokyo 
20minute meetings with world leaders assembled for emperor 
hirohitos rites is being described in some press accounts as 
minisummitry but the sessions are so brief they can only 
scratch the surface of difficult problems 
in the meantime soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
is winding up a whirlwind swing through the middle east in which he 
offered israel a resumption of diplomatic ties in exchange for 
attending a peace conference with the palestine liberation 
organization 
apart from that proposal the shevardnadze trip is important 
because it marks a new initiative by president mikhail s gorbachev 
to work with arab moderates instead of the radical forces that are 
only on the periphery of events 
that could make the soviets an important player especially if 
moscow restores ties with israel after a lapse of more than 21 years 
bushs remark this week before his departure for tokyo that the 
soviets would and should play only a limited role in middle east 
diplomacy drew a lighthearted rebuke thursday in cairo from 
shevardnadze 
that is sad the foreign minister said it injects a 
meaning of rivalry if the united states can singlehandedly resolve 
all the issues in the middle east we would welcome that but they 
cant there must be a collective effort to defuse the middle east 
crisis 
bush said he would not be rushed or stampeded by soviet moves 
but the pressure for a us initiative is coming not only from 
moscow touring nato capitals last week secretary of state james a 
baker iii was urged by the british spanish dutch greek and french 
to seize on what they contend is growing palestinian moderation and 
to get involved in peacemaking 
but baker told them it would be a mistake to move too quickly or 
to aim too high if the situation did not call for it and he was 
still cautious after bush met in tokyo with egyptian president hosni 
mubarak king hussein of jordan and president chaim herzog of israel 
baker said there were perhaps some opportunities out there with 
respect to the middle east peace process that havent existed 
before 
at the state department meanwhile there was no word on when the 
policy review would be completed 
spokesman charles e redman said policies are being looked at 
in a broad sense he said experts were examining the issues and 
that policymakers would get involved at the appropriate time 
the review of us arms control policy also is in low gear 
negotiations with the soviets to reduce longrange nuclear 
weapons were to resume last week the talks have been postponed 
indefinitely although nato and the warsaw pact will open separate 
negotiations on nonnuclear forces in vienna on march 7 
the reagan administration was aiming at a 50 percent reduction in 
strategic nuclear missiles bombers and submarines the two main 
obstacles to completing a treaty were the us strategic defense 
initiative and finding ways to verify compliance with the accord 
policymakers in the bush administration may be less committed to 
the search for a spacebased defense against ballistic missiles 
that could point to a compromise with the soviets who are 
determined to slow down the star wars program 
on the other hand brent scowcroft the assistant to the 
president for national security affairs might push for development 
of a new mobile missile that could complicate the verification 
problem as well as require a recalculation of some tentative 
weapons ceilings set during the reagan administration 
and completing the start treaty could be delayed even further

a longpredicted downturn in military 
recruiting has begun with army recruiters missing their quotas for 
the first time this decade the pentagon says 
the other three military services managed to hit their enlistment 
quotas for the first quarter of fiscal 1989 but also are showing 
signs of distress the pentagon said thursday 
the downturn has been predicted for more than a year primarily 
because of the strong economy and a dwindling pool of 18yearolds 
but we need to act now to head off future recruiting 
problems said grant s green jr the assistant defense secretary 
for force management and personnel 
the first step is to work with congress on military pay and to 
restore the value of recruiting incentives advertising resources 
and education benefits he said otherwise we could begin the 
chain of events that led to the serious military manpower problems 
of the last decade 
the latest manpower report covers the period from last oct 1 to 
dec 31 during those three months the four services had a combined 
quota of 61900 people 
the services signed up 61700 or just 200 shy of their goal 
but breaking the statistics down by individual service the army 
fell short of its goal of 24143 by 475 men and women the first 
such decline since 1980 
the navy managed to exceed its quarterly goal of 18900 by 
signing up 19200 men and women but it did so by calling up 
earlier than expected volunteers who had joined the delayed entry 
program to put off their military service by a few months 
the army and navy also had to increase the percentage of 
category 4 volunteers or low scorers on the military entrance 
test that they accepted the report shows the army had to accept 
almost 11 percent of its recruits from category 4 more than double 
the 4 percent level maintained for the past three years 
the marine corps matched its recruiting goal during the quarter 
by bringing in 7100 men and women and the air force also matched 
its objective of 11800 
but the marine corps and air force have reported they are 
working harder to meet their recruiting objectives green said 
while the department still considers this recruiting 
performance to be good environmental factors cannot be ignored 
green said thursday 
unemployment is at a 14year low the youth population will 
continue to decline through fiscal 1996 and budgetary pressures 
remain a concern 
according to census bureau projections the pool of 18yearolds 
in the united states has been declining for some years and wont 
begin increasing again until at least 1996

while president bush is half a world away his 
supporters are trying to convince skeptical conservatives he is a 
worthy successor to their longtime hero ronald reagan 
ronald reagan started the revolution former rep jack kemp 
told thursdays opening session of the conservative political action 
conference ill bet you right here and now today that george 
bush president bush will consolidate it strengthen it broaden 
it broaden its appeal 
long a conservative favorite kemp now is housing secretary in 
the bush cabinet 
lee atwater bushs handpicked chairman of the republican party 
cited his involvement in three reagan presidential campaigns and 
then said another hero of mine is george bush 
confronted by an openly critical delegate from young americans 
for freedom atwater said that there is something to criticize 
about any president but conservatives were not going to get a 
better conservative elected the rest of this century than george 
bush 
yaf delegates from california issued a report card on the 
bush presidency and said he has walked away from his conservative 
campaign promises that won him the election 
the group gave bush an f on aid to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels it is well known that the bush administration will refuse 
to seek military aid to the freedom fighters they said 
when jeffrey e wright the chairman of the california yaf 
chapter confronted the party chairman after the speech atwater 
said theres nobody who feels stronger about freedom fighters 
across this globe than george bush 
i would not judge things quite this early if i were you and i 
wouldnt be too harsh on him until you see what happens said 
atwater 
i have to judge him sorry said wright 
im sorry too said atwater 
bush is used to criticism from delegates to this annual meeting 
two years ago as the fight for the 1988 republican presidential 
nomination was heating up bush outraged many conservatives by 
declining an invitation to address cpac 
his six rivals appeared at the conference 
despite opposition from many conservative activists bush easily 
won the gop nomination and a little more than a month ago succeeded 
reagan in the white house 
reagan was a regular participant at cpac meetings and his 
retirement cast a long shadow on the current one 
david keene chairman of the american conservative union one of 
the principal sponsors of the conference noted that reagan had 
participated in 13 of the 16 cpac meetings including all those 
held while he was president 
his absence this year really is symbolic of another change 
within the movement the reagan era for all of its importance 
has ended said keene 
sergio picchio national chairman of young americans for freedom 
said the retirement of reagan meant we dont really have a leader 
that unifies the whole movement 
when he and keene were asked to identify likely successors to 
reagan as the leader of the conservative movement the names they 
cited included kemp sens phil gramm of texas and trent lott of 
mississippi and columnist and former white house aide pat buchanan 
no one suggested bush might succeed reagan as the conservative 
hero

president bush should begin correcting the 
deplorable conditions on most indian reservations by putting a 
someone in the white house in charge of issues affecting native 
americans say three senators who have been investigating those 
conditions 
we urge you to consider our call for active and coordinated 
policymaking at all levels of the government most notably at the 
white house the office of management and budget and the 
departments of interior and justice said sens dennis deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz and thomas daschle dsd in a 
letter thursday to bush 
by putting someone at the white house in charge of indian issues 
bush would send a signal throughout the indian communities of your 
dedication to americas first inhabitants they said 
the senators are members of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs and have been conducting special investigative hearings on a 
wide range of problems on reservations and within government 
agencies doing business with them 
they said they wanted to meet as soon as possible with whomever 
bush designates 
the senators said their hearings will likely produce legislative 
proposals for correcting longtime deficiencies in government 
policies toward indians 
the white house could in the meantime get reform started they 
said 
in their letter the senators said testimony before their 
committee casts doubt on whether the federal government is meeting 
its responsibility to protecting the rights of american indians to 
their land water forest hunting fishing and mineral resources 
as we are sure you will agree legal representation is at the 
very core of the federal governments trust responsibility to 
american indians they said the inherent conflicts facing the 
federal trustee arise not only in legal matters but also in policy 
decisions 
the president was in japan thursday for the funeral of the late 
emperor hirohito there was no immediate response to the senators 
letter from the white house

high school principals enjoyed a 49 percent 
salary boost to an average of 52987 this school year reflecting 
what one official called a recognition that they are key players 
in the drive for better education 
the lowest salary scale among senior high principals nationwide 
was 30497 paid in one of the largest districts surveyed with at 
least 25000 students according to the survey by the national 
association of secondary school principals 
the report was released thursday at the principal groups annual 
meeting being held this week in new orleans data on more than 1000 
school districts around the country was collected by the educational 
research service a private nonprofit research arm created in 1973 
by the principals association and several other education groups 
pay increases exceeded the 41 percent overall inflation rate for 
1988 but were not as steep as the 67 percent salary increases of 
the preceeding four years 
i think it represents the fact that principals are being 
recognized as key players in the drive for better schools said 
paul w hersey the associations director of professional 
assistance 
hersey pointed out that more school districts are trying school 
based management where individual schools are freed to try 
different strategies with less outside interference 
that kind of reform requires highly skilled leaders who are 
paid well hersey said 
the survey calculated average salaries by school district size 
but did not identify individual school districts nor did it give 
statebystate averages 
average pay for high school principals was 52987 up from 
50512 a year ago but the averages ranged from 55991 in 
districts of 25000 students or more to 47612 in districts with 
enrollments of 300 to 2499 
hersey said in an interview that the highest salary found in the 
survey was 86500 for a senior high school principal in a district 
in the northeast with enrollment between 2500 and 9999 pupils 
the survey also found that junior high and middle school 
principals averaged 49427 up 5 percent from last years 47078 
elementary school principals average pay rose 51 percent to 
45909 compared with 43664 in 1987

the handling of a controversial aircraft 
technology deal with japan has prompted a california congressman to 
call for making the secretary of commerce a statutory member of the 
national security council 
i strongly feel the united states must give more weight to 
longterm commercial interests in its national security 
decisionmaking democrat mel levine told a house panel thursday 
explaining why he plans to introduce legislation next week 
critics of the deal involving japans proposed fsx warplane to 
be built using technology developed for the us f16 fighter 
contend it was negotiated by state and defense department officials 
without participation by the commerce department us trade 
representative and other agencies 
the bush administration faced with mounting concern on capitol 
hill has asked the defense department and commerce department to 
review the strategic commercial and technological aspects of the 
project and submit a combined report to the nsc by march 10 
levine testified at a hearing of the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on commerce consumer protection and competitiveness 
the panels chairman rep james j florio dnj voiced 
serious concern over the fsx deal under which st louisbased 
general dynamics would join forces with japans mitsubishi heavy 
industries to codevelop and coproduce the nextgeneration fighter 
while this proposal may sound innocent it could be troubling 
as far as our longrange national security is concerned he said 
today president bush is in japan paying his respects on the 
death of of the emperor he said that is something he should 
do but making massive amounts of sophisticated aircraft technology 
available to japan or anyone is something that quite possibly 
the president should not do 
under current law the nscs permanent membership comprises the 
president vice president secretary of state and secretary of 
defense frequently however presidents designate other people as 
temporary members to participate in meetings on particular issues 
two former pentagon officials testifying before the panel took 
differing positions on the advisability of going forward with the 
fsx deal 
james e auer now director of the center for usjapan studies 
and cooperation at vanderbilt university in nashville tenn argued 
that japan needs technologically superior fighters to help offset 
the threat posed by the soviet unions far east force of 2000 
aircraft 
auer who in 197988 served in the office of the assistant 
secretary of defense for international security affairs also said 
the united states stands to benefit from the fsx because 
stateoftheart japanese technology may well make the f16 a 
better aircraft 
frank j gaffney jr director of the center for security policy 
a washingtonbased think tank said he saw no new japanese 
technology from which the united states should benefit 
i for one am not persuaded that the cocured composite wings 
and phased array radar technologies identified for flowback to 
the united states under the fsx deal meet that test said gaffney 
former deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear forces and 
arms control policy

the house ways and means committee quickly 
turned down president bushs proposals to trim medicare costs by 5 
billion and halve the capital gains tax rate 
the panel which has jurisdiction over tax and entitlement 
legislation on thursday approved a report by voice vote which said 
it has no intention of approving either of those requests from the 
new president 
while the committee will work diligently in this area it is 
not reasonable to expect providers or beneficiaries to absorb the 
level of reductions proposed by the administration in the medicare 
program for fiscal year 1990 the committee report said 
the report did not mention the capital gains tax directly but 
nonetheless made clear the committee backed the position of chairman 
dan rostenkowski dill that bushs proposal would violate the 
spirit of fairness in the income tax overhaul congress approved in 
1986 
while it may be appropriate for the committee to examine 
selective income tax issues in the 101st congress the committee 
does not anticipate consideration of major income tax changes or 
reopening of any fundamental feature of the 1986 tax reform act 
thursdays report said 
bush has proposed cutting the tax rate on capital gains about in 
half to 15 percent contending the government would actually take 
in more money at the lower rate because of increased economic 
activity 
democrats and many economists say the proposal would be a revenue 
loser and a giveaway to the rich 
congressional analysts released a new estimate thursday showing 
that after an initial jump in revenue next year cutting the capital 
gains tax would reduce tax collections and cost the government 242 
billion over the next six years 
after an initial and illusory revenue gain the presidents 
proposal is shown for what it is a tax break for the wealthy that 
will significantly increase the deficit said rostenkowski in a 
statement calling for bush to withdraw the proposal its a bad 
idea and should be discarded he said 
the administration and congress agree the cost of medicare has 
been soaring as the elderly population increases and medical fees 
grow faster than the general rate of inflation without restraints 
the program would grow from 845 billion this year to 975 billion 
next year according to white house estimates 
in an effort to contain costs bush in his 116 trillion budget 
proposed holding medicare spending to 925 billion next year by 
imposing limits on payments to hospitals and doctors who treat 
medicare patients and by cutting back the programs extra payments 
to teaching hospitals 
if these modest reforms are adopted the growth in medicare 
payments between 1989 and 1990 will be reduced by 5 billion the 
budget said 
the committee however said it was not reasonable to expect 
either providers or recipients of medicare to absorb the level of 
reductions proposed by the president totalling 235 billion over 
three years 
the new estimate on the capital gains tax made by the staff of 
the joint committee on taxation differs sharply from white house 
estimates that the presidents proposal would increase revenues by 
93 billion during the 198994 period 
whos right said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of 
the senate finance committee in a statement thursday thats the 
first thing well have to determine when the finance committee takes 
this matter up 
unlike rostenkowski who opposes any change in the rate bentsen 
has indicated he could live with a reduction in the capitalgains 
rate if the upperincome taxpayers who would benefit most were made 
to pay elsewhere for the cut 
capital gains are profits from the sale property such as stocks 
and real estate before the 1986 law they had preferential 
treatment in the tax code but now they are taxed the same as other 
income at rates of 15 percent 28 percent or 33 percent depending 
on total income

a rule change being considered by the nuclear 
regulatory commission could help electric utilities get approval for 
new nuclear plants in half the time it currently takes nrc chairman 
lando w zech jr said in an interview 
zech said the proposed change could be approved by the commission 
as early as next month 
the licensing reform idea is strongly supported by the utility 
industry which blames regulatory barriers for its current financial 
problems environmental groups oppose the change saying it would 
limit their ability to challenge applications for construction 
permits and operating licenses 
this would be a giant step forward zech said in an interview 
in his nrc office 
he declined to speculate on whether the four other commissioners 
would vote for the rule change which he said does not require 
congressional approval the commisioners were briefed on the 
inchthick document by their staff on wednesday 
zech said he had not yet studied the document in enough detail to 
be sure he would support the plan but he repeatedly expressed 
enthusiasm for such changes 
the plan would make three major changes in the licensing process 
allow utilities to get federal approval for a plant site long 
before committing themselves to actually building on it 
encourage manufacturers to develop standardized reactor designs 
this would allow utilities to choose a design already certified by 
the nrc and not requiring the current lengthy process of gaining 
design approval during the licensing process 
permitting utilities to get their plant construction permit at 
the same time as their operating license currently this is a 
twostep process and in some cases completed plants have stood idle 
because of failure to get an operating permit 
the most important thing about this whole endeavor is to do as 
much up front in the whole licensing process as possible so you 
dont have big major decisions for after the plants been built 
zech said 
he said utilities would be able to get plants built and licensed 
within six years and possibly sooner compared with the recent 
average of 13 years 
the utility industry contends that long delays in obtaining nrc 
licenses is one reason that no new nuclear plants have been ordered 
since the mid1970s zech said that with the rule change some 
orders might be placed in the early 1990s 
james d watkins the bush administrations designated energy 
secretary told his confirmation hearing wednesday that streamlining 
the nuclear plant licensing process could get things moving could 
relieve the kind of constipation we have in the process now 
environmental groups however have been critical of the 
regulatory reform proposals 
michael mariotte director of the nuclear information and 
resource service which is strongly critical of the industry and the 
nrc said the rule changes would unfairly limit the publics right 
to fight a plant licensing he said the main purpose of the changes 
was to aid the nuclear industry 
for them there is no future without the streamlined process 
mariotte said in a recent interview adding that his group might 
challenge the plan in court

president bushs plan to close or merge 
insolvent savings and loan institutions over the next 30 years at a 
cost of 265 billion is encountering stiff opposition in congress 
after reading the 333page bill submitted this week both 
democrats and republicans who support a separate sampl industry 
devoted primarily to home mortgages doubt it can survive under 
bushs proposal 
there are too many officials within the administration who 
would just as soon see the home mortgage lending industry done away 
with said rep frank annunzio dill and chairman of the house 
banking committees financial institutions subcommittee 
annunzio predicted that interest rates on home loans will rise 
dramatically if federally chartered sampls are allowed to disappear 
because the remaining financial institutions will not give such 
loans a high priority 
that concern was bolstered thursday by federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan who said his board is making it easier for bank 
holding companies to buy troubled sampls and questioned whether 
specialized fixedrate residential lending institutions are needed 
today 
greenspan testifying before the senate banking committee said 
that whatever survives will not be the traditional sampl that relied 
on shortterm deposits from savers to finance longterm fixedrate 
mortgages 
my own judgment is that at the end of the day thrifts will 
look a lot more like banks than they do now but there will still be 
thrifts he said ultimately its going to be the markets that 
are going to determine the banking structure in this country 
treasury secretary nicholas brady testifying thursday before the 
house banking committee defended that market approach and said 
the bush administration will stoutly resist congressional efforts to 
reregulate sampls by further restricting their lending activities 
the failure of many sampls has been blamed on imprudent and 
sometimes fraudulent loans for shopping centers office buildings 
and other highrisk ventures after congress deregulated the industry 
in the early 1980s 
annunzio with the backing of the industry said he will try to 
amend bushs proposal to restrict 80 percent of future sampl lending 
to family housing within a 50mile radius of each institution 
he complained that bushs plan requiring sampl owners to put up 
more of their own capital to cover losses for nonresidential 
lending doesnt stop the crooks it just makes them pay more to do 
business 
brady said annunzios proposal would put sampls back into the 
same box that we took them out of through deregulation when they 
had to pay more interest on deposits than they were receiving on 
home mortgages 
he predicted that more of them would go bankrupt as a result 
even while acknowledging that the healthiest third of the industry 
contains precisely those sampls that have maintained their emphasis on 
home mortgages 
the administrations plan would require sampls with less than 60 
percent of their loans in residential housing to become banks 
eventually 
it also would place them under the control of federal banking 
regulators for the first time require them to meet the 6 percent 
capitaltoasset requirements of banks within two years and open 
the way for banks to take over failed sampls immediately and healthy 
ones after two years 
rather than heal wounds your plan may actually put it the sampl 
industry out of its misery rep richard lehman dcalif told 
brady the banking regulators are going to make sampls look more 
like banks and im concerned about the effect of that on housing 
brady denied any intention on our part to deliver up the sampl 
industry to the banking industry after contending earlier that 
bushs plan assures the emergence of a healthy and strong sampl 
industry 
meanwhile greenspan said the federal reserve as the nations 
lender of last resort has entered into a support arrangement with 
the federal home loan bank system which lends to sampls 
we stand ready to make certain the liquidity needs of the 
thrift institutions are met greenspan said referring to the 
record 15 billion in deposits that were withdrawn from them in 
november and december 
greenspan also said bushs financing proposal for protecting sampl 
depositors against losses should be adequate but conceded its 
conceivable that there would be the need for a minor midcourse 
correction in a year or two 
according to figures released thursday by the office of 
management and budget bushs plan calls for spending 265 billion 
through 2018 
522 billion to meet commitments made last year to rescue 205 
institutions and prop up 17 others 
50 billion to shut down 350 more insolvent but still open sampls 
through 1991 
892 billion through 2018 to pay the governments share of the 
interest on bonds sold to borrow the 50 billion 
734 billion to take care of additional sampls likely to slip 
into insolvency between 1991 and 2018

president bushs trip to japan is leading to 
renewed calls in congress for the island nation to share more of the 
burden for regional defense in the pacific 
our defense effort is 92 times greater than the japanese 
effort based upon the share of our respective gross national 
products we devote to defense sen alfonse damato rny said 
thursday the american taxpayer is wondering whether this division 
of effort is fair any longer 
damato said defense department figures showed that the united 
states spent 37 billion to maintain forces in japan in fiscal year 
1985 and 5 billion the following those figures were the latest 
available though costs have undoubtedly risen he said 
while the japanese have announced their 1989 defense budget will 
increase by 156 billion to 316 billion over the previous year 
damato said expenditures are actually declining as a proportion of 
japans gnp 
bush was in tokyo for the funeral of emperor hirohito on 
thursday he has stepped gingerly when addressing the military 
spending issue saying that japan is making adequate contributions 
to regional defense but that any moves to do more will be welcomed 
by the united states 
adm huntington hardisty head of the us pacific command said 
the japanese are well on their way to building up a force 
capable of defending the sea lanes out to 1000 miles 
but tokyos military is no match for the soviets who operate 
literally in japans back yard he said 
although the japanese have done much to increase defense 
spending i believe they can and should do more he said 
sen james mcclure ridaho was more outspoken 
im getting sick of everyone trying to soak uncle sam he 
said describing the united states as guarantor of stability 
throughout the world 
mcclure said the american military presence is vital to japans 
security yet washington bears many additional expenses in the 
pacific including those of maintaining 44000 troops in korea and 
military bases in the philippines 
mcclure said he thinks the united states should be given space 
for overseas bases rentfree so long as washington provides the 
troops and supplies 
sen bennett johnston dla questioned the need to keep us 
troops in korea hinting that some might be withdrawn if the senate 
faces tough budget choices 
i havent figured out what the 44000 troops are there for 
he said 
but hardisty said a reduction of troops at this time would be 
premature in light of the continued threat from north korea

midway through an extraordinary 2hour armed 
services committee session sen alan dixon dill said there 
may not be a smoking gun but theres an abundance of smoke where 
defense secretarydesignate john tower is concerned 
within moments wyomings malcolm wallop uttered the scornful 
republican reply there may not be a smoking gun but theres 
plenty of smoke thats a strange standard my friends 
added the most junior senator on the committee republican dan 
coats of indiana we are establishing a new standard that the 
weight of allegations or of public perception carries more weight 
than the facts 
by the time the democraticcontrolled panel assembled in a packed 
senate hearing room late thursday the outcome was already clear 
towers nomination would be sent to the floor with a recommendation 
against confirmation with the full senate to decide its fate next 
week 
but that didnt stop all 20 members of the armed services 
committee from participating in an exercise in speechmaking thursday 
night as they struggled to explain their decisions 
republicans voiced alarm at a process in which so many lawmakers 
could read the same fbi investigation files on towers alleged 
drinking womanizing and financial conflicts of interest and come 
to diametrically opposite conclusions along party lines 
it seems that these things were orchestrated by somebody 
said an exasperated sen strom thurmond rsc his voice rising 
it is perception that is frightening this committee its not 
the truth thurmond said this committee ought to have the 
courage to do what is right perception should not control this 
committee it ought to be the truth 
committee chairman sam nunn dga listened intently reminding 
the members that it was president bush himself who put ethics at 
the center of his agenda and he said the decision on tower had 
genuinely torn members of the panel 
but ultimately said nunn stories of towers drinking were too 
serious to ignore 
i have searched in vain for several weeks for the point in time 
when the nominee himself acknowledged this problem and dealt with it 
decisively he said the nominee made it very clear that he has 
never sought medical assistance for his drinking problem 
other democrats put different emphasis on the various allegations 
against tower but all said the end result was that they could not 
comfortably vote to put him in the chain of command over the 
nations military and nuclear forces 
they pointed to the fbi reports saying the documents indicated 
towers acknowledged heavy drinking in the 1970s had extended into 
more recent times and that the evidence included firstperson 
accounts 
we should look elsewhere for a secretary of defense said 
sen james exon dneb acknowledging that the confirmation process 
had been personally painful to tower the system may not always be 
fair but it works 
several republicans however sounded a common theme that in 
towers 24 years in the senate none of his legislative colleagues 
ever saw him out of control even in allnight sessions and on long 
overseas trips 
i suppose john tower might have been able to conceal a 
problem from his colleagues said sen william cohen rmaine 
but its highly unlikely 
sen john warner of virginia the committees senior republican 
said he had interviewed every current senator who had served with 
tower not one single us senator can ever recall a single 
instance where any of his personal habits interfered with his 
duty warner said 
republicans also emphasized bushs right to select his cabinet 
nominees and said they gave a heavier weight to the new presidents 
wishes only eight presidential nominees for cabinet positions have 
been rejected by the senate in the nations history 
gop committee members also suggested it was hypocritical for 
senators to reject a former colleague over his drinking habits i 
wonder how many of us in this room would admit to the same 
proclivity to have a social drink asked sen trent lott rmiss 
this is not a canonization 
emerging from the hearing room after the vote republicans warned 
that the debate at least was not over 
this is probably worth discussing and debating on the floor 
said cohen there is a man here whose reputation has been dragged 
through the mire and republicans feel strongly about it i think 
its a bad storm rising

a military jury on friday 
convicted a us navy captain of dereliction of duty for failing to 
help a boatload of vietnamese refugees who later resorted to 
cannibalism to survive then spared him a harsh sentence 
capt alexander balian a highly decorated vietnam war veteran 
was sentenced to a reprimand he could have been jailed for 90 days 
and ordered to forfeit twothirds of his pay for three months 
the jury acquitted balian 48 of the more serious charge of 
ordering one refugee shaken off ropes as he tried to climb aboard 
the warship 
this court martial sentences you to be reprimanded said the 
jury foreman capt william fox after deliberating the sentence for 
about a half hour under military law court martial convictions are 
automatically reviewed 
the jury of six navy captains deliberated nearly six hours 
thursday and friday before returning a verdict 
balian of los angeles had been on trial since feb 10 
he was stripped of his command of the amphibious landing ship uss 
dubuque after being accused of failing to render adequate assistance 
to more than 80 vietnamese boat people when the dubuque encountered 
them june 9 in the south china sea 230 miles north of the 
philippine island of palawan 
un officials said 31 of the vietnamese died after encountering 
the dubuque survivors said they resorted to cannibalism to survive 
before filipino fishermen rescued them on june 27 
the jury found balian guilty of dereliction of duty for failing 
to conduct an adequate inspection of the refugee boat determine 
whether their sail was adequate conduct appropriate medical 
examinations of visibly dehydrated refugees provide necessary 
navigational equipment provide adequate food and clothing to the 
naked and take refugees aboard or see to it that they were taken 
aboard or assisted by a navy supply ship in the area 
the jury found balian innocent of charges that he ordered the 
dubuques crew to shake off a refugee who tried to climb aboard the 
warship using the vessels monkeylines 
on feb 16 balian was acquitted of a third charge failing to 
render assistance to a vietnamese who drowned 
the prosecution contended balian abandoned the refugees in his 
rush to resume his voyage to the persian gulf 
providing humanitarian assistance is a mission of the us 
navy the prosecutor lt cmdr raymond carlson said during 
closing arguments it was not capt balians mission it was an 
interruption to his mission 
carlson said the vietnamese left their homeland may 22 with the 
aim of escaping to freedom they planned a fourday voyage to 
malaysia but were stranded when their engine broke down after three 
days at sea he said 
food ran out and about 20 vietnamese had already died when they 
encountered the dubuque he said 
carlson said balian pressed his executive officer lt cmdr 
stanley halter to rush through an inspection of the refugee boat 
balian testified he did not pick up the refugees because he did 
not realize how desperate their situation was balian also testified 
that he believed the vessel was seaworthy based on reports from 
halter 
only a fool would think this vessel could effectively sail 
anywhere said carlson holding a photo of the boat jammed with 
emaciated vietnamese 
only a fool can think these people are not in a 
lifeendangering situation only a fool could really think food and 
water were all that was needed in this situation 
in his summation defense lawyer dan donato urged the jury to 
consider that balian was honestly mistaken about conditions on 
the boat 
it was a tragedy of errors donato said if the skipper had 
learned there were dead bodies if he had known people were 
sick he would have taken different actions if he had known there 
was an inoperable engine he would have taken a different action 
donato also said balian was under pressure from his commanders to 
reach the persian gulf on schedule the dubuque took part in us 
security operations in the gulf during the final weeks of the 
iraniraq war 
capt balian was told to be there donato said he was 
told dont be late

president bush attended emperor hirohitos funeral 
friday taking a frontrow seat as the japanese waived protocol 
rules to give him a prominent position at the solemn shinjuku 
imperial garden ceremony 
in the hours preceding the funeral bushs attention was diverted 
by the continuing problems of defense secretarydesignate john 
tower the white house despite heavy overseas calling was unable 
to get the former texas senator approved by the senate armed 
services committee in washington it voted 119 to reject his 
nomination 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters that 
bush was sticking by tower no matter how the committee vote went 
the next step is to consider it on the floor and thats what we 
will do he said 
a steady rain fell and the weather was chilly as bush and 
dignitaries from some 160 countries gathered for the funeral 
ceremony 
bush was shot down by japanese antiaircraft fire in world war 
ii but said coming to the funeral was the right thing to do and 
that he didnt want to look back 
wearing dark mourning clothes and a black overcoat with the 
collar raised bush was seated with his wife barbara on his right 
and west german president richard von weizsacker on his left 
the floor below them was heated with electrical coils and a 
brown wool blanket was placed on each chair 
en route to the funeral site bushs motorcade crossed an 
overpass just as the funeral procession containing hirohitos hearse 
proceeded immediately below 
during the briefing at the white house press filing center 
fitzwater said that us officials hoped the japanese would not be 
offended by bushs preoccupation with the tower problem in 
washington 
fitzwater said bushs attention to his embattled cabinet 
secretary should not be construed by the japanese as showing 
disrepect for their country on a national day of mourning 
the timing is dictated by the work of the committee not events 
over here the press secretary said 
more than 10000 invited mourners from japan and abroad were 
assembled at the shinjuku imperial garden bush unexpectedly was 
given a frontrow seat as japanese officials overrode protocol that 
would have seated the president on the basis of his time in office 
just a little over a month 
hirohito the last of the world war ii era world leaders died 
jan 7 of cancer at age 87 after reigning for six decades 
after the funeral bush returned to his hotel and was there when 
an explosion damaged a highway along which the emperors hearse was 
due to be taken after the cermony police speculated that radicals 
opposed to the emperor system were responsible for the blast 
in a meeting with japans prime minister noboru takeshita on 
thursday bush began by expressing the condolences of the american 
people upon hirohitos death white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said 
absent from the public ceremonies was empress dowager nagako 
hirohitos 85yearold wife who is said to be ailing with chronic 
back and hip problems the kyodo news agency said she paid her last 
respects during the palace ceremonies 
bush and his wife walked together to the site of hirohitos 
coffin and bowed in paying last respects just before leaving the 
funeral grounds 
no disturbances were reported during the initial stages of 
fridays funeral but a police official in the southern city of 
nagasaki said a letter containing a bullet and a death threat was 
sent to city mayor hitoshi motoshima who had earlier charged that 
hirohito bore some responsiblity for world war ii 
during the news briefing earlier fitzwater denied that bush and 
white house chief of staff john sununu had discussed finding another 
candidate for the top pentagon job 
i can flatly say that i do flatly say that he said ive 
talked to the president about that several times including just 10 
minutes ago theres no consideration of alternative candidates 
theres no alternate list bar none 
bush on thursday held talks with three mideast leaders while 
secretary of state james a baker iii challenged the soviet union to 
pitch in with deeds instead of simply rhetorical exercises 
bushs fastpaced diplomacy on the day of his arrival here 
involved meetings with a succession of world leaders including 
egyptian president hosni mubarak israeli president chaim herzog and 
jordans king hussein 
after bushs round of meetings baker suggested the soviets 
should contribute to the peace process in a concrete way by 
establishing full diplomatic relations with israel using its 
influence in syria and denouncing radical countries such as 
libya 
baker said a new dynamic for peace existed in the area and 
that bush hoped to nurture it the presidents sessions with mideast 
leaders provided a counterpoint to soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadzes 10day tour through the region where he attempted to 
advance moscows role 
first lady barbara bush meanwhile donned a tailored black suit 
and an elegant strand of pearls to pay a visit naoko takeshita the 
wife of the japanese prime minister 
the two women sipped tea at takeshitas official residence with 
mrs bush expressing sympathy over hirohitos death and the mrs 
takeshita offering congratulations on bushs election as president 
bushs focus on the middle east during his first overseas trip 
a fiveday visit to three asian capitals appeared to be an effort 
to steal some of the spotlight from shevardnadzes journey to the 
area 
baker briefing reporters after bushs full day of meetings with 
world leaders said soviet overtures to participate in a middle east 
peace were healthy quite frankly 
but he added i suppose we would want to know that there were 
concrete contributions that they had in mind rather than simply 
rhetorical exercises 
he said he would have a better idea of what the soviets intend 
when he meets with shevardnadze in march in vienna 
baker said contributing to the new dynamics for peace were talks 
between the united states and the palestine liberation organization 
and statements by plo leader yasser arafat denouncing terrorism 
he said the united states intended to be active in the peace 
process 
however he said ultimately a settlement would have to flow from 
direct negotiations between the palestinians and the israelis 
we are concerned that if we act too precipitously we might 
preempt promising possibilities that could surface if we adopted a 
more reasoned and measured approach baker added 
earlier fitzwater the white house spokesman said the subject 
of a middle east peace settlement also came up in a lunch with 
french president francois mitterrand 
we think there are some opportunities to move the peace 
process forward fitzwater said we want to be methodical and 
deliberate in our approach 
on cambodia bush voiced concern that the withdrawal of 
vietnamese there was proceeding at a slower pace than we would 
like to see fitzwater said 
president bush also emphasized that we would like to see a 
government in cambodia that would involve prince sihanouk and would 
not see a return to the power of the khmer rouge the spokesman 
said

an explosion friday on a roadside embankment spilled 
dirt and debris on a highway in suburban tokyo shortly before the 
motorcade carrying the body of emperor hirohito and the imperial 
family was to pass police said 
the incident did not stop the funeral motorcade which passed the 
site later en route to the imperial mausoleums outside tokyo where 
the emperor was to be buried said an official of the metropolitan 
police department 
japan broadcasting corp showed workers sweeping dirt off a 
section of sixline divided expressway in the western suburb of 
chofu where the highway runs below ground level 
the police official said the blast occurred about 15 minutes 
after the imperial motorcade left the funeral site in westcentral 
tokyo it was not immediately clear how far away the motorcade was 
when the blast occurred 
police had mounted the biggest security operation ever in japan 
to protect the grand state funeral and about 9000 mourners 
including president bush and leaders from 162 other nations 
attending the funeral 
the police official speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
suspected radical guerrillas opposed to the imperial system were 
responsible for the blast 
several radical groups had vowed to disrupt the funeral 
in 1986 about 30000 police on duty during the sevennation 
economic summit were unable to prevent guerrillas from firing two 
homemade projectiles at the tokyo summit site no damage or injuries 
resulted but the attack seriously embarrassed the police 
on tuesday police said they found two projectilelaunchers 
connected to timers in a forest near narita airport 35 miles north 
of tokyo where many foreign dignitaries arrived to attend the 
funeral

the justice department says the supreme court 
should overturn the landmark roe vs wade decision because nothing 
in the constitution guarantees the right to an abortion and such 
decisions should be left up to the states 
other western countries have through the legislative process 
reached reasonable accommodations of the competing interests 
involved in the abortion controversy acting solicitor general 
william c bryson wrote in a brief filed thursday with the high 
court 
there is no reason to believe that american legislatures if 
basic decisionmaking responsibility were returned to them would 
not similarly arrive at humane solutions he said 
the brief supporting the state of missouris position in a case 
before the court known as webster vs reproductive health services 
said the case represents a proper occasion to reconsider roe vs 
wade 
but the brief also acknowledged that the supreme court could rule 
on the missouri case without touching the 1973 decision that 
legalized abortion 
bryson wrote that the roe vs wade rests on the premise that 
there is a fundamental right to an abortion and that states do 
not have a compelling interest in protecting prenatal human life 
throughout pregnancy 
neither premise however is supportable the brief said 
abortion rights and civil liberties groups condemned the 
departments action while it was lauded by prolife advocates 
were also appalled at the strength of the language saying 
women do not have a constitutional right to make their own personal 
decisions about reproduction said tamar abrams a spokeswoman for 
the national abortion rights action league 
colleen oconnor of the american civil liberties union contended 
that there is a constitutional right to an abortion 
what roe vs wade clarified was that the decision is a matter 
of privacy and that right is protect in the constitution through 
the 4th amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and 
seizure oconnor said 
on the other hand douglas johnson legislative director for the 
national right to life committee said in a statement that we 
applaud this intervention by the bush administration in defense of 
unborn children 
the missouri case went to the supreme court after the 8th us 
circuit court of appeals on july 13 rejected key portions of the 
missouri law 
about 20 briefs were filed in support of the missouri law 
thursday the deadline for such briefs on that side of the issue 
advocates of the right to an abortion have another 30 days to file 
briefs 
the courts decision is expected by july 
in the missouri case the appellate court struck down these five 
provisions of the law 
a ban on using public hospitals or other governmentrun 
facilities for abortions not necessary to save a womans life 
a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or 
assisting an abortion 
a ban on using taxpayer money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions 
a requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed to 
be older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity to 
determine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb 
a declaration that the life of each human being begins at 
conception 
the appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bans 
the use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion 
but it said use of a public facility or the services of a public 
employee cannot be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by a 
patient

the shades of roger taney caleb cushing and 
lewis b strauss are being invoked as the senate struggles once more 
with its constitutional power to advise and consent on nominations 
to the presidents cabinet 
this time the spotlight is on john tower president bushs 
embattled choice to be secretary of defense 
eight times in history according to files of the library of 
congress and the senate library presidents have failed to win 
senate confirmation for people they had chosen to sit in the cabinet 
the last time was on jan 19 1959 when the senate voted 4946 
to reject president dwight d eisenhowers selection of strauss to 
be secretary of commerce 
strauss had survived by a vote of 98 in the senate commerce 
committee but had made too many enemies in congress as chairman of 
the atomic energy commission to clear the full senate 
in 1945 by contrast the same committee rejected the nomination 
of henry a wallace as secretary of commerce by a vote of 145 on 
jan 26 but the full senate approved it 5632 on march 1 
secretary of commerce jesse jones who had been asked by fdr to 
step down to make way for wallace opposed confirmation of the 
controversial former vice president and secretary of agriculture 
wallace had the backing however of organized labor 
it was the last time a senate committee rejected a cabinet 
nomination before the armed services committee voted thursday to 
reject the tower appointment 
the first president to have a cabinet choice vetoed by the senate 
was andrew jackson whose choice of taney to be secretary of the 
treasury was turned down on june 23 1834 taney who was already 
serving in the post by a recess appointment was later named chief 
justice by jackson and confirmed for that post by the senate 
president john tyler whose relations with congress were soured 
by his vetoes of major pieces of legislation had four cabinet 
choices rejected his selection of cushing to be secretary of the 
treasury was defeated three times in one day march 3 1843 
tyler later nominated james s green for the treasury post and he 
was rejected on june 15 1844 the senate also rejected his 
nominations of james madison porter for secretary of war on june 30 
1844 and david henshaw for secretary of the navy on jan 15 1844 
also rejected by the senate was president andrew johnsons 
selection of henry stanberry to be attorney general in 1868 
president calvin coolidges nomination of charles b warren as 
attorney general was rejected twice on march 10 and again on march 
16 1925

an attorney for an irish republican army member 
convicted in britain of killing a british soldier says hes dismayed 
that attorney general dick thornburgh has injected himself into the 
controversy over whether his client should be granted political 
asylum 
its just more delay said stephen a somerstein a new 
yorkbased attorney for joe doherty the delay already has been 
interminable and hes been incarcerated all through this the 
length of his incarceration exceeds all bounds of fairness of 
reasonableness 
doherty has been in federal prison in manhattan since fbi agents 
arrested him june 28 1983 at clancys bar in manhattan where he 
worked as a parttime bartender after breaking out of a maximum 
security prison in northern ireland more than six years ago 
thornburgh got involved in the case thursday at the request of 
the immigration and naturalization service which wants to deport 
doherty said dave runkel a spokesman for the attorney general 
at issue is a board of immigration appeals decision last nov 14 
that doherty could reopen his request for political asylum in the 
united states and remanding that request to an ins judge 
if thornburgh had not gotten involved doherty could have pursued 
his case with the judge justice department spokesman loye miller 
said 
since the attorney general can modify or overrule decisions of 
the board thornburgh could decide to deny doherty asylum without an 
ins judge hearing the case 
we had requested that the attorney general not review it and 
just allow us our day in court to press our political asylum claim 
that the board said we should have somerstein said in a telephone 
interview 
its tantamount to his being a judge in his own case he said 
doherty was convicted with three others of the killing that 
occurred during a gunfight between british soldiers and ira members 
who had planned to ambush a british army patrol in 1980 
he contends he is neither a terrorist nor a murderer but a 
soldier engaged in war and he is seeking asylum on the grounds that 
he would be subject to persecution if sent to britain 
on thursday thornburgh ordered that ins submit by march 27 a 
brief in support of its position after that doherty will have 30 
days to submit a brief arguing his case and then the ins will have 
14 days to file a reply 
the british have been seeking dohertys return to britain since 
1983 and prime minister margaret thatcher raised the issue with 
thenpresident reagan during a 1986 visit to washington 
us district judge john e sprizzo in brooklyn denied britains 
extradition request in december 1984 saying dohertys crime was a 
political act and qualified him for political asylum 
the government appealed and us district judge charles s haight 
ruled in dohertys favor the us court of appeals in new york 
upheld dohertys previous victories 
then the justice department began deportation proceedings 
since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent 
doherty chose the independent republic of ireland immigration judge 
howard i cohen upheld that decision in 1986 
since then the government has appealed three times and lost each 
time the most recent loss coming last nov 14 
doherty asked the board of immigration appeals to revoke his 
concession that he was deportable after ireland in december 1987 
ratified the european convention on terrorism the convention calls 
for mandatory extradition of those deemed terrorists and would have 
meant that doherty would have been extradited from ireland to 
britain

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is drawing the 
islamic curtain around iran again dragging it back into the 
selfimposed isolation from which more pragmatic leaders were 
seeking to lead it 
his call on moslems to kill british author salman rushdie for 
allegedly slandering islam in his novel the satanic verses has 
alienated iran at a time when figures like parliament speaker 
hashemi rafsanjani were trying to present a more moderate image of 
iran to the world 
western countries were horrified when iranian clerics last week 
offered a bounty of up to 52 million for the assassination of 
rushdie who has gone into hiding with police protection in britain 
the denunciation by khomeini of moves to normalize relations with 
the west and of demands for political social and religious reform 
now that the war with iraq has ended came on the heels of criticisms 
of the islamic revolutions shortcomings by several rival iranian 
leaders 
hes happy when its fortress iran surrounded by enemies 
said philip robbins an iran analyst with the royal institute of 
international affairs in london 
shahram chubin an iran specialist with the institute for 
international affairs in geneva said the western reaction to irans 
fury over the satanic verses has reinforced khomeinis belief 
that iran is surrounded by a sea of corruption and conspiracies 
it was perfect for him khomeini clearly thinks theres still 
some mileage out of a militant stand against the superpowers 
chubin said in a telephone interview 
the moves by khomeini 88 are a major setback for the 
pragmatists particularly rafsanjani and a boost for hardliners 
who feared rafsanjani was getting too powerful and believed 
restoring ties to the west would undermine the revolution 
the 12 european common market countries have recalled their 
ambassadors to protest the death threats against rushdie while 
khomeini and irans hardliners have accused the west of ganging 
up on islam and iran in particular 
sweden and norway also pulled their ambassadors out of tehran 
iran retaliated by withdrawing all its envoys from common market 
capitals 
the british who only normalized relations with tehran in 
december after a lengthy dispute recalled their diplomats from 
tehran and said they will not return until the iranians rescind 
their threats against rushdie and reject all forms of violence 
west germany irans main european trading partner has suspended 
plans to provide economic aid to iran to help with postwar 
reconstruction and canceled scheduled visits by senior government 
officials 
the bonn parliament branded khomeinis order to kill rushdie a 
declaration of war against western culture that the 
revolutionary patriarch has so often denounced as morally repugnant 
hundreds of dutch writers have called on their government to 
sever relations with tehran the dutch foreign minister hans van 
den broek called off a planned visit to tehran to protest an act 
of international terrorism 
khomeini declared wednesday that the wests action in allowing 
the satanic verses to be published in the first place and their 
subsequent diplomatic moves proved that it was wrong for iran to 
have tried to reestablish links 
but robbins and other analysts questioned how long khomeini can 
afford to keep iran alienated from countries that it will need to 
help its massive reconstruction program that will cost an estimated 
400 billion 
it is money that iran exhausted by its 8year persian gulf war 
and poor economic condition does not have and is not likely to have 
for years to come 
but the real problem remains the power struggle within the 
hierachy chubin said 
khomeini has slapped rafsanjani down to size but khomeini has 
been playing both sides being very equivocal and hasnt been 
decisive on important issues such as the economy and the 
constitution hes been in a state of shock since he had to accept 
the ceasefire chubin said 
robbins noted one explanation is that hes siding with the 
radicals on this one after they were weakened by irans failure to 
defeat iraq 
he wants to keep an equilibrium between the opposing factions 
to uphold his own authority he doesnt want the revolution 
diluted

a huge jump in disciplinary actions at the 
chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange does not 
necessarily indicate the degree of abuse by commodities traders a 
general accounting office official told congress 
richard fogel assistant comptroller general at the gao an 
agency that is an investigating and auditing arm of congress said 
results of an fbi investigation into commodities trading may give a 
better idea of abuse at the board and the exchange 
the testimony came thursday at the first senate oversight hearing 
of the year on the commodity futures trading commission a federal 
agency which faces reauthorization by congress 
the gao says the number of contracts traded at the mercantile 
exchange grew from 40 million in 1984 to 80 million in 1988 and at 
the board of trade from 80 million to 140 million during the same 
period 
in that same period the number of traders sanctioned for 
violations on the floor of the mercantile exchange went from 13 to 
105 while sanctions at the board of trade went from a low of eight 
in 1985 to a high of 32 in 1986 in 1988 the board of trade 
sanctioned 13 floor participants 
fogel said that from 1984 to 1988 mercantile exchange fines for 
trade practice abuses were a total 36 million for the same 
period comparable board of trade fines were 811000 
fogel told the senate agriculture committee that the figures 
could mean that an oversight system is working well or that it 
needs improvement because it is not finding abuses or punishing 
offenders severely enough 
but sen bob kerrey dneb called the number of sanctions taken 
against traders pitiful compared to the volume of trading 
the number of members expelled on both exchanges averaged about 
two a year fogel said he said that according to exchange 
officials permanent expulsion or lengthy suspensions are viewed as 
more severe than fines because they deprive members of their 
livelihood 
fogel said commission officials told the gao that they could not 
comment on their involvement in identifying or investigating alleged 
abuses until after any indictments stemming from the fbi probe are 
issued 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the committee said that 
over the coming months his panel will review dual trading the role 
of brokers and broker associations the adequacy of exchange floor 
monitoring compliance and discipline

hirohito the emperorgod made mortal by a 
disastrous war was honored friday at a traditionsteeped state 
funeral attended by the largest number of world leaders gathered 
together in modern times 
an explosion on a roadside embankment marred the day spilling 
dirt and debris on a highway shortly before the motorcade carrying 
the emperors body and the imperial family was to pass police said 
the motorcade bound on a chilly rainy day for the imperial 
burial site west of tokyo passed the area where the blast occurred 
without incident 
police said they suspected radicals who oppose the imperial 
system were responsible several such groups had vowed to disrupt 
the funeral for which japans police mounted their biggest security 
operation ever 
at the funeral service 51 blackrobed bearers carried atop a 
oneton bier the body of the emperor who died in january at age 87 
after a reign of 62 years that spanned japans rise to militarism 
its defeat in world war ii and its ascent as a world economic power 
the people will remember him forever said his son and the 
new emperor akihito in a eulogy before leaders of 163 nations 
including president bush 
a deepvoiced male chorus sang a solemn song a poem was read and 
members of the imperial family went individually before the coffin 
and bowed slowly 
after the eulogies bush and his wife barbara stepped to the 
front of the hall paused and made a slight bow before the coffin 
the capital a sprawling metropolis of 12 million people came to 
a standstill as 32000 police were deployed to protect the 
dignitaries 
police said the highway blast occurred about 15 minutes after the 
imperial motorcade left the funeral site in westcentral tokyo it 
was not immediately clear how far away the motorcade was at the time 
of the blast 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility 
early in the day a black hearse carrying the emperors 
lacedraped coffin drove at 6 mph through central tokyo along a 
fourmile route from the moated imperial palace to the funeral site 
at shinjuku imperial garden 
police said about 210000 people lined the streets some people 
cried as the motorcade passed and others held their palms together 
in prayer 
members of the royal family carried umbrellas in the streaming 
rain and wind 
trailing the coffin a chamberlain dressed in white carried a 
platter with a pair of white shoes that tradition says the deceased 
monarch will wear to heaven 
mourners filled the two huge tents built at the garden for the 
funeral 
officials overrode protocol to give bush a frontrow seat 
although tradition would have put him toward the back because of his 
short time in office 
bush was shot down by japanese antiaircraft fire in world war 
ii but said he decided to come to the funeral because it was the 
right thing to do because japan and the united states are allies 
also bowing before the coffin was britains prince philip a 
royal navy veteran of world war ii who was present at japans 
surrender ceremony in 1945 
prime minister noboru takeshita said in his eulogy that japan 
will continue to strive mightily to ensure that japan is open to 
the rest of the world full of vigor and culturally rich and will 
further promote the cause of world peace and human welfare 
he described hirohitos reign as eventful and turbulent times 
for japan including the calamities of that deplorable war the 
struggle to reconstruct itself from the ruins amid confusion and 
dire poverty and to regain its full independence 
about 400 demonstrators from three leftist groups gathered 
peacefully at a park in westcentral tokyo carrying banners 
denouncing the funeral and branding hirohito a war criminal 
hirohitos war responsibility is great he died without ever 
resolving it said a 30yearold woman wearing a mask and 
sunglasses at the rally 
historians generally agree that most of the decisions about the 
war were made by japans military leaders and that hirohito was 
largely powerless he relinquished his divine status under the 
constitution imposed by the united states after the war 
hirohito was to be buried near the grave of his father emperor 
taisho about 30 miles outside the city 
akihito in a black tailcoat black gloves and gray trousers and 
a blackveiled empress michiko were shielded by umbrellas as they 
left the palace for the funeral motorcade 
a 21gun salute boomed from howitzers mingling with ancient 
court music played on pipes and drums crowds up to 10 deep watched 
the motorcade as it pulled out of the main gate of the palace moved 
across the moat and along its route 
the 13 hours of funeral ceremonies began with two hours of 
private shinto ceremonies presided over by the akihito 55 who 
ascended the chrysanthemum throne after his fathers death 
the body of hirohito who died of cancer jan 7 was encased in 
an inner wooden coffin and an outer one of metal 
before the procession officers joining the largest security 
operation in japanese history checked cars and patrolled streets 
absent from the public ceremonies was empress dowager nagako 
hirohitos 85yearold wife said to be ailing with back and hip 
problems the kyodo news agency said she paid her last respects 
during the palace ceremonies 
stores in the ginza shopping district covered their advertising 
signs and display windows most businesses along the procession 
route were closed 
many of the dignitaries used thursday for minisummit meetings 
they included bush who is on his first trip overseas as us chief 
executive 
the government proclaimed friday a holiday asking japanese to 
suitably mourn hirohito and observe a minute of silence at noon 
to mark the funeral the government pardoned 30000 people 
convicted of minor criminal offenses 
the pardons allow an additional 11 million people to recover such 
civil rights as the right to vote and run for public office which 
they had lost as a punishment for their offenses 
a 72yearold farmer morie hiroki tried to commit suicide by 
ritual disembowelment or harakiri in kyushu in southern japan 
police spokesman kennosuke kumae said by telephone 
he said hiroki who slashed his abdomen with a kitchen knife was 
in serious condition in the hospital the spokesman said hiroki had 
served in china in world war ii and left a note saying he felt he 
had to follow the emperor in death

people who smoke to control their weight are 
simply redistributing their fat and putting themselves at risk for 
potentially deadly illnesses according to a study published today 
smoking does reduce weight the researchers acknowledged but 
flab stays around the waist increasing the chance for heart 
disease diabetes and early death 
if youre a cigarette smoker who is continuing to smoke in 
order to control your body weight or a nonsmoker considering 
starting up again youre making a bad decision said dr 
reubin andres a coauthor of the study and clinical director of the 
national institute on aging in baltimore 
theres no question that the risk of cigarette smoking is much 
greater than the risk of a few excess pounds of body weight he 
said 
cigarette smokers generally weigh less for their height than 
nonsmokers and typically gain weight if they quit the researchers 
acknowledged in their report in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
but in looking at the ratio of waist size to hip size in men over 
a period of 26 years the researchers found that waist sizes 
generally were larger in relation to hip size among smokers than 
nonsmokers 
mean measurements among smokers were 357 inches at the waist and 
39 at the hips compared with a mean ratio of 357 to 395 among 
nonsmokers the researchers said 
the more a person smokes the larger the comparative waist size 
the study found 
while the difference between the two ratios is small andres said 
previous studies have indicated this can have a big effect on risks 
of heart disease 
if you are fortunate enough to be shaped with the fat down 
around the hips then you have a relatively safe form of obesity 
andres said you are less likely to have high cholesterol high 
blood pressure and diabetes 
its simply one more bad effect of cigarette smoking as if 
you needed one more bad effect 
gary miller a spokesman for the tobacco institute a 
washingtonbased group representing the tobacco industry said he 
had not seen the study and had no comment 
how smoking causes differences in fat distribution is unclear 
andres said but cigarettes could affect hormones or could have a 
druglike effect on their own 
andres said no data on smoking and bodyfat distribution is 
available for women but one can hypothesize that women will show 
the same sort of changes as men 
the researchers also found that when smokers in the study gave up 
tobacco they gained an average of five pounds but the ratio of 
waist size to hip size did not increase significantly 
exsmokers who took up the habit again lost an average of 22 
pounds but the ratio of waist size to hip size increased meaning 
there was a greater increase in waist size 
the survey tracked 1122 men between the ages of 19 and 102 
between 1960 and 1986 the researchers measured the subjects 
height weight waist size and hip size and tracked changes in 
measurements and smoking status at twoyear intervals 
smokingrelated deaths claim 390000 americans annually 
according to the american cancer society which says smoking is 
linked to lung cancer heart disease chronic obstructive lung 
disease emphysema and various cancers

a civil rights activist who was one of the 
last americans to serve prison time for contempt of congress during 
the mccarthy era has moved to overturn his conviction based on an 
uncovered fbi memo 
a petition filed in us district court in atlanta thursday asks 
that frank wilkinsons contemptofcongress conviction be set aside 
wilkinsons lawyers argue that the government deliberately concealed 
evidence that a crucial witness who testified against wilkinson was 
considered unreliable 
wilkinson now 74 first came to the attention of the fbi during 
the 1940s when he led a move to integrate public housing in los 
angeles he and fellow integrationist carl braden were the last of 
36 americans sent to jail for clashing with the house committee on 
unamerican activities 
a newly released fbi memo which remained classified until last 
year shows the fbi knew in 1961 that anita edith schneider the 
woman who accused wilkinson of being a communist had exhibited 
emotional instability at a 1955 hearing 
therefore the 1961 memo said information on wilkinsons alleged 
communist party membership comes from sources not considered 
advisable to use as government witnesses 
nonetheless the supreme court used ms schneiders testimony 
that she knew wilkinson as a fellow communist party member in 
rejecting an appeal by wilkinson on a 54 vote 
wilkinson eventually served nine months of a oneyear prison term 
for refusing to answer the questions of the house committee 
we have a government which had in its possession information 
that clearly related to the reliability the credibility of the 
only witness whose testimony was used to convict frank wilkinson of 
contempt of congress said wilkinsons attorney douglas e mirell 
of los angeles 
we believe that in fact a fraud was perpetrated by the 
government upon the judicial system mirell said 
wilkinsons court petition invokes a procedure used when new 
evidence comes to light following a conviction it was filed by the 
american civil liberties union and the los angeles law firm of loeb 
amp loeb 
he obtained the memo about ms schneider as part of the 
settlement of his 15yearold lawsuit against the fbi seeking 
information the agency had gathered about him and his group the 
national committee against repressive legislation 
the whole course of first amendment law has been affected by 
it said paul hoffman legal director of the aclu foundation of 
southern california what we have here is the government by its 
affirmative misrepresentation in fact distorting the whole course 
of constitutional history

an american crowd at an american state funeral would 
have been different americans would have come equipped with 
binoculars americans would have made some noise americans would 
have brought the children 
americans would have gotten acquainted with their neighbors and 
chatted about the cold rain saying they wished they had worn long 
underwear 
no american crowd would have been so capable of sitting so still 
as long the japanese did today at the funeral for their emperor the 
visiting american dignitary president bush was surrounded by 9800 
japanese oblivious to him and demonstrating in every way the 
differences between their two societies 
in this nasty wet cold americans would have clapped their hands 
together to warm up dabbed handkerchiefs to runny noses and stomped 
their feet the japanese did none of that sitting motionless in 
silence for four hours or more talking in whispers if they talked 
at all 
americans would have huddled under the brown furry blankets that 
were provided for every japanese guest at the funeral 
the japanese used the blankets as tidy lap robes in their hands 
some of them held little bags filled with a chemical when the bags 
are shaken they emit a small amount of heat enough to warm a hand 
one japanese woman shook her bag and slipped it into her shoe 
the crowd at the imperial garden assembled under two enormous 
opensided white tents most were too far away to see the 
proceedings but still able to watch seven giant television screens 
that carried a fuzzy picture of what was going on before them 
here was japans elite members of the parliament of the 
national and local governments leaders of the giant corporations 
that are household names around the world 
over and over bows were exchanged a person taking his seat 
would first bow to those he recognized in his row these were deep 
bows from the waist straight down nothing held back nothing 
merely symbolic about them 
many acquaintances would bow upon seeing each other shake hands 
bow again those who arrived early and took their seats rubbernecked 
at the late arrivals latecomers offered bows and were bowed to in 
return those already in their seats often bowed without rising 
no public tears were shed here the crowd was somber stoic not 
griefstricken 
but nothing prepared an american visitor for the change in mood 
around the corner some of the mourners slipped away to another wing 
of the tent for a paper cupful of tea served by young women in 
black suits for a smoke for conversation for a break 
the air was dense with cigarette smoke noisy with chatter men 
few women ventured in stood around tables which carried only one 
thing an ashtray the visitors huddled around gas stoves to warm up 
for a few minutes 
the atmosphere was almost like that of a political convention 
but with the eternal bow substituting for backslaps

rep donald lukens denied any wrongdoing 
after being indicted on a misdemeanor charge that he had sex with a 
teenage girl 
lukens a republican was indicted thursday by a franklin county 
grand jury on a charge of contributing to the unruliness and 
delinquency of a child the firstdegree misdemeanor carries a 
maximum jail term of 180 days and a 1000 fine 
the charge resulted from an investigation prompted by a secretly 
videotaped meeting last november between lukens and the girls 
mother who contended lukens paid for sexual relations with her 
daughter on two occasions one of those times allegedly was four 
years ago when the girl was 13 
the grand jury accused lukens of having sexual intercourse with 
the girl on nov 6 when she was 16 in his columbus apartment 
i do categorically deny that i contributed to the delinquency 
and unruliness of a minor at any time and i further categorically 
deny the accuracy of the alleged facts upon which the charge was 
apparently based lukens said from his washington office i am 
innocent of the charge brought forth today 
lukens 58 and divorced said his attorney had advised him 
against commenting on the allegations beyond his brief statement 
lukens did not testify before the grand jury which did not ask 
him to appear franklin county prosecutor michael miller said 
no date for an initial court appearance was set for lukens 
the house ethics committee which has jurisdiction over 
allegations of wrongdoing by lawmakers typically waits for the 
outcome before taking any action in cases where members have been 
charged in court 
a criminal conviction does not automatically bar a legislator 
from sitting in congress 
columbus television station wsyx on feb 1 broadcast a videotape 
that shows lukens apparently offering a job to anna coffman after 
she asked him why he was messing around with her daughter the 
station said it videotaped the nov 11 meeting between lukens and 
ms coffman at a fastfood restaurant in columbus 
but the fbi and prosecutors reviewed the tape and said they found 
no evidence of bribery 
the grand jury heard testimony from the girl ms coffman and at 
least two women who said they saw lukens with the girl in his 
apartment 
ms coffman interviewed by wdtntv of dayton following the 
indictment said she had hoped the grand jury would have returned a 
more serious charge 
i expected more because this is a very serious matter ms 
coffman said what kind of impression does it have on our 
children our future 
mrs coffmans daughter said she thinks an appropriate penalty 
would be to see lukens go to jail and no longer be a congressman 
its like a hurt right underneath my heart the daughter said 
lukens was first elected to congress in 1966 and served two 
terms he lost a bid for governor in the 1970 republican primary 
after that race he was barred from seeking public office for 
five years for not filing campaign reports on time that campaign 
law was changed before the fiveyear period expired and he was 
appointed to the state senate in 1971 to fill an unexpired term he 
returned to congress in 1986

a military jury spared a 
us navy captain serious punishment after convicting him today of 
failing to help vietnamese boat people who resorted to cannibalism 
to survive 
the jury of six navy captains could have jailed alexander balian 
for 90 days and made him forfeit twothirds of his pay for three 
months 
instead they gave the decorated vietnam war veteran a reprimand 
saying he erred last june 9 while his ship was in the south china 
sea but deserved no further punishment than to be relieved of 
command as he was in august 
balian 48 claimed he had been made a scapegoat over the 
incident and that heroes like me are hung out to dry when they get 
in trouble 
the jury had acquitted him of the more serious charge of ordering 
one refugee shaken off ropes as he tried to climb aboard the 
amphibious landing ship uss dubuque 
the jury deliberated nearly six hours before returning a verdict 
it took a half hour to decide on the sentence 
balian of los angeles was accused of failing to render adequate 
assistance to more than 80 vietnamese refugees in a leaky boat the 
dubuque encountered about 250 miles north of the philippine island 
of palawan 
un officials said 31 of the refugees later died survivors said 
they had devoured the dead to survive before filipino fishermen 
rescued them on june 27 
the jury found balian guilty of dereliction of duty for failing 
to conduct an adequate inspection of the refugee boat determine 
whether its sail was adequate conduct appropriate medical 
examinations of visibly dehydrated refugees provide necessary 
navigational equipment provide adequate water and clothing to the 
naked and take refugees aboard or see to it they were taken aboard 
or assisted by a navy supply ship in the area 
the prosecution had claimed balian abandoned the refugees in his 
rush to resume his voyage to the persian gulf where the dubuque 
took part in us navy security operations during the final days of 
the iraniraq war 
the defense argued that he was under pressure from his commanders 
to reach the persian gulf where the dubuque served as mother ship 
for us minesweepers and provided a backup force of 400 marines 
balian testified he did not pick up the refugees because he did 
not realize how desperate their situation was 
he also said he believed the refugees vessel seaworthy based on 
reports from the ships executive officer lt cmdr stanley halter 
after the sentence balian told reporters he accepted 
responsibility for his decision but called the navy investigation 
unfair 
he said an initial probe had cleared him of wrongdoing but that 
the second investigation was conducted by an officer of whom he had 
been critical 
balian also said at least four members of his crew should be 
courtmartialed for their actions he did not identify them 
in hindsight i should have done it different balian said 
he said the refugee problem was politically messy for the navy 
because no matter how you look at it the navy was embarrassed 
the captain also said there had been insufficient emphasis on 
what really happened on that junk why two young children were 
allowed to die and why three were murdered and all five eaten where 
is the accountability for that 
he said the jury was as fair as they could be but the dirty 
procedures to get me to court martial are sickening 
balian took command of the dubuque a 16500ton vessel based in 
sasebo japan in may 1987 and was relieved of command last august 
he said he had received a new assignment as assistant chief of 
plans at the navys telecommunications command in washington but did 
not know whether he would stay in the service 
the captain denied prosecution allegations he did not care about 
the fate of vietnamese refugees 
i fought for them he said we fought and were wounded 
because we cared about the vietnamese god knows this didnt come 
out well and im accountable im responsible 
in 1966 balian won the silver star the third highest military 
award for valor and a purple heart for wounds because he saved 
members of his crew after their river patrol boat was caught in a 
viet cong night ambush 
balian later served a second tour in vietnam aboard a destroyer 
his tours of duty since have included command of the ammunition 
supply ships uss kilauea and uss kiska and the amphibious assault 
ship uss peleliu

hunters call it the experience of a 
lifetime a trophy retrieved from the longago days of the american 
frontier critics call the centurys first largescale buffalo hunt 
a slaughter and a disgrace 
more than 15 percent of the yellowstone national park buffalo 
herds have already been killed this winter as they wandered beyond 
the parks boundaries to forage victims of a state law that permits 
the shootings to avert the spread of disease to cattle 
a total of 500 likely will be killed by monday and the state was 
mailing letters today to 250 hunters notifying them that they can 
come to paradise valley to shoot their buffalo if the beasts cross 
into montana 
if any animal even a bloodthirsty montana hunter could be a 
part of this and say its exciting its such stupidity that i cant 
believe it said cleveland amory president of the fund for 
animals in new york this is no longer a hunt its a massacre 
east coast animalrights activists are not the only people 
critical of the hunt 
ellery merrell a 73yearold rancher who has lived his entire 
life in tom miner basin about 18 miles north of yellowstone said it 
was sickening to watch the buffalo fall 
theyre about as smart as a damned old milk cow merrell said 
of the bison 
merrell said he had nine buffalo on his property wednesday 
morning he allows no buffalo hunting but the animals are killed 
when they cross the road to other property he said 
its legendary lack of intelligence notwithstanding the buffalo 
fascinates hunters and wildlife lovers equally the stubborn shaggy 
giants represent the frontier lost 100 years ago 
many of the hunters most of them montanans who have hunted all 
their lives call the bison hunt an experience they will never 
forget 
us rep ron marlenee rmont said he had looked forward to 
killing a bison with his 44magnum pistol but was unable to get 
away for the hunt 
i think that both the national park service and the state are 
acting in a responsible manner marlenee said there are too 
many buffalo in the park the harvest of those buffalo is a humane 
harvest of animals that would otherwise starve to death 
for the state of montana however its an economic issue 
about half of yellowstones bison carry brucellosis a disease 
which some scientists say could be transmitted to montana cattle 
herds brucellosis causes cows to spontaneously abort their calves 
herds could be quarantined if the disease should start to spread 
the legislature cited that concern when it decided in 1985 to 
allow hunters to kill bison entering montana the previous winter 
state wildlife officials shot 88 bison in montana to control 
brucellosis 
but louisa willcox of the greater yellowstone coalition dismissed 
disease as a justification for the hunt saying cattle in the area 
are vaccinated against it 
theoretically its certainly possible she said of the 
disease risk realistically its not 
once numbering in the millions the buffalo faced extinction by 
late in the 19th century yellowstones buffalo herd has rebounded 
from fewer than 50 at the turn of the century to about 2700 last 
winter 
park spokeswoman joan anzelmo said that even if all 750 hunters 
on the states list were to kill a bison the survival of the 
yellowstone herds and the species is not at all threatened by the 
biggest hunting death toll of the century 
anzelmo also said there wont be another year like this one soon 
large numbers of buffalo are being killed this year because recent 
mild winters allowed the survival of many animals that normally 
would have died 
last year only 39 bison were shot 
montana originally chose 250 names of hunters from those who 
applied for 200 bison tags at the beginning of the current season 
oct 1 another 250 were called in january said nancy craft of the 
montana fish wildlife and parks department

a female doctor and a 
14yearold girl may have been raped before they were killed in an 
army massacre at a rebel field hospital a human rights group says 
ten people included wounded rebels were slain in the feb 13 
attack on the hospital by an elite army battalion the roman 
catholic churchs legal aid office said thursday 
the office a highly respected human rights organization in el 
salvador said the doctors body bore 10 bullet wounds and the 
teenagers body six it said both were severely bruised on the 
inner thighs and breasts 
radio venceremos the guerrillas clandestine station reported 
on feb 15 that troops of the atlacatl battalion attacked and 
destroyed the field hospital two days earlier 
it said six people three medical workers and three wounded 
guerrillas were killed 
both the legal aid office and the rebel radio identified the 
female victims as alejandra bravo betancourt a 35yearold mexican 
physician and rosibel dubon 14 a paramedics aide their bodies 
were exhumed and examined feb 17 by the legal aid office 
the alleged massacre took place outside the village of los 
encuentros near the sumpul river that forms el salvadors northern 
border with honduras 
the northern province of chalatenango where los encuentros is 
located is a stronghold of leftist rebels waging a 9year civil war 
against the usbacked government 
col ciro lopez roque military commander of chalatenango told 
reporters thursday there was no field hospital near los encuentros 
but he said atlacatl troopers killed several guerrillas including 
the mexican doctor in combat feb 13 
they were treating one wounded subversive said lopez roque 
but it was not a field hospital there wasnt even a hut there 
legal aid concluded a field hospital was in fact installed near 
los encuentros and that atlacatl troops attacked and destroyed 
the field hospital and killed war wounded and the medical personnel 
present 
legal aid said in addition to the doctor and girl five wounded 
guerrillas and three other medical aides were killed in the atlacatl 
attack 
because the bodies of the two women were completely nude and 
both were bruised around the breasts and on the inside of the 
thighs rape or attempted rape is presumed the report said 
the church office called the attack a flagrant violation of 
the salvadoran constitution and of the 1949 geneva conventions 
the alleged massacre took place 10 days after a visit to el 
salvador by vice president dan quayle quayle delivered what he 
called a very emphatic message to the effect that washington 
expected the salvadoran armed forces to improve their human rights 
record

sikh gunmen crept into a sikh farming 
familys sleeping quarters near amritsar and killed a father and his 
four sons a senior police official said today 
police blamed the same group of six separatists for a second 
attack thursday night in a nearby village in which another sikh was 
killed 
more than 300 people have been killed so far this year by sikh 
extremists who have for seven years waged a bloody guerrilla war 
against the predominantly hindu government for a separate homeland

the tents were empty the applications lay 
blank and all was quiet on the texas border today but immigration 
authorities warned that thousands of central americans were lying 
low and hoping for a lapse in tighter federal restrictions 
i dont think they will stop coming said juan bautista 
sanchezsanchez a nicaraguan who was detained after his application 
for asylum was denied he said he left home after being arrested and 
beaten for marching against nicaraguas sandinista government 
they will be coming not only for economic reasons but for 
political reasons and i think they will come if i tell them that 
even if they get put in jail here they will not get beaten up he 
said 
but for now the immigration and naturalization services tough 
new asylum policy has achieved its goal a sharply reduced flow of 
central americans across the texas border patrol officers all along 
the border said the policy has not yet resulted in an increase in 
illegal immigration despite rumors that immigrants were shifting 
their point of entry westward to laredo and el paso 
were keeping an eye on the situation said jaime arras of 
the us border patrol office in el paso 
border patrol officers in laredo also said they had seen no 
unusual activity 
but many central americans are presumed to be in mexico waiting 
their turn to make it past border patrol checkpoints and to their 
destinations in the interior 
they are not stupid theyre lying low said silvestre reyes 
border patrol chief for the mcallen sector theyre probably with 
a sympathizer on their own or with an alien smuggler in hs through the 
rio grande valley around 
brownsville including 40000 who have sought political asylum 
to control that flow an army of ins workers and additional 
border patrol officers descended on the texas border this week to 
carry out the tougher rules for asylumseekers 
at the port isabel service processing center where an influx of 
asylum applicants was expected giant tents were pitched to house 
detainees and dozens of typewriters were shipped to process 
applications so far none of the tents and few of the typewriters 
have been needed 
ins officers processed 233 applications for asylum on tuesday 
the first day of the new policy but just 51 on wednesday and 10 on 
thursday only two of the more than 300 applicants were granted 
asylum 
nobody is coming to apply for asylum and thats sort of 
predictable when 99 percent of these folks are being thrown in jail 
here so obviously people are going underground and they are not 
going to be going through the system anymore which is a tragedy 
said mark schneider an attorney with the harlingenbased proyecto 
libertad which represents central americans 
under the old ins procedures immigrants applying for asylum had 
to wait weeks while their applications were processed during which 
they were released on their own recognizance 
under the new policy applications are processed on the spot but 
those whose applications are denied are being held on bonds between 
1000 and 4000 they are housed at an indoor detention center at 
port isabel 15 miles northeast of brownsville or at a red cross 
shelter near the texasmexico border 
thursday night more than 400 people stayed at the shelter only 
130 of whom were sent by the ins the others showed up on their own 
to await processing of their applications according to jim buck 
deputy commissioner of the ins 
buck said immigration agents are posted at the shelter but not in 
an adversarial role 
we want these people to have a place to stay we dont want 
them out in the streets he said we will have daily roll call 
but we wont have any heavy armaments and theyll have free 
movement

when little jessica has a cold her working parents 
can depend on increasing numbers of hospital daycare programs with 
such names as sniffles and sneezes and under the weather 
springing up nationwide in the past five years day care for 
mildly ill children in hospitals and independent infirmaries is 
catching on in massachusetts about a dozen hospitals offer the 
service according to the state office for children 
the trend prompted the state agency to study the need for such 
health care and to come up with alternatives that suit both anxious 
workers and employers concerned about lost productivity when staff 
members stay home 
the daycare infirmaries generally take youngsters recuperating 
from the runofthemill childhood illnesses 
dr george sterne a pediatrician in new orleans who is on a 
national panel working on standards for such care said mixing 
hospitals with day care came about because hospitals had vacant beds 
and needed to keep nurses on the job when their own children were 
ill 
maureen mcandrew the nurse manager of pediatrics at st johns 
medical center in lowell runs the hospitals 2yearold sniffles 
and sneezes program 
a room at the end of the pediatric floor accommodates up to five 
children with beds and a play area that includes board games and a 
television set the program accepts children from six weeks to about 
12 years of age while the number of days is unlimited they can 
remain in care for no more than 10 hours a day the cost is 250 an 
hour lunch included 
parents are required to stay with their children about 15 minutes 
before depositing them in an effort to ease the transition 
its run by a hospital in a hospital but theyre not treated 
like theyre in the hospital said mrs mcandrew who added the 
program averages two to three children at a time 
marcia mandellzimmer is a nursing supervisor at st johns last 
year when she worked elsewhere and didnt know about sniffles and 
sneezes ms mandellzimmer said she missed three days of work for 
her own illness but more than four weeks caring for her baby son 
jonathan when he was too sick to go to day care 
in january jonathan was recovering from a fever and flu symptoms 
when she took him to the unit at work for one day and was relieved 
of the worries working parents usually face with a sick child 
you feel guilty trying to send your child to day care knowing 
they really shouldnt be there she said but if you dont have 
any vacation time saved up you miss a days pay and it doesnt 
look good on your record 
with the hospital day care she said she had no such concerns 
its what money cannot buy and its cheaper per hour than a 
babysitter she said 
a report in pediatrician magazine calculated that businesses lose 
six to 29 days annually per parent of children under age 6 who are 
out sick at a cost ranging between 2 billion and 12 billion 
according to judith presser chairperson of the health and childcare 
task force of the office for children 
sterne said he strongly opposes the notion of a hospital unit for 
day care unless it is segregated from the hospital setting and uses 
staff whose primary training is in early childhood education 
this is the kind of issue that gets parents very emotionally 
involved ms presser said in an interview thursday its new 
parents are uncertain of it 
like massachusetts the states of california delaware new 
jersey and minnesota already have or are completing regulations on 
such health care for children she said 
youre going to see another half dozen states in the next two 
years developing this kind of regulation ms presser said in the 
meantime she said there are no state implemented standards so 
parents have to look at whether theyre good for their child

city councilors who asked the citys 
law department how to go about driving snakes from this heavily 
irish city got an answer harking back to the old sod 
we have thought of suggesting you hire a consultant but the 
only person we are aware of who successfully drove snakes out of an 
area apparently retired a long time ago city lawyers said in a 
recent unsigned memo referring to the legend of st patrick driving 
the snakes from ireland 
the councilors made the request a few weeks ago because of 
complaints about a pet python on the loose in a residential 
neighborhood the ninefoot python disappeared three months ago and 
hasnt been seen since 
the city lawyers went on to suggest in their memo that the 
councilors visit the st patricks day parade in neighboring 
holyoke the march which annually attracts more than 225000 
people is regarded as being most conducive to the thoughtful 
discussion and consideration of driving snakes from places they 
said 
the last known fatality from a snake bite in massachusetts 
occurred outside springfield in 1761 when timothy mireck was struck 
by a rattlesnake the song on springfield mountain considered 
one of americas first folk tunes commemorates mirecks encounter

a coffee dispute is brewing at city hall 
george jacoby an aide to mayor sophie masloff says hes 
steaming over a decision by city controller tom flaherty to 
challenge a 17760 bill submitted for coffee supplied to the 
mayors office 
the vast majority of the coffee consumed in the mayors suite 
is by visitors we have very little hospitality to offer other than 
a cup of coffee he said 
gil martinez a contracts supervisor for flaherty recently wrote 
a memo to the mayor challenging the bill and claiming the mayor 
failed to follow proper procedures for procuring the percolating 
perk he said a contract must be awarded for a coffee service 
the more important question is how can you justify using tax 
dollars to purchase coffee for your office martinez said 
flaherty and masloff are among several democrats running for

the city is spending 125000 to install a toilet 
for a bridge tender staffing the university bridge and the issue is 
creating a stink among neighbors who say the hangdown plumbing is 
an eyesore 
a watersupply pipe has already been installed at a cost of 
40000 for the north tower toilet on the drawbridge 
but work on the sewer pipe has been stopped for the present in 
response to complaints from neighbors and the city engineering 
departments own surprise at how ugly the 4inch castiron sewer 
line looks hanging from rods under the bridge said jim bodoia 
project engineer 
critics have suggested a pump system which would allow the 
plumbing to be hidden under the bridge deck bodoia said that would 
be more expensive as would a holding tank arrangement that was 
considered by the city 
however bodoia said that with the complaints a decision still 
has to be made on whether to go ahead with the unsightly 
installation or an alternative 
why not just have the bridge tender walk to the south tower 
toilet when nature calls 
that would require a walk of about a block each way and the 
engineering departments ed engel said the coast guard frowns on the 
operator leaving the tower in case boat traffic approaches

while the philippine and us governments 
consider the fate of ferdinand e marcos doctors say his exile here 
may soon end without a struggle in death 
sunday is the third anniversary of the deposed philippine 
presidents arrival in exile and he will probably mark the occasion 
from his hospital bed where he has spent most of 1989 doctors say 
he appears tired and defeated 
its very hard to describe why a patient is so lethargic why 
they dont move around in bed or try to stand said dr george 
druger a lung specialist who has treated the 71yearold marcos for 
the past six weeks at st francis medical center 
its almost as though hes lost his will to live hes trying 
but hes not fighting like he used to druger said 
druger one of a team of doctors treating the former president 
said marcos has only a 50 percent chance of ever leaving the 
hospital and a 10 percent chance of living another year 
marcos ill health has prevented him from being arraigned in new 
york on federal racketeering charges he and his wife imelda are 
accused of stealing more than 100 million from their homeland and 
stashing it in the united states 
after their indictment oct 21 mrs marcos flew to new york to 
plead innocent and was freed on 5 million bail 
although the philippine government claims marcos stole billions 
of dollars during his 20year rule it has never charged him with 
fraud 
us district judge john f keenan is scheduled to resume a 
hearing march 6 on whether marcos is well enough to be arraigned in 
new york his attorneys argue marcos should be granted a medical 
severance meaning prosecution against him would not proceed 
unless he recovers prosecutors have said it is too early to 
determine marcos longterm prognosis 
aides said marcos spirits were buoyed thursday by a visit from 
cardinal ricardo j vidal the archbishop of the central philippine 
city of cebu who performed mass at marcos bedside and gave 
communion to marcos and his wife 
this is a pastoral and spiritual visit to a very sick man 
vidal said it is the only reason i came to hawaii im not acting 
as an emissary 
marcos remains in guarded condition in the hospitals intensive 
care unit druger said marcos improved slightly in the past week 
relying on a respirator only while sleeping and speaking clearly for 
the first time in three weeks 
marcos who arrived in hawaii on feb 26 1986 after being 
ousted in a popular uprising has been hospitalized since jan 15 
for treatment of pneumonia and bronchial asthma 
earlier he was hospitalized with congestive heart failure he 
also suffers from kidney problems 
a few weeks ago marcos aides said it was the leaders dying wish 
that he be allowed to return to his homeland philippine president 
corazon aquino has banned his return saying it would threaten 
national security 
mrs marcos has visited her husband daily during his hospital 
stay while maintaining her whirlwind social life the 59yearold 
former beauty queen is often sighted at honolulus most expensive 
restaurants and popular nightclubs 
while her husband lies in the hospital mrs marcos outings are 
tracked by fbi agents and reported in local gossip columns 
sometimes she sees the fbi guys sitting at the other end of the 
restaurant and she invites them over said gemmo trinidad a 
family spokesman some things in the news media hurt her 
feelings but the general public is nice to her people even ask for 
her autograph she says their friendliness helps restore her faith 
in america and she still has hope that she and the president will 
be cleared

petropulos a 29year veteran of sharon steel who posed for one of 
the paintings 
he said another steelworker was originally chosen to be a subject 
for the painting 
but mrs rockwell saw me at the company and thought i was more 
mature for the picture than the other person petropulos recalled 
after taking control of the steelmaker in 1969 posner ordered 
the paintings moved to his corporate offices in miami beach fla 
sharon steel which is operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection had to file suit against posner last july after he first 
refused to return the paintings posner agreed to relinquish the 
paintings in an outofcourt settlement 
you never know we may be forced to sell them in the future by 
events beyond our control said franklin bill agnew who was 
recently appointed by bankruptcy court to oversee the companys 
reorganization but i hope they stay in the community for a long 
time to come 
roger reed owner of illustration house inc of new york said he 
had viewed copies of the paintings in a rockwell catalogue and 
believed each was worth 20000 
a mystery of sorts surrounds one painting the company 
commissioned 14 paintings but only 13 were shipped to posners 
offices 20 years ago the one painting has never been found 
that irks john reichert who posed for the missing painting 
how can somebody walk in an office and take it away without 
anyone knowing reichert said somebody knows where it is 
company executives said they are at a loss as to where the 
painting may be 
the painting could have been given to one of our customers but 
who knows said walter sieckman chief operating officer for 
sharon steel 
he noted that when the paintings were first completed they 
werent considered exceptionally valuable 
it was considered part of our advertising program at the 
time sieckman said 
rockwell worked with his third wife molly over a fourday 
period in photographing the men who were subjects in the 14 
paintings he later put the images to canvas at his studio in 
stockbridge mass 
he made you so at ease so quickly recalls robert addicott a 
43year veteran of sharon steel he was a quiet man but he had a 
sense of humor

at the fw woolworth co store downtown an m1 
semiautomatic carbine is for sale for 19999 as the gun of the 
month and that does not sit well with city councilor david 
scondras 
its obscene to have a store that represents what is wholesome 
in america to sell these weapons scondras said they 
shouldnt sell guns 
he wants such weapons as the m1 which was used during world war 
ii banned 
a gun rack in the upstairs sporting goods department of the 
downtown woolworths includes a gun rack stocked with rifles among 
which is a semiautomatic equipped with a steel bayonet 
guns with bayonets dont appeal to sportsmanship they appeal 
to rambo said scondras why do hunters need a bayonet to 
skewer a squirrel give me a break 
the manager of the store referred questions to woolworths 
headquarters in new york a secretary there said no one from the 
company would comment 
scondras said he would write to woolworths asking the chain to 
stop selling guns 
it sends a very bad message out to kids every kid in the world 
knows about going to woolworths for toys and candy he said i 
dont think their parents want them thinking about going there for 
guns

suspected illegal aliens and drug traffickers in raids on both sides

there is a lot of bandit activity and drug dealing down on the

civil rights pioneer james h meredith is 
unfazed by the election of a former ku klux klan leader to the 
louisiana legislature and said he even agrees with him on numerous 
issues 
theres nothing wrong with his english meredith said of 
david duke i understand what hes saying and a lot of it is the 
same thing ive been saying 
meredith 55 a selfdescribed conservative who was in new 
orleans thursday to speak about a federal order to desegregate 
louisianas colleges said he found duke more believable than many 
other politicians 
people say he used to be a klan leader and he used to be this 
or that well im a christian and i believe people can change 
meredith said 
meredith who had to be escorted into the university of 
mississippi by us marshals in 1962 and who still bears the scars 
of three shotgun blasts from an assassination attempt in 1966 said 
before his speech that he and duke agree on many things 
we agree on equal opportunity i am also against 
affirmative action programs he said but it really shouldnt 
get to that under our constitution the people of a district elect 
the person they want to represent them and a if majority of those 
people select a candidate no one has a right to question it 
in baton rouge meantime duke said he was pleased with his 
assignments on the state house of representatives judiciary 
committee and health and welfare panel 
thats what i wanted duke said i want health and welfare 
because obviously welfare reform is one of the most important parts 
of my program judiciary im concerned about our courts and law 
enforcement 
meredith who like duke is a republican echoed the former klan 
grand wizard in other areas 
im against abortion im against handing out diplomas to black 
americans who have not been taught what those diplomas represent 
he said i dont believe in paying welfare to ablebodied men and 
women 
i think those things are wrong and bad for us as a people they 
are the way the liberal establishment keeps power over people

the soviet union is posing the 25000 
question offering a prize in that amount to anyone who can figure 
out the best way to convert the ruble into dollars the top soviet 
economist says 
a warning though to wouldbe entrants some western economists 
think the question may be unanswerable 
abel aganbegyan chief economic adviser to soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev mentioned the 25000 prize thursday in a speech to a 
group of international bankers and businessmen 
aganbegyan said the soviets are planning the contest jointly with 
californias esalen institute once better known for its encounter 
sessions and other experiments in radical psychology 
the soviets have increasingly discussed the possibility of making 
the ruble convertible so that it can be traded on world markets 
because their currency cannot be traded for western currency it has 
no intrinsic value on other markets that severely limits the 
soviets ability to buy foreign goods 
in his san francisco speech aganbegyan spoke of the 
possibilities of converting the ruble to hard currency over the next 
seven to 10 years or the creation of free trade zones in the country 
with a second currency that would be semiconvertible 
this semiconvertible currency would be backed by gold and 
export goods he said 
the soviet union is aware that the official rate of the ruble is 
not realistic at 160 he said adding that it might eventually 
be devalued to half that amount black market rates for rubles in 
the soviet union are 25 cents to 30 cents 
in the meantime he said we plan to double internal prices for 
raw materials and fuels to bring them closer to world prices 
some western economists scoff at the notion of the soviets making 
the ruble convertible saying such a move would require a wholesale 
transformation of the nations economy 
asked about the idea last december val zabijaka an economist on 
the soviet desk at the us commerce department said you 
probably believe in santa claus too 
in another speech in silicon valley aganbegyan told 200 
executives of hightech companies that the soviet union wants to 
encourage joint ventures with us firms to commercialize soviet 
technology 
the soviet union recently abolished requirements that joint 
ventures with companies from other countries had to be at least 51 
percent sovietcontrolled 
jack wilson vice president of dataquest inc a san jose market 
research firm that sponsored the speech to hightech leaders said 
the relaxation of restrictions on joint ventures was welcomed in 
silicon valley 
there may be real prospects for technology deals wilson 
said but its still a long march to develop any kind of a market 
there these deals are hard to put together

algerian voters overwhelmingly approved a new 
constitution that paves the way for a multiparty system for the 
first time since independence from france in 1962 
more than 70 percent of the 104 million voters in thursdays 
balloting voted for the constitutional change according to results 
announced today by the interior ministry 
the constitution extends the process of political and social 
reform that president chadli bendjedid promised after a week of 
riots last october left 176 people dead by official count 
government offices were the main targets of rioters 
about 80 percent of the 13 million voters in this former french 
colony in north africa cast ballots the ministry said 
interior minister aboubakr belkaid said the new constitution 
opens the way to a new era he said it will allow his country 
to know more democracy to assure public and individual liberties 
and to establish the sovereignty of the law 
although it does not specifically authorize political parties to 
compete with the ruling national liberation front in this nation of 
25 million the new constitution declares the right to create 
associations of a political character 
since bendjedid 59 announced the draft constitution various 
groups have begun forming among them are the leftist democratic 
union the islamic salute front and the berbers rally for culture 
and democracy 
ahmed mahsas a former agricultural minister announced formation 
of the union of democratic forces on thursday the official algerian 
press service reported 
it was the third national referendum in less than four months 
in november 92 percent of the voters approved political reforms 
that began reducing the power of the ruling party algerias only 
legal political organization the next month about 81 percent 
elected bendjedid to a third fiveyear term 
octobers riots were rooted in economic problems brought by low 
world prices for oil the nations chief export many algerians 
blamed the centralized socialist government for failing to solve 
the problems 
the proposed constitution also guarantees freedom of expression 
and within limits the right to strike it would restrict the army 
to defending the national independence the unity and territorial 
integrity of the country 
under the current charter the army has a role in development 
of the country and the building of socialism 
also dropped is a declaration that the algerian state is 
socialist the new text does not refer to socialism 
however islam would remain the state religion and arabic the 
official language

a suitcase filled with dummy weapons used to train 
security personnel triggered a reallife emergency drill at miami 
international airport as a jumbo jet was ordered off a runway and a 
busy terminal was evacuated 
it looked like a normal suitcase airport spokeswoman amalia 
fernandez said thursday there were two imitation hand grenades 
and a fake firearm like a pistol there was also a fake explosive 
device complete with a detonator and tubes 
the suitcase a demonstration kit belonging to a londonbased 
security manager for pan american world airways originally cleared 
customs in london and was supposed to be loaded onto pan am flight 
445 to caracas venezuela said pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon in 
new york 
airport security spotted the bag after it was left behind by 
mistake and immediately called the pan am airbus a300 off the 
runway for a security check delaying the flight by an hour ms 
hanlon said 
they also closed the airports international flight terminal for 
about 30 minutes causing minor flight delays but no cancellations 
said ms fernandez 
normally we would hear from airline somehow ms fernandez 
said we were not notified of this and of course when you 
see that in our security screening system it looks like the real 
thing 
pan ams london security office was supposed to send a message to 
the airlines miami office and to security personnel at the airport 
warning them of the kit ms hanlon said 
we believe it was sent but somehow it was not received she 
said its one of those miscommunications that are unfortunate 
security seminars held throughout the pan am system have used the 
fake weapons kits for some time ms hanlon said 
she said the antiterrorism classes were routine long before a 
bomb exploded on pan ams flight 103 from london last december 
killing all 259 people aboard in a crash in lockerbie scotland

despite the exclamation point theres not much 
to cheer in hizzoner a oneman show based on the life of 
fiorello h laguardia 
the play which opened thursday at broadways longacre theater 
seems like a textbook recitation about one of new yorks most famous 
and colorful mayors little of that color comes through in 
playwright paul shyres theatrical biography which smacks of 
extensive research but little imagination 
shyre sets his play in 1945 on the mayors last day in office 
while laguardia is cleaning out his desk he also dusts off his 
memories giving the audience a dry rather straightforward 
accounting of his life shyre makes it sound like a resume 
there are no surprises and very little insight into the man who 
not only was mayor of new york for 12 years but also a congressman 
a clerk in the us foreign service an army pilot and a tireless 
champion of the underdog 
whatever heart the evening has comes from the hard work of actor 
tony lo bianco who invests the play with an energy that rarely 
flags lo bianco has to work doubly hard too during a preview last 
week he broke an ankle sliding down a fire pole he continued with 
the performance but now wears a black foot cast 
the cast hasnt hampered the actors movement around designer 
eldon elders credible recreation of the mayors city hall office 
in fact it adds to the performance giving lo bianco a jaunty gait 
as he makes his way back and forth across the stage 
the actors physical resemblance to laguardia is amazing his 
bulldog frame suggests the great mans height and weight and he has 
down pat that peculiar way the mayor scrunched up his face when he 
got excited for the most part he also captures laguardias voice 
a highpitched almost squeaky way of talking 
lo bianco is at his best in several of the imaginary press 
conferences he holds with newspaper reporters the mayors banter 
doesnt stop and neither does lo bianco in his efforts to get the 
last bit of humor out of each joke 
famous names eleanor roosevelt robert moses jimmy walker 
gypsy rose lee calvin coolidge dorothy parker are dropped into 
the evening at regular intervals but their associations with 
laguardia are not as interesting as the mayors personal revelations 
about the death of his first wife and child his fathers army 
career or occasional thoughts about being mayor of new york 
the best moment in the play occurs near the end when laguardia 
muses on the price of progress he worries about the homeless men 
bulldozed into oblivion when their shacks near the hudson river are 
torn down to start construction of the henry hudson parkway was the 
project worth the human cost 
but that introspection is rare in hizzoner the play is more 
concerned with events presented in the most prosaic way possible 
laguardias various political campaigns successful and 
unsuccessful are related in often confusing detail and eventually 
blur together director john going hasnt found a way to separate 
them on stage 
other famous moments are glossed over when laguardia reads the 
comics over the radio during a newspaper strike it falls flat the 
incident is wellknown but seems an afterthought to the meandering 
second act which repeats many of the devices press conferences 
radio programs used in act 1 
laguardias life certainly had enough drama for a theater piece 
the creators of fiorello captured it 30 years ago in the 
pulitzer prizewinning musical hizzoner hasnt it has put the 
biographical facts but not the man himself on stage 
in other reviews 
the new york posts clive barnes says lo bianco cuts an 
engaging and persuasive figure as laguardia but he says the 
plays basic trouble is that its sole character appears to be 
running for office as much as appearing in a play 
howard kissel in the daily news wrote that hizzoner has the 
faults of most oneperson shows based on famous people it quickly 
becomes a history lesson kissel says lo bianco gives laguardia 
a vulgarity a buffoonishness that diminishes the little flower 
unfairly 
in the new york times mel gussow wrote that the laguardia 
presented in the play would win few votes either as a candidate 
or as a comedian

a bookstore chain that initially withdrew the satanic verses 
from its shelves for fear of terrorist attack went on the offensive 
today saying it will continue to sell the book despite many 
threats of violence 
waldenbooks one of the nations largest chains ran 
advertisements in nine newspapers defending its decision to stop 
displaying the book which has been condemned by moslems worldwide 
we will continue to sell the book when it comes back in stock 
at the publisher declared the ads signed by harry hoffman 
president and chief executive officer of the chain we will 
continue to use discretion in displaying the book 
the advertisement is headlined a statement of fact in troubled 
times 
two other large book chains b dalton and barnes amp noble 
briefly stopped selling the satanic verses after ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini the iranian leader called for the execution of 
its author british novelist salman rushdie and those responsible 
for its publication those stores resumed sales of the book 
wednesday after nationwide protests 
waldenbooks ordered the book removed from store shelves last 
friday but said its managers could sell it from behind the counter 
todays advertisement cited the many threats of violence made 
against our stores and our people a waldenbooks spokeswoman 
tracy urdan said the chain received an estimated 60 bomb threats in 
the first days after the death threat was issued 
all three of the large chains were criticized by writers groups 
for engaging in a form of censorship but hoffman insisted that his 
employees safety was the real issue 
in any case ms urdan said the question is moot for the time 
being because there are no more books in stock and there wont be 
until march 10 
viking penguin the us publisher of the satanic verses is 
reportedly printing 15000 copies and has plans for another 50000 
within two weeks the new york times reported today 
the times said an unidentified book wholesaler predicted the book 
would sell 500000 copies in hardcover making it a huge bestseller 
in chicago speakers at a rally thursday urged people to buy the 
book to register support for rushdie 
lets not be stampeded by this kind of intellectual terrorism 
lets vote with our wallets buy rushdies book said larry 
heinemann winner of the 1987 national book award for his novel

chicago public librarys cultural center celebrated chicago 
suntimes gossip columnist irv kupcinet said if good people dont 
stand up and act evil takes over 
a small group of chicago moslems attended the rally handing out 
brochures condemning rushdies book for insulting islam in a manner 
that scandalizes and maligns muslims beliefs 
we dont agree with the death threat or the bounty said 
mohammad kaiseruddin president of chicagos muslim community 
center but we are still very offended by passages in the satanic 
verses that use profanity to describe the prophets abraham and 
mohammed

idaho gov cecil andrus said he acted in the 
interests of national security when he partially lifted a ban on the 
shipments of nuclear waste into the state 
but antinuclear activists said the issue is not national 
security but a burgeoning radioactive waste supply with no place to 
go 
andrus announced thursday that he will allow temporary shipments 
of transuranic and lowlevel radioactive waste into the state the 
shipments are to come only from the us department of energys 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant in colorado and only for the next 
six months 
the governor said two railroad boxcars per month will be accepted 
from the rocky flats site near denver to avoid a serious national 
security crisis if the facility closed down 
an average of four boxcars per month were shipped from the 
colorado plant to the idaho national engineering laboratory before 
andrus closed idahos borders to waste shipments last oct 19 
partially lifting the ban on new shipments will allow rocky flats 
to remain open and give the doe time to clear up problems that have 
delayed opening of its waste isolation pilot plant a permanent 
waste storage site near carlsbad nm 
sen james mcclure ridaho and rep richard stallings didaho 
both supported andrus decision mcclure called it recognition of 
the fact that this is a national issue that has clear and serious 
implications for our deterrent forces 
but elizabeth paul the executive director of the antinuclear 
snake river alliance criticized the governor for softening his 
stance since january when he said the doe should stop producing 
weapons if it cannot come up with longterm waste solutions 
ms paul said there is no reasonable evidence that shutting 
down rocky flats would jeopardize national security 
another snake river board member fritz bjornsen agreed saying 
the crisis is in radioactive waste management not national 
security

the seabrook nuclear power plant wont 
operate commercially for another two years if at all one owner 
told the lead owners bankruptcy judge 
i think it is more likely than not that seabrook will run but 
it is still a very uncertain situation it changes on a daily 
basis said robert busch a northeast utilities senior vice 
president 
testifying at a public service co of new hampshire bankruptcy 
hearing thursday busch said northeasts proposed acquisition of 
public service which would spin off that utilitys seabrook 
investment into a separate company assumes seabrook will operate 
by mid1991 
other northeast and seabrook officials stressed that the 
companys estimate of may 1991 is for financialplanning purposes 
and may be conservative 
it is 16 months later than the estimate used by public service 
the 58 billion plant finished in 1986 remains idle for lack 
of a federal operating license 
rob williams spokesman for new hampshire yankee public 
services seabrook management division played down the northeast 
projection he said financialplanning estimates used in dealings 
with utility regulators and lenders are by their nature very 
conservative 
it appears to us that the licensing process will be completed 
by the end of the year williams said 
commercial operation should follow soon afterward he added 
public service spokesman nicholas ashooh said he was concerned 
that differences in owners financialplanning estimates on seabrook 
may be perceived as meaning that seabrook has slipped again 
that is really not accurate ashooh said 
some owners are more conservative than others ashooh said 
meantime public service said it will make a new offer to state 
officials next month on electricity rate increases it seeks to 
emerge from bankruptcy protection 
public services chief financial officer charles bayless made 
the disclosure thursday as he tried to show a federal bankruptcy 
judge that there still are prospects for a reorganization settlement 
that would avert lengthy expensive litigation 
the state the utility and its creditors have been locked in 
dispute over a key issue in the reorganization what rates public 
service will be able to charge for its 36 percent share of the 
completed but stalled seabrook plant 
the company also announced it had settled a securitiesfraud 
lawsuit brought by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that 
helped pay for completing the seabrook nuclear power plant 
northeast new englands largest power company wants to buy 
public services nonseabrook assets and has made a bid that it 
says is worth about 2 billion if seabrook operates 
northeast is stressing its experience with nuclear plants having 
built the threereactor millstone project in connecticut busch was 
project manager for millstone 3 which he said began commercial 
operation about two weeks ahead of schedule in april 1986

although careful to separate religion and the modern 
democratic state organizers of todays grand funeral for emperor 
hirohito drew deeply from japans shinto rites and ancient 
traditions 
court music was played classical poetry read and costumes of 
another era worn although government officials said the funeral 
ceremony was pared down in length and pomp to conform to the 
times 
the funeral lasted more than 13 hours the 1927 funeral of 
hirohitos father emperor taisho took a day and a half and 
mourners dared not even look at the hearse bearing taishos body 
japanese today snapped photographs of the funeral procession and 
hirohitos son emperor akihito carried his own umbrella 
he delivered a eulogy in common speech rather than the elaborate 
courtly language used for such events in the past 
but the main funeral ceremony at the shinjuku imperial gardens 
led by the new emperor was still steeped in the rituals of shinto 
the indigenous religion which predates yet still coexists with 
buddhism 
sensitive to japans postwar constitution which insists on 
separation of religion and state and relegates the emperor to a 
figurehead role the funeral organizers stressed such a duality in 
the ceremonies 
an actual curtain of black color was drawn after the completion 
of the shinto ceremony at the gardens and reopened before the start 
of the state funeral the curtain separated some 9800 invited 
mourners and the imperial family from the hall where hirohitos body 
lay 
the sound of flutes and ancient court music heralded the start of 
the elaborate procession led by akihito into the funeral grounds 
empress michiko in a flowing black dress and matching veil 
followed a few steps behind 
dignitaries representing 163 nations were bundled up in dark 
woolen blankets at their seats in a large tent 
once hirohitos coffin was in place in the funeral hall 
specially constructed of japanese cypress ritualists made 
offerings including silk and food to hirohito marking the start 
of the shinto ceremonies 
dressed in mourning black with a top hat and gloves clutched in 
his left hand a solemn akihito entered the hall through the 
traditional shinto torii gate and bowed deeply stepping up to the 
altar he read from a speech handed to him by a chamberlain and bid 
a final farewell to his father 
after he left empress michiko entered the hall where she 
offered a sacred sakaki branch to the late emperor 
ancient myths hold that gods dwell in the sakaki or evergreen 
trees which are often used in shinto rituals as offerings to 
deities 
chamberlains later removed the offerings from the hall and the 
black curtain was drawn to signal the end of the 47minute shinto 
ceremony 
by the start of the state funeral a short while later the 
torii gate and small tables at the altar had been removed a 
speech by chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi signaled the 
beginning 
imperial family members again walked up to the funeral hall and 
bowed prime minister noboru takeshita and other government 
representatives offered short eulogies 
the onehour state funeral concluded with the visiting foreign 
dignitaries stepping up to the hall and bowing to the late emperor 
and his family

many japanese bid an affectionate farewell today to 
the emperor who led them through a devastating war and into great 
prosperity but for others the funeral was an occasion to denounce 
the system he represented 
hirohito is the greatest of war criminals during world war ii 
with hitler and mussolini said a 36yearold high school teacher 
among about 400 demonstrators who gathered at one tokyo park 
protesters from three leftist groups displayed banners denouncing 
the 74 million funeral and attacking hirohito for his role as 
titular leader during japans world war ii aggression 
under the name of hirohito our mothers and fathers were 
mobilized for war in asia and thousands of people were massacred 
said the teacher who refused to give his name 
opponents of the imperial system associate it with militarism and 
remind their countrymen that the emperors name was used to rally 
support for japans invasion of much of asia during world war ii 
until the end of the war the emperor also stood at the head of 
the state shinto religion which was used to justify strong central 
control by the government and the suppression of human and religious 
rights 
civil servants at a municipal office in japans southwestern 
prefecture of okinawa voted to come to work today despite the 
governments designation of the day as a special national holiday in 
hirohitos honor 
resentment against hirohito remains strong on the island where 
about 210000 japanese civilians and soldiers died in the fiercest 
fighting on apanese territory of world war ii 
about 210000 people lined the route taken by a funeral motorcade 
most appeared curious braving a cold drizzle to crane their 
necks at the cortege eagerly snapping pictures as the slowmoving 
hearse and its imperial motorcycle escort came into view a few shed 
tears 
but at 11 other locations in tokyo about 4300 people took part 
in antiemperor demonstrations police said including about 800 who 
shouted slogans through loudspeakers as they marched 2 miles 
authorities arrested five people including two who broke through 
police lines and ran into a street along the funeral route 
national police said they had no figures on demonstrations 
elsewhere in japan but in hiroshima about 30 people staged a 
sitin in front of the atomic dome the remnants of a domed building 
gutted by an atomic bomb in august 1945 
shortly after the united states dropped the bomb hirohito 
announced japans surrender 
for some mourners in tokyo it proved an emotional sendoff as they 
lined up many rows deep and bowed their heads as hirohitos coffin 
passed by 
eitaro ohya 77 recalled watching the 1927 funeral procession 
for emperor taisho hirohitos father 
i remember keeping my head bowed so low because the emperor was 
considered a god that i saw nothing ohya recalled but this 
time i watched it is a great honor to witness two emperors 
funerals 
others were bitter kazumasa miyamoto 70 said i was forced 
to do construction work in china in the name of emperor hirohito and 
had a hard time we should not spend money for such a funeral 
the holiday kept department stores restaurants movie theaters 
and other places of entertainment shut down large sections of the 
city were blocked off to traffic and most residents stayed home or 
headed out of tokyo 
across the capital only a few small stores and restaurants 
remained open 
in the nakano district where marxists staged a protest many of 
the demonstrators had lunch at the only eatery open a kentucky 
fried chicken outlet where the staff wore black mourning ribbons

prosecutors played videotapes of jewelers 
counting money stacked to the ceiling as they argued against bail 
for gem store employees arrested in a 1 billion cocaine 
moneylaundering network 
three of the defendants were ordered held without bail thursday 
but us magistrate ralph j geffen allowed 125 million bail for 
rita sorfazian as well as 50000 bail each for two gem store clerks 
in arguing against bail for mrs sorfazian assistant us 
attorney russell hayman said the government does not have the 
resources to wipe out the sophisticated moneylaundering network 
attacked wednesday with arrests of dozens of people at the downtown 
jewelry district and other locations worldwide 
if we let her out are we letting her out to work for one of 
the jewelers we know are still doing this he asked 
ms sorfazian has yet to post bail 
thirtyseven people were charged wednesday with taking in at 
least 1 billion through merchants in los angeles texas florida 
and new york then sending the laundered cash to colombian drug 
lords 
the defendants also were charged with aiding and abetting the 
distribution of 640 pounds of cocaine seized during the 
investigation

the body of emperor hirohito today was sealed inside 
a hillside crypt and offerings were made to his spirit ending a 
13hour funeral attended by the largest gathering of world leaders 
in modern history 
a day of elaborate ceremony concluded by torchlight shortly 
before 9 pm after the lacedraped coffin was put on a cart and 
tugged 33 feet up a slope by a pulleylike device it was then moved 
inside a prepared stone tomb dug into the hillside and sealed with 
concrete 
hirohitos moundlike mausoleum is in a grove of towering cypress 
trees at the musashi imperial cemetary west of tokyo 
worshiped as a living god and branded a war criminal during his 
87year life hirohito was honored by official representatives of 
163 nations at some of the ceremonies including president bush and 
his wife barbara 
the bushs sat in the front row at the funeral covered with wool 
and cashmere blankets to protect them from the winter chill bush 
the collar of his black overcoat turned up paused in front of the 
coffin and lowered his head in a slight bow when his turn came to 
approach the coffin 
a bomb exploded in a roadside embankment about 20 minutes before 
a motorcade carrying hirohitos body and members of the imperial 
family passed by on its way to the burial ground 
the motorcade was not delayed and no one was injured police said 
they suspected radicals planted the bomb they said groups opposing 
the emperor system staged 11 demonstrations in the japanese capital 
and officers arrested five people 
a 21gun salute opened the final fivehourlong ceremonies of 
entombment as the rainy weather that had occurred most of the day 
cleared 
the ceremonies ended with the tombside offering of 16 kinds of 
food and six kinds of clothing the imperial family now led by 
55yearold emperor akihito then returned to the imperial palace 
the kyodo news agency said a sword ceremonial shoes books 
written by the emperor and favorite items of clothing were buried in

belongings would be encased including an old germanmade microscope 
he used in marine biological research and a recent list of rankings 
of sumo wrestlers hirohitos favorite sport was sumo wrestling 
the people will remember him forever akihito said in his 
eulogy he expressed his overwhelming emotion and extreme 
sense of sorrow while thanking the people of japan and foreign 
countries who sent condolences after his fathers death jan 7 from 
cancer 
the 74 million funeral began with private shinto rites within 
the walls of the palace in downtown tokyo 
the metropolis of 12 million came to a virtual standstill and 
32000 police mounted the largest security operation in japanese 
history to protect the world leaders and contain antimonarchy 
protests 
the day was declared a national holiday businesses were closed 
and many residents took advantage of the long weekend to head for 
ski slopes 
about 800 protestors burned a japanese flag and chanted slogans 
through loudspeakers as they marched for 2 miles from shiba park in 
the heart of tokyo 
another 400 demonstrators from three leftist groups gathered at 
another park carrying banners denouncing the funeral and attacking 
hirohito for his role as titular leader during japans world war ii 
aggression 
the tenno emperor hirohito is the greatest of war criminals 
during world war ii with hitler and mussolini said a 36yearold 
high school teacher who refused to be identified under the name 
of hirohito our mothers and fathers were mobilized for war in asia 
and thousands of people were massacred 
but others cried or clasped their hands together in prayer as 
hirohitos coffin passed by 
a 72yearold farmer morie hiroki tried to commit suicide by 
harikiri on the southern island of kyushu the world war ii army 
private left a note saying he felt he had to follow his emperor in 
death 
hirohito renounced his purported divinity in 1946 as japan began 
its climb from the ashes of world war ii toward spectacular economic 
success 
police estimated 571400 people braved the 37degree weather to 
view he funeral processions including more than 200000 who watched 
as a black hearse carrying the coffin drove slowly through central 
tokyo along a fourmile route from the imperial palace to the main 
ceremony at shinjuku imperial gardens 
the motorcyleescorted 32car procession passed parliament the 
democratic core of modern japan and the national stadium where the 
emperor opened the 1964 summer olympics heralding japans postwar 
reemergence 
akihito and empress michiko led the imperial mourners but 
hirohitos 85yearold widow the empress dowager nagako did not 
attend the public ceremonies due to reported poor health 
at the shinjuku gardens 51 blackrobed men carried the coffin on 
a 22footlong palanquin to a wooden shrine for shinto rites led by 
akihito the body of hirohito was encased in an inner wooden coffin 
and an outer one of metal 
a chamberlain dressed in white followed the bier carrying a 
platter with a pair of white shoes that tradition says the deceased 
monarch will wear to heaven 
flutes and pipes with an occasional drum beat sounded a 
plaintive tune as the procession entered the ceremonial grounds 
members of the imperial family the women in veils men in black 
tailcoats and black silk top hats protected themselves from the 
rain with umbrellas 
in two vast heated tents were the 9800 invited mourners a 
phalanx of world leaders japanese government officials private 
citizens and several champions of sumo wrestling 
akihito delivered his fourminute eulogy a deepvoiced male 
chorus sang a solemn mourning song a poem was read and imperial 
family members went individually before the coffin and bowed slowly 
shinto attendants wore black robes and traditional headgear and 
eight men carried two sacred evergreen trees while others bore tall 
banners with imperial symbols of the sun and moon and chests 
containing ceremonial offerings 
after the religious ceremony shinto appurtenances were removed 
and the state funeral began with a minute of silence 
in his eulogy prime minister noboru takeshita described 
hirohitos 62year reign as eventful and turbulent times for 
japan including the calamities of that deplorable war the struggle 
to reconstruct itself from the ruins amid confusion and dire poverty 
and to regain its full independence 
during all these years emperor showa ardently wished for world 
peace and the wellbeing of the japanese people he said 
referring to hirohito by his posthumous name 
after the eulogies the bushs stepped to the front of the hall

bundled against the cold president bush bowed in 
final respects to emperor hirohito at a raindrenched funeral today 
and later vowed to fight on his return to washington to salvage the 
troubled nomination of john tower as secretary of defense 
as bush joined 9800 mourners under tents at the shinjuku 
imperial garden ceremony towers nomination was rejected in 
washington by the senate armed services committee the vote was 
119 split along party lines with the democrats in the majority 
the vote the first such committee rejection of a presidents 
cabinet choice in 44 years was a major setback for bush on his 
first trip overseas as president and came as he mingled with 
leaders of more than 160 countries 
i am going to strongly continue to back sen tower and i dont 
believe hes going down the drain bush told reporters after the 
funeral as he emerged from talks with foreign leaders at the us 
ambassadors residence 
he said he had no intention of withdrawing towers name in favor 
of a new less controversial nominee i havent considered any 
options he said i stand strongly with john tower 
added bush he knows that when i get back and i will be back 
before the senate vote he knows i will do whatever i can to talk 
to individual members and have them know how strongly i feel about 
it and hopefully to persuade some who have looked at evidence so 
far and may have a different opinion 
despite the setback bush said he considers his honeymoon with 
congress is still going fine but inasmuch as he wants tower 
confirmed he said i cant say its a pat on the back 
although he appeared tired from the rigors of his journey bush 
said he felt like a spring colt ready to charge 
after paying a courtesy call on hirohitos son emperor akihito 
on saturday morning bush flies to beijing for two days of talks 
with chinese leaders he will visit south korea briefly on monday en 
route home to washington 
earlier leaving the threehour funeral bush had shown no sign 
of distress over the senate committees vote he gave a thumbsup 
sign and smiled as his armored limousine flown in specially from 
washington brought him back to the american ambassadors residence 
apart from the funeral bush held separate meetings with 
philippine president corazon aquino king baudouin of belgium prime 
minister benazir bhutto of pakistan west german president richard 
von weizsaecker singapore prime minister lee kuan yew prime 
minister turgut ozal of turkey italian president francesco cossiga 
and president mobutu sese seko of zaire bush had a private dinner 
with king juan carlos of spain 
fitzwater said bush assured mrs aquino of us support and noted 
that the administration is seeking 200 million in aid for the 
philippines 
recognizing that towers nomination suddenly was in deep trouble 
white house chief of staff john sununu was up most of the night on 
longdistance telephone calls to senate republicans and others said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said sununu called tower by telephone this afternoon to 
inform him of bushs continued support sen tower said he knew it 
would be a difficult fight but hes ready to move forward 
fitzwater said 
for the first time fitzwater said it would probably be 
helpful for the nomination to release the 140page report on the 
fbi investigation of towers personal life however he said im 
not at all sure that that can happen or that it should happen out 
of concern for those who were interviewed 
secretary of state james a baker iii in a cbs television 
interview said bush had not been hurt by the tower vote i dont 
think its a loss until it goes down the tubes on the floor he 
said adding that he was not predicting that the nomination was lost 
separately baker said in an nbctv interview that it is not in 
the best interest of the foreign policy of the united states to have 
a nomination hang fire for this long 
fitzwater said there was no consideration of any replacement for 
tower period bar none 
bush had begun his day with calls to washington with senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan and other senators about towers 
nomination but even before the committee voted bush had to put the 
matter aside to attend hirohitos funeral 
for the occasion bush had rented a morning coat in washington 
including grey stripe pants black vest black tie and black cutaway 
jacket with tails 
accompanied by his wife barbara bush was given a frontrow 
center seat in one of two huge opensided tents at the state 
funeral to give him a place of prominence japanese officials had 
to waive protocol rules that would have put bush toward the back 
because of his short tenure in office 
one by one world leaders approached hirohitos coffin to pay 
respects after the formal eulogies 
when their turn came bush and his wife paused in front of the 
coffin and lowered their heads in a slight bow a pelting rain and 
stiff wind made the chilly day in tokyo seem even colder 
bush wore a black overcoat and turned up his collar against the 
wind along with many other mourners bush and his wife covered 
their laps with wool and cashmere blankets placed on each seat 
there were electrical heating coils beneath the floor and a 
heater in the low wall directly in front of the president 
hirohito the last of the world war iiera world leaders died of 
cancer at age 87 on jan 7 after reigning for six decades 
bush issued a statement thanking japanese officials who managed 
this complicated logistics and put on a marvelous pageant in honor 
of the late emperor beautifully staged and beautifully carried 
off on schedule working against the elements but nevertheless 
with a dignity and a ceremony that was appropriate 
he said he had great respect for what they did and the way in 
which they did it and i am proud to have represented the united 
states of america here today 
bush a navy combat pilot in world war ii who was shot down by 
japanese gunners during a bombing run said attending the funeral 
was the right thing to do because japan and the united states are 
allies 
the gesture was appreciated by the japanese particularly because 
of lingering resentment in some quarters about hirohitos role as a 
leader during the war some us veterans were among those who 
objected to bushs decision 
bush was unaffected by the only significant security incident 
involving the emperors funeral a bomb damaged a highway along 
which the emperors hearse was due to be taken after the ceremony 
but bush was already back at his hotel at the time police 
speculated that radicals opposed to the emperor system were 
responsible for the blast

president bush vowed today to stand 
strongly with defense secretarydesignate john tower through a 
senate floor vote despite the armed services committees rejection 
of towers confirmation because of questions of character 
im going to strongly continue to back senator tower and i 
dont believe hes going down the drain bush told reporters in 
tokyo where he was attending the funeral of japans emperor 
hirohito 
the committee voting strictly along party lines recommended by 
119 thursday night that the senate reject towers nomination after 
democrats expressed continuing concerns about questions of his 
character 
i cannot in good conscience vote to put an individual at the 
top of the chain of command when his history of excessive drinking 
is such that he would not be selected to command a missile wing a 
sac bomber squadron or a trident missile submarine sen sam nunn 
dga the committee chairman said before the vote 
bush faced with a political defeat at home as he made his global 
debut at the hirohito funeral said he believed lingering doubts 
about tower would be answered when the full senate takes up the 
nomination 
i am going to strongly continue to back senator tower bush 
said as he left the us ambassadors residence in tokyo i am 
hoping that this debate that will follow next week will clear up any 
questions 
i havent considered any options i stand strongly with john 
tower said bush 
secretary of state james a baker iii in tokyo with bush said 
it would be a mistake for bush to withdraw the nomination in advance 
of a vote on the senate floor 
if he now pulled it i think all of you would say this is a 
terrible thing it shows that his judgment was flawed from the 
beginning baker said on cbs this morning 
the committee vote marked an abrupt departure from the monthlong 
honeymoon between the new republican president and the democratic 
majorities of congress but bush said he still believes his 
relationship with congress is still going fine 
should the full senate reject tower it would be the first time 
in history a newly elected president had suffered a rejection of a 
nominee to his first cabinet in all eight cabinet nominations have 
been rejected the most recent 30 years ago 
a handful of democrats suggested after the committee vote 
thursday night that bush seek a replacement for tower before next 
weeks scheduled floor vote it doesnt do the president any 
good said sen robert c byrd of west virginia its a 
tremendous burden for any nominee to go to the floor with a vote of 
no confidence 
but the white house quickly rejected that suggestion 
theres no consideration of alternative candidates 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters traveling 
with the president in japan theres no alternate list bar 
none 
hell be working to contact senators throughout the days ahead 
sometimes by telephone sometimes in person he said 
tower a former texas senator who had once chaired the committee 
said in a statement he was obviously disappointed but would 
continue to work at the pentagon and await the vote of full 
senate 
the strictly partisan vote climaxed an extraordinary 2 hour 
nighttime committee session at which lawmakers swapped views on the 
fbis investigation into numerous allegations against him 
tower has been dogged by allegations about his drinking habits 
and womanizing as well as by questions of possible conflict of 
interest posed by his earning hundreds of thousands of dollars as a 
defense industry consultant after leaving the senate 
the committees senior republican john warner of virginia said 
bush was entitled to a cabinet of his own choosing warner noted 
that many of the senators who had served with tower had been 
questioned by the fbi during its investigation 
not one single us senator not one who has served with john 
tower can ever recall a single instance where any of his persoal 
habits interfered with his duty warner said not one 
democrats hold a 5545 majority in the senate and a strictly 
party line vote on the floor would doom towers nomination still 
the prospect is for a bruising struggle leading up to an expected 
vote next wednesday or thursday as bush tries to sway enough 
democratic votes to triumph in his first major confrontation with 
congress 
even before the committee voted senate republican leader bob 
dole made clear the importance of the issue for the president 
saying on the floor that a vote against tower would be a kick in 
the teeth to the president 
one gop committee member sen william cohen of maine also said 
the party line vote would make it tougher to forge a bipartisan 
defense policy 
in his leadoff speech to the committee nunn expressed concern 
about towers drinking and said there were examples of behavior 
with women which he found indiscreet although he added the record 
did not support allegations that the former senator exerted sexual 
pressure on women employees and associates 
he said there was a significant public perception of a conflict 
of interest arising from towers receipt of large amounts of money 
from major contractors in return for the services he provided 
sen malcolm wallop of wyoming said tower had undergone trial 
by leak and said repetition has become a standard of truth 
the democrats who voted for the motion to reject tower were sens 
nunn byrd james exon of nebraska carl levin of michigan jeff 
bingaman of new mexico edward m kennedy of massachusetts alan 
dixon of illinois john glenn of ohio albert gore of tennessee tim 
wirth of colorado and richard shelby of alabama 
the republicans who voted against the motion were sens warner 
cohen wallop strom thurmond of south carolina pete wilson of 
california john mccain of arizona slade gorton of washington 
trent lott of mississippi and dan coats of indiana

the american civil liberties union filed a lawsuit 
challenging the states new ban on medicaidfunded abortions saying 
it punishes a 15yearold girl who became pregnant after being 
gangraped 
a hearing on the lawsuit filed thursday in wayne county circuit 
court was scheduled today before judge john hausner 
the law is imposing a double punishment on this person said 
howard simon executive director of the michigan chapter of the aclu 
the girl faces not only the punishment of being a victim of 
rape itself but being essentially consigned to the lifetime 
consequences simon said 
hausner could issue a temporary restraining order and ultimately 
a preliminary injunction clearing the way for a statefunded 
abortion the aclu lawsuit also filed on behalf of the girls 
mother is the first to challenge the ban passed by voters last 
november 
according to the lawsuit the girl whose name is being withheld 
was raped last month by three men the wayne county prosecutors 
office said two men were in jail awaiting trial on seconddegree 
criminal sexual conduct charges in the case 
the teenager who is five weeks pregnant wanted an abortion but 
was unable to afford the procedure because her family is on welfare 
the lawsuit said 
elizabeth gleicher and william h goodman the lawyers 
representing the girl said the abortion ban should be overturned 
because it denies poor women equal access to health care 
courts in connecticut vermont new jersey and california have 
overturned similar abortion bans allowing poor women in those 
states to again seek medicaidpaid abortions gleicher said 
before medicaidfunded abortions were banned in michigan the 
state spent about 6 million a year for some 18500 abortions for 
poor women

a physician was ordered to surrender his 
license and submit to a comprehensive psychiatric examination after 
12 former female patients accused him of sexual and ethical 
misconduct 
in suspending dr pravin d thakkars medical license for 90 
days the indiana medical licensing board said thursday that he 
presented a clear and immediate danger to the public health and 
safety and had engaged in immoral conduct 
two women have filed lawsuits against thakkar contending he got 
them pregnant then performed abortions without their knowledge 
carmen brutchen hertzinger and kathy collins both of anderson were 
the first to testify at a threehour hearing that led to the boards 
action 
several women then came forward and said thakkar asked to perform 
pelvic exams on them despite their medical condition one woman said 
thakkar wanted to perform a pelvic examination on her when she 
sought help for a strep throat 
thakkar 38 an obstetriciangynecologist who has a family 
practice in frankton did not attend the hearing 
we know a lot of these allegations are lies and false well 
get a chance to present our evidence to the licensing board soon and 
ill be exonerated thakkar said in a telephone interview thursday 
night 
the board pointed out that the 90day suspension was the most 
severe action that could be taken before a formal complaint is filed 
and a final hearing is scheduled 
ms hertzinger claims she became pregnant with thakkars child in 
february 1983 after they became romantically involved thakkar is 
accused of administering drugs to ms hertzinger eight months later 
causing her to deliver the fetus at his home he told her the baby 
was stillborn and he had taken care of it ms hertzinger said 
however ms hertzinger claims that she was conscious during part 
of the procedure and heard a babys cry 
asked later if she regretted not coming forward with her 
disclosures earlier ms hertzinger said it took all the numbers 
that we had here today to convince them of the severity and the 
danger that doctor thakkar was causing 
ms collins claims thakkar fathered her unborn child and then 
aborted the fetus with a medical instrument jan 9 1988 
after reviewing thakkars educational training and background 
board member dr deanna portekeene expressed concern over the 
doctors qualifications to practice as an obstetrician 
id be interested to know how this doctor even advertises 
himself as an obstetrician she said im certainly raising a 
lot of questions as to what his qualifications are as a physician 
let alone his personal conduct which is appalling 
ms hertzinger and ms collins have taped a segment of the 
television talk show geraldo that is scheduled to air march 7 
a third woman susan bickel 34 a former employee of thakkars 
said she went to him for an examination in august 1982 when she 
suspected she had become pregnant by her husband 
she said thakkar examined her with medical instruments and told 
her she wasnt pregnant she said she experienced pain during the 
exam and later began bleeding 
mrs bickel said she went to another doctor who examined her and 
told her she had undergone an abortion 
mrs bickel said thakkar eventually told her that he thought if 
id had a child by anyone else i wouldnt want him 
telling similar stories almost all of the women testified that 
thakkar told them they were beautiful asked questions about their 
sex lives and asked them for dates while under his care 
dr john hinton called the allegations probably the worst abuse 
of physicianpatient trust that ive seen since ive been on the 
board

thousands of people held a rally in 
southern kosovo province today to support miners who are striking to 
protest ethnic discrimination and to demand the resignation of a 
communist party chief 
yugoslav leaders rushed to pristina the provincial capital to 
prevent possible ethnic clashes between the albanian majority and 
slav minority 
more than 1300 ethnic albanian miners some on a hunger strike 
have refused to leave their pits at the trepca lead and zinc mines 
since monday 
tens of thousands of people have joined sympathy rallies and 
strikes across the province of serbia one of six yugoslav 
republics most private shops and some schools in kosovo closed 
today 
about 3000 university students and their professors today spent 
a second night in a pristina sports hall to show solidarity 
yugoslav communist party leader stipe suvar and the serbian 
republics party boss slobodan milosevic arrived in pristina and 
met with kosovo communist party chief rahman morina whose 
resignation the strikers demand 
the miners consider morina an ally of milosevic who is trying to 
gain greater serbian control over kosovo 
the mainly moslem albanians make up more than 85 percent of the 
provinces population and they claim his move would result in 
discrimination against them by serbs who are predominantly 
christian 
since the mine action began 150 strikers have asked for medical 
help and 16 have been hospitalized the tanjug news agency said 
a provincial spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity today 
denied reports published thursday that 17 people had already been 
hospitalized he said a medical facility had been set up at the site

changes in the republics constitution that would give serbia 
sovereignty over its provinces kosovo and vojvodina and increase 
the republics powers over defense and state security tanjug 
reported 
however the ammendments must also be approved by the assemblies 
of kosovo and vojvodina before they can be enforced 
on thursday yugoslav raif dizdarevic was quoted by tanjug as 
saying that constitutional changes would not endanger any 
nationality in yugoslavia 
dizdarevic met thursday evening with representatives of the 
striking miners and appealed to them to leave the pits and begin 
talks with authorities over their demands

increases today in the discount and prime lending 
rates which make borrowing more expensive are a direct outcome of 
the federal reserves attempt to crack down on inflation economists 
say 
the nations central bank is trying to slow down the economy and 
crush inflation by draining reserves from the banking system that 
has boosted shortterm interest rates although longterm rates have 
risen relatively little 
the federal reserve today raised its discount rate which it 
charges on loans to member banks to 7 percent from 65 percent its 
highest level since april 1986 
major banks already had begun raising their prime rate a 
benchmark for a wide range of consumer and business loans to 115 
percent from 11 percent effective today that move was made in 
response to the recent rise in shortterm interest rates which 
increases the banks own costs of borrowing 
chase manhattan bank and republic national bank of new york 
announced the increases thursday chemical bank manufacturers 
hanover trust co citibank and other major banks followed suit 
today 
the increase in the prime rate is more significant to businesses 
and consumers because of its direct effect on loan rates such as 
adjustablerate mortgages the discount rate is relatively little 
used and the latest increase only partially catches it up with 
increases in other rates 
the prime is at its highest level since november 1984 in the 
past year the rate has jumped 3 percentage points the most recent 
rise to 11 percent from 105 percent was on feb 10 
banks are passing along higher rates because their own cost of 
funds has risen and demand for loans remains strong said alan lenz 
director of trade and economics for the chemical manufacturers 
association 
the prime rate is like any other price its set by both supply 
and demand theyre going to get the best price they can lenz 
said 
chase said it was reacting to rises in other rates not 
anticipating them when it raised its prime rate 
the primes a laggard rate said fraser seitel a senior vice 
president 
on wednesday the labor department reported that consumer prices 
rose in january at an annual rate of 72 percent the highest in two 
years 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan called the inflation 
trend disturbing and vowed to keep upward pressure on rates until 
the pinch succeeds in squeezing inflation out of the economy 
since february 1988 the federal funds rate has jumped by more 
than 3 percentage points this rate the interest on overnight loans 
between banks is closely controlled by the federal reserve 
the fed drained reserves from the banking system on thursday 
seemingly indicating that it wants to keep the federal funds rate 
somewhere between 95 percent and 975 percent said giulio martini 
an economist at the investment firm sanford c bernstein amp co in 
new york 
banks typically set their prime rate about 2 percentage points 
above the federal funds rate which would translate to a prime of 
115 percent to 1175 percent martini said 
this is essentially a correctly placed prime martini said 
increases in rates have not slowed the economy much so far one 
reason is that longterm rates have not risen much because investors 
have been confident of the feds determination to control inflation 
longterm rates edge up when investors begin to lose confidence 
in the fed and demand higher rates to compensate for expected 
inflation

an afghan guerrilla leader today 
called on other countries to recognize the interim government the 
insurgents formed for afghanistan and predicted the sovietbacked 
rulers in kabul will be overthrown 
sibghatullah mojaddidi who was recently elected president of the 
interim government also offered an amnesty for afghanistans 
communist government troops if they switch sides in the 10yearold 
civil war 
fellow guerrilla fighters based in iran today reportedly rejected 
the interim government the insurgents hope will take over if 
president najibs communist government falls in kabul 
at a news conference ending a stormy threeweek meeting of 
pakistanbased guerrillas mojaddidi said the guerrilla government 
would become functional inside afghanistan within a month god 
willing 
he asked foreign countries to recognize the proposed government 
and for the united nations to give it a general assembly seat 
the religious and political strains among the guerrillas were 
evident when their council elected mojaddidi considered a moderate 
among the moslem guerrillas as president and and rasul sayyaf a 
fundamentalist from the ittehadeislami guerrilla group as 
premier fundamentalist factions advocate a strict moslem system 
and moderates have favored a broadbased government in afghanistan 
embracing islam as its official religion 
afghan shiite guerrillas most of whom are in iran boycotted the 
440delegate council after the pakistanbased guerrillas the 
majority of whom are sunni moslem refused to give them the 
representation they sought 
tehran radio reported today that leaders of the smaller 
iranbased resistance rejected the appointment of the interim 
government saying they were denied representation to the council 
the radio quoted mohammad karim khalili spokesman for the 
iranbased alliance as saying we consider the formation of the 
interim government as one sided and cannot recognize it the 
report was monitored in cyprus 
the shiites afghanistans largest minority represent only 17 
percent of afghanistans population of 15 million but make up 40 
percent of the 5 million refugees who have fled to pakistan and iran 
moslem guerrillas have fought the government in kabul since the 
communists seized power in a violent 1978 coup soviet forces 
intervened in december 1979 
moscow withdrew its troops by feb 15 under a unmediated 
accord 
guerrilla and western observers have predicted kabul will fall 
within months in the absence of soviet forces but najib says his 
army is strong enough to withstand a guerrilla assault 
a western diplomatic source speaking in islamabad on condition 
he not be further identified said i think its too early to talk 
about recognition their first test will be to get a capital 
he said the first movement toward the worlds acceptance of the 
guerrilla government might be a derecognition of kabul 
communist forces heavily armed by the departing red army hold 
the capital and afghanistans key cities but insurgents backed 
mainly by pakistan and the united states reportedly control about 
90 percent of the countryside

oliver north suggested the nicaraguan rebels 
stage a suicide mission to destroy sovietmade helicopters 
before the sandinista government could decimate the contras a 
witness said today at the irancontra trial 
robert w owen testified that in november 1984 he delivered from 
north to contra leader adolfo calero maps and photographs of the 
managua airport where the helicopters were being assembled 
before leaving washington for central america owen said north 
outlined his proposal for attacking the soviet hind helicopters 
which had been delivered to the airport outside nicaraguas capital 
owen described the armorclad hind helicopter as the most 
dangerous helicopter in the world north was concerned if these 
weapons these platforms were targeted against the nicaraguan 
resistance it would decimate it owen said 
the helicopter used by the soviets in afghanistan could put a 
bullet in every square inch of a football field in 10 seconds 
owen said 
north felt it would be in the best interests of the resistance 
if they could stage an attack on the airport and destroy the 
helicopters before they became operational said owen the third 
prosecution witness in the trial against north 
north envisioned it would be a suicide mission undertaken by 
the pilots who would not have enough fuel to return to their base 
owen said 
owen who is testifying under an immunity agreement with 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said he delivered the maps 
and photographs to calero during a trip he made to honduras later 
that month 
north is accused of among other things lying to congress when 
he denied giving the rebels tactical military advice while congress 
banned any us military assistance to the contras 
the ban took effect about a month before owen said he delivered 
the maps and photographs to calero and outlined the mission as 
proposed by north 
calero said he would discuss the proposal with rebel pilots but 
he didnt make a commitment one way or another owen recalled 
several months earlier owen a former aide to thensen dan 
quayle rind now the vice president said he discussed with north 
a proposal to set up a nonprofit taxexempt foundation to raise 
humanitarian assistance for the contras after congress shut off us 
aid 
owen said he and north discussed the fact that such an 
organization couldnt be used to raise money for military goods 
north is also accused of conspiring to violate tax laws by 
setting up a taxexempt foundation to raise money to help arm the 
rebels 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel and former national 
security council aide is charged with 12 felony counts arising from 
his involvement in the irancontra affair 
in testimony on wednesday calero helped defense lawyers 
establish that norths close working relationship with the contras 
was an open secret in official washington despite the aid ban 
imposed by congress 
government officials particularly at the cia constantly 
referred the contras to north calero said 
if we had a request or some kind of a grievance they would 
say talk to ollie 
everybody knew we dealt with him in congress in the state 
department calero said for us he was the representative of 
the united states government he was our contact 
but calero conceded to prosecutors that he couldnt recall 
talking with reagan about the kind of help north was lending the 
contras 
calero said he had franker discussions with the late cia director 
william casey to whom he said he referred as uncle bill 
i was more explicit as to our situation and our problems with 
director casey than i ever was with the president the contra 
leader said 
calero testified he didnt expect that north would use any of the 
90000 for personal expenses but he said he never demanded an 
accounting because i had absolute trust in what colonel north was 
doing 
he was asked by sullivan if he ever complained to prosecutors 
that north had misappropriated any of the travelers checks you 
gave him 
not at all to any one calero replied to this day i 
believe he acted properly 
calero appeared to be a reluctant prosecution witness repeatedly 
telling keker he couldnt recall a 1985 meeting in norths office 
involving retired army gen john singlaub who helped the contras 
buy 5 million worth of weapons and arms dealer richard v secord 
a retired air force major general 
but under questioning by sullivan calero had little difficulty 
remembering details of meetings he and other contra leaders had with 
reagan at the white house which north had arranged 
sullivan showed the jury pictures of calero and the other contra 
leaders posing with reagan and thennational security adviser robert 
mcfarlane 
one picture of reagan posing with contra leaders was used by the 
rebels as clear evidence of the support of the president of the 
united states for the freedom fighters calero said 
another picture bore an inscription from reagan to calero that 
said your struggle for justice and democracy in nicaragua will 
prevail 
those were very heartfelt words calero said

sort of extended family so they could spend time with her while she 
is growing up the tampa tribune reported 
we feel that we should not be denied the right to know that 
girl as a child mrs twigg said 
the twiggs of langhorne pa say statements by a lawyer in 
their longstanding court battle suggesting they would seek custody 
of kimberly mays were part of his strategy they once considered it 
but later ruled it out 
you take a step back and say what is in the best interest of 
everybody involved mrs twigg told the tribune 
the twiggs maintain they brought the wrong child home from hardee 
memorial hospital in wauchula in 1978 and that robert and barbara 
mays took their child the girls were the only white female infants 
in the hospital at the time 
the child the twiggs raised named arlena died of a congenital 
heart defect last august they learned from blood tests that she was 
not their real daughter 
mays is fighting to block a genetic test the twiggs want 
performed to determine kimberlys parentage 
mrs twigg told the tribune on thursday that she decided to talk 
in part because of the growing public perception that she and her 
husband are being unfair to kimberly the twiggs say they have 
received hate mail comparing them to terrorists 
their eldest daughter irisa 20 was sneered at by a fellow 
member of a health club who learned her last name and said oh i 
know who you are 
irisa said she wants to know if she and kimberly are related 
maybe we could be friends one day and sisters after that she 
said 
mays a sarasota roofing supply salesman said in december that 
kimberly fears the twiggs will remove her from the only home she 
knows and that she inscribed a drawing she gave him for christmas 
i hate the twiggs i want them to go away 
mrs twigg says the ill will since the case has been in the 
limelight is undeserved she said she and her husband first 
considered seeking custody because they suspected mays participated 
in the alleged babyswap making him an unfit parent they say they 
changed their minds in part because there was no evidence to 
support that 
mays first wife barbara died of cancer in 1981 he remarried 
but was divorced 
the twiggs sued the hospital for 100 million they dropped the 
lawsuit late in 1988 on a technicality saying they planned to 
refile they are seeking genetic testing of kimberly in a separate 
lawsuit

oliver north suggested the nicaraguan rebels 
stage a suicide mission to destroy sovietmade helicopters 
before the sandinista government could decimate the contras a 
witness said today at the irancontra trial 
robert w owen testified that in november 1984 he delivered from 
north to contra leader adolfo calero maps and photographs of the 
managua airport where the helicopters were being assembled 
before leaving washington for central america owen said north 
outlined his proposal for attacking the soviet hind helicopters 
which had been delivered to the airport outside nicaraguas capital 
owen described the armorclad hind helicopter as the most 
dangerous helicopter in the world north was concerned if these 
weapons these platforms were targeted against the nicaraguan 
resistance it would decimate it owen said 
the helicopter used by the soviets in afghanistan could put a 
bullet in every square inch of a football field in 10 seconds 
owen said 
north felt it would be in the best interests of the resistance 
if they could stage an attack on the airport and destroy the 
helicopters before they became operational said owen the third 
prosecution witness in the trial against north 
north envisioned it would be a suicide mission undertaken by 
the pilots who would not have enough fuel to return to their base 
owen said 
owen who is testifying under an immunity agreement with 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said he delivered the maps 
and photographs to calero during a trip he made to honduras later 
that month 
north is accused of among other things lying to congress when 
he denied giving the rebels tactical military advice while congress 
banned any us military assistance to the contras 
the ban took effect about a month before owen said he delivered 
the maps and photographs to calero and outlined the mission as 
proposed by north 
calero said he would discuss the proposal with rebel pilots but 
he didnt make a commitment one way or another owen recalled 
several months earlier owen a former aide to thensen dan 
quayle rind now the vice president said he discussed with north 
a proposal to set up a nonprofit taxexempt foundation to raise 
humanitarian assistance for the contras after congress shut off us 
aid 
owen said he and north discussed the fact that such an 
organization couldnt be used to raise money for military goods 
north is also accused of conspiring to violate tax laws by 
setting up a taxexempt foundation to raise money to help arm the 
rebels 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel and former national 
security council aide is charged with 12 felony counts arising from 
his involvement in the irancontra affair 
in testimony on thursday calero helped defense lawyers establish 
that norths close working relationship with the contras was an open 
secret in official washington despite the aid ban imposed by 
congress 
government officials particularly at the cia constantly 
referred the contras to north calero said 
if we had a request or some kind of a grievance they would 
say talk to ollie 
everybody knew we dealt with him in congress in the state 
department calero said for us he was the representative of 
the united states government he was our contact 
but calero conceded to prosecutors that he couldnt recall 
talking with reagan about the kind of help north was lending the 
contras 
calero said he had franker discussions with the late cia director 
william casey to whom he said he referred as uncle bill 
i was more explicit as to our situation and our problems with 
director casey than i ever was with the president the contra 
leader said 
calero testified he didnt expect that north would use any of the 
90000 for personal expenses but he said he never demanded an 
accounting because i had absolute trust in what colonel north was 
doing 
he was asked by sullivan if he ever complained to prosecutors 
that north had misappropriated any of the travelers checks you 
gave him 
not at all to any one calero replied to this day i 
believe he acted properly 
calero appeared to be a reluctant prosecution witness repeatedly 
telling keker he couldnt recall a 1985 meeting in norths office 
involving retired army gen john singlaub who helped the contras 
buy 5 million worth of weapons and arms dealer richard v secord 
a retired air force major general 
but under questioning by sullivan calero had little difficulty 
remembering details of meetings he and other contra leaders had with 
reagan at the white house which north had arranged 
sullivan showed the jury pictures of calero and the other contra 
leaders posing with reagan and thennational security adviser robert 
mcfarlane 
one picture of reagan posing with contra leaders was used by the 
rebels as clear evidence of the support of the president of the 
united states for the freedom fighters calero said 
another picture bore an inscription from reagan to calero that 
said your struggle for justice and democracy in nicaragua will 
prevail 
those were very heartfelt words calero said

the number of women appointed to statelevel 
cabinet positions by governors has increased more than 15 percent in 
two years the national womens political caucus said today 
the group released its study of governors appointments and said 
that since 1981 the number of women appointed to such posts has 
increased 114 percent 
our new study confirms that the message of womens abilities 
and political savvy is being heard by goverors of both parties and 
in all regions of the country said irene natividad head of the 
bipartisan womens political organization 
the survey rated the 50 governors based on the percentage of 
women appointed to their cabinets ranked first was virginias 
democratic gov gerald baliles whose 7 cabinet posts include three 
women or 43 percent 
ranked last was missouris republican gov john h ashcroft who 
has no women in his cabinet 
natividad said ashcroft is out of synch with the rest of the 
states and has not recognized the political and leadership talents 
of women 
the group said 150 women hold the state jobs in 1989 up from 70 
in 1981 and 130 in 1987 
she said there appeared to be no difference between republican 
and democratic governors in appointing women four of the top 10 
governors in the groups rankings were republicans 
after baliles the governors with the most appointed women in 
cabinet jobs were maryland gov william d schaefer arkansas gov 
bill clinton wisconsin gov tommy g thompson vermont gov 
madeleine kunin illinois gov james r thompson new jersey gov

a lebanese shiite moslem was 
sentenced to life imprisonment today for the 1987 hijack of an air 
afrique jetliner in which he killed a french passenger and seriously 
wounded a flight attendant 
switzerlands highest court convicted hussein hariri on all seven 
charges against him including murder attempted murder and 
hostagetaking 
the 22yearold hariri who previously said a life sentence would 
be no problem rose from his chair but showed no emotion when 
the verdict was read he will be eligible for parole in 15 years 
the ruling by the fivemember federal criminal court followed a 
fourday trial in which the prosecution called hariri a killer 
blinded by conviction 
defense attorneys had sought a conviction on the lesser charge of 
manslaughter claiming hariri acted on reflex when he fatally shot 
xavier beaulieu 28 they said testimony did not disprove their 
contention that the victim had made a threatening move 
hariri was also ordered to pay damages of 556000 to air afrique 
and a total of 101000 to beaulieus family the flight attendent 
and a second passenger he threatened 
hariri commandeered an air afrique dc10 on a flight from 
brazzaville congo to paris on july 24 1987 to press demands for 
the release of lebanese and palestinians held by france west 
germany and israel 
after gaining control of the plane over northern italy he 
demanded to be flown to beirut but agreed to a refueling stop at 
geneva airport hariri shot beaulieu after his deadline for readying 
the plane expired 
swiss police stormed the plane and arrested the lone hijacker 
after crew members overpowered him and passengers began fleeing the 
aircraft over safety chutes 
flight attendant jeanpierre elouma was seriously injured by a 
shot from hariris pistol when he jumped the hijacker 
investigators said hariri boarded the plane at bangui central 
african republic carrying 140 rounds of ammunition and 19 ounces of 
explosives 
hariri refused to testify in court about his alleged links to the 
proiranian hezbollah group lebanons most militant faction 
presiding judge jeanjacques leu said hariri told pretrial 
interrogators that he joined hezbollah in 1985 after his release 
from an israeli prison 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most 
of the 15 foreign hostages in lebanon which include nine americans 
the longestheld foreign hostage is terry a anderson 41 chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
hariri had told interrogators he received detailed instructions 
for his mission 
swiss officials said his demands during negotiations at geneva 
airport included the release of the hamadi brothers two lebanese 
arrested in west germany as terror suspects 
one of them mohammed ali hamadi has been on trial in frankfurt 
since last july on charges linked to the 1985 hijack of a twa 
airliner to beirut in which a us navy diver was killed 
hariri told the court he did not intend to kill beaulieu but that 
he fired without aiming when the frenchman his head covered with a 
blanket made a threatening move 
i did not want to kill anyone i only wanted to liberate my 
friends said hariri who described himself as a soldier of 
god 
but the flight steward told the court he saw hariri kill beaulieu 
with a closerange shot to the head 
hariri acknowledged he paid a bribe equivalent to about 6 to 
elude police controls at the airport in bangui where his father 
reportedly had a business 
he was expected to be returned to the maximum security wing of 
genevas champdollon jail after sentencing 
the hariri case gained wider dimensions with the kidnap of a 
swiss red cross delegate in lebanon last november 
swiss foreign minister rene felber said the abduction was aimed 
gaining leniency for hariri the delegate of the allswiss 
international committee of the red cross peter winkler was 
released after a month in the hands of captors who were never 
identified switzerland said no concessions were made

emperor hirohito met today with top japanese leaders and told them 
not to distort their nations militaristic past a government source 
said 
japanese prime minister noboru takeshita told parliament last 
week it was unclear whether japan had been an aggressor in world war 
ii and that historians would have to judge japans role 
the comments drew criticism from china and other asian countries 
which suffered a brutal occupation by japan before and during the 
war 
some of those nations continued their criticism today with 
demonstrations and newspaper editorials 
foreign minister qian qichen of china meanwhile met separately

during the meetings qian stressed that there are sensitive 
topics between china and japan and that it is necessary to come up 
with the correct interpretation of past history a senior japanese 
foreign ministry official said on condition of anonymity 
no distortion should take place regarding the past because that 
would hurt the feelings of the chinese people and should be 
avoided the official quoted qian as telling uno 
qian met takeshita in a hastily arranged courtesy call one 
ministry official said the two did not discuss the japanese 
leaders comments according to a ministry summary of their talks 
uno told qian that takeshitas comments did not represent a 
change in japanese policy toward the war and he expressed regret 
that neighboring countries had misunderstood the prime 
ministers intention ministry officials said qian also was quoted 
as saying that relations between japan and china were in good 
shape and progressing

an 11yearold pregnant girl was 
transferred from one hospital to another with her legs taped 
together to delay delivery but both her premature twins died 
authorities said 
the florida department of health and rehabilitative services has 
investigated the case and found that no laws were broken 
but despite the finding duncan moore president and chief 
executive officer at tallahassee memorial regional medical center 
said thursday that he believed the treatment of the girl violated 
state and federal laws 
officials at tallahassee community hospital said doctors at their 
hospital taped the girls legs to protect her because she was not 
willing or able to keep her legs together as complications of her 
pregnancy required 
they then put her in an ambulance and sent her to memorial which 
has more advanced facilities for neonatal care 
one of the girls babies was born dead at 6 ounces and the other 
died soon after birth at 9 ounces the girl had been 21 to 24 weeks 
pregnant 
communitys administrator nick carbone accused memorial 
hospital officials of pulling a stunt to try to discredit his 
hospital 
this was absolutely the best medical thing you could do said 
rheb harbison spokesman for community hospital theyre trying to 
sensationalize this case 
but community officials acknowledged that the girl should not 
have been sent alone in the ambulance on jan 9 from their hospital 
to memorial and said that a nurse will accompany any patients 
transferred in the future 
the two hospitals also disagreed on whether the girl was in 
active labor when community sent her to memorial doctors at the 
state department of health and rehabilitative services a 
physicians peerreview organization and officials at the federal 
health care financing administration all found she was not harbison 
said 
but even if she had been we still could have transferred her 
if the benefits outweighed the risks he said 
moore however said it was obvious that the girl had been in 
labor

the t issues taiwan tibet trade and 
technology transfer are on the table when president bush sips tea 
with chinese leaders this weekend 
bushs twoday visit to beijing starting saturday was to stress 
the positive aspects of sinoamerican relations that have developed 
since the two nations established diplomatic ties 10 years ago 
bush who headed the us liaison office in beijing for more than 
a year in 197475 was to be given an effusive welcome as an old 
friend of china 
but the first bilateral summit since president reagan visited in 
1984 also offers both sides a chance to vent some touchy issues and 
discuss the quickly improving ties between china and its longtime 
adversary the soviet union 
theyll be lightly skipping over a number of issues rather than 
boring in on one issue said one us official who spoke on 
condition he not be named 
among the issues 
taiwan chinese leaders insist that taiwan remains the most 
serious problem in sinous relations beijing says washington 
should play a more active role in bringing about a peaceful 
reunification of taiwan with the mainland and condemns continued 
us arms sales to the nationalist government on taiwan estimated 
at 700 million in 1987 
some prominent americans still cling to the hope of longterm 
control of taiwan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier guo 
xiangzhi of the taiwan research institute in the academy of social 
sciences wrote in a recent article 
the united states has welcomed the lessening of tensions across 
the taiwan straits in the past several years particularly taiwans 
decision to ease travel and trade restrictions with the mainland 
but it says the taiwan question is one for the chinese to solve 
themselves 
taiwanese groups in the united states have urged bush to back 
selfdetermination for taiwan when he meets deng xiaoping and other 
chinese leaders the taiwan government has expressed concern that 
china will push bush into a mediator role 
tibet the united states supports chinese claims to sovereignty 
over tibet but has concerns over alleged human rights violations in 
chinas suppression of proindependence disturbances in tibet over 
the past 18 months 
china rejects criticisms of its human rights record and says 
us congressional resolutions on tibet are unwarranted interference 
in its internal affairs 
it is regrettable that a few people in the united states still 
make unfair criticism on chinas internal affairs and even want 
chinas affairs to be done according to their will chinas us 
ambassador han xu said recently 
technology transfer china is the only nation classified as 
friendly and nonallied by the us export control system which 
is also subject to national security and cocom controls when 
acquiring technology with potential military uses 
both the united states and the 16nation cocom coordinating 
committee on multilateral export control which oversees exports to 
communist states have moved to reduce the list of items which must 
be reviewed before being sold to china but china which badly needs 
western technology for its modernization drive says liberalization 
of exports has been too slow 
this has not only inflicted losses on china but also tied the 
hands of american enterprises and weakened their competitiveness in 
the chinese market vice foreign minister zhu qichen said 
the united states for several months last year froze further 
liberalization of export restrictions in reaction to chinese arms 
sales to iran 
trade bilateral trade soared to about 135 billion last year 
up from 10 billion in 1987 according to us figures but china 
accuses the united states of protectionism particularly against 
chinese textiles and the united states complains about lack of 
adequate protection for copyrights 
the united states supports chinas application to the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade but is urging china to first further 
reform its trading system to make its goods more competitive and 
less dependent on government subsidies 
international issues bush said his visit is not meant to 
upstage soviet leader mikhail gorbachev who comes to beijing in may 
for the first sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
us officials also say they welcome the normalization of 
longstrained sinosoviet relations which will allow both nations 
to concentrate on economic reform the chinese say their improved 
relations with the soviets will not affect sinoamerican ties 
the united states and china both oppose vietnams occupation of 
cambodia bush is likely to ask the chinese to ensure that 
withdrawal of vietnamese troops from cambodia will not lead to the 
khmer rouges return to power 
thirtyone us congress members asked bush in a letter to urge 
china to stop aiding the khmer rouge the khmer rouge are blamed for 
the deaths of 1 million of their countrymen during their bloody 
197578 rule over the country 
china has said it will cease aiding the khmer rouge when vietnam 
ends its 10year military presence in cambodia 
bush and the chinese leaders are also likely to discuss tensions 
on the korean peninsula china is close to the communist north and 
the united states has troops in south korea 
the middle east central america and the future of chinas 
marketoriented reforms as it tries to overcome economic overheating 
and inflation also were expected to be dealt with

at the women of hope a permanent shelter for impoverished women 
most of whom are mentally ill the three listened as about 16 
residents complained about the lack of affordable housing and jobs 
for unskilled workers 
while we sit here in this room tonight many of our sisters and 
brothers are out in the freezing cold said sister mary scullion 
the roman catholic nun who runs the women of hope 
philadelphia the nations fifth largest city has a homeless 
population estimated at 10000 
sister scullion told kemp that more federal emphasis and money 
are needed to lift the burden of the homeless from cities and to 
provide more affordable housing for lowincome citizens 
we want you to go tour and to talk but more importantly 
the answer to helping is what happens when you go back to 
washington she said 
kemp told reporters he had come to philadelphia to talk with 
folks and to listen to learn about the problems to see what 
theyve done and what i can do to be a catalyst to make an impact 
make a difference in this problem 
its a very human real problem that exists and its a national 
tragedy and george bush wants me to not only inventory the problem 
but inventory some of the answers said kemp who plans to visit 
other cities to examine their housing problems 
hayes who is acting as a tour guide called kemps visit a 
nonideological novices composite tour with as little time as 
possible spent in offices with politicians 
kemp heinz and specter stopped at a cityrun shelter for 
homeless men where most of the approximately 75 men sitting in 
plastic chairs seemed more concerned with getting a bed than talking 
to political leaders 
its hard to get in here man said nathaniel white 42 
they call your name once if you dont hear your name called 
forget it 
earlier in the day kemp visited a soup kitchen and a homeless 
shelter in baltimore at the viva house shelter he told residents 
that he came as an advocate for their needs not as an adversary 
we want to make some changes he said 
viva house director brendan walsh told kemp that programs for the 
homeless suffered during the reagan administration so much money 
has gone to the military that the federal housing budget has been 
cut from 31 billion to 7 billion walsh said 
thats why im here kemp answered i want to find some 
answers to the problem of homelessness

the defense minister has proposed a 
series of austerity measures in return for a government pledge not 
to cut the defense budget below the current level of about 265 
billion a year 
the proposals including the withdrawal of 1400 troops in west 
germany and restructuring of armed forces units wont undermine 
belgiums commitment to nato said defense minister guy coeme 
the structural reforms of armed forces units such as 
combining and scaling down some air force squadrons closing a naval 
base and a navy training school and pulling 1400 of belgiums 
27000 troops back from west germany will be discussed with the 
allies he said 
the number of troops to be withdrawn was low enough so as not to 
be interpreted negatively by the allies coeme said 
he said his proposals would save at least 51 million a year 
the philosophy of our approach is that we will concentrate on our 
traditional strong points like moinesweeping and antitank 
capabilities 
coeme urged against further cuts in belgiums annual defense 
budget it amounts to 265 billion this year 
belgiums defense efforts have long been a source of criticism 
according to alliance figures belgium spent 34 percent of its 
gross national product on defense in 1980 which has since only 
declined

governors are appointing record numbers of 
women to their state cabinets more than doubling the total of eight 
years ago a womens political group said friday 
the national womens political caucus called for the federal 
government to follow suit 
the group said its survey of the 50 states found 150 women in top 
appointed posts with gains for women coming in all regions and 
among governors of both parties 
it credited the governors with taking the lead in the appointment 
of women and said in a report clearly this is an area in which 
the federal government can learn a great deal from the states 
labor secretary elizabeth dole is the only woman heading one of the 
bush administrations 14 cabinet departments 
the number of women in state cabinet posts is up from 70 in 1981 
and 130 in 1987 the group said women now hold 21 percent of all 
state cabinet jobs nationwide 
no doubt about it the nations governors with few exceptions 
are recognizing that qualified savvy and experienced women have 
joined the poitical landscape irene natividad head of the 
bipartisan womens political group said at a news conference 
but she added we look forward to the time when such studies 
as this are no longer needed 
the survey released a ppeared to be no difference between republican 
and democratic governors in appointing women four of the top 10 
governors in the groups rankings were republicans 
after baliles the governors with the most appointed women in 
cabinet jobs were william d schaefer of maryland bill clinton of 
arkansas tommy g thompson of wisconsin madeleine kunin of 
vermont james r thompson of illinois thomas h kean of new 
jersey henry bellmon of oklahoma buddy roemer of louisiana and 
richard f celeste of ohio tommy thompson james thompson kean and 
bellmon are republicans the others are democrats 
noting the high ranking of several southern governors natividad 
said i think we can safely say that the old stereotype that 
southern politicians are resistant to change has effectively been 
broken 
she also said that while women first made gains by appointment to 
administrative or healthrelated posts they now are increasingly 
being appointed to jobs formerly associated with men including 
those dealing with water energy and natural resources she said 
natividad suggested the groups survey which it has released in 
past years with providing pressure by comparision on governors 
the study commended new mexico gov garey carruthers a republican 
with only one woman cabinet appointee in 1987 for recruiting two 
additional women to his cabinet since then

no decison has been made on how to squeeze 2 
billion out of farm programs to meet federal spending goals but 
analysts are looking at all possibilities agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said friday 
well find a way to do so because thats a requirement of the 
budget process yeutter told reporters agriculture will have 
to play its part in that process 
he added well look everywhere obviously itll have to be 
done on the basis of economic analysis were not going to do it in 
an arbitrary or capricious way and that means analyzing all the 
options and combinations of options 
about 2 billion will have to be whittled from programs in the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 those cuts were not specified in the 
budget proposals submitted by the outgoing reagan administration in 
january and were left open to be negotiated with congress 
yeutter served for 3 years as us trade representative in the 
reagan administration before president bush tapped him to be 
secretary of agriculture 
no senior aides to yeutter at the agriculture department have yet 
been announced by the white house and key jobs are still being 
carried out by holdovers from the reagan administration 
however yeutter said at a news conference that he was hopeful an 
announcement would be made soon on the no 2 post of deputy 
secretary probably within the next few days 
reports circulated last week that yeutter and some presidential 
aides had been bickering over filling the deputy secretary job with 
yeutter favoring jack parnell the california agricultural 
commissioner or sam hollis a cotton warehouseman from memphis 
tenn 
but there were claims that white house pressure had developed for 
former kentucky governor louie nunn who told the associated press 
that he had been interviewed by yeutter several weeks earlier 
yeutter said that the reports of his bickering with the white 
house were completely false and that there had been no 
disagreement whatsoever with the white house 
options for cutting usda farm program spending include further 
reductions in target prices for major crops including wheat corn 
and cotton those are prices used in a formula to help determine 
federal subsidies to farmers who participate in annual crop programs

president bush is meeting the four men who guide 
modern china and its communist party during his twoday visit 
starting saturday 
two of them top leader deng xiaoping and president yang 
shangkun are octogenarians representatives of the old guard of 
preliberation revolutionaries 
the other two communist party general secretary zhao ziyang and 
premier li peng are younger leaders concerned less with ideology 
and more with guiding chinas 1 billion people toward a 21st century 
of economic prosperity 
deng xiaoping 84 is the architect of chinas bold experiments 
in economic reform he holds no official position except chairman of 
the central military commission but no one questions deng is the 
man in charge 
a former red army comissar who helped lead the communists to 
victory in 1949 deng is a survivor of mao tsetungs political wars 
who has spent the past decade undoing much of maos ideological 
heritage 
deng was purged during the leftist 196676 cultural revolution as 
a capitalist roader but battled his way back after maos death 
in 1976 by the end of the 1970s he was chinas undisputed leader 
deng rejected maos concept of the primacy of class struggle and 
made economic development his top priority in the past decade he 
has abolished the commune revived the family farm and encouraged 
private enterprise 
he has also promoted the stillunfinished tasks of freeing 
factory managers from bureaucratic interference creating a price 
system based on market forces rather than government dictum and 
forging a welltrained mobile labor force 
deng has tolerated slow expansion of intellectual and artistic 
freedoms and has encouraged increased contacts with the outside 
world particularly the west in 1979 he toured the united states to 
mark the establishment of uschina relations but politically his 
instincts are conservative several times he has cracked down on 
political dissent when he felt it threatened the supremacy of the 
party or the nations stability 
yang shangkun 81 became chinas fourth president or head of 
state in april last year 
yang like deng was born in sichuan province and played an 
active role in red army campaigns of the 1930s and 1940s purged 
during the cultural revolution the career military man returned to 
public office in the late 1970s and in 1982 was appointed permanent 
vice chairman of the central military commission 
as senior military officer on the commission he backed dengs 
1985 decision to end the wartime footing of the army and cut 1 
million troops from the force of more than 4 million 
the post of president is largely ceremonial and yang is not 
thought to be an initiator of policy but he does have a voice 
because of his close ties to deng and his seat on the 17member 
party politburo chinas top decisionmaking body 
zhao ziyang 69 for the past decade has been chinas leading 
advocate of speed and boldness in initiating economic reforms 
he made his reputation as party secretary and governor of sichuan 
in the late 1970s when he led the nation in highly successful 
experiments in restoring family farming 
in 1980 deng brought him to beijing and he was quickly named 
premier a post he held until 1987 
zhao became acting general secretary of the communist party in 
january 1987 following the ouster of fellow reformist hu yaobang 
who was blamed for prodemocracy student unrest he officially took 
over chinas most powerful post the following november 
zhao known for his immaculately tailored western suits his 
cosmopolitan manner and his love for golf has been widely regarded 
as the man most likely to succeed deng as chinas senior leader 
however there have also been persistent reports publicly denied 
by chinese officials that zhaos stature has suffered during 
chinas recent economic woes 
zhao reportedly has been criticized for pushing decentralization 
and price reforms too quickly contributing to the outofcontrol 
pace of industrial growth and inflation of more than 20 percent 
zhao now has joined the more cautious premier li peng in backing 
a twoyear slowdown in reform while the government tries to restore 
eocnomic growth to a manageable level 
li 60 in april completes his first full year as premier or 
head of government an electrical engineer who studied in the soviet 
union in the 1950s li represents the new breed of technocrats now 
filling the ranks of the chinese government 
li has tried with only limited sucess to shake off the 
impression that he is a conservative who opposes zhaos efforts to 
move quickly in introducing marketoriented reforms 
he consistently supports the reforms but with the qualifier that 
they not be implemented at a speed that will threaten economic or 
social stability 
li appeared to have gained the upper hand last september when the 
government announced its twoyear hold on reforms and said central 
authorities would reimpose controls in such areas as banking and 
foreign trade 
li a native of sichuan was cared for by the late premier chou 
enlai after his father was killed by the nationalists when li was 3 
years old he joined the party at age 17 
after returning from six years in the soviet union in 1954 he 
held a number of important engineering posts and was named minister 
of power industry in 1979 he was appointed vice premier in 1983 and 
served as education minister from 1985 
li along with zhao is a member of the fivemember politburo 
standing committee the pinnacle of power within the party

they came to mourn emperor hirohito but world 
leaders used the gathering for a flurry of minisummits on issues 
ranging from middle east peace and the furor over the satanic 
verses to just getting acquainted 
with japan turning out to be the stage for funeral diplomacy 
the worlds attention converged on tokyo the liberalleaning 
asahi shimbun said in an editorial saying japan should strive to 
enhance our international trust 
the agreement between china and indonesia to normalize relations 
suspended 22 years ago was the biggest result of the tokyo talks 
it came from a meeting thursday between president suharto of 
indonesia and chinese foreign minister qian qichen the long freeze 
had resulted from indonesian allegations that china backed a 1965 
communist coup attempt against the jakarta government 
the middle east figured in president bushs meetings with 
jordans king hussein egyptian president hosni mubarak israeli 
president chaim herzog and french president francois mitterrand 
white house officials said bushs meetings in tokyo most lasting 
no more than 30 minutes mainly were general discussions and were 
not intended to delve into detail but us secretary of state james 
a baker iii said there are perhaps some opportunities out there 
with respect to the middle east peace process that havent existed 
before 
mubarak and hussein who had conferred at home with soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze on middle east peace efforts 
met in tokyo spokesmen said they also agreed that recent diplomatic 
efforts have brought the middle east closer to peace 
mubarak conferred with herzog but they reportedly were unable to 
reduce differences over a proposed international peace conference 
there were delegations from 163 nations at fridays funeral and 
the soviets were among the first to arrive they quickly took up 
efforts to improve relations with tokyo which insists that any 
substantial warming must await the return of a group of islands off 
northern japan occupied by the soviets since the end of world war ii 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe sought japans 
support for his countrys condemnation of irans death threat 
against salman rushdie the author of the satanic verses a 
japanese foreign ministry official said japan foreign minister 
sousuke uno opposed any international leader advocating murder but 
said japan had no plans to withdraw its ambassador in iran 
howe dined friday with the chinese foreign minister for 
discussions on hong kong the british colony that is to return to 
chinese rule in 1997 
japanese prime minister noboru takeshita had meetings set with at 
least three dozen foreign dignitaries and an unscheduled talk 
friday with chinas qian who also met with uno 
foreign ministry officials said that qian and uno discussed 
takeshitas remarks last week that it would be up to historians to 
decide whether japan was an aggressor in world war ii qian did not 
discuss the issue with takeshita 
no distortion should take place regarding the past because that 
would hurt the feelings of the chinese people and should be 
avoided one official quoted qian as telling uno 
uno told qian that takeshitas real intention was misunderstood 
the officials said after earlier protests in china japanese 
officials said japan was not trying to deny the suffering it had 
inflicted on its neighbors 
bush met with philippine president corazon aquino and assured her 
of us support and noted that his administration is asking congress 
for 200 million in aid for her country white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said 
aid also figured in takeshitas talks with brazilian president 
jose sarney foreign ministry sources said takeshita promised to 
send a mission to brazil to consider its request for new credits 
that could total more than 1 billion 
on friday uno and baker took up the usjapan agreement on 
joint development of japans next fighter plane which some american 
congressmen say would mean transferring sophisticated us 
technology to potential competitors in japan japan denies that

minister benazir bhutto of pakistan west german president richard

the cost of cleaning up radioactive and toxic 
wastes at the governments 12state nuclear weapons complex is 
likely to exceed the official 63 billion estimate a senior energy 
department official told congress on friday 
raymond p berube deputy assistant secretary for environment 
said a firm estimate for cleanup costs was not yet possible because 
the department is uncertain how badly the environment has been 
damaged at many of the weapons plants 
theres a strong chance that these costs will go higher than 
63 billion he said adding that projected costs are likely to 
escalate as more detailed information is learned about the extent of 
the soil and groundwater contamination 
theres a lot of uncertainty at this point he told a house 
armed services subcommittee 
berube said that while contamination at some sites could be 
cleaned up in two or three years work at the most polluted plants 
will require decades to complete 
he cited the pinellas plant near largo fla which makes 
electronic components for nuclear weapons as a likely candidate for 
speedy cleanup in part because the vinyl chloride contamination 
there is less far flung and is not radioactive 
among the most difficult cleanup jobs will be at the hanford 
reservation near richland wash which berube said is the most 
polluted site in the entire complex and the savannah river plant 
near aiken sc which produces a highly radioactive gas there has 
been extensive contamination of soil and groundwater at these sites 
dating back to the early years of operation in the 1950s 
key elements of the weapons complex including parts of savannah 
river hanford and the rocky flats plutonium processing plant in 
colorado have been closed down by the energy department in recent 
months because of safety and technical problems 
an energy department report issued last month said it would cost 
52 billion to modernize the weapons complex and another 29 
billion to clean it up over the next 21 years the department has 
said the cleanup cost eventually would range up to 63 billion plus 
another 2 billion to 4 billion for decommissioning and 
decontaminating parts of the complex that are permanently shut down 
an official of the general accounting office the investigating 
arm of congress reiterated the gaos position that some of the 
weapons plants are so badly polluted that they may never be cleaned 
up he did not specify these plants 
in the final analysis some areas within the complex may be 
irreversibly contaminated j dexter peach gaos assistant 
comptroller general told the house panel as a result he said 
these sites may simply be sealed off and never used again 
rep david e skaggs dcolo said sealing off sites would 
amount to creating national sacrifice zones which he called 
utterly unacceptable 
skaggs whose district includes the rocky flats weapons plant 
called on the energy department to speed up dramatically its 
efforts to identify all the contamination problems and to clean them 
up 
our national defense and the future of the nuclear weapons 
complex itself will be very much at risk if that full cleanup is not 
undertaken he said 
peach also criticized the energy department for having failed to 
develop a comprehensive plan for cleaning up the nuclear waste 
despite having been urged by the gao to do so three years ago 
recent doe plans and reports have shed considerable light on 
the problems doe faces however none of them taken individually or 
collectively provide an overall comprehensive environmental 
strategy peach said 
berube told the hearing that president bushs designated energy 
secretary james d watkins was intent on moving quickly to develop 
a fiveyear action plan based on currently available information 
for cleaning up and modernizing the weapons complex

flutes wailed in a misty forest friday as japan 
buried emperor hirohito who reigned for 62 years through 
militarism ruin and the undreamed prosperity that sprang from it 
kings leaders or representatives of 163 countries were present 
to pay their respects making the 74 million funeral of the 
87yearold emperor the largest international gathering in modern 
history 
blackrobed court musicians and attendants carrying shields 
pikes and banners of yellow and white preceded the emperors coffin 
to the mausoleum at hachioji 30 miles west of tokyo in the rites 
that marked the end of an era 
an official carried white shoes that tradition says the emperor 
will wear to heaven hirohito was considered divine when he became 
emperor descended like his ancestors from the sun goddess but he 
renounced divinity after the crushing defeat of world war ii 
his coffin was placed on a cart pulled 100 feet up a slope 
lowered into a stone tomb dug into the hillside and sealed in with 
concrete by flickering torchlight in the evening mist the imperial 
family made offerings to his spirit 
the newspaper yomiuri said objects buried with the emperor 
included the microscope he used in 50 years of research as a 
respected marine biologist and a list of rankings of wrestlers in 
the traditional sport of sumo of which he was an avid fan palace 
officials would not confirm the report 
kyodo news service said hirohito was laid to rest in a white silk 
kimono but that a western suit and tie his customary dress were 
buried with him 
a 72yearold farmer slashed his abdomen with a kitchen knife in 
an attempt at ritual suicide beside a war memorial on the southern 
island of kyushu leaving a note that he wanted to follow his 
emperor in death he was reported in serious condition 
mayor hitoshi motoshima of nagasaki one of two japanese cities 
on which atomic bombs were dropped said the orations at hirohitos 
funeral sounded as if they were avoiding reality the impression 
was that he existed only after the war 
nagasaki police said a letter containing a bullet and a death 
threat was delivered to motoshima on wednesday after he said the 
emperor bore some responsibility for world war ii 
a bomb exploded in an embankment about 20 minutes before the 
funeral motorcade passed on its way to the burial ground scattering 
dirt on the road but injuring no one it was the only violent 
incident reported in a day of ceremonies guarded by 32000 police 
officers 
earlier in the day 51 men in the court robes and headgear of 
ancient japan carried hirohitos coffin on a bambooscreened litter 
to a funeral hall of unvarnished cypress wood in the shinjuku 
imperial gardens musicians played a dirge on pipes flutes drum 
and gong 
after several eulogies president bush and other foreign 
dignitaries walked to the coffin and bowed slightly to pay final 
respects 
for the more than 60 years of your reign you shared in the 
peoples joys and sorrows emperor akihito said in a farewell 
address to his father who died of cancer jan 7 
akihito 55 was dressed in black tie tails and a black silk top 
hat he marched in the procession in a nearfreezing rain carrying 
his own umbrella as did empress michiko 54 crown prince naruhito 
29 and other members of the imperial family 
during a 13hour day of funeral rites the foreign dignitaries 
attended three hours of ceremonies in the gardens they joined more 
than 9000 japanese political and business leaders artists and 
athletes in two immense heated white tents on either side of the 
path to the funeral hall 
hiroshi arakawa spokesman for the national police agency said 
about 5190 people were involved in 71 demonstrations across the 
country against the imperial system and 12 people were arrested 
he said said seven of the arrests were made in tokyo including 
two people who broke through police lines and ran into a street on 
the funeral route 
funeral organizers divided the shinto and lay rites at the 
shinjuku gardens drawing and reopening a black curtain between the 
two parts because of demands that the constitutional separation of 
state and religion be upheld 
several members of the opposition socialist party skipped the 
shinto ceremony and attended only the part at which government 
leaders expressed condolences 
the communist party boycotted the entire funeral contending the 
religious and statesponsored portions had been conducted as one 
the postwar constitution that specifies separation of religion and 
state was written by the united states 
prime minister noboru takeshita said hirohito ardently wished 
for world peace and the wellbeing of the japanese people and he 
always remained at one with them in the effort to overcome the 
nations difficulties 
many stores offices factories and entertainment centers were 
closed friday which was declared a national holiday but trains to 
ski resorts were reported full 
we respect the emperor but a holiday is a holiday said 
hiroshi hazama 37 he said he watched early funeral rites on tv 
before catching the train

a sheriffs deputy was arrested in the murder 
of three prostitutes and is being investigated in the slayings of 
six others who traded sex for drugs police said today 
a ballistics test has linked a gun found in the deputys car to 
at least three of the killings police chief daryl gates said 
deputy rickey ross 40 a narcotics investigator who has been 
with the los angeles county sheriffs department for 18 years was 
spotted at 130 am thursday by police officers patrolling south 
central los angeles gates said

police were trying to determine whether ross was linked to the other 
recent slayings gates said 
we have ballistic matches on three homicides and three only 
gates said

another series of prostitute killings that terrorized south central 
los angeles earlier this decade and became known colllectively as 
the south side slayings 
the name of the woman in the car with ross was not released 
gates said she told officers that she was getting scared before they 
arrived because she had been well briefed by police on the 
areas killings 
the woman told investigators simply that he ross wanted to go 
to the trunk of his vehicle gates said 
the gun that was recovered was in the trunk although the woman 
didnt know that 
at least nine women known in the streets as strawberries have 
been shot to death since 1985 the body of the last victim was found

aflcio leaders concluded their annual 
winter meeting friday with a call on congress to make it tougher for 
employers to skim assets from pension funds and a vow to be a major 
force in the coming redrawing of congressional districts 
the federations executive council also condemned a recent 
treasury department reversal of a customs service determination that 
imported multipurpose vehicles were small trucks and therefore 
subject to a 25 percent import tariff 
the protracted labor dispute at eastern airlines dominated the 
weeklong meeting with leaders of the 141millionmember federation 
promising to back up 8500 machinists and ground personnel planning 
to strike the airline next week 
but labor also put on the record its positions on a variety of 
domestic and international issues with statements ranging from a 
call for an increased minimum wage to condemnation of irans 
ayatollah khomeini for his death threats against satanic verses 
author salman rushdie also included were resolutions supporting 
labor movements in poland hungary chile burma south africa 
malaysia and korea 
the friday resolution on pensions said nearly 2 million workers 
have had their pensions jeopardized since 1980 by employers who use 
overfunded pension money for business purposes primarily to help 
initiate or fight takeover attempts 
workers have a fundamental right to pension fund assets the 
35member executive council said employers who terminate pension 
plans to skim off excess assets violate that right and deprive 
workers and retirees of their pension protection 
the statement called on congress to take a number of steps to 
discourage employers from dipping into or terminating pension funds 
including provisions calling for distribution of excess assets 
between employers and plan beneficiaries 
the postelection year session of the council was not as 
political as past gatherings but the resolution on redistricting 
that will follow the 1990 census indicated labor would try to be a 
major force in maintaining democratic majorities in both the 
congress and the majority of state legislatures 
it is vital that the labor movement and its allies coordinate a 
longterm reapportionment strategy that assists state legislative 
candidates who are committed to programs that benefit working 
americans and counterbalances conservative antiunion efforts to 
gerrymander away liberal legislators the council said 
the resolution said the shape of redistricting would be affected 
by those elected to key posts in 1989 and 1990 elections and urged 
aflcio affiliates to use their political action money and resources 
to support project 500 and the national committee for an effective 
congress two liberaloriented organizations involved in the debate 
on how the redistricting should be carried out 
the resolution condemning treasurys decision in the 
multipurpose vehicle case was requested by owen bieber president 
of the united auto workers 
the initial customs ruling would have made usmade 
multipurpose vehicles predominantly smaller fourwheel drive 
vehicles more attractive in terms of price than those of foreign 
competitors mainly japanese auto makers 
the treasury department has capitulated to foreign political 
pressure pointlessly increasing the us trade deficit and 
undermining the jobs of us workers the council said 
the council called on president bush to reinstate the customs 
decision 
the panel said its decision to involve organized labor in the 
debate over satanic verses stemmed from denial of free speech to 
labor organizers in numerous countries

spread the virus prisoners said

atlanta mayor andrew young said friday that 
president bush should be more willing than former president reagan 
was to support the idea of un sanctions against south africa as a 
way to end apartheid 
young who like bush once served as the us ambassador to the 
united nations said that experience should make bush more 
understanding and more appreciative of the powerful role that the 
united nations can play in bringing about an end to apartheid 
young commented during an appearance on worldnet the united 
states information agencys televison program in which foreign 
journalists question american political figures via satellite 
hookups 
on another subject young a former top aide to the late civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr was generally upbeat in his 
assessment of the prospects for blacks under the bush 
administration he said there is a tremendous difference between 
bush who has worked with black leaders and the black community for 
years and reagan who really did not know what was going on in 
the black community during most of his adult life 
young also said the election of former ku klux klan leader david 
duke to the louisiana legislature has helped bush and republican 
party officials in general realize that their party has leaned too 
far to the right on race relations 
dukes election he said served as a warning to the bush 
administration and to the republican party that they have to make 
some serious efforts not to continue to be branded in the minds of 
most americans as subtly and unconsciously if not consciously 
racist 
as for south africa young predicted that the united nations 
role this year in supervising namibias peaceful transition to 
independence from south africa will help persuade the bush 
administration to support possible un sanctions against south 
africa 
when they see firsthand the effectiveness of the united nations 
in that kind of situation i think we will probably see sometime 
this summer the bush administration willing to at least engage 
margaret thatcher and great britain on the issue of un sanctions 
against south africa he said the british prime minister has 
opposed such sanctions 
the united states did impose some economic sanctions against 
south africa during the reagan administration but critics said the 
action did not go far enough

a congressional agency which monitors us aid 
programs in latin america plans to close its sixperson office in 
panama because of unsettled conditions in that country an official 
said friday 
david littleton director of operations for national security and 
international affairs at the general accounting office said he 
expects all personnel will have left the office by the middle of the 
year 
they will begin leaving shortly before presidential elections set 
may 7 he said 
the number of official us personnel from various government 
agencies in panama has been scaled back considerably since 1987 when 
relations between the two countries began to deteriorate 
the panama regional office of gao which opened in 1975 oversees 
governmenttogovernment aid programs for central and south america 
and the humanitarian aid program for the nicaraguan contras as well 
littleton said 
littleton said in a telephone interview that the functions 
carried out by the panama office will be transferred to washington 
the united states does not recognize the legitimacy of the 
panamanian government and has not had substantive contact with 
officials of that government since it assumed power a year ago 
it continues to recognize as the legitimate authority in panama 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle who was deposed last february 
in a coup led by followers of defense chief manuel antonio noriega 
there have been numerous incidents of harassment directed against 
americans particularly military personnel for more than a year but 
none has involved gao officials littleton said 
the military command headquarters said in a statement wednesday 
that in the first six weeks of this year panamas defense forces 
have stopped searched rerouted detained or impounded more 
us government vehicles than in the previous eight months 
littleton said the problems encountered by gao officials have 
been different as an example he said the prohibition on contacts 
with panamanian officials has created difficulties in such areas as 
renewal of visas and drivers licenses 
secretary of state james a baker iii said in congressional 
testimony on tuesday that he envisions no change from the reagan 
administrations policy of refusing to recognize the noriegaled 
government in panama he added however that the policy is being 
reviewed 
noriega has been indicted by grand juries in florida on charges 
related to drug smuggling

the president of an interim government 
for afghanistan said friday his guerrillaformed group would begin 
operations inside that country within a month and he added god 
willing 
sibghatullah mojaddidi also asked foreign countries to recognize 
the proposed government which hopes to take over if the 
sovietbacked government in kabul is overthrown 
other resistance leaders rejected the government elected by a 
440member group of moslem guerrillas in pakistan on thursday 
at a news conference concluding the stormy threeweek session 
mojaddidi said it would become functional inside afghanistan within 
a month but he did not elaborate 
mojaddidi leader of the guerrilla afghan national liberation 
front also requested the united nations give the interim government 
a seat in the general assembly 
however mohammad saljooque a delegate and member of the 
national islamic front of afghanistan said the whole thing 
assembly was contrived to leave power in the hands of a 
sevenparty islamic guerrilla alliance based in pakistan 
eight afghan guerrilla groups based in iran boycotted the meeting 
in a dispute with the pakistanbased majority over allocation of 
seats 
we consider the formation of the interim government as 
onesided and we cannot recognize it the leader of the 
iranbased rebel alliance mohammad karim khalili was quoted as 
saying friday by tehran radio 
the guerrillas have been fighting afghanistans sovietbacked 
government since it seized power in a bloody 1978 coup soviet 
forces intervened in december 1979 and completed a ninemonth 
withdrawal feb 15 
the guerrilla council known as a shura met at a religious camp 
outside islamabad to form a broadbased interim government that 
would oversee a return to peace and the formation of an islamic 
government 
once the shura convened on feb 10 the seven pakistanbased 
parties quarreled over distribution of cabinet ministries 
the four fundamentalist groups favor a strict moslem government 
while the moderates advocate a more liberal regime with islam as the 
official religion 
on thursday the shura approved a government that gives each of 
the seven leaders a key post and reserves most remaining portfolios 
for their own parties 
mojaddidi on friday repeated the guerrillas offer of amnesty to 
defecting afghan communists 
there is a general amnesty for kabul regime members with the 
blood of mujahedeen on their hands if they join the resistance 
mojaddidi said through an interpreter 
a western diplomatic source in islamabad said the rebels 
announcement of a cabinet might not be enough for the world to 
accept it as a new legitimate government 
i think its too early to talk about recognition their first 
test will be to get a capital the source said speaking on 
condition he not be identified 
communist forces heavily armed by the departing red army hold 
kabul and afghanistans key cities the insurgents backed mainly by 
pakistan and the united states reportedly control about 90 percent 
of the countryside 
guerrilla and western observers have predicted kabul will fall 
within weeks or months in the absence of soviet forces but marxist 
president najib says his army is strong enough to withstand a rebel 
onslaught 
resistance leaders say they are adopting a harrassment and siege 
tactic to save lives and await the communists collapse from within 
of afghanistans prewar population of 15 million more than 1 
million people have died and more than 5 million afghans live as 
refugees in pakistan and iran

president mikhail s gorbachev met friday 
with ukrainian writers pressing for cultural economic and 
environmental reforms and participants said he expressed support 
for their efforts 
hours after gorbachev left police dragged away people who 
gathered near a downtown square where rallies against the ukrainian 
communist party chief had been allowed nightly since sunday the eve 
of gorbachevs arrival 
they hauled off anyone who stopped at october revolution square 
and put them in vans it was not clear what happened to those who 
were detained 
dmitro pavlychko head of the newly formed ukrainian language 
society which seeks to make ukrainian the republics official 
language said the group had a beautiful discussion with 
gorbachev in party leader vladimir v shcherbitskys office 
he completely supports all of our national economic and 
ecological thoughts pavlychko said 
shcherbitsky is the only remaining member of the partys ruling 
politburo to have been appointed under leonid brezhnev whose 
18year rule is now regarded as a period of stagnation and 
corruption there have been persistent reports since gorbachev took 
power four years ago that he has tried to oust shcherbitsky 
the evening tv news program vremya said only that gorbachev 
urged the writers to support his reform efforts 
it said he also met with top ukrainian government and party 
officials as well as local party leaders before his departure for 
moscow in what likely was criticism aimed at shcherbitsky the tass 
news agency said gorbachev told the officials that in some cases 
the communist party still was avoiding involvement in reform efforts 
it is necessary to raise the intellectual level of party work 
to free it from functions outside its purview he said 
gorbachev did not directly criticize shcherbitsky in the meeting 
said ivan drach head of the kiev branch of the ukrainian writers 
union 
he had to be very gentle very delicate drach said he 
tried to advance a line of understanding between the writers and the 
party 
drach himself called for shcherbitskys ouster during the 
meeting he said 
russian increasingly has become the language of commerce and 
education since shcherbitsky assumed leadership of the ukraine in 
1972 he replaced petro shelest who was ousted on charges of 
encouraging ukrainian nationalism 
according to drach the writers told gorbachev they seek an 
accounting of economic performance and problems an end to massive 
atomic power and industrial projects they say have devastated the 
environment a truthful history of the ukraine and a revival of the 
ukrainian language and culture 
drach also is the leader of the fledging ukrainian popular 
movement patterned after the unofficial political organizations 
that have drawn more than 100000 members in the baltic republics 
we decided concrete things pavlychko said in an inteview 
hours after the meeting with gorbachev he declined to elaborate 
there was a palpable difference between shcherbitsky and 
gorbachev drach said we could sense from gorbachev an aura of 
good will 
gorbachev told the writers he would do everthing to encourage 
the ukrainian language and culture and specifically supported 
calls to make ukrainian the official language drach said 
during the meeting gorbachev won friends by quoting taras 
shevchenko and other ukrainian poets pavlychko said 
he also asked writers for patience to understand the 
complexities of the entire situation pavlychko said we 
shouldnt whip our horses he quoted gorbachev as saying 
it is important that for the first time the writers were in 
the office of shcherbitsky drach said we had to wait for the 
visit of gorbachev to get it

a 14yearold boy was sent to the nebraska 
state penitentiary because hes a smart youngster who wants to be a 
criminal when he grows up the judge who sentenced the youth said 
friday the youngster is the youngest person ever held at the prison 
buffalo county judge dewayne wolf decided thursday to send 
richard boswell to the penitentiary after he was convicted as an 
adult of auto theft and of escaping from a state institution 
i feel very vacant wolf said in a telephone interview 
i sat and stared at this kid hes a smart person he knows 
what he wants and unfortunately what he apparently wants is to be 
a criminal he said 
public defender gary hogg who represented boswell said the 
judges only choices were to send boswell to the youth development 
center in kearney from which the boy escaped at least twice or the 
state penitentiary the state does not have a maximumsecurity 
facility for juvenile offenders 
this is no normal kid wolf said hes 14 but hes not the 
average kid from your neighborhood hes a very dangerous young 
man 
wolf sent boswell to the center in central nebraska dec 19 after 
the boy was convicted of escaping from the institution 
i gave him a lecture at that time that hes too young to go to 
the penitentiary and all that stuff wolf said 
the next day boswell ran away from the center which has no 
fences 
after that escape wolf and hogg said boswell broke into some 
cars and stole a knife a gun and a set of brass knuckles 
the officer sent to arrest boswell in a garage asked for help 
fearing for his safety wolf said adding that boswell was later 
overheard to say that he would have shot the officer if he had come 
into the garage 
boswell was sentenced to up to three years for escape and one to 
four years for auto theft wolf said boswell should be eligible for 
parole in about nine months 
assistant corrections director larry tewes said boswell was held 
in a hospital room at the prison 
we could keep him there until hes 16 if we had to but wed 
rather not well be looking to transfer him to another state which 
can handle juvenile offenders said tewes who added that boswell 
is the youngest person ever held at the prison 
boswell was first sent to the youth center in november 1987 for 
robbery assault and burglary 
the sad part of this real issue is what do you do with the 
young criminal wolf said we have only two choices ydc or 
corrections we really dont have a secure facility we need one 
state sen jerry chizek chairman of the legislatures judiciary 
committee agreed 
we have to recognize that there are juveniles who are real 
problems and we must deal with that he said we dont have an 
answer right now but i do know that sending a 14yearold to prison 
is definitely not going to correct the problem 
the problem wolf said stems from the changing nature of 
juvenile offenders 
twenty years ago they were runaways today they are doing the 
same things as adult criminals wolf said 
our failure with this particular youth was some time ago 
probably before he was 8 this just didnt happen overnight he 
said

a judge on friday sentenced two men to six 
years probation and 1200 hours community service for stealing 
donated eye tissues and selling them abroad 
hillsborough circuit judge dennis alvarez also fined each man 
4500 to cover restitution and court costs but said robert grant 
and robert fisher will have a clean record if they successfully 
complete probation 
grant and fisher were convicted last month of conspiracy and 
grand theft by a jury that acquitted their wives gailya grant and 
irene fisher 
they could have been sent to prison for one year on the 
conspiracy charge and five on the grand theft count 
prosecutors accused them of misrepresenting themselves as members 
of a nonprofit eye bank in order to gain access to cadavers in 
medical examiners offices hospitals and funeral homes 
grant 45 and fisher 40 sent corneas taken from the corpses to 
research facilities in the united states and abroad to argentina and 
saudia arabia authorities said many went to a saudi arabian 
hospital for a processing fee as high as 1300 a pair assistant 
hillsborough state attorney judy hoyer said during trial 
medical examiners supplying the corneas the transparent tissues 
that cover and protect the eyeball assumed the tissues were going 
to florida regional bone and tissue bank inc but they were sold by 
another eye bank university ophthalmic services inc 
grant and fisher were former employees of florida regional 
ms hoyer said university ophthalmic was set up in 1986 by mrs 
grant and mrs fisher 
it was closed a year later after florida regional discovered 
grant and fisher were removing corneas and keeping the fees for 
delivering them 
defense attorneys maintained their clients simply recognized a 
loophole in the law set up a legitimate eye bank retrieved corneas 
that likely would have been discarded and capitalized on the need 
for eye tissue in foreign countries

the nations elderly are being needlessly and 
inhumanely drugged by doctors who are inexperienced in treating 
older patients and who rely on drugs to control behavior the 
american psychological association said friday 
many of these patients could benefit from lower doses of the 
medications they need to treat chronic illnesses and from 
alternative nondrug therapies such as psychological counseling the 
association said in asking medicare to cover their services 
too often the elderly are needlessly and inhumanely being left 
and psychologically abandoned to druginduced stupors said bryant 
welch executive director of professional practice at the 
association 
he spoke to reporters at a briefing in advance of a forum 
sponsored by the associations board of professional affairs on the 
overuse and misuse of prescription drugs for the elderly 
a report earlier this month by the inspector generals office at 
the department of health and human services alleged widespread 
prescription drug problems among the elderly the report said 
americans over age 60 account for 51 percent of deaths and 39 
percent of hospitalizations from drug reactions 
the psychologists association concentrated on the misprescribing 
of psychotropic drugs medications that control behavior to older 
patients 
antipsychotic drugs must be used appropriately for specific 
documentable reasons not simply to control behavior perhaps more 
for staff convenience at nursing homes said william simonson 
associate professor of pharmacy at oregon state university who 
joined welch at the briefing 
the tragic scenario of a physically robust patient turning into 
a nonfunctional zombie after receiving antipsychotics has been 
played out many times he said 
the problem may be eased he said by medicare regulations due to 
go into effect later this year the rules will require nursing homes 
to ensure that residents are not given antipsychotic drugs unless 
needed to treat a specific condition and that residents who use the 
drugs be given gradual dose reductions or drug holidays when 
possible in an effort to discontinue use 
linda keegan a spokeswoman for the american health care 
association which represents more than 8000 nursing homes noted 
that government standards for care currently discourage the use of 
drug therapy to control behavior 
she added while we recognize that psychotropic drugs have been 
used in the past as chemical restraints physicians prescribing 
drugs to nursing home patients increasingly realize that such 
practices may help control behavior but they inevitably create new 
problems 
from 35 percent to 40 percent of prescribed sedatives and 
hypnotic drugs go to elderly americans who make up about 12 percent 
of the population the psychologists group said 
the american psychiatristric association agrees that physicians 
need more training about prescribing psychotropic drugs for the 
elderly the association started such a program two years ago said 
spokesman dr harvey ruben 
however ruben said it is naive for the psychologists to 
believe that many nursing home patients could be treated with 
alternative nonmedical therapies he said 60 percent to 70 percent 
of nursing home patients have some form of dementia and most would 
not benefit from behavior modification 
the psychologists recommend that the medicare program the 
federal health insurance program for the elderly be expanded to 
cover psychological services 
currently the programs mental health coverage includes services 
by psychiatrists who can prescribe drugs the services of 
psychologists who are not medical doctors and cannot prescribe 
drugs are not covered by medicare 
simonson who specializes in geriatric pharmacology said 
medications to control behavior can be used effectively to manage 
patients and in nursing homes there is often pressure to use these 
drugs to control patients prone to wandering around yelling or 
striking out at other patients

a veteran sheriffs deputy who allegedly was 
smoking cocaine with a prostitute was arrested for investigation of 
murdering three hookers in an area where at least nine prostitutes 
have been killed police said friday 
rickey ross 40 a narcotics investigator who has been with the 
los angeles county sheriffs department for 18 years was spotted 
with the woman in his car early thursday by police officers 
patrolling southcentral los angeles police chief daryl gates said 
at a news conference 
police have been investigating the slayings in the area of at 
least nine and possibly as many as a dozen strawberries women 
who trade sex for drugs since august 1985 
police were investigating whether ross was linked to the other 
recent slayings gates said but he said there was no indication the 
deputy was linked to any of another series of prostitute killings in 
the area earlier this decade that became known collectively as the 
south side slayings 
ross was arrested after a gun found in his car was linked by a 
ballistics test to the three killings police said 
gates said the woman in the car did not know ross was a deputy 
he did not stop her using his badge gates said he only 
identified himself as a deputy after the officers stopped him 
the name of the woman in the car with ross was not released 
gates said officers determined that she was a prostitute but he 
would not characterize her as a strawberry 
gates said she told officers that she was getting scared before 
the officers stopped them because she had been well briefed by 
police on the killings 
the woman told investigators simply that he ross wanted to go 
to the trunk of his vehicle gates said the gun was found in the 
trunk the gun was not described but gates said it was not the 
deputys service weapon 
gates said ross waived his rights and spoke to investigators but 
the chief would only reveal a little bit of what was said 
he was not able to explain all of this gates said he 
admitted he picked up the young woman but he did not believe she was 
a prostitute 
los angeles county sheriff sherman block said ross married with 
two children ages 20 and 5 had been assigned to a unit at los 
angeles international airport 
he has a very fine record block said he has been a very 
effective investigator in the narcotics bureau 
police on routine patrol spotted ross car parked but said it 
pulled away from the curb in an erratic manner when they 
approached and the officers made a traffic stop the chief said 
the officers believed ross was under the influence of an 
intoxicating substance gates said the woman told investigators they 
had been smoking cocaine but he noted that tests were still being 
conducted to confirm the type of substance 
ross was initially held for driving under the influence after 
the ballistics report on the three killings was finished he was 
arrested in his home in rialto about 55 miles east of downtown los 
angeles 
a search warrant was obtained and the home was searched but gates 
would not reveal what was recovered there 
we have ballistic matches on three homicides and three only 
gates said those three victims were found on oct 14 nov 18 and 
dec 11

commerce secretary robert mosbacher said friday 
that western europes plan to create a unified economy by 1992 is 
expected to expand markets for us companies rather than create a 
fortress europe that shuns american goods 
mosbacher in his first major address since joining the cabinet 
said that while there are sure to be a few european strongholds 
against us goods the initiative generally is likely to improve 
business opportunities for americans 
the 12 countries in the european economic community are trying to 
forge a single market almost as integrated as the united states by 
the end of 1992 
in a sense 1992 marks a shift in majority view away from 
protection and toward openness a willingness to gamble that this 
openness will work mosbacher said at a congressionally sponsored 
conference on europe 1992 
he said government analysts and business executives also are 
concerned that some benefits of the unified market may be denied to 
noneec countries but the full impact of the initiative wont be 
known until the plan actually is implemented 
the reality is that many europeans are not completely in favor 
of more open markets mosbacher said some european companies 
have been accustomed to having their inefficiency shielded by their 
governments 
mosbacher said that while freetrade advocates cannot expect to 
win every dispute us officials will work to eliminate any 
inequities 
all of us in the administration will forcefully advocate vital 
us business interests through regular meetings with our ec 
counterparts he said 
speaking about efforts to shrink the us trade deficit 
mosbacher said he had a message for countries that think they can 
continue to sell to the united states while refusing to buy american 
products those days are over 
an open america is best for us and for the world he said 
but the world must be open to america as well 
in addition mosbacher said american industry must redouble its 
investment research and pursuit of quality in order to better 
compete with foreign producers 
american industry must learn to do what others do and pull out 
all stops to win and hold foreign customers he said

an israeli reserve soldier was killed in the 
west bank on friday when palestinians dropped a cement block on his 
head from the roof of a building the army said 
the soldier identified as binyamin meisner 24 was the sixth 
member of israels armed forces to be killed since the uprising 
began in december 1987 a total of 17 israelis and at least 385 
palestinians have been killed 
israel radio and television said palestinians provoked soldiers 
by throwing stones and lured them into one of the narrow alleys of 
the citys open air market 
the large block was then dropped and hit meisner who was wearing 
a steel helmet after meisner was hit troops opened fire said a 
nablus army commander who was not identified further 
the army imposed a curfew on nablus 120000 residents and began 
housetohouse searches and sporadic gunfire was heard arab 
reports said 
in the gaza strip nine palestinians were wounded in clashes with 
troops arab hospital officials said the army said it was checking 
the reports 
the hospital officials said the wounded included a 30yearold 
woman who was nine months pregnant doctors said she was shot in the 
back but was not in serious condition they said a 4yearold boy 
was shot in the right arm 
bassam abu sharif plo chief yasser arafats political adviser 
said in an interview published friday he was trying to arrange a 
meeting with israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin in london 
abu sharif speaking in an interview with the israeli newspaper 
yediot ahronot in london said he was working through british 
political figures in the conservative party to arrange a meeting 
with rabin who will visit london 
if i meet him i will ask him why do you shoot children abu 
sharif said he will of course ask me why are you rioting 
rabin has met extensively with palestinian officials in the 
occupied lands but in line with government policy has said he 
would not negotiate with the palestine liberation organization 
rabin has left for a fundraising tour in switzerland and was 
scheduled to go to london before returning to israel next week said 
a defense ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
recent polls have indicated the majority of israelis support 
negotiations with the plo under certain conditions 
prime minister yitzhak shamir on friday reiterated his opposition 
to talks with the plo saying the organization was still intent on 
destroying israel 
shamir also rejected a demand by soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze that israel agree to talks with the plo and an 
international middle east peace conference as the price of renewing 
diplomatic ties 
we will not accept any conditions for the resumption of 
relations shamir told a news conference after a threeday visit 
to france as long as the soviet union doesnt renew ties with 
israel from our view it cannot be involved in any way in the peace 
process in the region 
the statement appeared to contradict an earlier one by foreign 
minister moshe arens who said after a meeting with shevardnadze he 
believed the soviets could play a role in middle east peacemaking 
even without diplomatic ties with israel

it will take more than theft of computers rifling 
of files and a sixalarm arson fire to put the dallas gay alliance 
out of business its president said friday as operations continued 
at temporary quarters 
if it were the arsonists intentions to halt our work it 
didnt happen said william waybourn the alliance operates 
several outreach programs including the aids resource center of 
dallas that also was housed in the destroyed building 
damage caused by the fire in a strip shopping center was 
estimated at 750000 said fire capt je foster no injuries were 
reported 
the fire set us back an hour thats how much they halted our 
service to the gay community and to people with aids he said 
we deal with aids day in and day out believe me a fire we can 
handle 
investigators ruled the center was set afire early thursday after 
its offices were ransacked and computers and legal documents were 
stolen arson investigators said they had no suspects two other 
businesses also were destroyed 
no confidential information about aids clients was taken 
waybourn said 
those files wont mean anything to anybody except us he 
said weve always been an open organization they could have 
gotten the same information just by calling us 
missing documents included papers concerning efforts to have 
state district judge jack hampton removed from office waybourn said 
dallas gay alliance offices had been a center of activity for 
attempts to oust hampton since december when he was quoted in a 
newspaper article as saying he gave a lighter sentence to a killer 
because his two victims were homosexuals 
arson investigators suspect a petroleum product may have been 
used to ignite the fire becaue of the intense heat it generated 
fire officials said results of laboratory rests were expected 
monday 
waybourn said all of the alliances services continued friday 
thanks to community support including donations of equipment and 
furniture he said an electronic security alarm system and 24hour 
security guards also were donanted 
waybourn also said a new weekly program of lowcost anonymous 
aids tests was launched thursday as planned albeit to a lower 
number than expected 
we only had a few people come by for it waybourn said but 
i think thats because of all the tv cameras that makes it hard to 
be anonymous 
the three missing computers contained information about the 
alliances activities including lists of donors and organization 
members alliance leaders said the missing materials could not be 
used to identify any clients including those with aids 
waybourn said the center had some insurance but not enough to 
cover our losses its hard to get coverage on a facility like 
ours

the governing conservative party narrowly retained 
one of its safest parliamentary seats friday against a strong show 
of voter disapproval of prime minister margaret thatchers policies 
the special election in the wealthy richmond district in northern 
england saw the tory majority tumble from nearly 20000 votes to 
2600 saved from defeat only by a split centrist vote 
it was the biggest collapse of conservative support since mrs 
thatcher came to power in 1979 
the main opposition labor party which earlier friday kept its 
seat at pontypridd in south wales in another byelection was beaten 
into fourth place in richmond 
the elections to fill vacant seats in the 650seat house of 
commons came midway through mrs thatchers third term with polls 
showing a sharp dro in tory support and increased backing for labor 
richmond voters appeared to reflect the widespread hostility to 
government plans to reform the statefunded national health service 
and privatize the countrys water companies and to the recent 
upsurge in inflation 
there has been something of a protest vote against the 
government said william hague 27 the victorious conservative 
candidate in richmond we have had problems on the issue of health 
reforms and on the proposed privatization of water we still have a 
lot of convincing to do 
the richmond election had been watched closely to see which of 
britains two feuding centrist parties david owens splinter 
social democrats or paddy ashdowns larger newly merged social and 
liberal democrats would poll more votes 
the social democrats did by a wide margin and owen called it a 
stunning result which shows that sticking with your beliefs 
pays off in british politics 
the results gave hague 19543 votes social democrat michael 
potter 16909 social liberal democrat barbara pearce 11589 and 
labors frank robson 2591 
potter and pearce said the results showed their parties should 
try to unite behind a single candidate before the next general 
election which mrs thatcher must call by june 1992 
in pontypridd labor candidate kim howells 42 a research 
officer with the leftled national union of mineworkers won 20549 
votes or 533 percent 
secondplace went to the plaid cymru welsh nationalist candidate 
syd morgan with 9755 votes or 253 percent plaid cymru with 
three seats in the 650seat house of commons seeks independence for 
wales tory nigel evans trailed with 5212 votes or 135 percent 
pontypridd is a labor stronghold in the once thriving but now 
largely neglected industrial heartland of south wales and howells 
victory was predictable 
labor has lost three consecutive general elections to mrs 
thatcher since 1979 party leader neil kinnock is trying to edge 
labor away from some of its hardline socialist doctrines and soften 
its advocacy of unilateral nuclear disarmament 
labor has gained in the polls because of discontent with thatcher 
policies especially the governments plans for the national health 
service which many voters see as a first step toward a mainly 
private system 
the service will remain free to patients but hospitals will 
compete with each other for fees of statefunded patients and for 
private patients the elderly will get tax breaks for buying private 
health insurance 
the pontypridd election was caused by the death of local labor 
legislator brynmor john the richmond election was called following 
the appointment of the conservative incumbent sir leon brittan to 
the european economic communitys executive commission

a videotape that recreates laurie danns 
last day a nightmare of deadly gunfire at an elementary school 
arson poison and suicide helps spare police chief herbert timm 
the strain of retelling the grim story 
but it also brings back memories it makes it as vivid as when 
i was there said timm who is using the video in presentations on 
the deadly events of last may 20 to law enforcement social work and 
community groups 
we started getting so many requests we decided to make a video 
that might stand on its own winnetka police lt joe sumner said 
friday 
community crisis the laurie dann case recreates danns 
violent rampage in this comfortable north chicago suburb 
dann 30 opened fire in a secondgrade classroom at winnetkas 
hubbard woods elementary school killing one student and wounding 
five she then ran to a nearby home and wounded a college student 
before killing herself 
the video recounts the events beginning at 1020 am when the 
citys fire department received its first call about a fire in the 
house where dann babysat to 720 pm when police found her dead 
police later found evidence she had attempted to set fires and 
deliver poison snacks and drinks before the school shootings 
the video includes timms estimate that if dann had killed 
everyone she tried to burn poison and shoot that day the death 
toll would have been 50 instead of two an 8yearold boy and dann 
herself and six wounded 
every time i see it tears come to my eyes timm said 
the video also includes the chiefs candid admission that 
reporters questions helped shape police strategy 
they would ask chief how about this chief how about 
that and i would say well were working on that were looking 
into it timm recalled on the video 
then id race back into the building and say my god have 
you guys thought about looking into this 
survivors or victims families were not interviewed said 
independent producer gerald rogers who donated his hourlong 
50000 production to this village of about 13000 
we tried very hard not to be sensationalistic or to exploit 
anyone rogers said i wanted people to learn 
the camera bursts into the bathroom where one boy was shot and 
moves into a secondgrade classroom where the womans gunfire 
killed nicholas corwin and wounded four other children still 
photographs capture the aftermath of bloody clothing a bloody floor 
stark photographs of danns body face down on a carpet mark the 
end of the daylong assault though rogers said he debated over using 
them 
for a storyteller it had a finality to it that was hard to 
overlook said rogers who lives in neighboring kenilworth and 
produces education film and videotapes 
timm turned to rogers to help with the video project after the 
two met while working together with parents concerned about drug and 
alcohol abuse 
the tape sells for 450 and rents for 100 any profits will go 
to the winnetka police department 
it showed us there are some things we did wrong we had 
problems with command posts in the right place and problems with 
communication when calls from reporters and families saturated our 
phone lines sumner said 
the video brings back tragic memories for him too 
but if its going to help someone in the future sumner 
addedits worth the pain

465 million settlement ordered by the supreme court for the bhopal 
gas leak the court also began hearing a petition asking the 
settlement be raised to 600 million

has a week to submit to the court a breakdown of how the funds will 
be allotted

a petition asking that compensation for the 1984 disaster which 
killed more than 3400 people be increased to 600 million 
a same fivejudge supreme court panel that ordered the first 
settlement began preliminary hearings friday on the petition 
rk garg an attorney for the group has argued the settlement 
challenged the concept of india as a free nation by 
capitulating to union carbide and had fettered its fine 
constitution to the whims of a multinational company 
lawyers for union carbide refused comment on the petition 
the government says 20000 people were seriously affected by 
exposure to the methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from the bhopal 
pesticide plant operated the indian subsidiary of union carbide 
on feb 14 the supreme court ordered union carbide to pay 470 
million in final settlement of all claims however the court ruled 
last week that union carbide could receive credit for 5 million 
deposited after new york district judge john keenan ruled in 1986 
that the money be made available for immediate relief to the victims

settlement as too low the indian government originally sued union 
carbide for 3 billion

chiefs of amazon indian tribes ended a 
historic meeting friday with a demand to stop plans to build a 
hydroelectric dam that would flood native lands 
hundreds of indians wearing colored feathers beads and red and 
black paint stood and chanted their support as indian leader ailton 
krenac read an appeal to protect amazonia home to most of brazils 
220000 native people 
we do not want the construction of dams on the xingu river and 
on other rivers in the amazon because they threaten indian 
nations he said the mostly white audience of townspeople and 
representatives of environmental groups cheered and applauded 
more than 500 indians from about 40 native groups met for five 
days in this eastern amazon city 2000 miles northwest of rio de 
janeiro to protest the proposed belo monte dam on the xingu river 
an amazon tributary it was the first time indians in brazil set 
aside longstanding tribal rivalries and banded together in a 
political movement 
the reservoir of the 58 billion dam would flood 500 square 
miles of rain forest the dam would have a generating capacity of 11 
million kilowatts 40 percent more than that of grand coulee the 
biggest hydroelectric dam in the united states 
for a long time the white man has ignored our thinking and the 
spirit of our ancestors now this must stop our territory is the 
sacred site of our people the home of our creator that cannot be 
violated krenac said 
the government contends brazil must tap the vast hydroelectric 
potential of the amazon basin to progress federal electric power 
officials at the gathering told the indians that dams will be built 
earlier in the week one indian woman thrust a machete just inches 
from the face of an electricity company representative other tribal 
people said that was merely a symbolic gesture 
congressman tadeu franca pledged to carry on the indians fight 
in brasilia the capital because of this meeting it will be 
indians working together not some presidential decree that will 
build the indians history he said 
nothing like this has ever happened before the indians will go 
back to their villages with the sense that something really new and 
important has happened said terry turner a us anthropologist 
who has worked more than 20 years with the kayapo indians 
construction of the dam is scheduled to start in 1993 it must 
first be approved by congress 
brazil has shown interest in getting partial financing for the 
project from the world bank but indians and environmental groups 
are asking the washingtonbased institution not to put up any money 
in a small victory this week the indians won an agreement from 
the government electric power company in amazonia to change the name 
of the project to belo monte from kararao kararao is a war cry of 
the kayapo tribe and was offensive to other tribes

a couple wont seek custody of a 10yearold 
girl they believe is their daughter but they still want genetic 
testing done to determine whether they are her real parents their 
lawyer said friday 
ernest and regina twigg of langhorne pa would settle for a 
chance to visit with the girl and make her part of their family 
said john blakely the twiggs attorney 
they were becoming very frustrated with the publics 
perception they have always intended to do what is best for 
everyone said blakely 
the twiggs filed a lawsuit last year seeking genetic testing of 
the girl kimberly mays the girls father robert mays a roofing 
supply salesman from sarasota is fighting to block the tests 
the twiggs claim they brought the wrong child home from hardee 
memorial hospital in wauchula in 1978 and that robert and barbara 
mays took their child the same day 
the girl the twiggs raised named arlena died of a congenital 
heart defect last august they learned through blood tests that she 
was not their daughter 
kimberly and arlena were the only two white baby girls in the 
hospital at the same time the twiggs who maintain hospital 
personnel deliberately switched their healthy daughter for a sickly 
child have asked a sarasota court to order genetic testing to 
determine kimberlys parentage 
this doesnt change the lawsuit at all blakely said 
in december mays said kimberly inscribed a drawing she gave him 
for christmas i hate the twiggs i want them to go away 
mays wife barbara died of cancer in 1981 he remarried and 
later divorced 
mrs twigg said she and her husband first considered seeking 
custody because they suspected mays participated in the alleged baby 
swap but now there is no evidence to support that 
the twiggs who have seven children later grew concerned about 
public sentiment that they were being unfair to kimberly they say 
they have received hate mail comparing them to terrorists 
you take a step back and say what is in the best interest of 
everybody involved mrs twigg told the tampa tribune in an 
interview published in friday editions breaking four months of 
silence in the case we feel that we should not be denied the 
right to know that girl as a child 
blakely said while there have been no discussions with mays or 
his attorney arthur ginsburg the twiggs should be the ones to 
determine extent of the visitation relying on guidance from 
psychologists and psychiatrists 
i think the only basis the twiggs would seek custody is if some 
professional told them it would be in kimberlys best interest to 
remove her from mr mays house which we do not anticipate said 
blakely 
ginsburg was not available friday his office said mays could 
not be reached he has an unpublished telephone number

a west german businessman who was convicted of 
illegally reexporting a chemical warfare ingredient to iran has 
been denied all us export privileges for 10 years the commerce 
department said friday 
peter walaschek was convicted in us district court in baltimore 
last august after pleading guilty to illegally reexporting 
usmade thiodiglycol from singapore to iran in violation of the 
export administration act the department said the substance is an 
ingredient of mustard gas which is used in chemical warfare 
between january 1987 and april 1988 walaschek purchased more 
than 210 tons of the substance in the united states for shipment to 
singapore and greece then reexported the chemical from singapore 
to iran without approval from the commerce department the agency 
said 
commerce undersecretary paul freedenberg said the departments 
action demonstrates the importance the united states places on 
prevention of the further spread of chemicals used for warfare 
freedenberg said that walaschek deliberately tried to hide the 
true destination of the chemicals he purchased and that the 
transactions highlight what countries such as iran will do to 
acquire the chemicals they need to wage chemical warfare

a third associate of winnie 
mandela appeared in court friday in connection with the slaying of a 
14yearold activist who allegedly was assaulted at mrs mandelas 
house 
john morgan 61 appeared briefly in johannesburg magistrates 
court authorities have identified him as the bus driver for mrs 
mandelas unofficial bodyguards known as the mandela united soccer 
club 
on tuesday the selfdescribed coach of mandela united jerry 
richardson and a 17yearold club member were arraigned in court on 
charges of murdering activist stompie seipei 14 they were arrested 
sunday at mrs mandelas home in soweto outside johannesburg 
mrs mandela is the wife of nelson mandela the jailed chief of 
the african national congress the largest group fighting the 
whitedominated government 
last week major antiapartheid groups accused mandela united 
members of conducting a reign of terror in soweto and said mrs 
mandela should be ostracized the groups stressed that they remained 
loyal to nelson mandela 
morgans appearance in court friday was procedural and did not 
deal with the substance of the case against him officials said 
news of the appearance was the first disclosure morgan had been 
arrested 
seipei whose funeral is scheduled for saturday allegedly was 
abducted in late december along with three other young men taken to 
mrs mandelas home and assaulted 
seipeis decomposed body was found in a field on jan 7 and was 
identified by forensic experts two weeks ago 
mandela summoned three prominent antiapartheid lawyers for a 
fourhour meeting thursday at victor verster prison farm near cape 
town but details of the discussions have not been disclosed 
seipeis murder is one of four recent killings involving people 
connected directly or indirectly to mrs mandela and her bodyguards 
on wednesday a 13yearold soweto girl was killed when gunmen 
fired on her house with ak47 rifles and set the dwelling on fire 
with a firebomb police said the attack might have been in revenge 
for the killing last week of maxwell madondo a member of mandela 
united 
last month dr abu baker asvat a physician and activist was 
shot and killed at his soweto clinic a suspect has confessed to 
shooting asvat during a robbery attempt and police say the case is 
nonpolitical but mrs mandela has suggested that asvat may have 
been killed because he had examined seipei and other youths she said 
were sexually molested by a methodist minister 
methodist leaders have denied the sex allegations and accused 
mrs mandela of falsely implying that the church conspired with 
police to discredit her 
the african national congress and a committee of soweto activists 
have suggested that mandela united was infiltrated by police agents 
but these groups have criticized mrs mandela for poor judgment and 
lack of discipline 
in another development antiapartheid leaders criticized the 
government for not releasing more detainees following negotiations 
to end a hunger strike 
nearly 300 black detainees in johannesburg and port elizabeth 
suspended a threeweek hunger strike last week after law and order 
minister adriaan vlok told antiapartheid church leaders that a 
substantial number of detainees would be released within two 
weeks 
mary burton president of the black sash civil rights group told 
a news conference held by several activists that only 17 detainees 
had been released 
this is not a substantial number of detainees and does not 
enable us to report to the hunger strikers that their suffering and 
their agreement to suspend the strike have been vindicated she 
said 
many of the detainees have been held for more than two years 
without charges and they are demanding that they either be charged 
or released

a military jury reprimanded 
a us navy captain friday for not giving enough help to a boatload 
of vietnamese refugees who resorted to cannibalism to survive 
the jury of six navy captains could have jailed alexander balian 
a decorated vietnam war veteran for 90 days and made him forfeit 
twothirds of his pay for three months 
it said he erred in handling the situation that arose last june 9 
while his ship was in the south china sea but deserved no further 
punishment than being relieved of command as he was in august 
he was acquitted of the more serious charge of ordering one 
refugee shaken off ropes as the man tried to climb aboard the 
amphibious landing ship uss dubuque 
balian 48 claimed he was made a scapegoat and said heroes 
like me are hung out to dry when they get in trouble 
he was charged with failing to render adequate assistance to more 
than 80 vietnamese refugees in a leaky boat the dubuque encountered 
about 250 miles north of the philippine island of palawan 
un officials said 31 refugees later died and survivors said 
they had eaten the flesh of the dead before filipino fishermen 
rescued them june 27

leftist guerrillas made the 
second charge in as many days friday that the army attacked one of 
their field hospitals the report said one person was killed and 
another wounded 
the armed forces denied both allegations 
venceremos the clandestine rebel radio said soldiers used light 
artillery and small arms in an attack feb 18 on a field hospital 
near santa clara in san vicente province about 40 miles east of san 
salvador 
on thursday the legal aid office of the roman catholic church 
said 10 people were slain in an army attack feb 13 on a rebel field 
hospital 
a brigadista was killed in the attack last saturday and a 
patient was wounded venceremos said adding that soldiers stole 
and destroyed all hospital supplies and medicines 
the report did not identify the brigadista a term often used 
for armed paramedics 
col galileo torres director of the armed forces press office 
denied the radio venceremos report 
whats happening is that the rebels are trying to continue with 
the line that we are violators of human rights and of the geneva 
convention on human rights he said in a telephone interview 
torres said there normally arent hospitals in the area of 
the alleged attack because there is constant combat and military 
units constantly force the guerrillas to move on 
the legal aid office said thursday two of those killed in the 
feb 13 attack in the northern province of chalatenango a woman 
doctor and a 14yearold girl may have been raped 
venceremos claimed feb 15 that soldiers of the atlacatl 
battalion attacked and destroyed the field hospital two days 
earlier it said three medical workers and three guerrilla patients 
were killed 
both the legal aid office and rebel radio identified the possible 
rape victims as alejandra bravo betancourt a 35yearold mexican 
doctor and rosibel dubon a paramedics aide their bodies were 
exhumed and examined feb 17 by the representatives of the legal aid 
office a respected human rights organization 
legal aid said five wounded guerrillas and three other medical 
aides also were killed at the hospital outside los encuentros 
village near the sumpul river which forms el salvadors border with 
honduras 
col ciro lopez roque military commander of chalatenango 
province told reporters thursday there was no field hospital near 
los encuentros he said atlacatl soldiers killed several guerrillas 
including the mexican doctor in combat feb 13 
legal aid concluded that a field hospital was set up near los 
encuentros and atlacatl troops attacked and destroyed the field 
hospital and killed war wounded and the medical personnel present 
it called the attack a flagrant violation of el salvadors 
constitution and the 1949 geneva conventions to which el salvador

federal bank regulators in a report to 
congress released friday rejected charges that their policies 
discourage banks from forgiving part of the huge debt owed by third 
world countries 
current regulatory policy and accounting policies have not 
prevented banks that were otherwise inclined to do so from 
participating in a wide range of negotiated debt reduction 
transactions with borrowing countries three regulatory agencies 
said in a report to the senate banking committee 
critics of current policy say banks are discouraged from 
realistically recognizing losses on third world debt they say banks 
should be permitted to spread the effects of recognizing losses over 
several years currently they must reduce their profit by the full 
amount of any addition to loss reserves 
however the federal reserve board office of the comptroller of 
the currency and the federal deposit insurance corp said accounting 
standards are designed to present a true picture of banks financial 
condition adding accounting policies are not intended to 
encourage or discourage any actions that management considers to be 
in the best interest of the institution 
they cited world bank estimates showing that 20 billion in 
developing country debt has been eliminated in the past two years 
the three agencies also said that banks exposure to developing 
country debt had improved considerably since the crisis first 
emerged in 1982 but was still large for the nations 10 biggest 
banks 
at the end of september the 10 largest banks were on the hook to 
developing countries for loans representing 95 percent of the banks 
capital and loss reserves 
and the report endorsed the continuation of the socalled baker 
plan which rejects taxpayer contributions toward solving the 
problem and encourages casebycase negotiations for additional 
lending rather than any coordinated plan of debt forgiveness 
the approach is named after secretary of state james a baker 
iii who developed while serving as ronald reagans treasury 
secretary 
the bank regulatory agencies continue to believe the 
casebycase negotiated approach is the best method the report 
said 
president bush has said his administration will take a new look 
at the approach but has advocated no specific changes 
on another point the report said the secondary market for 
selling and swapping third world loans is a poor indicator of the 
loans true value many analysts say they are worried because the 
loans are now worth about 40 percent of their original value down 
from 60 percent in mid1987 the regulators said secondary market 
prices may reflect shortterm supply and demand rather than the 
longterm value of the loans 
the regulators report is the first installment toward meeting 
the requirements of a section of last years trade act a second 
report due by may 31 will examine the effects of third world 
lending on bank profits between 1977 and 1987 
the treasury department was supposed to deliver another report 
this week on new approaches for solving the debt crisis but was 
given a threeweek extension

tens of thousands of ethnic albanians 
refused to work on friday to protest ethnic discrimination and to 
demand the resignation of a provincial communist party chief 
yugoslav communist party leader stipe suvar descended a mine 
shaft to meet with miners who began the strike monday but they 
reportedly told another official that you can have us out only in 
our coffins 
the staterun media said 40000 people have staged sympathy 
strikes across kosovo a province of serbia one of six yugoslav 
republics 
schools universities and most businesses closed friday and the 
tanjug news agency described the province as on the verge of a 
general strike and total paralysis 
suvar and serbian party boss slobodan milosevic rushed to 
pristina the provincial capital to prevent possible ethnic clashes 
between kosovos albanian majority and the slav minority 
the crisis has reached critical point suvar said at a 
meeting in pristina the provincial capital we must stop at all 
cost the worsening of the situation 
the protesters condemn serbias drive to secure greater control 
over kosovo by changing the current constitution fearing they would 
lose wide autonomy granted to them in 1974 they also demand the 
resignation of provincial party leader rahman morina who they 
consider an ally of serbian party boss slobodan milosevic 
serbian leaders have asserted that they must have more control in 
kosovo to protect the mainly christian slav minority allegedly 
persecuted by predominantly moslem ethnic albanians who make up 85 
percent of the provinces population 
president raif dizdarevic said he would take all measures under 
the constitution and laws to prevent violations of order and 
peace and thhreats to the constitutional system 
foreigners traveling to kosovo noticed an unuusally large number 
of police an indication that units were sent to kosovo from serbia 
there was no official confirmation 
more than 1300 ethnic albanian miners some on a hunger strike 
have refused to leave their pits at the trepca mines 
later friday suvar met with the trepca mines management and 
said that nobody not even the miners have a right to issue 
political ultimatums to the country 
suvar who spent three hours with the striking miners left the 
trepca mine without any apparent result he would not comment on the 
meeting 
suvar was told by aziz abrasi the director of the mine that the 
miners have told him you can have us out only in our coffins 
about 250 miners have asked for medical aid said dr nedjmi 
zeciri the mines medical officer six were hospitalized for 
exhaustion while the rest received treatement at the makeshift 
first aid station outside the mine he said 
milosevic on friday reiterated his stand by saying in pristina 
that albanian nationalism has caused physical political and 
cultural violence over slavs in the province which is 
unprecedented in europe today 
in november up to 100000 ethnic albanians demonstrated in 
pristina for five days to protest the dismissal of senior provincial 
officials as demanded by serbias leaders

a man who shuttled between central america and 
washington for oliver north testified friday that north gave 
nicaraguan rebels tactical advice after congress banned us 
military aid and once suggested the contras mount a suicide air raid 
on the managua airport 
robert w owen 35 said at norths irancontra trial that he 
made so many trips ferrying information between north and contra 
leaders that he signed memos with the initials tc meaning 
the courier 
despite their extensive dealings owen testified north told him 
he had told congress the two had only a passing relationship 
to my best recollection he said he met me a couple of times he 
said i met you a couple of times i knew you were an activist 
supporting the nicaraguan resistance owen quoted north as saying 
owen told jurors he actually met with north 80 to 100 times 
between july 1983 and august 1984 on contra matters 
among the charges against north is an accusation he lied to the 
house intelligence committee by saying he had only casual contact 
with owen 
on at least three occasions owen said he carried maps and 
photographs from north to nicaraguan rebel leaders at meetings in 
honduras including one in november 1984 the documents he carried 
showed details of the airport in managua the nicaraguan capital 
and also included details of terrain and specific sandinista 
emplacements 
also among the 12 charges for which north is being tried are 
allegations that he lied to congress by denying reports that he was 
giving tactical and procurement advice to the contras in defiance of 
the ban which took effect in october 1984 he was a marine 
lieutenant colonel and a top national security council aide at the 
time 
in 1985 owen testified he took part in efforts to open a 
southern front along nicaraguas costa rican border at norths 
direction he flew to costa rica to view possible sites for an 
airstrip that eventually was built for the effort to resupply the 
contras 
he said he also reluctantly accepted 1000 in travelers 
checks from north as a wedding present the government charges that 
that money was part of 4300 that north is accused of embezzling 
owen said that in march 1986 the role of retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord who he said was running the secret arms 
resupply network for north was being exposed what you had hoped 
to keep quiet is now being openly discussed on the street owen 
wrote to north in a memo secord also faces criminal charges in the 
irancontra affair but has yet to come to trial 
that same month owen testified north asked him to fly to 
honduras aboard a plane loaded with humanitarian supplies then to 
supervise loading of weapons to be dropped to the rebels owen who 
by then was working with a us government humanitarian relief 
effort protested his contract barred him from delivering weapons 
he said between the two of us i would fly down on nhao 
nicaraguan humanitarian assistance office put on my robert owen 
private citizen hat and fly with the ammunition owen testified 
he said when he got to honduras there was no ammunition to be 
loaded 
prosecutors questioned owen for nearly five hours friday norths 
lawyers will crossexamine him monday 
owen who testified under a prosecution grant of immunity is a 
1978 stanford university graduate after college he worked for the 
senate republican conference and was an aide to thensen dan 
quayle who is now vice president after leaving quayles office he 
went to work for gray and co one of the largest washington public 
relations firms 
when contra representatives asked the firm in 1983 to set up a 
fundraising campaign owen said he was sent to north in the course 
of things he met contra leader adolfo calero and eventually went on 
his payroll with undefined duties for 2500 a month salary and 
expenses 
he said his work was more with north than calero 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said he was puzzled why so 
many memos that owen wrote north contained aliases 
i did not want to put his name or my name on documents i was 
writing owen said for security reasons i just did not want my 
name floating around for the same reason i did not want to put 
colonel norths name on documents 
north was referred to as steelhammer hammer and bg 
the latter stood for blood and guts owen testified 
a month after the congressional edict against us military aid 
to the contras owen said north outlined a plan for attacking soviet 
hind helicopters that were being delivered to the managua airport 
owen said he relayed norths idea and delivered maps of the airport 
to calero in honduras 
owen described the armorclad hind helicopter as the most 
dangerous helicopter in the world he said north was concerned 
if these weapons these platforms were targeted against the 
nicaraguan resistance it would decimate it 
the contras fighting nicaraguas sandinista government had only 
three small airplanes of a pushpull type in which there was one 
propeller in front and one aft 
north feared the raid would be a suicide mission undertaken by 
the pilots who would not have enough fuel to return to their base 
owen said 
on another trip south in early 1985 owen said north asked him 
to take a series of maps to calero in honduras north also asked 
that he get from calero a list of military goods needed right 
now

independence day friday by hoisting their national flag over the 
highest castle tower in the capital of tallinn after relegating the 
flag of soviet estonia to a museum 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia said many thousands 
of people attended including the republics communist party chief 
vaino vyalyas soviet television showed crowds in the cobblestoned 
old town of the baltic port 
estonia was a province of the czarist russian empire but it 
proclaimed itself independent on feb 24 1918 after the 1917 
bolshevik revolution the small baltic republic was absorbed by the 
soviet union in 1940 under a secret protocol between nazi germany 
and moscow that divided east europe into spheres of influence 
the blue black and white banner hoisted on friday was the flag 
of independent estonia between the world wars 
the flag of soviet estonia that flew for decades when displaying 
the tricolor banner was illegal was taken down thursday night before 
and given to a local communist historical museum the official 
soviet news agency tass said 
the decision to proclaim feb 24 as the day of estonias 
independence and to raise the blue black and white national flag on 
the gherman tower on that day is an important step toward restoring 
the estonian peoples dignity and recognizing their genuine 
history said a statement issued by the estonian communist party 
the flagraising ceremony also was attended by clergymen and 
representatives of the peoples front unofficial political movement 
the peoples front has led the drive during the past year to 
wrest more cultural and economic autonomy from moscow party and 
government leaders have been replaced by those sympathetic to the 
organizations goals in november the republics supreme soviet or 
parliament declared sovereignty in all areas except foreign and 
military affairs 
the kremlin declared that move invalid but estonia has not 
backed down 
arnold ruitel president of the presidium of the republics 
supreme soviet told a rally outside the tower it should be 
clearly realized that dates of national history and national symbols 
should not be regarded as something hostile to socialism 
soviet officials last summer eased restrictions on the drive for 
more autonomy in the nearby republics of latvia and lithuania as 
well as in estonia 
the local parliaments moved quickly to make ethnic languages 
official and permit use of national flags on holidays sporting 
events and cultural rallies

opposition and government negotiators 
agreed on a proposal friday that would allow new trade unions to 
form and legalize the solidarity independent union movement 
officials said 
the proposal was reached by a working group that is part of the 
broad talks between the government and opposition on political and 
economic reforms 
the proposed labor law is the result of a feb 16 agreement by 
the sides to amend the current labor act the proposal would have to 
be passed by the sejm or parliament to become law 
the proposal would allow trade unions to organize nationally the 
current law that took effect in 1982 restricted how quickly a 
nationwide union could form 
the whole nationwide union will be allowed to shape its 
internal organizations freely the draft was not questioned and was 
accepted said tadeusz mazowiecki the leader of the opposition 
delegation to the talks 
at a meeting with students at the gdansk polytechnic on friday 
solidarity leader lech walesa said that until now i am satisfied 
with the discussions and with the fact that all sides agree about 
the necessity of reforms but i feel a lack of political decisions 
walesa said he has asked his advisers and solidarity negotiators 
to provide a point by point list of the biggest stumbling blocks 
that would require political decisions 
mazowiecki said more talks were needed on how to resolve 
conflicts when rival unions form at the same enterprise 
the official trade union alliance opzz proposed that disputes 
between trade unions be the subject of a worker referendum said the 
leader of the opzz delegation romuald sosnowski on state 
television 
at a news conference mazowiecki said only the most important 
issues should be put to a referendum and that the opzz proposal 
seemed demagogic 
lets hope that despite everything its only the difficult 
beginning of trade union pluralism and that we will push forward at 
the next meeting mazowiecki said 
th government has made it clear that solidarity will be legalized 
only if the opposition accepts a whole package of political and 
eocnomic reforms 
the talks began feb 6 and are expected to last six weeks 
solidarity was born in the labor turmoil of 1980 the first free 
union in the soviet bloc then suppressed and outlawed after the 
declaration of martial law in december 1981 
also friday at least 25 people were arrested during in warsaw 
and the southern city of krakow 
several hundred people gathered in krakows market square to 
protest the beating of demonstrators during a feb 17 rally against 
political indoctrination in schools said rally spokesman adam 
slomka 
police used water cannons and tear gas to break up the protest 
he said 
ten people were arrested he said two people were taken away in 
an ambulance and several others were beaten said a student activist 
who declined identification 
in warsaw police arrested at least 15 supporters of the orange 
alternative an independent group founded in the southwestern city 
of wroclaw that has attracted attention for its satirical street 
events mocking authority 
a crowd of several hundred people watched as members painted 
store windows and the street with bright orange paint

television cameras normally barred from 
federal courtrooms have been used to record us court of military 
appeals proceedings in what a group of news organizations hopes will 
be the start of a trend 
the tv cameras and sound equipment were operating for two hours 
thursday as lawyers argued the constitutionality of drug tests for 
military personnel 
the almost unprecedented presence of the equipment was authorized 
by the threejudge court on a request by 13 news organizations 
including the four major television networks 
timothy dyk a lawyer representing the organizations said the 
results were encouraging 
everybody was very excited about it and pleased with the 
results and the quality of the pictures he said 
dyk said the filming which will be broadcast at a later date 
was done without enhanced lighting and using the courts own sound 
system 
dyk said he believed it was the first time tv cameras have been 
used to record proceedings in any federal court but some years ago 
a federal judge in roanoke va permitted cameras in his courtroom 
a demonstration of television cameras in court was conducted by 
dyk last november for three supreme court justices that was a trial 
run not a live court proceeding aimed at winning support from 
the high court for the idea 
while nearly all states allow some televised state court 
coverage the federal courts have remained adamant in banning 
cameras from the courtroom 
dyk said the military appeals court is not covered by those 
rules adopted by the us judicial conference which helps 
administer the federal court system 
the us court of military appeals is a civilian appellate court 
with jurisdiction over the military justice system 
two cameras were used to record thursdays proceedings one was 
focused on the three judges hearing the case and was manned by a 
cameraman the second camera was unmanned and was placed at the side 
of the judges bench to focus on the lawyers 
dyk said there are no plans for the next step in the campaign to 
change the policy against televised federal court proceedings 
but he said those present thursday felt there was no disruption 
we talked to the judges and counsel afterward and they say they 
saw no problem with it dyk said one lawyer said he was 
nervous but because his wife was there

the new constitution approved by algerian voters 
will increase civil liberties and usher in a new era of democracy in 
this once staunchly socialist nation the interior minister said 
friday 
more than 70 percent of the 104 million voters in thursdays 
balloting voted in favor of the new constitution according to 
results announced by the interior ministry on friday 
about 80 percent of the north african nations 13 million voters 
cast ballots the ministry said clearing the way for a multiparty 
political system for the first time since independence from france 
in 1962 
interior minister aboubakr belkaid said the new constitution will 
allow his country to know more democracy to assure public and 
individual liberties and to establish the sovereignty of the law 
he said it opens the way to a new era in multipleparty 
politics 
the new charter continues the political and social reforms 
promised by president chadli bendjedid after a week of 
antigovernment riots in october left at least 176 people dead 
parliament in the coming weeks is expected to consider a set of 
measures governing the operation of political parties and an 
electoral code 
most algerians welcomed the reforms but islamic fundamentalists 
who have already begun organizing a political association had 
reservations 
islamic leader ali belhadj said fellow moslems could not support 
a pluralistic system that was in conflict with the ideology and 
contradicted the beliefs of our people 
thursday was the third time in less than four months that 
algerians were asked to vote in november voters approved a set of 
political reforms that reduced the influence of the countrys single 
party the national liberation front 
in december about 81 percent of the voters elected benjedid 59 
to lead the country of 25 million for a third fiveyear term 
octobers violent unrest was blamed on an economy battered by 
falling world oil prices algeria derives 95 percent of its export 
revenue from oil 
algerians blamed the centralized socialist government for 
failing to solve the economic problems behind high unemployment a 
shortage of goods inadequate housing and a general decline in 
living standards 
although it does not specifically authorize competing political 
parties the new constitution declares the right to create 
associations of a political character and several have already 
been formed in anticipation of the reform 
the new constitution also guarantees freedom of expression and 
within limits the right to strike it restricts the army to 
defending the national independence the unity and territorial 
integrity of the country 
under the old charter the army had a role in development of 
the country and the building of socialism 
the new text does not refer to socialism the old constitution 
declared that the algerian state is socialist 
islam remains the state religion and arabic the official language

the bush administrations proposal for a 5 
billion reduction in medicare next fiscal year appeared friday to be 
going nowhere 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said he wouldnt support the proposed reduction which 
was also turned down by the house ways and means committee the day 
before 
the idea that we can save some 5 billion i think is 
unacceptable said bentsen whose committee has jurisdiction on 
the senate side over the federal health insurance program for the 
elderly 
medicare costs have been growing rapidly as the number of elderly 
americans increases and as the prices of medical services rise 
faster than the general rate of inflation 
this years medicare costs of 845 billion would grow to 975 
next year without restraints bush however proposed to hold the 
program to 925 billion in fiscal 1990 by limiting payments to 
hospitals and doctors who treat medicare patients and by trimming 
supplementary payments to teaching hospitals 
bentsen however said the financial strain on many hospitals 
would not withstand the proposed cut which would shave more than 
35 billion from medicare payments to hospitals 
the numbers were looking at now indicate many are at the 
breakeven point and this is further complicated by the substantial 
number of hospitals that have had to close their doors and havent 
been able to make ends meet bentsen said 
a reduction of that amount is excessive and wed be going too 
far he said 
the chairman declined to say how much of a savings he would be 
willing to support 
the ways and means committee which has jurisdiction over the 
program on the house side said in a report thursday that it is 
not reasonable to expect providers or beneficiaries to absorb the 
level of reductions proposed by the administration in the medicare 
program for fiscal year 1990

the mayors office has been held by democrats for 
half a century and thats unlikely to change this year but a gop 
writein candidate may throw a small monkey wrench into the 
opposition works in tuesdays primary 
at the very least the outnumbered republicans got a moment in 
the spotlight when with less than a week to go flashy former 
democrat edward vrdolyak made his writein bid official wednesday 
democratic frontrunner richard m daley the cook county 
prosecutor and son of the late mayor richard j daley and acting 
mayor eugene sawyer say they expect little impact on their contest 
though some observers say vrdolyaks bid on the gop side could 
siphon off some of daleys white ethnic votes 
herbert sohn the gop candidate endorsed by the cook county 
party says hell whip vrdolyak hands down 
alderman timothy evans who like sawyer is black will take on 
the democratic and gop primary winners as a thirdparty candidate in 
the april 4 special general election 
analysts say vrdolyak is a longshot for the gop nomination and 
that odds are even worse for a republican winner in april the 
partys last mayor william hale big bill thompson lost his 
1931 reelection bid 
in a radioshow recording session vrdolyak said he hopes to win 
10000 votes that amount could guarantee him the nomination in this 
democratic stronghold and is half what he got from his ward in a 
failed 1987 mayoral bid 
his big challenge tuesday will be to get people to properly write 
in votes with punchcard voting machines said paul green a 
professor at governors state university in suburban university park 
who follows city politics 
its physically very difficult to have legal writeins on a 
punchcard system green said 
but vrdolyak showed he can still draw a crowd at wednesdays 
rally where a multiracial crowd cheered him on and supporters said 
they had more than 50000 signatures on petitions drafting him for 
the race 
vrdolyak switched parties after resigning from city council and 
giving up his post as chairman of the powerful cook county 
democratic party to mount his thirdparty challenge to harold 
washington the citys first black mayor two years ago

republican party leaders completed action 
friday on a resolution denouncing former ku klux klansman david duke 
and denying him any financial or technical assistance from the 
national party 
what makes a republican is not the approval of some backroom 
committee but the approval of the voters who elected me duke 
said when told of the action 
the resolution was adopted unanimously by a telephone vote of the 
11 members of the partys executive committee 
duke was elected as a republican to the louisiana house of 
representatives saturday despite appeals by president bush and 
former president reagan on behalf of his gop opponent john treen 
after dukes election he was denounced by republican party 
chairman lee atwater and bush indicated his only regret about 
opposing duke was that it might have helped him 
mr atwater cannot take away me being a republican nor can this 
committee said duke as far as not giving me any money or 
technical assistance i didnt need any money or technical 
assistance to win this race and i wont need any money or technical 
assistance to win any future races i may be involved in 
the opposition of national party leaders had little impact on 
republican legislators in louisiana who welcomed duke into their 
ranks when he was sworn in on wednesday 
leslie goodman a spokesman for the national party said the vote 
was conducted over the last two days 
she said a copy of the resolution was not available because party 
lawyers were refining its language 
however a proposed resolution made public late last week 
denounced the former klan leader saying that duke may be a 
republican in party registration but he is not a republican in 
gesture deed or belief 
the resolution described duke as a former grand dragon of the 
white knights of the ku klux klan and the founder of the national 
association for the advancement of white people which embraces 
views antithetical to the republican party 
secondly duke and these groups preach doctrines of racial 
religious and ethnic hatred bigotry and discrimination against 
american citizens which are abhorrent to the american tradition and 
have no place in the republican party

police in bombay india opened fire friday on moslem mobs 
protesting the satanic verses killing up to 12 people and an 
iranian leader said the novel might cause a vast battle between 
iran and the west 
officials in london said britain asked soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze to press the iranian patriarch ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini to lift his command that followers kill salman 
rushdie author of the novel moslems call blasphemous 
news reports said police gunfire wounded 40 people during the 
bombay protest by about 5000 people after midday moslem prayers and 
that 11 police officers were injured police said they arrested 300 
demonstrators 
the protesters ignored a ban on assembly of more than five people 
in public places friday the moslem sabbath a police spokesman said 
they set fire to several buses and other vehicles and attacked 
police 
police imposed the ban after some moslems announced plans to 
demonstrate against the book which they say is blasphemous 
reports of the death toll conflicted press trust said 12 people 
were killed united news of india put it at 10 and police 
commissioner sm shangari said eight had died two deaths initially 
attributed to the violence were caused by unrelated road accidents 
he said 
demonstrations also were reported in the indian cities of new 
delhi calcutta darjeeling varanasi patna and siliguri no 
violence was reported 
in new delhi about 400 moslems marched to the british embassy 
and the citys 32officer police force was put on alert 
india banned rushdies book in november fearing it could spark 
sectarian unrest more than 90 million moslems live in india and 
make up about 11 percent of the nations population of 880 million 
the novel also is banned in pakistan south africa bangladesh iran 
and egypt 
rushdie was born into a moslem family in bombay in 1947 now a 
british citizen he has been under police guard in england since 
khomeini first ordered moslems on feb 14 to kill him iranian 
clerics have put a 52 million bounty on rushdies head 
in demonstrations feb 1213 one person was killed in india and 
six died in pakistan where police opened fire on a crowd that 
attacked a us diplomatic office 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani urged western 
countries to state clearly if they agree with the contents of 
rushdies novel 
rafsanjani said moslems want to know if western governments 
support what the book says about islam so that we know what our 
duty is regarding those who are a partner in cursing the prophet 
the ground has been laid for a vast battle between islam on the 
one hand and paganism and arrogance on the other rafsanjani said 
in the prayer sermon in tehran broadcast by the official islamic 
republic news agency and monitored in cyprus 
british foreign office sources said foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe had written shevardnadze urging him to tell khomeini 
that the soviet union shares the international communitys wish to 
see iran respect international obligations and renounce the use of 
violence 
shevardnadze on a 10day middle east tour will meet with 
khomeini on saturday in a rare audience with the religious patriarch 
the soviet ambassador to london leonid zamyatin said the 
controversy clearly shows the need for respect for religious 
feelings and traditions as well as tolerance for the politics and 
values of others 
the 12 nations of the european economic community have recalled 
their envoys from iran and london has shut down its mission in 
tehran iran pulled its ambassadors out of the common market nations 
nearly 2000 moslems rallied in manchester in northern britain on 
friday and called for rushdies book to be withdrawn from library 
shelves they waved placards and ripped a cardboard effigy of 
rushdie to pieces 
britains home secretary douglas hurd said his countrys 
750000 moslems were entitled to protest peacefully and with 
dignity against a book which they believe denigrates and insults 
the prophet of islam 
but to turn such protests toward violence or the threat of 
violence is wholly unacceptable he told a meeting of moslems in 
birmingham 
howe in tokyo for the funeral of emperor hirohito was 
threatened with death by a man who called the tokyo correspondent 
for britains guardian newspaper and said howe wont leave tokyo 
alive he is a great infidel like rushdie the newspaper said 
in istanbul a man called the associated press and said us 
embassies would be bombed he said he spoke in the name of islamic 
jihad for the honor of islam another caller said a bomb was 
placed at the british council office in istanbul but no bomb was 
found police said istanbul governor cahit bayar said security 
precautions were taken at foreign missions in the city he did not 
elaborate 
some moslem priests in turkey denounced rushdie during their 
friday sermons and one said he should be killed the anatolia news 
agency reported 
many people in the predominantly moslem country have said they 
disapprove of the satanic verses but others have opposed 
khomeinis death threat

thousands of world war ii veterans gathered across 
britain some in prayer services some in pubs to remember 
comrades killed by japanese soldiers in the name of emperor hirohito 
in meetings and protests that stretched from britain to hong 
kong south korea and japan some vented their anger at japans 
wartime leader and others even celebrated his death 
protesters in south korea burned japanese flags in two cities 
north korea denounced hirohito as an inveterate enemy of the 
korean people and british veterans in hong kong marched with 
placards saying hirohito was a war criminal and down with 
japanese imperialism 
in britain elderly exsoldiers and former prisoners of war held 
more than 25 services at war memorials and in churches to coincide 
with the emperors grand state funeral 
our purpose is to remember those of our colleagues who suffered 
as a result of hirohitos army said harold payne president of 
the far east prisoner of war association whose 68 chapters 
organized the services 
some veterans were angry that queen elizabeth iis husband 
prince philip joined world leaders at ceremonies in tokyo and that 
he made a slight bow of the head at the emperors coffin and to the 
new emperor akihito 
a spokesman for buckingham palace said the bow was a formal and 
entirely usual act of courtesy to a reigning sovereign 
but payne said before a london church service that drew 1000 
people its also in our minds that by all these dignitaries 
going to the far east the japanese will think theyre exonerated 
from blame 
at the service payne refused to speak to a reporter from the 
japanese communist partys newspaper akahata and said he asked the 
reporter to leave 
many of those taking part were among the 52000 british and 
australian prisoners held under brutal conditions after the fall of 
singapore in 1942 many had worked on the death railway the 
supply line between burma and thailand whose construction cost 
16000 lives 
during the service at londons church of st 
martininthefields one expow spoke of forgiveness 
if we allow bitterness and hatred to dominate our lives it 
will lead to selfdestruction maj lawrence smith said 
but peter dunstan a 68yearold former royal marine who had been 
captured in singapore said in an interview at the church were 
going to the local pub to celebrate putting that soandso six foot 
under where he should have been long ago 
in seoul south korea riot police with shields dispersed about 
70 protesters who tried to march to the japanese protests police 
took 10 marchers into custody protesters denounced hirohito as 
mankinds biggest war criminal and burned japanese flags in 
rallies in seoul and pusan 
during 36 years of japanese rule allegiance to the emperor was 
demanded of all koreans who also were ordered to adopt japanese 
names and speak japanese 
the arch crimes hirohito had committed against our nation have 
not yet been paid off the north korean government newspaper minju 
chosun said 
in japan about 5190 people turned out for 71 antiemperor 
demonstrations across the country and 12 people were arrested 
national police agency spokesman hiroshi arakawa said 
the bitterness comes despite a view generally held by historians 
that hirohito was only a titular leader with little political power 
others while bitter did not want to think about the emperor 
anymore 
no way was this funeral going to overshadow the memory of the 
lads said reginald dunne vice president of the national expow 
association and organizer of a service attended by 600 in the 
northern england city of blackpool

a federal appeals court on friday refused to 
grant a new hearing in the partial merger of two detroit newspapers 
but continued to block the transaction to give opponents a chance 
for further appeal 
the 54 decision left the supreme court as the only avenue of 
appeal for a coalition of newspaper readers and advertisers who have 
sought to halt the joint operating agreement between the detroit 
news and the detroit free press 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia rejected a 
petition filed by the 500member michigan citizens for an 
independent press for a hearing by the full court 
a threejudge appeals panel in january had said the newspapers 
were entitled to a partial exemption from federal antitrust laws and 
could merge business and production departments 
the court said its stay delaying the partial merger shall 
remain in effect until 5 pm est on march 6 1989 to afford 
appellants an opportunity to apply to the supreme court for a stay 
beyond that date 
the washingtonbased advocacy group public citizen which is 
handling the legal work for michigan citizens said opponents would 
decide by wednesday whether to ask the supreme court to take the 
case attorney bill schultz said i think the fact that it was 54 
shows we were right we had a strong shot 
the news owned by gannett co inc and the free press owned by 
knightridder inc in 1986 asked permission for the partial merger 
in order to keep the free press from going out of business 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii approved the application 
last year and opponents began appeals 
under the proposed agreement gannett would initially take 55 
percent of the joint operations profits or losses and after six 
years the split would become 5050 for the next 94 years 
the newspapers would retain separate news and editorial 
departments 
the majority opinion opposing a rehearing written by judge 
laurence silberman argued that costcutting by the newspapers was 
irrelevant to the case 
congress authorized the attorney general to prevent a city 
newspaper editorial monopoly even at the risk of a shared economic 
monopoly because it thought the unusual economics of the newspaper 
industry compelled that exception to the antitrust laws silberman 
wrote otherwise one newspaper may achieve a stunning fusion of 
economic and editorial political power due to the loss of actual 
and potential competition 
the dissenting opinion written by chief judge patricia wald 
said the attorney general had accepted the premise that one of the 
newspapers cut prices to eliminate a rival 
where two independent papers can compete legally and stay 
alive condoning resort by one to pricing which on the record is 
hard to distinguish from illegal predatory pricing in order to 
secure a monopoly protected by a joa will ironically make it even 
more probable that newspapers will disappear wald wrote 
we have taken another vital step toward knowing there will be a 
strong future for this newspaper said free press publisher david 
lawrence we are getting there but after almost three years of 
this process we will not breathe comfortably until all of this is 
finally behind us 
it is time for everybodys lives to go on i would hope that 
everyone including opponents would agree enough is enough 
we are gratified by the decision of the us court of appeals 
not to rehear the detroit joa case james k batten president of 
miamibased knightridder said in a statement released in detroit 
we will be consulting as soon as possible with our attorneys and 
officials at gannett to plan our next moves 
officials of arlington vabased gannett declined to comment on 
the courts decision

a hospital that transferred an 
11yearold girl who was five months pregnant with twins to another 
hospital violated no federal or state law officials said friday 
one of the fetuses was stillborn the other which weighed 9 
ounces died shortly after it was delivered later that day 
the case came under investigation when tallahassee memorial 
medical center filed a report as required by the new state law 
about the transfer 
tallahassee memorial and tallahassee community hospital which 
transfered the girl disagreed on whether the girl was in labor at 
the time 
rheb harbison a spokesman for tallahassee community said the 
case was a classic medical nightmare 
but once you look beyond the shock of it and ask yourself 
whether or not appropriate medical care was delivered you would have 
to conclude as both the federal and the state governments have 
that it was he said friday 
the child walked into tallahassee community on jan 9 
accompanied by her grandmother and complaining of indigestion 
harbison said 
a doctor determined she was five months pregnant with twins and 
that one of the babies was in a breech position harbison said 
she was not in labor when she presented at the hospital but she 
was clearly having problems with her pregnancy he said 
the doctor decided to transfer the child by ambulance to nearby 
tallahassee memorial unlike tallahassee community tallahassee 
memorial has a specialist in premature births on duty around the 
clock harbison said 
the child was upset and did not follow directions to keep her 
legs together to prevent her amniotic sac from dropping further he 
said the doctor put two strips of tape on top of the girls thighs 
to remind her 
in no way whatsoever were her legs immobilized or bound or 
wrapped or any other of the descriptions that have been floating 
about said harbison 
harbison said his hospital received notification thursday from 
the health care financing administration that federal investigators 
found no evidence that the hospital had violated regulations 
prohibiting hospitals from transferring indigent people to other 
hospitals for emergency care 
federal rules specifically bar hospitals from tranferring women 
or girls to another hospital if they are in labor 
the state department of health and rehabilitative services also 
found no evidence that tallahassee community violated a state law 
prohibiting hospitals from questionning patients needing emergency 
care before deciding treatment according to steve konicki an hrs 
spokesman 
ron brafford senior vice president at tallahassee memorial said 
friday that officials at his hospital thought the girl was in labor 
when she arrived and thats what constituted a violation 
community officials acknowledged that the girl should not have 
been sent alone in the ambulance for the twomile trip and said a 
nurse will accompany any patients transferred in the future

the first un human rights report on cuba 
released friday said cuban prisoners complained of torture but that 
fidel castros government denied mistreating them 
a sixmember team that spent 10 days in cuba in september 
compiled the 400page report and the un human rights commission 
which includes 43 nations will begin discussing it tuesday 
in their report the investigators said they received more than 
1600 complaints of human rights violations including 137 of 
torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment 
the torture allegations were in a letter signed by 22 political 
prisoners and handed to two un representatives who visited 
combinado del este prison in havana 
it said the cuban tormentors advised by experts in political 
repression mainly russians and czechs inflict all kinds of 
torture 
gen jose abrantes cubas interior minister told the un 
representatives a number of detainees or prisoners had in the past 
been beaten but those responsible had been punished their report 
said 
he said there are no cases of torture the report said 
most of the complaints 1183 were from cubans who declared it 
difficult to leave the country either temporarily or 
permanently the investigators reported 
cuba has said 20000 cubans could leave for the united states 
each year under an agreement with washington during the first nine 
months of 1988 only 5932 had gone however and the report quoted 
vice president carlos rafael rodriguez as blaming us 
noncompliance 
much of the report was devoted to statistics suggesting a great 
improvement in education and health care since castros revolution 
in 1959 it also quoted cultural figures as praising his literacy 
campaign and promotion of cultural life 
ambassador alioune sene of senegal led the un team whose other 
members were from bulgaria colombia ireland nigeria and the 
philippines 
washington says cuba and north korea are the worlds worst human 
rights offenders and the united nations should send investigators 
to cuba once a year as it does with such other countries as chile 
south africa and el salvador 
castros government has said it will not allow another visit

firemen and volunteers on friday 
battled a 20day fire that has destroyed tens of thousands of acres 
of one of the countrys most important wildlife preserves officials 
said 
firefighters have been unable to check the blaze which began as 
a series of brush fires throughout the northeastern coastal state of 
bahia said leonardo martins da rocha of the brazilian forestry 
institute he spoke in a telephone interview from the rural town of 
eunapolis about 651 miles northeast of rio 
the situation is extremely serious and worsening said da 
rocha the various fires are joining each other and are burning 
day and night 
he said the fire which has destroyed half of brazils atlantic 
forest has swept through more than 75000 acres of the virgin 
wilderness 
the cause of the fire is not known but local farmers often set 
fire to their land at this time of the year to renew their pastures 
or burn garbage da costa said 
he blamed a twomonth drought in the region and a lack of funds 
from the bahia state government for making the task of fighting the 
blaze more than impossible 
i just saw two large plantations go up in smoke in a couple of 
hours da costa said we have teams of four trying to contain 
the fire in spots because we have no money to work with what fire 
can you stop with four men 
just 3 percent of the oncevast atlantic forest which in the 
16th century covered about 170000 square miles along a 3000mile 
coastal strip remains standing today 
some of the forests rare monkeys birds and trees many found 
nowhere else in the world face extinction among them is the 
paubrasil the tree that gave the country its name 
fires also have broken out recently and raged uncontrolled in the 
northern amazon jungle 
environmentalists and some scientists have warned that the smoke 
is increasing world pollution and contributing to the greenhouse 
effect or warming of the earths atmosphere

carletonville plan a consumer boycott and civil disobedience

facilities union leaders said friday 
the boycott was sparked by the reintroduction of strict 
segregation by the extremeright conservative party which took 
control of the town council in last octobers municipal elections 
the council has voted to resegregate local facilities that had 
been opened to all races and to build a fence to keep blacks off the 
town halls lawn the council said last month it was considering a 
curfew barring blacks from the town at night but no action has been 
taken 
carletonville 45 miles southwest of johannesburg is one of 
several dozen towns captured by the conservatives last october 
local affiliates of the congress of south african trade unions

president pw bothas national party government has made no move 
to halt the boksburg boycott even though stateofemergency 
regulations prohibit the organization of such protests 
the government has condemned the conservative partys 
resegregation campaign but has been accused of hypocrisy because it 
has made no move to repeal the separate amenities act which allows 
blacks to be barred from local facilities 
the statecontrolled south african broadcasting corp said friday 
that the act has caused problems at every level of south african 
life 
on a personal level it results in a discrimination that was 
intensely hurtful an sabc commentary said the antagonism 
generated by such legislation has been an insurmountable obstacle in 
the essential task of promoting reconciliation between communities

arrest people violating the separate amenities act but will collect 
information and warn the alleged offender that court procedings may 
ensue 
the afrikaanslanguage newspaper beeld reported friday that 
blacks who visited a library to donate blood in evander another 
town controlled by the conservatives were told to leave the 22

funding for the namibia independence plan 
was delayed friday by a lastminute dispute between black african 
nations and western allies over whether the united nations may buy 
goods from south africa 
the general assembly had been scheduled to approve 416 million 
for the un peacekeeping force that will guide namibia to 
independence after 74 years of south african rule 
but the african frontline states insisted on inserting language 
into the funding resolution referring to un embargos on buying 
military equipment oil or other goods from south africa 
the united states britain and france opposed the language 
noting that secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars report to 
the security council on namibia said it would be necessary to 
purchase goods and services in southern africa to keep down the cost 
of the mission 
a key sticking point appeared to be where the united nations 
would purchase 102 million worth of gasoline and aviation fuel 
diplomats said 
the two major sources for such refined products in the region are 
south africa and angola overland supply from south africa would be 
easier and less expensive 
since 1984 however the general assembly has asked the security 
council to impose a mandatory oil embargo on south africa a measure 
that britain and the united states have vetoed 
general assembly resolutions against south africa are only 
advisory security council resolutions are enforceable 
in 1984 the security council passed a resolution calling on all 
states not to buy military equipment from south africa which by 
then had developed a flourishing arms industry with export capacity 
the african frontline diplomats were also debating friday 
whether the un plan to lease 40 mineresistant vehicles for a year 
at 656000 would violate the embargo some contended that other 
purchases such as trucks radios and construction materials for the 
un peacekeepers barracks also should be barred 
the general assemblys budgetary committee had not resolved the 
issue by late friday a necessary step before the whole general 
assembly can vote for funds for the namibia peacekeeping force 
on april 1 the united nations intends to begin implementing a 
oneyear plan for namibias independence under the supervision of 
the un transition assistance group 
the mission will send 4650 military peacekeepers 500 police 
supervisors more than 760 civilian un staff 820 locally hired 
staff and 620 election monitors to namibia which is also called 
southwest africa 
if necessary perez de cuellar may dispatch a total of 7500 
troops but the initial deployment was limited as a costcutting 
measure at the insistence of the united states soviet union 
britain france and china who together pay 57 percent of all 
peacekeeping costs 
south africa has ruled namibia since it captured the colony from 
germany during world war i 
in december south africa signed accords with angola and cuba 
agreeing to free namibia if 50000 cuban troops stationed in angola 
are sent home by mid1991 
angola asked cuba to send troops to help protect the marxist 
government from crossborder raids by south african troops based in 
namibia and from a rebellion by the usbacked rebels of unita 
the national union for the total liberation of angola

an irish un soldier was machinegunned to 
death by the israelibacked south lebanon army on friday and 
irelands foreign minister told an israeli diplomat the kiling could 
damage israeliirish ties 
in new york israeli un ambassador johanan bein expressed 
regret for the unnecessary death said israel was investigating 
and stressed that the shooting involved only the sla and not israeli 
troops barukh binah the israeli un mission spokesman told the 
associated press 
timur goksel spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon 
said pvt michael mcneela 21 was shot in the chest by machinegun 
fire from an sla position overlooking an irish post in the southern 
lebanese village of hadatta 
death was instantaneous said goksel the fire was not 
provoked 
in dublin foreign minister brian lenihan called in the israeli 
charge daffaires and strongly protested what he called the 
unprovoked killing 
mr lenihan insisted the incident could not but have a negative 
effect on relations with israel said a spokesman for the foreign 
affairs department speaking on condition of anonymity 
the israeli representative expressed regret and undertook to 
convey the views of the irish government to the israeli 
authorities the spokesman said the israeli diplomat was not 
identified by name 
un spokesman francois giuliani said at un headquarters in new 
york that undersecretarygeneral marrack goulding in charge of 
peacekeeping summoned bein and protested strongly this incident 
goulding in a verbal protest repeated the un position that 
israel is responsible for the south lebanon army and we do not 
accept the view that the sla is acting independently 
it was a rarely publicized un diplomatic complaint the united 
nations seldom makes timely announcements of its protests 
diplomatic sources at the united nations speaking on condition 
of anonymity said the incident appeared to be a mistake and that 
the sla militiaman apparently fired without authorization of his own 
superior officer 
but a statement read by giuliani said the recent upsurge of 
slas deliberate and unprovoked firing to unifil positions mostly 
to irish has been persistently protested with the israeli army but 
nothing had come out of these protests 
mcneela was on his second tour of duty in lebanon with the 
700man irish battalion in the 5800member unifil force he had 
planned to marry soon 
larseric wahlgren commander of the un force visited the 
village later and told reporters i condemn the senseless killing 
of one of my soldiers 
most sla members are christians israel trains and finances the 
militia which helps 1000 israeli troops patrol the jewish states 
selfdesignated security zone in southern lebanon 
israel established the eightto10 mile zone in 1985 after 
withdrawing most of its troops from lebanon 
since the un force was deployed in southern lebanon in 1978 
under a un peacekeeping mandate 160 peacekeepers have been killed 
27 of them irishmen

a federal judge on friday dismissed 
racketeering charges against three men indicted last month in the 
pentagon procurement investigation defense attorneys said 
while the men two private consultants and a suspended navy 
procurement specialist are no longer accused of racketeering they 
face a number of other criminal charges stemming from the jan 7 
indictment including bribery and theft of government property 
us district judge richard williams issued his ruling from the 
bench and said he would file a written order next week according 
to gerard treanor a lawyer for william l parkin a defendant 
treanor said the judge agreed with the defense arguments that 
prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to satisfy 
racketeering charges against consultants parkin and fred h lackner 
and stuart e berlin a navy official who has been suspended without 
pay 
defense attorneys said a significant result of the dismissal was 
that the government would no longer be able to seize cash and other 
assets of the defendants under provisions of the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act 
the three men were charged with racketeering and conspiracy to 
commit racketeering as part of a 27count indictment returned by a 
federal grand jury 
the 86page indictment also included charges against teledyne 
electronics of newbury park calif a defense contractor that is a 
branch of teledyne inc of los angeles and three teledyne employees 
but neither teledyne electronics nor its employees were charged 
with racketeering which carries a penalty of 20 years in prison and 
a fine of 250000 the penalty for conspiracy to commit 
racketeering is five years in jail and a 250000 conviction on a 
racketeering charge can also result in forfeiture of any property 
garnered illegally 
attorneys said williams also dismissed some wire fraud counts 
against the defendants but refused to grant motions to drop other 
charges the trial is set to begin on march 27 
in the indictment the first in the governments 212 year 
investigation into the defense purchasing system prosecutors 
claimed that teledyne and three of its officers agreed to pay parkin 
160000 to assist them in obtaining a navy contract related to 
radar 
the indictment contended that parkin then paid lackner a 
californiabased consultant who in turn paid berlin to manipulate 
the contracting procedures so that teledyne was assured of receiving 
the contract 
the governments coasttocoast investigation of the 150million 
pentagon purchasing system codenamed operation ill wind 
centers of allegations that companies paid private consultants to 
illegally obtain information about lucrative contracts prosecutors 
based much of their information on telephone wire taps

a casino owner was fined 15 million friday for 
displaying nazi memorabilia and throwing parties on hitlers 
birthday state gaming officials said 
the nevada gaming control board also placed nine conditions on 
imperial palace owner ralph engelstads gaming license including 
provisions prohibiting such parties and any displays that would 
glorify hitler or nazi germany 
the agency filed a twocount complaint against engelstad dec 8 
citing the collection and parties he also was cited for allegedly 
destroying records pertaining to a pending civil lawsuit 
engelstad had faced possible license revocation on the various 
charges but gaming officials said they worked out a compromise to 
get the controversial issue settled the agreement included an 
apology by engelstad 
he refused comment after a twohour hearing before the state 
gaming commission 
engelstads attorney george dickerson defended his clients 
actions and said they were done in private but gaming control board 
attorney scott shearer contended the fine was appropriate because 
engelstad had damaged the reputation of nevada and its gaming 
industry 
shearer said the action should be a warning that the gaming board 
cares about nevadas image and will take swift action including 
license revocation if similar circumstances arise with other 
licensees 
the agreement capped weeks of negotiations between engelstads 
attorneys and the attorney generals office 
dickerson defended the hitler birthday parties on april 20 in 
1986 and 1988 saying they were conducted for crews who worked on 
the restoration of naziera cars that were to be used in one of 
engelstads automobile displays 
he said his case if it had proceeded before the commission 
would have involved the issues of free speech and right to privacy 
engelstad has said previously his actions were in poor taste and 
apologized at the time the incidents were made public 
the parties took place in a private room at the strip resort 
near a collection of antigue cars that is open to the public daily 
he said he planned to put the multimilliondollar collection of 
naziera memorabilia on public display and believed it represented 
an important chapter in history

a private environmental group contends in a new 
report that preschool children are consuming cancercausing 
chemicals in fruits and vegetables at levels that expose them to 
health risks many times greater than the government considers safe 
the findings by the natural resources defense council were 
immediately challenged by the environmental protection agency which 
said in a statement friday that health risks to children are taken 
into account when setting allowable chemical residue levels 
the natural resources defense council a group specializing in 
environmental and health matters that has criticized government 
policy in numerous areas is scheduled to announce its findings at a 
news conference monday an executive summary of the report was 
obtained friday by the associated press 
janet hathaway one of the authors declined to comment on the 
twoyear study except to say our work definitively shows there is 
a greatly increased risk to children from chemicals in their diets 
the study according to the summary concludes that preschoolers 
are at an increased risk because they consume many times more in 
fruits and vegetables than adults relative to their weight and are 
more vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals 
the summary said the authors had concluded after analyzing 
consumption data and allowable residues of eight carcinogenic 
chemicals on 27 fruits and vegetables that as many as 5500 to 
6200 youngsters among the current population of preschoolers may 
eventually get cancer solely as a result of their exposure to the 
chemicals before six years of age 
this represents the report continued a risk of at least five 
people in 20000 getting cancer because of their exposure before the 
age of 6 years much higher than the one in one million considered 
allowable by the epa in its risk analysis formula 
critics of the study said it raises false fears among parents 
its voodoo statistics this has nothing to do with the 
realities of disease said dr elizabeth whelan executive 
director of the american council on science and health 
there is no evidence of even one case of human cancer in 
children and adults being linked to exposure to the minute pesticide 
residues in food said dr whelan in a telephone interview she 
maintained there are greater health risks in not using the 
pesticides 
the environmental groups study concludes that the typical 
preschooler receives four times greater exposure on average than 
adult women to eight carcinogenic pesticides the group evaluated and 
that in some cases the increased exposure is as much as 18 times 
that of adults 
our nations children are being harmed by the very fruits and 
vegetables we tell them will make them grow up healthy and strong 
concludes the report summary 
the groups conclusions were based on fruit and vegetable 
consumption figures from the agriculture department and on levels of 
pesticide residues found on 27 fruits and vegetables according to 
the food and drug administration and the epa the study said 
preschoolers eat six times as much fruit in general seven times 
as much grapes apples and apple sauce and 18 times as much apple 
juice as an adult the study said it said that half of all fruits 
sampled by the fda in 1987 had detectable levels of pesticides 
in a statement the epa said the agency is concerned about 
potentially higher pesticide exposure to children and infants but 
that it takes those concerns into account when determining levels of 
pesticides that are allowed on food 
john moore acting epa deputy administrator said in an 
interview however that the agency does not agree with some of its 
critics that it should across the board add another potency factor 
in addition to what we use to accommodate the fact that kids are 
exposed more to certain foods containing some level of pesticides 
he added that the agencys chemical tolerance levels for fruits 
and vegetables is designed to protect the average person against 
any short or longterm harmful effects that might result from an 
entire lifetime of exposure to pesticide residues in food including 
exposure during childhood 
the private groups study saw exposure to daminozide a growth 
regulator as posing the greatest risk to children among the 
carcinogenic chemicals they examined with a potential cancer risk to 
preschoolers of 1 case in every 4200 people exposed the epa 
recently said it plans to order the product which is used on 
apples off the market and the producers of processed apple products 
have said for the most part it is no longer is being used by their 
industry

settlement in the 16month dispute the sources said 
attempts to reach board officials friday after word of the 
recommendation surfaced were unsuccessful but grounds for 
recommending such a panel include a finding that a strike probably 
would cause an emergency in the affected industry 
labor leaders have been urging bush to intervene in the dispute 
which centers on easterns demands for 150 million a year in annual 
concessions from the machinists union 
the union contends frank lorenzo chairman of texas air corp 
which owns eastern is trying to destroy the airline and incorporate 
most of its operations into nonunion continental airlines another 
texas air property 
i would hope the president would accept the boards 
recommendation for the good of the workers and the good of the 
airline aflcio president lane kirkland said when informed of the 
mediation boards recommendation 
eastern spokesman robin matell asked for the airlines reaction 
to the nmb recommendation referred to a tuesday letter to the board 
from thomas j matthews easterns senior vice president for human 
resources who was responding to reports the board was leaning 
toward asking bush to intervene 
this course of action as the effect of almost totally underming 
the negotiations the letter said is the nmb trying to create 
an atmosphere for an agreement or do the bidding for one side 
there is no precedent for this action in the airline industry 
the letter said there was no evidence interstate commerce would 
be disrupted during a strike grounds for presidential intervention 
under the railwaylabor act 
several labor leaders familiar with labor laws said it is 
unprecedented for a president to ignore recommendations from the 
mediation board to name an emergency panel 
such boards have 60 days to review the dispute and to make 
contract proposals if the boards final offer is rejected the panel 
can submit it to congress which then can enter the contractwriting 
business by imposing the proposal on both sides in the dispute

so few people are applying for political 
asylum under a tough new oneday procedure that the immigration 
service has scaled back the extra staff it brought in to start the 
program an official said friday 
immigration and naturalization service officials said the 
dropping numbers indicate the program is succeeding in discouraging 
frivolous applications the agency maintains that most 
asylumseekers are here for economic reasons and are not fleeing 
persecution a requirement for obtaining refugee status 
twentysix asylum examiners will be sent home by monday said 
alfonso de leon the ins assistant district director for 
examinations 
one of the two state department personnel on hand to issue 
advisory opinions returned home thursday de leon added 
they are subject to recall but its just not costeffective to 
have them here with the numbers that are showing up or should i say 
not showing up said de leon who oversees the adjudication 
process 
a total of 50 examiners have been on duty here since tuesday 
under a new policy in which asylumseekers face immediate jailing 
detention and deportation proceedings if their cases are denied 
more of the 24 case examiners remaining after monday and part of 
the clerical staff also may be sent back home if the number of 
applicants remains extremely low de leon said 
the ins reported it processed 233 asylum applications tuesday 
the first day of the gettough procedure only two people were 
granted asylum that day 
of 51 applications submitted wednesday none was approved the 
number of applicants dropped to 10 thursday all of whom were 
rejected and detained 
of the 19 processed friday a 20yearold nicaraguan student was 
the only one granted asylum 
i understand he is active in a political party and had been in 
prison for his political beliefs said ins spokeswoman virginia 
kice 
single adults face detention here at the ins minimumsecurity 
port isabel service processing center family groups are sent to an 
american red cross shelter in brownsville where they must report 
for daily ins roll calls or face deportation proceedings in absentia 
ins commissioner alan nelson said monday the program was designed 
to discourage the tens of thousands of central americans pouring 
across the rio grande illegally in southern texas over the past year 
more than 40000 have applied for asylum in the area since last 
may when the ins noted a dramatic upsurge in immigration from that 
region 
until recently the ins was seeing 2000 or more central american 
asylum applicants weekly at its harlingen district at the southern 
tip of the state 
immigration advocates opposed to the new program said the 
immigrants simply have gone underground and will take their chances 
of apprehension by the border patrol those apprehended may pursue 
asylum in immigration courts 
de leon said it was too early to declare the new program a 
success but added i have received reports that the word is 
out throughout central america and even groups in the pipeline have 
turned around and gone back

the federal aviation administration proposed a 
801000 fine against northwest airlines on friday for violations 
including the use of boeing jumbo jets on 8198 flights without a 
required engine bolt inspection 
the airline was also charged with making unauthorized repairs on 
two 747s and failure to comply with a dozen other faa rules and 
directives 
the airline has 15 days to respond to the civil penalty the 
proposed fine amounts to a settlement offer from the faa which will 
take effect if the airline does not object the faa said it first 
outlined the alleged violations in a feb 17 letter to northwest 
president john f horn 
william slattery northwest executive vice president for 
operations described the problems as primarily instances of 
inadequate record keeping and differences in interpretation 
slattery said none of the issues questions the safe operation of 
airliners belonging the minneapolisbased airline he said the 
airline had completed original required inspections but had not 
accomplished repetitive followup inspections 
he said discussion between the faa over the past year had reduced 
the number of alleged violations from 139 to a dozen and the airline 
would continue to discuss the remaining matters with federal 
authorities 
our objective is to ensure northwest is adhering to all federal 
aviation regulations slattery said noting that other faa fines 
against airlines had ranged from 252000 to 95 million 
one case in the latest proposed penalty involved northwest 
failing to comply with an faa airworthiness directive for 
inspecting engine pylon attach bolts on 24 boeing 747s while 
continuing to fly the planes the faa said 
although afterthefact checks did not disclose any defects in 
the bolts these 8198 flights constituted violations of safety 
regulations because the airline did not do the inspections in the 
specified time frame the faa said 
the unauthorized repairs were on flap panels and horizontal and 
vertical stabilizers on two 747s the agency said 
it said other allegations included improperly deferring 
maintenance and flight crew overscheduling 
the problems were discovered during a monthlong indepth faa 
inspection of the airline in january and february 1988 as part of a 
national safety inspection program the faa said it published a 
100page report on the inspections in march which included praise 
of northwest for conducting its own internal audit which led to 
several changes in company practices before the start of the faa 
inspection

sweaters are on sale jelly beans are two bags for a dollar and the 
gun of the month is an m1 semiautomatic carbine 
its no toy and city councilor david scondras wants the 
department store and other stores to stop selling assault weapons 
woolworths is viewed as a wholesome american store every kid 
in america knows about woolworths scondras said friday when 
you say its ok to sell something at woolworths then it sends a 
message it sanctions the buying and selling of assault 
weapons he said 
the high number of gunrelated deaths in bostons neighborhoods 
along with the easy availability of assault weapons has led scondras 
and nine other council members to introduce a measure that would 
outlaw the sale of assault weapons in the city the council has 13 
members 
itll be brought to a vote before the end of march by april 
they wont be selling them he said the measure would not ban 
standard handguns 
los angeles and stockton calif have banned militarystyle 
semiautomatic assault weapons recently in the aftermath of the 
killing of five elementary students in stockton last month a man 
used an assault rifle to spray a schoolyard with 100 bullets within 
two minutes 
ordinances banning the weapons have also been introduced in new 
york new orleans and cleveland as well as maryland florida and 
wisconsin 
robert giroux manager of the downtown store who refused to 
comment on scondras complaints said several other woolworths 
stores sell firearms telephone calls to the companys new york 
headquarters were not returned friday 
gun of the month has long been a feature in the woolworths 
sporting goods department located across from the childrens 
section and upstairs from the pet shop where finches were marked 
down below halfprice friday 
the m1 carbine a smaller lighter version of the 30caliber 
rifle of the us army in world war ii was on sale for 19999 
scondras also was disturbed by a boltaction rifle with a bayonet 
on display at the store 
youre not going to tell me that when youre selling a bayonet 
and a military weapon and all this military imagery youre selling 
hunting gear he said youre pushing a fantasy for rambo 
giroux said the bayonet was removed after the councilors 
complaints were publicized 
woolworths sports department sells fishing gear bows and 
arrows bowie knives shotguns and a limited variety of other 
rifles but no handguns 
assault weapons arent appealing to recreational sports 
theyre appealing to rambo scondras said weve been sending 
this wrong message for a long time that you deal with your problems 
by blowing away your enemies

republicans hung tough friday on john towers 
troubled nomination to be defense secretary with president bush 
saying from tokyo there is no fallback there is no option to 
the controversial appointment 
ill be talking to whoever has an open mind on this subject 
bush said in vowing a personal lobbying campaign upon his return to 
the united states early next week the president said he was not 
questioning the motivation of key senate democrats who have opposed 
the tower nomination 
the nomination rejected on an 119 partyline vote in the senate 
armed services committee goes before the full senate later next 
week 
i wouldnt be in a fight if i didnt think we could win it 
bush said in remarks to reporters shortly before leaving tokyo on 
saturday morning tokyo time 
tower has been battling allegations of excessive drinking and 
womanizing as well as questions about possible conflict of interest 
stemming from the hundreds of thousands of dollars he earned as a 
defense consultant earlier in the decade 
bush said many opponents had noted perceptions of towers 
problems and added thats not a fair enough not a high enough 
standard 
earlier bush had said i stand strongly behind the 
appointment and arranged for a personal lobbying campaign when he 
returns home 
suggestions from majority democrats that tower withdraw and avert 
a bruising battle between the bush administration and the senate 
next week were brushed aside 
tower met at the white house with senate republican leader bob 
dole and vice president dan quayle for a strategy session and dole 
said afterwards there was no talk of a possible withdrawal 
dole added bush would be meeting individually next week with 10 
or so potential democratic supporters in hopes of salvaging the 
nomination 
democrats hold a 5545 majority in the senate meaning that bush 
must pick up at least five democrats to assure towers confirmation 
dole said he believed all 45 republicans were behind tower 
in his friday remarks in japan bush said i want them 
senators to know how strongly i feel and i feel its not a 
personal win or lose its whats right who is best to run the 
defense department and thats whats at stake and im going to win 
this battle 
dole also said the white house is at work preparing a summary of 
the confidential fbi file on tower that can be released to the 
public in hopes of demonstrating that allegations him are baseless 
the committee roll call transformed what had been a debate over 
towers fitness into a fierce partisan battle over a presidents 
right to pick the members of his own cabinet and dole made clear 
the stakes involved for bush 
this is the presidents first controversial vote and i think he 
has a right to expect all of us to support him he said of the 
republicans 
at the same time he said i hope theres no party effort to 
line up every democrat against john tower 
he said a pitched partisan battle could be an end to the 
honeymoon for both georges the president and senate majority 
leader mitchell dmaine 
mitchell said in a statement he has not decided how to vote 
adding that whatever the outcome i sincerely hope that we can 
continue to work with the administration on the nations problems 
despite the fighting words from republicans one conservative 
democrat said it would be best if tower withdrew difficult 
and controversial decisions will have to be made at the defense 
department during the next four years said sen david boren of 
oklahoma 
when controversial decisions have to e implemented it becomes 
even more difficult when the decision maker himself is controversial 
for other reasons we need a defense secretary that can garner more 
unified support 
one democrat on bushs list of possible votes is sen howell 
heflin of alabama another was sen lloyd bentsen a senator from 
texas who introduced his former colleague warmly at his confirmation 
hearing several weeks ago both men told reporters they were 
undecided on the nomination and would make up their minds after 
reading the fbi report 
administration officials also contacted sen chris dodd a 
liberal democrat from connecticut to meet with bush one official 
noted that tower was been one of only five senators and one of 
only two republicans to vote against a resolution censuring dodds 
father sen thomas dodd in 1967 a spokesman for dodd said he was 
undecided 
some democrats were clearly hoping the nomination wouldnt come 
to a floor vote 
boren who said he hasnt made up his mind issued a statement 
calling on tower to withdraw 
sen robert c byrd of west virginia said after casting his 
committee vote that withdrawal would be wise and predicted swift 
confirmation for a replacement nominee 
mitchell at a breakfast meeting with reporters said he wasnt 
suggesting withdrawal but he said he was certain that the 
president will consider all the possible options including that 
one and added that a replacement nominee would probably be 
confirmed in a relatively short period of time 
but bush wouldnt hear of it i stand strongly with john 
tower he told reporters he is my choice my only choice and i 
am standing with him

only five weeks into the new presidency the 
federal reserve board is teaching the bush administration a painful 
lesson it doesnt pay to get into a fight with the folks who set 
interest rates 
since taking office president bush has been suggesting the fed 
not choke off the economic expansion by pushing interest rates 
higher 
the president got the feds response friday and it was just the 
opposite of what he had hoped to hear 
the central bank raised its discount rate the fee it charges for 
loans to commercial banks to 7 percent its highest level in three 
years 
a boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the 
board can send of its intentions to push a broad range of interest 
rates higher in an effort to slow an overheated economy 
three times since jan 20 bush has brushed away worries about 
inflation and said he didnt see the need for the fed to give the 
economy a dose of tighter credit rather he said the central bank 
should worry more about economic growth because he did not see signs 
that inflation was getting out of hand 
those comments were echoed thursday by the administrations chief 
economic spokesman treasury secretary nicholas brady who said 
central bank policymakers were anticipating too much he likened 
the feds efforts to combat inflation by raising interest rates to 
shooting at a duck 
when youre aiming at a duck you can miss it you can aim too 
much ahead of it or too much behind it brady said adding that 
the administration would like the fed to aim a little closer to 
it 
brady did not even try to sugarcoat the message by adding as 
bush had that he did not believe he and the central bank were all 
that far apart 
bush sought to drive that point home again during a news 
conference friday in tokyo where he was concluding the first leg of 
an asian tour before heading to china 
answering reporters questions bush acknowledged that he and alan 
greenspan chairman of the fed differ somewhat on the question of 
the threat of a resurgence of inflation 
we talked about this bush said he was more concerned 
about the most recent consumer price figures which showed inflation 
increasing at an annual rate of more than 7 percent a year 
but i dont think you can make a judgment on one months 
figures bush said but look if hes right on inflation his 
concerns if theyre a little more than mine we should be alert to 
that 
the president went on to say that he and greenspan have got a 
little difference of interpretation now as to how you read the 
indicators on inflation but bush said thats the only 
difference weve got 
bush said he did not like to see interest rates rising and said 
that this argues even more forcefully than ive been able to argue 
that we need to be able to get an agreement with congress on a new 
fiscal 1990 budget that meets deficitreduction targets 
while disputes between the central bank and a president are not 
uncommon some members of congress were taken aback by bradys 
apparent disregard for the threat of inflation especially given the 
barrage of bad news on the price front in recent weeks 
labor costs wholesale prices and consumer prices have all been 
headed higher the government reported wednesday that retail prices 
shot up at their fastest pace in two years last month an annual 
rate of 72 percent almost double the 44 percent increase recorded 
in 1988 
im disappointed that the administration is not more serious 
about this problem rep stephen neal dnc lectured brady 
during his appearance before the house banking committee 
what concerns many observers is that the fed may be forced to 
boost interest rates higher and more quickly than it had intended to 
dispell doubts in financial markets about the central banks resolve 
to fight inflation because of the administrations verbal sniping 
greenspan a longtime republican strategist and close friend of 
bush has gone out of his way to emphasize the central banks 
political independence even though he and the other six board 
members were all appointed by former president reagan 
recognizing the dangers of a public dispute with the fed bush 
budget director richard darman took the unusual step on friday of 
telling his colleagues in the administration to cool it 
he said disputes between an administration and the fed were 
extremely unhelpful adding it tends to be unsettling to the 
financial markets unsettling to foreigners and confusing to 
people who are trying to plan and none of those things is good for 
the economy 
darmans unspoken fear is that foreigners who finance an 
increasing share of americas borrowing needs might suddenly decide 
to dump their dollardenominated assets because of fears that the 
fed had responded to political pressure and abandoned its 
inflationfighting campaign 
many economists believe such a dollar strike is the most 
likely way the next recession will be triggered fears about the 
intentions of foreign investors helped trigger black monday the 
508point drop in the stock market of october 1987 
with the increase in the discount rate the central bank hopes to 
demonstrate its resolve and keep the economy headed toward a soft 
landing the process whereby gradual increases in interest rates are 
enough over time to slow economic demand and thus relieve 
inflationary pressures 
many economists believe the process will work they note that the 
feds credit tightening has already boosted shortterm interest 
rates by around 3 percentage points since march when the tightening 
began they predict overall growth should begin slowing 
significantly by this spring 
if the fed is successful the economic recovery already at a 
peacetime record of six years will keep steaming ahead 
but if inflation keeps rising and the fed is forced to clamp down 
even tighter then bushs worst fears of a recession could come 
true

president bushs diplomatic debut on the world stage 
has been soured and his new administration has been thrown on the 
defensive by a senate committees rejection of his choice of john 
tower to be defense secretary 
and if that werent enough bush got more bad news from home 
during his far east tour friday when the federal reserve board 
boosted its key discount rate to dampen inflationary pressures bush 
has been arguing that there is not enough inflation to justify 
higher interest rates 
with leaders of more than 160 nations assembled here for the 
funeral of emperor hirohito the politically embarrassing news of 
towers rebuff by the senate armed services committee was splashed 
across the front pages of japanese newspapers 
back in the united states television viewers saw reporters 
bombarding bush secretary of state james a baker iii and national 
security adviser brent scowcroft with questions about towers 
troubles not the presidents talks with foreign leaders 
all in all it wasnt the kind of script the white house would 
have written for bushs first overseas journey as president 
although at a news conference in tokyo saturday morning bush sought 
to downplay his disagreement with fed chairman alan greenspan and 
he disputed that the tower problem had cast a cloud on his trip 
the president said he and greenspan have got a little 
difference of interpretation now as to how you read the indicators 
on inflation but thats the only difference weve got as to 
tower 
i think people that are serious students of foreign policy and 
are interested in foreign policy objectives are not going to view 
this trip in the context of a flap over the john tower nomination i 
think theres much more serious points in foreign policy to be made 
and if its beclouded by some political battle back home right 
now so be it bush said 
the selection of tower has been a festering problem for bush 
even before the nomination was announced in january there have been 
repeated questions about excessive drinking womanizing and possible 
conflict of interest involving defense contractors 
dismissing the allegations as rumor and gossip bush has 
steadfastly defended tower and taken the political heat 
im going to strongly continue to back sen tower and i do not 
believe he is going down the drain bush said he vowed to carry 
the fight to salvage the nomination to the senate floor 
white house chief of staff john sununu was on the telephone to 
washington throughout the night trying to devise a workable 
strategy bush made some calls to influential senators but to no 
avail 
the 119 vote against tower split solidly along party lines with 
the democrats holding the edge dealt a blow to bush and the song of 
bipartisan cooperation he has been singing since his inauguration a 
month ago 
putting the best possible face on the situation bush said the 
honeymoons still going fine and im not going to get total 
agreement on every issue 
however he acknowledged that considering he wants tower 
confirmed as his pentagon chief i cant say its a pat on the 
back 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said it would be a 
kick in the teeth to the president if the full senate rejected 
tower sen william cohen rmaine said the committees partyline 
vote against tower would make it harder to forge a bipartisan 
defense policy 
here for the funeral of emperor hirohito the president held 
separate talks over the last two days with the leaders of 17 
nations by all appearances the sessions went off without a hitch 
although the stakes did not seem very high 
in advance of the trip scowcroft had said the meetings would not 
delve into substantive issues nor would they yield any decisions 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the problem 
with tower did not come up in any of bushs meetings 
nevertheless baker acknowledged that towers difficulties were 
hurting the administration 
it is not in the best interest of foreign policy of the united 
states to have a nomination hang fire for this long the secretary 
of state said its very difficult to proceed when you dont have 
one of your major national security players in place 
bush is not willing to play hardball politics with congress and 
blame anyone at this early stage for fouling things up 
in particular he said he had no problem with sen sam nunn 
dga the armed services chairman who singled out towers drinking 
record as a good reason for rejecting him 
i have no acrimony and im not going to be drawn into 
namecalling or a political accusation here bush said im not 
going to do that ive got to work with the senate on a lot of 
issues but i want them to know how strongly i feel 
and i feel its not a personal win or lose its whats right 
who is best to run the defense department the president said

president bush said friday he didnt question 
whether it was right for him to be there while attending the funeral 
of emperor hirohito but he admitted having memories of fighting the 
japanese in the pacific 
i cant say that in the quiet of the ceremony that my mind 
didnt go back to the wonder of it all bush told a news 
conference i vividly remember the personal friends that were in 
our squadron that are no longer alive but my mind didnt dwell 
on that at all 
bush the youngest pilot in the navy when he was commissioned 
was shot down by japanese gunners on sept 2 1944 during a bombing 
attack on chichi jima his two crew members were killed and he was 
rescued by a passing american submarine 
there had been criticism of bush for attending the funeral of 
hirohito the last of the world war ii leaders to die 
bush said his thoughts had nothing to do about whether it was 
right to be here and perhaps having been in combat in world war 
ii maybe the decision was more correct maybe it was more profound 
to be here im representing the united states of america 
were talking about a friend were talking about an ally he

a man called a honolulu radio station last month 
threatening to bomb an american plane unless a jailed member of the 
japanese red army was released by friday a station spokesman said 
japanese police said the terrorist group probably would not attack 
an american target 
danny oshita general manager of the radio station koho said the 
caller on jan 23 demanded the freedom of osamu maruoka and asked 
that the message be relayed to the japanese consulate in honolulu 
the caller who spoke in japanese hung up without identifying 
himself 
oshita said he relayed the message to the consulate and later was 
interviewed by the fbi 
us investigators said there was no indication that a bomb 
caused the hole in the fuselage of united airlines flight 811 which 
made an emergency landing in honolulu after nine people were sucked 
out of the plane and killed 
in tokyo a senior national police agency official said saturday 
it was not realistic to assume the japanese red army was 
responsible for the incident 
police here said last month they feared the lebanonbased 
japanese red army might attack japanese embassies abroad to disrupt 
the funeral friday of emperor hirohito or to press for the release 
of maruoka and hiroshi sensui another red army member detained in 
japan 
maruoka was arrested last november he was wanted in connection 
with a 1972 attack at israels lod airport in which 26 people were 
killed and the hijacking of a jetliner over india in 1977 
the japanese official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
that if the japanese red army wanted to pressure the tokyo 
government it probably would have chosen a target more closely 
related to japan and the japanese people than an american aircraft 
flying from hawaii to new zealand 
he also said that if the plane was bombed i dont think the 
japanese red army would actually explode the bomb so easily 
once it explodes they cant use it for bargaining any more 
he said japanese authorities were aware of the threat to the 
hawaiian radio station

president bush his visit to asia distracted by the 
imperiled nomination of defense secretarydesignate john tower bade 
farewell to japans new emperor saturday and said his introductory 
talks with foreign leaders laid some good groundwork for 
maintaining global peace 
bush and his wife barbara left tokyos haneda airport aboard 
air force one on a more than fourhour flight to beijing at 
midday a heavy rain fell as the boeing707 jet took off bush was 
looking forward to a nostalgic return to his former diplomatic post 
in china but first he grappled with questions concerning tower and 
summed up his two days in japan 
throughout all of our disscussions i found a shared sense 
of satisfaction that eastwest relations are now clearly 
proceeding on the basis of an agenda favorable to the united states 
its allies its friends bush told reporters 
in discussions with middle eastern and european leaders as well 
as leaders of thirdworld nations such as pakistan bush said 
weve laid some good groundwork here and that will help us 
as we go down the road 
bush also said that during his trip to china he will bring up 
human rights but said he has no specific cases to press with his 
hosts the president revealed that he will will meet in beijing as 
well with cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
bush said the united states believes that sihanouk should head an 
interim government once vietnamese troops complete their pullout of 
forces from cambodia later this year he also reiterated american 
opposition to a return to power by the chinesesupported khmer rouge 
he defended tower again in his session with reporters saying he 
had no fallback planned except to lobby strongly with whoever 
has an open mind on the subject the senate will take up the tower 
nomination shortly after bushs return from asia next week 
bush was arriving in china at midday beijing time 330 am est 
washington time 
both countries have come so far since my stay in china bush 
said in written responses to questions posed by xinhua the chinese 
news agency the remarks were released by the white house as bush 
prepared to leave for beijing 
bush said the world remained a tumultuous dangerous place 
but said he was optimistic i would say that any man with 11 
grandchildren is a cautious optimist by definition he has a big 
stake in the future 
on china bush conceded that the united states has some big 
differences with beijing on some issues but said he wanted to 
travel there to show the chinese leaders that he will never take 
them for granted 
bush also said that weve passed the day of confining 
sinoamerican relations to discussions limited to americas security 
interests alone the relationships strong and id like to 
strengthen it he said 
although bushs asian tour so far has been distracted by the 
burgeoning battle with congress over tower the president earlier 
sought to stress the primary reason for his visit to japan emperor 
hirohitos funeral 
during his nearly halfhour exchange with reporters gathered in 
the us ambassadors residence here the president also 
he and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan have a little 
difference of interpretation of economic indicators relating to 
inflation bush said that he does not like seeing interest rates 
raised as the fed did in washington friday and said he believes 
there will be less pressure on interest rates if he and congress 
agree on a fiscal 1990 budget that meets the 100 billion 
deficitreduction target 
said that in his talks with mideast leaders he made clear the 
continuing readiness of the united states to facilitate this 
process in a way is consistent with israels security interests 
and positive developments in the arab world bush has kept open 
the lowlevel contacts that thenpresident ronald reagan established 
with the palestine liberation organization late last year 
admitted that while attending the funeral services for emperor 
hirohito he had thoughts of his shooting down over the pacific by 
the japanese during world war ii but said that he didnt dwell on 
that at all 
perhaps having been in combat in world war ii maybe the 
decision to come to tokyo was more correct he said maybe it 
was more profound to be here im representing the united states of 
america were talking about a friend were talking about an ally 
he said the hirohito funeral was beautifully staged and 
beautifully carried out 
bush met briefly at the imperial palace with japans new emperor 
akihito before sitting down separately with presidents jose sarney 
of brazil and ibrahim babangida of nigeria bringing to 20 the 
number of foreign leaders he has met with in two days of fastpaced 
diplomacy here 
in his remarks to the chinese news agency bush declared that 
the one constant in todays world is change for the most part 
the direction of change is positive from the standpoint of americas 
values and interests 
let me say that i certainly agree that the current state of our 
relationship is healthy he said 
he vowed to work for increased trade with china and pledged to 
keep up the dialogue between our two governments on political issues 
of mutual concern which bush listed as global peace easing of 
regional conflicts arms control and combating drugs terrorism and 
threats to the environment 
he said the united states hoped that a recent easing of tensions 
between taiwan and china could be accelerated but he said the 
united states remains committed to keeping troops in south korea 
which he will visit on monday on his way home to washington 
it would be far too optimistic at this point where the 
deterrence provided by us forces in korea is no longer needed 
he said 
during his two days in beijing bush is slated to hold oneonone 
sessions with the nations top four leaders discuss matters ranging 
from taiwan to trade and even host a texasstyle barbecue 
in bushs meeting with philippine president aquino he vowed 
continued strong support for a proposed 200 million in aid to the 
pacific nation contained in budgets submitted by both himself and 
former president reagan fitzwater said 
bush also reiterated us support for her government and for 
democracy in that country fitzwater said 
bush also met with singapore prime minister lee kuan yew belgian 
king baudouin turkish prime minister turgut ozal pakistani prime 
minister benazir bhutto italian president francesco cossiga 
in addition the president and his wife had dinner with king juan 
carlos of spain and his queen sophia 
meanwhile baker held a separate session friday with japanese 
foreign minister sousuke uno that included a discussion of a 
controversial proposed joint venture to build the fsx jet aircraft 
although the reagan administration approved the agreement for 
japaneseus construction on a new version of the f16 fighter the 
bush administration is reassessing the proposal 
according to yukio okamato an official with the japanese foreign 
ministry uno voiced hope for a smooth implementation of the 
agreement as soon as possible

church bells rang out across this 
island nation saturday as filipinos celebrated the third anniversary 
of the overthrow of president ferdinand marcos but the lingering 
discord here was plain to see 
about 3000 marcos supporters marched saturday demanding their 
ousted leaders return from hawaiian exile 
the military said a soldier and his wife were arrested in a van 
packed with explosives headed toward the site where president 
corazon aquino was to speak later in the day 
the military also said an officer was placed under restrictions 
in southeastern luzon for purported links to renegade lt col 
gregorio honasan leader of the august 1987 attempt to topple mrs 
aquino 
filipinos awaited the return of mrs aquino from japan where she 
attended the funeral of emperor hirohito to take part in 
festivities marking the climax of the people power uprising that 
propelled her to office 
the main celebrations were planned on epifanio delos santos 
avenue where hundreds of thousands of people turned out three years 
ago to protect military officers who mutinied against marcos 
brig gen alexander aguirre said about 2000 troops would 
provide security mrs aquino took office on feb 25 1986 and 
marcos fled to hawaii 
some prominent filipinos who helped put her in power said they 
were boycotting the ceremonies because the aquino government lacks 
direction 
lt col manuel oxales deputy chief of the national capital 
region defense command said the soldier and his wife were arrested 
about 9 pm friday in taytay a few miles east of the celebration 
venue he said the van was headed for manila 
the implication is quite big oxales said asked if the 
explosives were meant for a new coup attempt he said were 
trying to find out 
col marino filart philippine constabulary regional commander 
for southeastern luzon said a police captain was placed under 
restrictions friday in albay province 200 miles southeast of 
manila after admitting contacts with honasans group 
filart said the captain whose name was not released said 
honasans group asked him to join them but he refused filart said 
dissidents had been trying to recruit followers in his area 
honasan was prominent in the antimarcos uprising but then led a 
coup attempt against mrs aquino on aug 28 1987 he escaped from 
custody in april 
on friday about 10000 leftists took to the streets to express 
their dissatisfaction with mrs aquino shouting antigovernment 
slogans and burning a 10foot papier mache effigy of the president 
masked youths burned tires and exploded firecrackers and rockets 
during fridays sixhour protest the rally took place at the 
mendiola bridge about 300 yards from the presidential palace 
many of the disparate groups that rallied around mrs aquino 
whose politics are centrist have since fallen away 
they include leftleaning activists who dreamed of social and 
economic reform and military officers who believe their revolt 
against marcos was taken over by oldstyle politicians in 
revolutionary guise 
mrs aquinos vision of the philippines was the restoration of 
democratic institutions congress a liberal constitution and an 
independent judiciary critics say that was not enough in a country 
ravaged by poverty social injustice and corruption 
i will not join the celebrations because i think there is no 
cause for celebration sen juan ponce enrile said they really 
wanted change for the country but nothing is clear and our 
future is still dim 
as defense minister enrile led a mutiny against marcos on feb 
22 1986 that prompted civilians to fill the streets protecting 
the mutineers from soldiers loyal to marcos 
enrile later turned against mrs aquino she fired him as defense 
minister nov 23 1986 after a failed coup by his followers 
defense secretary fidel ramos another key figure in the 1986 
revolt said saturday the government had not had sufficient time to 
achieve all the revolutions goals 
we should not be discouraged ramos told reporters we 
should not listen that our government is on the brink of collapse 
and that the filipinos cannot do it 
leftleaning activists say mrs aquino tolerates military abuses 
of civil rights in the 20yearold war against communist guerrillas 
and has not pressed land reform and other social programs 
in a statement thursday the womens organization gabriela 
claimed she had completely turned away from the people who 
installed her in power 
arnel de guzman secretarygeneral of the ecumenical movement for 
justice and peace said mrs aquino had installed mere trappings 
of democracy

authorities warned that thousands of central americans were lying

i dont think they will stop coming said juan bautista 
sanchezsanchez a nicaraguan who was detained after his application 
for asylum was denied he said he left home after being arrested and 
beaten for marching against nicaraguas sandinista government 
they will be coming not only for economic reasons but for 
political reasons and i think they will come if i tell them that 
even if they get put in jail here they will not get beaten up he 
said 
but for now the immigration and naturalization services tough

central americans across the texas border patrol officers all along 
the border said the policy has not yet resulted in an increase in 
illegal immigration despite rumors that immigrants were shifting

hunters call it the experience of a 
lifetime a trophy retrieved from the longago days of the american 
frontier critics call the centurys first largescale buffalo hunt 
a slaughter and a disgrace 
more than 15 percent of the yellowstone national park buffalo 
herds have already been killed this winter as they wandered beyond 
the parks boundaries to forage victims of a state law that permits 
the shootings to avert the spread of disease to cattle 
a total of 500 likely will be killed by monday and the state was 
mailing letters today to 250 hunters notifying them that they can 
come to paradise valley to shoot their buffalo if the beasts cross 
into montana 
if any animal even a bloodthirsty montana hunter could be a 
part of this and say its exciting its such stupidity that i cant 
believe it said cleveland amory president of the fund for 
animals in new york this is no longer a hunt its a massacre

people who smoke to control their weight are 
simply redistributing their fat and putting themselves at risk for 
potentially deadly illnesses according to a study published today 
smoking does reduce weight the researchers acknowledged but 
flab stays around the waist increasing the chance for heart 
disease diabetes and early death 
if youre a cigarette smoker who is continuing to smoke in 
order to control your body weight or a nonsmoker considering 
starting up again youre making a bad decision said dr 
reubin andres a coauthor of the study and clinical director of the 
national institute on aging in baltimore 
theres no question that the risk of cigarette smoking is much 
greater than the risk of a few excess pounds of body weight he

democrats and republicans alike say they are 
concerned that the white house forced health and human services 
secretarydesignate louis sullivan to forgo nearly 300000 he was 
entitled to from his medical school job 
i feel what is being asked of you has not been asked of others 
in the past said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
senate finance committee which endorsed sullivan on a 190 vote 
thursday 
sen john danforth rmo agreed saying it is grossly unfair 
to him my hope is we can reopen this issue with the white 
house 
the issue of sullivans severance pay from the morehouse school 
of medicine in atlanta came to light earlier this month when 
president bush was trying to fend off ethical questions about 
several of his other top appointees

democrats who control congress now dominate the 
means of getting there having spent more money raised more and 
received more from special interests than the republicans 
the federal election commission put the price tag for electing 
the 101st congress last year at 458 million not appreciably higher 
than it was to finance the campaigns of the 100th congress two years 
earlier 
however the commission in a report issued thursday found that 
the democrats now have surpassed the republicans in raising money 
for senate campaigns from political action committees in the house 
the democrats have widened the lead they held previously 
one result is that republicans suddenly are sounding like 
threadbare populists while democrats say they have made peace with 
the captains of industry who once regarded them with suspicion

a military jury spared a 
us navy captain serious punishment after convicting him today of 
failing to help vietnamese boat people who resorted to cannibalism 
to survive 
the jury of six navy captains could have jailed alexander balian 
for 90 days and made him forfeit twothirds of his pay for three 
months 
instead they gave the decorated vietnam war veteran a reprimand 
saying he erred last june 9 while his ship was in the south china 
sea but deserved no further punishment than to be relieved of 
command as he was in august 
balian 48 claimed he had been made a scapegoat over the 
incident and that heroes like me are hung out to dry when they get

midway through a question of attribution a 
sudden hush falls over the audience the unthinkable it seems has 
happened queen elizabeth ii has walked on stage 
in fact her majesty is actress prunella scales but given the 
public awe in which the queen is held turning her into a stage 
character is a daring ploy unprecedented in mainstream british 
theater 
a question of attribution with an englishman abroad are 
two plays by alan bennett which under the combined title single 
spies have been a sellout since opening dec 1 at the 
governmentsubsidized national theater the show reopens feb 28 for 
a commercial run at appropriately enough the queens theater 
bennett plays anthony blunt the erstwhile spy who worked as 
surveyor of the queens pictures and he is seen rearranging 
paintings in the queens gallery at buckingham palace when the 
monarch unexpectedly appears 
if you dont believe its her you cant suspend your 
disbelief said scales 56 it gives one an extraordinary sense 
of power on stage because of the way they the audience listen 
for there capturing the queens diction bearing and demeanor 
is the diminutive actress bestknown as longsuffering sybil fawlty 
opposite john cleese on the tvs wonderful fawlty towers and 
the conniving miss mapp in mapp and lucia based on the ef 
benson novels 
scales admires bennetts very cheeky bit of writing but said 
she was determined not to caricature the queen 
there are lots of people jolly good at imitating the queen 
rather better than me she said i thought it frightfully 
important that the portrayal be as real as possible 
this elizabeth is drily and slyly witty every bit the softspoken 
match for the singular spy in her midst 
blunt was unmasked in 1964 as a spy the socalled fourth man 
alongside kim philby guy burgess and donald maclean all cambridge 
university classmates in the 1930s in return for making a secret 
confession to his interrogators he was spared punishment and public 
exposure kept his job as the queens art adviser and retired 
honorably in 1972 in 1979 prime minister margaret thatcher 
publicly named him a spy whereupon he was stripped of his 
knighthood he died in 1983 
its not known whether the queen ever knew she was employing a 
traitor but bennetts play subtly hints that she can detect human 
forgeries as cannily as blunt detects fake pictures 
after 40 years on with john gielgud as a schoolmaster and 
the screenplays for two lowbudget triumphs a private function 
and prick up your ears single spies confirms bennetts 
stature in the top rank of british writers 
meanwhile tv viewers are being treated to a rerun of his 
talking heads a remarkable series of monologues including 
maggie smith playing an alcoholic wife of a vicar and bennetts own 
devastating portrayal of a mentally disturbed middleaged man 
bennett has used treason before to explore the english psyche in 
the old country which cast alec guinness as an english defector 
living in moscow an englishman abroad was first seen as a 1984 
teleplay portraying the wretched life of another traitor guy 
burgess in exile in moscow 
it depicts an episode in which coral browne playing in 
hamlet in moscow is visited backstage by burgess the drunk and 
maudlin englishman abroad 
in the latest production scales plays browne while simon callow 
is burgess 
scales said both plays were about martyrdom about people who 
suffer for their convictions and stressed that playing coral 
browne offered distinct but equal challenges to playing the queen 
with the queen youve got the tapes the broadcasts and 
everything said scales i wish coral browne were as 
welldocumented 
browne 75 who starred most recently in the movie 
dreamchild saw single spies on its opening night the 
queen to date has no plans for a visit 
felicity murgosmith a palace spokeswoman said i cant 
possibly tell you whether shes seen it we have no notes of her 
private visits the queen takes a great interest in whats going on 
in this country 
murgosmith said no permission was necessary for bennett or 
anyone else to put the royal family onstage stage censorship in 
this country finished some time back she said

the united states is helping to finance 
reconstruction of four mosques from cairos rich islamic past in an 
effort to preserve the citys heritage 
egyptian and american officials said the 13 million project is 
miniscule by the standards of the us agency for international 
development in egypt where it administers economic aid of more than 
865 million only israel gets more 
but the threeyear project to rebuild the historic mosques also 
unlocks the door to further use of american development money for 
egypts famous monuments 
often overshadowed by more famous pharaonic monuments cairos 
islamic heritage is second to none but squeezed by an 
everexpanding city and gutted from below by a rising water table 
many of the 520 remaining moslem monuments are in danger of 
crumbling 
marshall d brown the usaid director in cairo did not rule out 
future allocations for antiquities 
the projects chief architect saleh lamei mostafa said in order 
to do the job to his expectations he needs much more money i 
call these reconstructions rather than restorations because so much 
work has to be done he said i could use three times as much 
money but ill do the best i can 
mostafa said the most challenging of the four mosques alzahir 
baybars albunduqdari is so decrepit that it accommodates fewer 
than three dozen worshippers for friday prayers when he finishes 
he said 10000 to 12000 will pray there 
all the worshippers will be thanking the americans for this 
he said 
the projects budget of 3 million egyptian pounds comes from a 
hostcountry fund generated by sale of spare parts machinery 
and raw materials brought from the united states under the aid 
program for resale in local currency brown said both egyptian and 
us officials must approve outlays from the fund which usually 
totals about 700 million pounds 304 million 
in an interview he said the fund generally finances development 
projects i think it seemed to us something that would seem 
symbolically to tell the egyptian people hey the americans are 
pretty sensitive to your historical and cultural past and show 
our support for it he said 
brown said the project originated in 1987 when us ambassador 
frank g wisner and ahmed kadry then chairman of the egyptian 
antiquities organization agreed that something should be done to 
restore the medieval historical part of cairo 
fahmy abdalina antiquities director for islamic and coptic 
monuments said the americans were given the names of the four most 
historic and important monuments that could benefit from financial 
aid 
this is a great large and difficult project that would 
have taken up too much of our own money if we had financed it 
were very grateful to the americans he said 
two of the mosques the early 16thcentury ghuriya and 
15thcentury almuayyad face a narrow bustling thoroughfare 
leading from bazaar to bazaar in one of cairos last medieval areas 
once a marketplace for exoticaladen camel caravans the picturesque 
area provides the setting for the bestknown works of naguib 
mahfouz who won the nobel prize for literature last year 
the atmosphere beckons tourists seeking 1001 arabian nights 
covered alleys donkey carts stacked with vegetables street 
peddlers balancing on their heads loaves of freshbaked bread and 
stalls where craftsmen stitch splotches of cloth into squares like 
those once used to assemble the great arabian tents 
another mosque built by the mameluke amir shaykhu in 1349 lies 
in a separate part of old cairo within sight of the citadel of 
crusaderfighter saladin 
the first reconstruction will be in the spring at baybars mosque 
in a business and residential area about a 15minute car ride from 
downtown cairo pumps have been working for months to lower its 
water table before the reconstruction engineers can go to work 
dating from 1269 baybars has a checkered history it has housed 
a bakery soap factory abbatoir and stables napoleons troops used 
it as a fort and later ottoman turks fired cannon from its ramparts 
against rebellious locals 
today few in cairo even recognize baybars as a mosque taxi 
drivers call it the english slaughterhouse because thats what 
british overlords used it for until early this century 
mostafa specializes in islamic architecture and formerly taught 
at beirut university in preparation for the project he has been 
studying plans left by workers who built cairos islamic monuments 
including 10thcentury manuscripts left by persian artisans and 
drawings by traveling artists in the 1800s when much of the old was 
still alive 
a major architectural challenge in baybars will be to fashion a 
pinewood dome covered with lead sheets to replace the missing 
original which towered 60 feet from the floor 
he hopes to gather enough strong wood from demolished houses to 
rebuild the dome wood for the original came from jaffa in what is 
now israel which baybars seized from the crusaders in 1268 
baybars one of the strongest mameluke rulers is said to have 
designed the enormous mosque himself to use as a rest house while 
playing polo on the grounds he looted stone columns from monuments 
throughout egypt for decoration

soon it will be possible to make a tv program 
that makes fun of tv programs that make fun of tv but eddie 
murphys production company has found at least one more interesting 
and funny way to spoof its very own medium in whats alan 
watching tonight on cbs 
murphy returns to television in a very funny cameo as james 
brown but mostly his credit here is as executive producer 
the hourlong sitcom combined with video sketches whats alan 
watching is the first production of eddie murphy television in 
its deal with cbs well so far so good it was written by former 
saturday night live writers barry w blaustein david sheffield 
and bob tischler 
woven through the sitcom premise is a satire of movies of the 
week game shows commercials documentaries a rapid montage of 
these is presented to 17yearold alan hoffstedtter corin corky 
nemec who plops in front of the set with the remote when he wants 
to get away from the rest of his wacky family 
first theres older sister gail fran drescher who mooches off 
mom and dad and waits for her divorce from juan to become final so 
she can marry slobbish carpetcleaning magnate leonard kling the 
carpet king rob bartlett whose motto which he often 
graphically demonstrates is so clean you could eat off it 
alans brother jeff david packer a porsche salesman is in 
love with his sleek 912 turbo and any other material possession he 
can acquire did i tell you im thinking about getting a fax 
machine he excitedly asks dad at dinner 
dad peter michael goetz is in the corrugated cardboard box 
business he tries to explain to alan why jeff is so mean by 
explaining sometimes a box comes off the assembly line a little 
skewed 
thats why i love my dad alan says in an aside these 
incredible box analogies 
meanwhile mom barbara barrie teaches tap dancing to 
neighborhood youngsters 
my parents tell me i watch television to escape says alan as 
a 7yearold wouldbe hoofer wails mammy in the living room 
what would i possibly want to escape from 
the sitcom plot manages to be very funny on one level rather 
poignant on another while mom and dad yearn to spend worryfree 
golden years at the sunny retirement village of their choice the 
older kids regress moving back home when they cant make it in the 
outside world alan facing the uncertainties of a faraway college 
next year is torn between going off to school and staying in 
philadelphia to be near his highschool heartthrob 
when he escapes to the tv room alan is regaled with an amazing 
array of video sketches that when interspersed occasionally with 
actual clips of television shows make the real things look like 
jokes theres an ad for a hardhitting news report on pit 
babies a documentary on mr ed complete with celebrity 
recollections such as george carlins paean while we were still 
telling jokes ed was working conceptually a commercial for an 
upcoming extravaganza coming sunday to the brendan byrne arena 
its gandhi on ice 
murphy makes a cameo appearance in heavy makeup as james brown 
starring in a cbs movie of the week soul on the rocks in which 
brown goes to prison an apparently intentional reference to real 
life that allows murphy in a dual role as a protester to chant 
free james brown while moonwalking 
eventually the people on television give alan advice on what he 
should do dick smothers says go away to the big university gandhi 
says stay in philadelphia the remote control leads alan to 
jeopardy alans family for 400 says a contestant alex 
trebek intones a selfish cretin he was kicked out of locksmith 
school when he couldnt open his lunchbox correct question who 
is alans brother jeff 
in keeping with the hipness of the hour the surreal ending is 
very funny and thankfully leaves the end unpat perhaps suitable 
for a weekly series

percent and when you put new oil in the french fries you left some

if television gave awards for the most 
improved show of the season this years would have to go to nbcs 
a different world and to producer debbie allen 
in its debut season last year a different world was 
ballyhooed as a spinoff of the cosby show and slotted right 
behind that hit comedy it produced huge ratings frequently landing 
in first or second place in the nielsens critically though it was 
a big yawn 
the show was a vehicle for lisa bonet one of the cosby kids 
packed off to college the show was designed to appeal to younger 
audiences 
i was brought in to turn it around said allen who 
previously helped make fame a hit in syndication i was also 
to help with the morale problem on the set people were unhappy it 
wasnt a company that had a central binding force one of my main

prices and interest rates are rising economists 
are shaving their growth forecasts and many americans are putting up 
the storm shutters preparing for the economys version of winter 
but while the portents are ominous this isnt necessarily the 
prelude to winter particularly so severe a winter as that which 
plagued the economy in the late 1970s and led to the deepfreeze 
recession of 19811982 
there are some differences there are even some encouraging 
breaks in the clouds enough so that some observers remain convinced 
inflation isnt an immediate threat among them it seems are some 
in the white house 
moreover while few economists would claim that a slowdown could 
be made without pain a growing number seem to believe that future 
economic extremes can be constrained and that pain need not be as 
intense as in the past 
more and more of them talk about such things as rolling 
readjustments in which recessions in some geographical areas are 
accompanied by good times in others and downturns in some 
industries are offset by upturns in others 
but aside from this broad factor there are some specifics that 
lend encouragement 
there remains for example a good deal of price competition in 
goods as demonstrated by sears roebucks plan for everyday low 
pricing a policy under which tags on some items will be cut 50 
percent 
the car companies are competing especially through rebates and 
subsidized interest rates moreover inventories are sufficiently 
large to all but assure a continuation of this discounting through 
much of the spring and summer 
if that isnt enough to keep some prices in line then global 
competition might come into play long gone are the days when 
american companies could ignore foreign competition now 
overpricing means lost market share 
another factor consumer resistance is evident in various areas 
of the economy for several years for instance it seemed there was 
no limit to increases in housing prices now some asking prices are 
being cut 
american production efficiency is still another factor billions 
of dollars have been spent on improved plant and equipment in recent 
years and that means manufactured products are being turned out at 
relatively lower costs 
technological changes and ingenious software for example have 
vastly raised the power of small computers without equivalent 
increases in price and those improvements are destined to continue 
since hightech investment is up 
a changed work ethic now helps to reduce inflationary pressures 
wages in the past few years have been limited roughly to 
productivity increases a contrast to the 1970s when they outpaced 
productivity and fueled inflation 
still another factor that makes 1989 much different from a decade 
or so ago is the very manner in which the federal reserve has been 
acting rather than waiting for evidence of inflation the fed began 
its attack in advance 
way back in march 1988 fed economists reasoned that the growing 
labor and industrial capacity shortages eventually would begin to 
force up prices even if the evidence was not conclusive at the 
time the fed began raising rates 
ever since then it has had its foot on the brake keeping the 
economy from roaring out of control in effect it has been muting 
the inflationary danger bit by bit rather than delaying action and 
being forced to come down harder 
that was not the case in the early 1970s when inflation thinking 
became so habitual that carmakers made no effort to hold down wages 
confident they could pass on their expenses in higher prices it 
took years to uproot that attitude 
in contrast todays fed has acted preemptively attacking the 
inflation problem before it developed strongly dosing it with high 
interest rates before it has had a chance to grow into a monster

where drivers passing the 
maximumsecurity nevada state prison see a grim centuryold 
building of handhewn granite blocks and iron window bars disney 
production people saw a set for tom sellecks next movie 
they wanted a building with a forbidden look for hard rain a 
story set in a california prison in the early 1900s 
producer robert cort and director peter yates considered about 60 
prisons and visited 15 sites before deciding to film outdoor scenes 
at the prison located on the outskirts of the state capital in the 
high desert of northwest nevada 
the nevada facility was chosen because it had two yards and we 
could be guaranteed that their security would not interfere with our 
work and our work wouldnt interfere with their security said 
ellen pasternak the movies unit publicist 
robin holabird deputy director of nevadas film office said 
while the disney movie is the most recent planned for the prison 
her office receives a steady stream of requests for information and 
visits from producers interested in filming at the historic building 
when they come scouting we tell them were interested and will 
take extra steps so they know were serious about making a movie 
she said if all we could offer them was a new jail it could not 
have been done 
with hard rain nevada joins a growing number of governments 
marketing prisons as movie sets to attract the millions of dollars 
local economies can generate from hollywood moviemakers looking 
beyond california for new locations and lower production costs 
weve got lots of competition when it comes to prisons said 
bill marsden of the ministry of culture film board in alberta 
canada which tried unsuccessfully to attract the disney co by 
offering a vacant 19th century prison and prisoners from a 
neighboring jail as extras for hard rain 
now there are so many film commissions that when producers send 
out circulars saying theyre looking for a prison theyre sorting 
through photos for weeks marsden said 
ohio caught the attention of filmmakers by featuring the vacant 
state penitentiary in columbus in a prison for rent advertising 
campaign that ran in movie catalogs and magazines 
it described it almost like a real estate dialogue on a piece 
of property complete with electric chair said rj cavallaro 
assistant manager of the ohio film bureau 
ohio stopped running the prison for rent advertisement a year 
ago cavallaro said partly because the campaigns success 
stereotyped the state as a location for making prison movies 
we do have a lot of prisons and we really are grateful that 
filmmakers think of us when they think of prison movies but we also 
have to promote the rest of a very diverse state he said 
iowa state officials recently began an aggressive campaign 
promoting two state prisons by mailing out color fliers to 9000 
movie makers according to wendell jarvis director of the iowa film 
office 
weve had a couple of feature films shot here recently and they 
brought in several million dollars in a short period of time we 
want to open the doors up to bring in more of that money and work 
for iowa people he said 
jarvis said iowa wardens were enthusiastic about advertising 
their prisons and have agreed to let crews film in working prisons 
they realize theyre part of our economic development effort 
just like anyone else he said 
arizonas chief warden no longer allows moviemakers in the 
arizona state prison at florence once a popular location for films 
because of security and discipline concerns according to william 
mccallum director of the arizona motion picture office mccallum 
now passes requests for the florence prison featured in stir 
crazy and raising arizona on to states with available prisons 
weve probably lost millions of dollars because we cant get 
the business he said 
in addition to money the local nevada economy can expect to make 
from hard rain when disney hires local workers and buys 
supplies the nevada state prison itself will get economic benefits 
from the movie according to lt mike budge a prison official and 
consultant for the movie 
they had to give something to the inmates and theyre donating 
money to the inmate welfare fund and with that money were 
purchasing recreational equipment he said 
budge said the prison will get to keep a truck and 350 sets of 
inmate denims disney is supplying for the movie 
theyre also building a permanent guard post and adding fencing 
and razor wire because they want it to look more confining and that 
only adds to our security he said 
the announcement that disney planned to make a movie at the 
prison also improved discipline among inmates 300 of whom will be 
hired as extras budge said 
nobody wants to get locked up and miss their chance to be in 
the movie he said

les miserables is getting ribbed in the city 
that made the musical a hit as new yorks gleefully poisonous 
forbidden broadway strikes sparks in london 
also under the satirical gun are the phantom of the opera 
cats and cameron mackintosh who produced both hits theyre 
just some of the british targets now being lovingly lampooned on 
home turf 
the longrunning spoof of the broadway theater scene which has 
been playing on and off in new york since its 1981 bow at an upper 
westside supper club opened march 2 at londons fortune theater 
forbidden broadway the west end edition is the latest 
incarnation of a minimusical revue that has made a cottage industry 
out of creator gerard alessandrinis skills at parody 
this show has pulled me out of poverty said alessandrini 
34 a graduate of the boston conservatory of music who was in new 
york waiting tables when forbidden broadway clicked 
in eight years his show has ballooned from a twoperson 
nightclub act at palssons in manhattan to a fullfledged london show 
in a 440seat west end theater 
last fall a revised new york production opened to rave reviews 
in larger premises the 130seat theater east 
its more than alessandrini ever dreamed would happen and 
requires him to maintain a sharp lookout for new trends to spoof 
youve got to keep up almost like a critic he said you 
listen to the theater gossip that type of thing 
however he doesnt want to be known just as a parodist i like 
to think of the show operating on different levels if audiences 
listen its informative about the theater and it at least works 
on a musical level 
targets under attack from his fivemember new york cast range 
from patti lupone and madonna to mackintosh and b d wong the 
tonywinning star of m butterfly 
a fourperson london cast will perform about 25 percent of the 
new york material theres a duet spoofing musical divas mary martin 
and ethel merman and a les miserables parody that abbreviates 
the 3 hour and 15 minute musical adaptation of victor hugos epic 
novel into a chaotic pellmell 10 minutes 
other numbers come from the repertory of 150 accumulated over the 
years and some were written especially for the west end 
in the last category are the rsc gavotte referring to the 
governmentsubsidized royal shakespeare company and a piece about 
the british theaters obsession with spies as currently seen in 
alan bennetts hit single spies 
theres also a song lampooning the london stages plethora of 
productions of richard iii 
brush up your richard is sung to the tune of brush up your 
shakespeare from cole porters kiss me kate 
because of the constant twoway theater traffic between london 
and new york alessandrini is confident the american material will 
work here he already looks forward to the parody potential of m 
butterfly which opens in london april 20 
budgeted at 375000 alessandrinis show breaks even at a 
staggeringly low 14000 pounds 25000 a week or 55 percent 
audience capacity 
we couldnt have done forbidden broadway offbroadway for the 
london price said the shows american producer jack mcquiggan 
last season mcquiggan produced an english play simon grays 
the common pursuit on the west end following success with the 
play offbroadway neither he nor his partner joan stein is 
involved with forbidden broadway in new york 
an unrelated london theater spoof wicked lips proved a fast 
flop last year when its british creators failed to clear the 
necessary rights 
andrew lloyd webber composer of cats and the phantom of 
the opera has so far refused to approve mockeries using his 
melodies so alessandrinis show parodies him with its own tunes 
but forbidden broadway happily has other fans where it 
counts mackintosh has put his money where alessandrinis mockery 
is hes invested 7500 in the show

in 1980 50 standup comics tried their luck on 
audition night at new yorks improv two were robert townsend 
and keenan ivory wayans they quickly became friends and ended up 
cowriting hollywood shuffle a film largely financed by 
townsends credit cards that turned into one of last seasons 
surprise movie hits 
now wayans is showcasing his own talents by writing directing 
and starring in im gonna to git you sucka a takeoff on the 
blaxploitation films of the 1970s 
a few years ago me and some friends were sitting around and 
talking about the movies we used to go see wayans said in a 
recent interview the conversation went from remember this 
movie to remember this scene we started laughing and that was 
when airplane was coming out and that was kind of a blueprint for 
me 
starting with the death of junebug spade from an overdose of gold 
chains he was ready to die the preacher boomed im gonna 
to git you sucka takes on such movies as superfly and 
shaft and turns them upside down 
wayans who also cowrote and coproduced the eddie murphy 
concert film raw plays jack spade who helps capture those 
responsible for his brother junebugs death assisting spade are an 
aging band of tough guys played by exfootball stars jim brown and 
bernie casey and musician isaac hayes who wrote the theme to 
shaft 
that was the coolest thing wayans said to be able to work 
with those guys and then to watch them get up there and be totally 
uninhibited thats because they got it they didnt take themselves 
seriously they were having a good time in retrospect they could 
see where the humor was 
fans of national lampoons animal house will recognize john 
vernon the dreaded dean wermer of faber college vernon is the 
villain again in im going to git you sucka he plays mr big 
the man behind the proliferation of gold chains 
my first choice was shelly winters wayans said initially 
it was still going to be mr big but you wouldnt have ever seen 
her face 
wayans project took a long time to get to the screen when the 
film was conceived in the early 1980s he was a relatively unknown 
standup comic and actor it was a time when hollywood studios were 
not interested in financing an all black film they were however 
willing to reconsider if wynans would agree to make a few minor 
changes 
i went to vestron and they kept coming up with the most bizarre 
ways to integrate the cast they could think of how about if i get 
anthony michael hall the breakfast club sixteen candles to be 
my younger brother a kid that was left on the doorstep of my house 
and act black for the entire film and how about if we make one 
of the guys like charles bronson they wanted so desperately to 
integrate it they didnt care if they undermined the picture 
but the success of hollywood shuffle and spike lees shes 
gotta have it made the studios more receptive to wayans project 
and he ended up getting united artists to distribute the film 
it was a lot easier to go in and sit down and really talk 
before we did hollywood shuffle if it was an all black act no 
one wanted to touch it 
wayans grew up in the washington heights section of manhattan 
one of 10 children he was trying to make people laugh as far back 
as he could remember and had plenty of time to display his talents 
at the family dinner table 
there was always an audience and we were always competing he 
said dinner time was sitting at a long table with my parents at 
each end the objective was making the person across from you spit 
food 
his early heros were richard pryor and the late freddie prinze 
who also grew up in washington heights but while those comedians 
had traumatic and tragic lives prinze committed suicide just as he 
became a star wayans has no interest in being a tortured 
artist 
it wasnt a psychological thing where i had a horrible family 
life and i wanted the audience to love me he said there are 
those who just find humor in almost anything who have warped senses 
of humor which im a victim of i just find everything funny and i 
like being funny 
although mr big mutters ominously at the end of the movie that 
there will be no sequel wayans is anxious to continue making 
films and also to help other blacks break into the business 
the recognized pool of talent is so small that the opportunity 
is tremendous said wayans who found roles for antonio fargas 
steve james and his brother damon among others theres a building 
pool of talent right now 
but wayans couldnt help adding i used them all in the movie

franz kafka is reappearing in print 
in his native prague after nearly 20 years but vaclav havel the 
czech dramatist wellknown in the west is in prison and his name is 
nowhere to be found on shop or library bookshelves 
like much else in a nation caught between the pressures of soviet 
reform today and the kremlinimposed orthodoxy of the past 
czechoslovak literature and the arts present a contradictory picture 
hesitant steps toward opening up the statecontrolled arts have 
returned a few previously unshown films including those by 
czechborn academy awardwinner milos forman to the movie 
theaters put a handful of more daring plays on the stage and 
legalized some underground rock groups 
this spring kafkas novels should go back on sale in prague 
they had been banned under the nazis in the stalinist 1950s and 
were out of print again after the prague spring reforms were 
crushed in 1968 
literary journals began publishing long articles on kafka and 
some of his notebooks last year the first time in two decades the 
author saw print apart from a collection of short stories published 
for the 1983 centenary of his birth 
but the new attitude to kafka does not extend to anything or 
anyone deemed a political challenge to the orthodox communists 
installed by moscow to rule after 1968 michal cernik head of the 
czech writers union has said that emigre writers can be published 
however both he and official poet karel sys editor of the 
relatively outspoken literary weekly kmen referred swiftly to top 
officials when asked in recent interviews if works by havel or the 
feted emigre writer milan kundera the unbearable lightness of 
being might appear soon in prague 
communist party leader milos jakes in a december interview with 
the french daily le monde spelled out why 
kundera is not a bad writer jakes said when asked whether 
works written since kundera went abroad in 1977 might be published 
in czechoslovakia but he simply takes his specific attitude to us 
and to socialism we have many more such talents but they 
do not speak openly against socialism 
as an active member of the charter 77 human rights group and a 
writer who refuses to leave his homeland havel draws far more 
official ire than any other cultural figure 
he was arrested jan 16 and went on trial in february on charges 
of sedition and obstructing a public official that could jail him 
for 2 years 
the growing respect for the 52yearold playwright among 
intellectuals and others outside the tiny circle of active 
dissidents inside czechoslovakia is one explanation for the tough 
move 
havel was feted when called to the stage at a folk music festival 
in lipnice last september an action that later sparked official 
reprisals against the festival host music critic jan rejzek 
he was the only dissident greeted by name with joyful chants of 
long live havel when the authorities surprisingly permitted an 
independent rally in prague last dec 10 
in contrast to the public silence in czechoslovakia after havel 
and five other activists were jailed for subversion in 1979 his 
january arrest prompted demonstrators in prague to shout demands for 
his release more than 1000 intellectuals who had never sided with 
havel in public before voiced the same demand in a letter urging the 
communist authorities to open up to the society they rule 
further signs of a stirring in the arts are found in the moravian 
capital of brno where theater is far more lively than in prague 
but political activity carries its price in brno too eva 
vidlarova an assistant director at a brno theater was detained in 
december after organizing a petition to free another jailed cultural 
activist independent publisher petr cibulka 
fear of such repression leaves many czech and slovak 
intellectuals wondering what to do to push for the greater freedom 
most seek like many people in the soviet bloc they often retreat 
into a private sphere of family friends and interests in that cozy 
world characterized by a leading economist as somewhere between 
nirvana and lethargy they can pursue cultural activities for 
small audiences or chase material comfort 
in society at large though they must often work at jobs that 
deaden initiative and cope with irritating consumer shortages once 
rare in czechoslovakia 
as dissatisfaction mounts official attempts at dialogue and 
counsels of patience ring hollow to many 
we know how bad the situation is said sys in an interview 
we can discuss it for hours and days but we live here and we have 
to get out of it somehow 
there are extremes on both sides in the clash between the 
communist authorities and independent groups sys said advocating 
dialogue as the solution 
but intellectuals who attended a meeting with prague communist 
party boss and politburo member miroslav stepan after the petition 
circulated on havel said the increasingly isolated leadership still 
seems unwilling to open up to the society it rules

the talk of okinawa these days is about a gift 
a royal heir has made to the district where he lives in tokyo its 
angry talk 
okinawans are angered because they feel the heir has given away 
symbols of their golden age of independence long ago 
hiroshi sho the greatgrandson of okinawas last king has 
chosen to give the taito ward in tokyo his collection of more than 
1000 family heirlooms and the ownership of a royal tomb in shuri 
once the seat of okinawan royalty and now a neighborhood of naha 
the capital of okinawa prefecture 
the tomb called the tamaudun is a threeroom structure with 
limestone outer walls and sunbaked plazas of coral ground into a 
fine white sand generations of okinawan royalty are buried there 
local reaction to shos decision disclosed in december by a 
tokyo newspaper has often been colored by lingering friction 
between the majority yamato japanese a broad term referring to most 
of the inhabitants of japans main islands and the uchinanju or 
okinawans 
when i heard the news it felt like the yamato people had done 
it to us again said taxi driver tamotsu yonaha it has hurt our 
pride 
his shos wife is japanese so i guess it stands to reason 
said an old woman selling herbal tea at a market but it still 
belongs to us 
a special session of the prefectural assembly was convened in 
january and after two days of discussion the assembly called shos 
choice regrettable 
statements of protest were issued by business leaders civic 
organizations and even some of shos relatives several small groups 
have organized grassroots opposition 
however yoshin hirata assistant director of the prefectural 
education agencys culture division said tokyo and the japanese are 
not to blame he credited taito ward with trying to work out a 
compromise 
they dont want to have us glaring at them forever he said 
it seems that sho simply wanted his estate to be kept near 
home which for him is tokyo 
sho also has told the okinawan government that he believes the 
tokyo ward will make the collection more accessible to researchers 
from all over the world 
after being approached by sho the taito ward one of 23 
administrative subdivisions in tokyo agreed to establish a 
24million foundation to care for the objects and keep the 
collection in one place the ward has a population of about 177000 
though disappointing mr hiroshi sho believes that setting up 
the foundation with taito ward is the best solution and i would 
like to respect his view gov junji nishime of okinawa said in a 
statement 
the 70yearold sho who was born in tokyo refuses to meet with 
reporters 
letters to the editor of the okinawa times which has run dozens 
of reports on the issue have been strongly against the foundation 
according to senior editorial writer akiko yui 
he has lived in tokyo all his life and i think he has little 
affection for okinawa she said noting that shos parents are 
buried in taito ward 
what the okinawans are feeling is the irony that the descendant 
of their king is no longer an okinawan 
sho is the greatgrandson of okinawas last king tai sho who 
died in 1901 okinawa was unified into the chuzan kingdom during the 
15th century and in its heyday traded with china korea and 
southeast asia 
in 1609 the kingdom was invaded by warriors from southern japan 
and required to pay taxes the islands were incorporated into japan 
in 1879 ending the local monarchy members of the okinawan royal 
family were encouraged to move to tokyo and marry yamato japanese 
which most of them did many okinawans believe the royals were 
forced to assimilate into japanese culture 
okinawans have felt they were discriminated against over the 
years by the japanese during world war ii attempts were made to 
wipe out their five main dialects which are often incomprehensible 
to speakers of standard japanese 
many okinawans blamed the government in tokyo for the heavy 
fighting in 1945 on okinawa which was as close to japan proper as 
us forces reached before the japanese surrendered more than 
100000 civilians died in the battle which also claimed the lives 
of 110000 japanese soldiers and 12500 americans 
following postwar occupation by the united states okinawa was 
turned over to japanese administration in 1972 20 years after the 
occupation of japan had ended 
the japanese emperor gave okinawa to america said an 
okinawa times editorial after emperor hirohitos death jan 7 the 
descendant of okinawas emperor has for free given tokyos taito 
ward okinawas possessions 
we wont ask which crime is more serious but to the people of 
okinawa there is just a feeling of misery

by condemning salman rushdie to death for 
blaspheming islam ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has acted decisively 
to put the brakes on moderate trends in iran 
a decade after khomeini led the islamic revolution to power in 
iran many of the countrys senior figures are seeking greater 
freedom and an end to irans political and economic isolation 
factions also are jockeying for power trying to position themselves 
to take over after khomeini leaves the scene 
but the frail 88yearold ayatollah seized on the unlikely issue 
of rushdies novel the satanic verses to reassert his primacy 
over the secular and liberal forces gathering momentum in iran 
his thunderbolt shocked many in the west the decree that an 
author in the late 20th century be put to death for a work of 
fiction reverberated from european foreign ministries to fifth 
avenue bookstores that stocked the novel 
diplomatic envoys were recalled and writers marched in new york 
and signed protests in europe 
a price of more than 5 million was put on rushdies head by two 
iranian clerics the author fled to a safe hiding place and issued 
an apology for sections of the book that could be considered 
blasphemy of the prophet mohammed 
a stern and unforgiving khomeini rejected any apology and renewed 
his call for rushdies blood he also denounced his own domestic 
foes as long as i am alive i will not let the state fall into the 
hands of liberals khomeini vowed in a statement wednesday 
the ayatollah chose the issue and the timing of his assault 
controversy simmered over the satanic verses for months in 
october the book was banned in india the country of rushdies 
birth demonstrations were staged against the novel in other 
countries on feb 12 six people were killed in pakistan during a 
protest over publication of the book in the united states two days 
later khomeini issued his condemnation 
on the face of it khomeinis statement dramatically pointed to a 
sharp swing back to revolutionary radicalism 
six months after an aug 20 ceasefire halted the war with iraq 
the iranian leadership is openly split khomeini sides with 
hardliners who oppose demands for reforms in the countrys 
political social and religious life 
how far he will push that course is anyones guess khomeini in 
the past has used extremism and allegations of western conspiracies 
against iran and islam to crush internal discord and rouse 
revolutionary zeal when he sees it flagging 
the government has been paralyzed to a large degree by competing 
power blocs whose rivalry had been masked by the need for a united 
front during the traumatizing 8year war with iraq 
socalled pragmatists led by parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani have been seeking to end irans isolation and modernize 
its economy 
opposing them is a curious mix of revolutionary antiwestern 
hardliners such as prime minister hussein musavi and interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi and a group of conservative clerics 
who bitterly resist change 
we expected the situation would improve after the ceasefire 
but instead it has become worse said a westerntrained iranian 
doctor echoing what appeared to be widespread sentiments he spoke 
with a reporter on condition he not be identified 
with the end of the fighting some leaders have questioned what 
the revolution has achieved and blamed government inefficiency as 
much as the war for the hardships most iranians face 
the strongest criticism came from ayatollah alihussein 
montazeri khomeinis designated successor 
he called for a candid reevaluation of the revolutions 
achievements and stressed the need to make up for past mistakes 
people in the world got the idea that our business in iran was 
murdering people he added in an apparent reference to reports 
that thousands of dissidents have been executed by the regime in 
recent months 
montazeri declared that instead of safeguarding the values of 
the revolution we shouted slogans instead of providing value to the 
people we only made more and more of the intelligent and active 
people more and more disgruntled and isolated 
some iranians had seen montazeris criticism as a sign of 
imminent liberalization after 10 difficult years in which the 
revolution survived bloody internal strife the war and 
international hostility 
khomeinis bitter denunciation of liberal trends and criticism of 
the leadership dashed those hopes 
the powerful bazaaris the wealthy tehran merchants who still 
have a strong hold on the economy have questioning the sincerity of 
the liberalization process 
they admit their mistakes but they never do anything to 
correct them and the biggest mistake is the continuation of the 
mullahs clerics in office one prominent merchant said 
nonetheless khomeini freed thousands of prisoners in a general 
amnesty earlier this month and has permitted the formation of 
political parties under legislation shelved during the war how 
freely those parties will be able to operate is questionable 
on the economic front iran faces a massive reconstruction that 
officials estimate will cost at least 400 billion shortages of raw 
materials because of import restrictions to save foreign currency 
have left hundreds of factories operating at 30 or 40 percent of 
capacity 
the main shopping precincts are crowded with bargainhunters 
until late in the evening even when whole city blocks are suddenly 
plunged into darkness by the frequent electricity cuts 
the mounting problems have left irans 50 million people 
uncertain of their future and hungry for better days after all the 
hardship and heartbreak

lesbia rocque and her three children 
hitchhiked from nicaragua carrying with them nothing but hunger 
and hope 
at the end of the threemonth odyssey launched by a military 
summons for her 12yearold son the family waded across the rio 
grande and asked for asylum at a rural barbedwireencircled 
government compound americas new ellis island 
instead they were rejected then arrested 
after resigning his nicaraguan government job over differences 
with the sandinistas ramon aguirre tried to open a business in 
managua but the government shut him down 
unable to sleep unable to feed his wife and daughter aguirre 
and his family headed north only to be robbed three times in mexico 
and arrested at the us border where they too asked for asylum as 
political refugees 
now the aguirres share a pale green 12by12 foot room with 
another nicaraguan family at a converted government agriculture 
warehouse where aliens do their wash on stones and children line up 
for juice from red cross workers usually dispatched to natural 
disasters 
i didnt think it was going to be like this i cant go back 
theyll kill me aguirre said through a translator i dont know 
whats going to happen to us 
what is going to happen 
after months of a massive influx of central americans and weeks 
of wrangling over changing us policy on how to handle them that 
question remains unanswered though officials see a few certainties 
the human flood will continue possibly underground and it will 
strain local areas ability to provide for the newcomers 
as many as 100000 central americans may enter the united states 
this year officials say most wade across the rio grande where 
clothes letters to god and even an unused airline ticket can be 
found on the grassy banks left behind in haste or happiness 
they seek a new life in a new land sometimes following a dusty 
road to casa oscar romero a churchrun shelter sometimes never 
making it past the rivers edge before arrest by the border patrol 
after a policy change last week they most often end up living in 
detention either under armygreen tents surrounded by barbed wire 
at a militarystyle base or at the converted warehouse where 
children play in the yard fathers line up to use the single pay 
phone mothers try to fight off boredom and uncertainty 
some spend the chilly nights huddled under blankets in a shabby 
old shed with red plastic walls on two sides 
refugees seeking political asylum more than half of them 
nicaraguans were at first turned loose while their applications 
were processed free to join friends and relatives in miami or los 
angeles new york or houston 
in december the immigration and naturalization service 
restricted the asylumseekers to south texas but that produced a 
squalid squatters camp 
now aliens are given a single interview that can be as short as 
10 minutes and after being denied asylum the same day they are 
arrested and held on 10004000 bonds pending appeal 
they pile up in detention centers here the closest entry point 
by land to impoverished and warscarred countries to the south 
central americans now outnumber mexicans trying to illegally enter 
the country here by as much as 9to1 some days border patrol 
agents say 
at the end of last week more than 1000 were being held at two 
ins detention barracks here in the southern tip of texas 
the turmoil created by this eightmonthold influx is widespread 
even contributing to the racial tension in miami that exploded in 
riots during super bowl week 
local officials here and in miami complain they cant provide 
homes jobs and schooling for this newest migration wave problems 
with the shifting and sometimes contradictory policies as well as 
feeding and clothing the people detained here continue to mount as 
federal officials scramble to enforce an asylum law drafted in 1980 
to accommodate 500 applications not 100000 
catholic bishops in texas even likened the detention to 
concentration camps and immigration experts say the current 
plans are similar to how the thousands from the mariel cuban 
flotilla were handled the circuslike tents used for detention 
they say could end up being permanent and many here on all sides 
of the issue agree that longterm solutions have yet to be proposed 
at the heart of the matter experts say is a continuing paradox 
over us immigration policy which has a tradition of welcoming 
those less fortunate your tired your poor your huddled 
masses as the statue of libertys inscription says and yet now 
turns away those in need 
the bush administration has tried to deter the barrage of 
immigrants by loudly rejecting their political asylum applications 
ins officials say these immigrants flee poverty not persecution 
but critics of the policy say economics and politics were in fact 
married by the reagan administration which used economic sanctions 
and arms for the contras to exert political pressure on nicaragua 
and devastate that nations economy 
when they thought about economic pressure they never 
envisioned this said jose hinojosa a political scientist and 
immigration expert at pan american university in edinburg texas 
those denied asylum will be deported even to nicaragua after 
appeals have been exhausted the ins said 
refugees say their countrymen will keep coming and those who 
work with the refugees say these newcomers will go underground 
some people may simply try to go around the system its 
happened before it will happen again said sister norma pimentel 
codirector of casa oscar romero an internationally known shelter 
for aliens they wont stop coming this is just going to make it 
more difficult for them 
the central american stampede is not only the result of continued 
economic deterioration there but also a 1987 memo from 
thenattorney general edwin meese 
meese directed ins officials to issue work permits to nicaraguans 
while their political asylum applications were pending word 
traveled back to central america and last summer numbers of 
immigrants began a swift rise 
they created the boom said jonathan moore a proyecto 
libertad attorney working with asylum applicants theyve lurched 
from one extreme to the other 
said ins spokesman duke austin we think that a very 
unfortunate sign was sent by the meese memo 
unless an alien falls into a preference group either by family 
relations or special skills there is no way to legally immigrate to 
the united states political asylum becomes the one legal way in 
now attorneys complain that in its rush to slam the asylum door 
shut the ins is prejudging all asylum claims as frivolous the 
term ins commissioner alan nelson used to describe most claims and 
rejecting endangered refugees

moore spoke of a client interviewed for only 15 minutes then 
rejected when the man talked of threats made against his life the 
interviewer said only uhhuh moore said 
she didnt ask any questions we think its become a 
meaningless process moore said 
in the first week of speedy case resolutions the ins rejected 
all but two of 300 asylum applications ins officials say each 
applicant gets a thorough and fair interview which can range from 
10 minutes to several hours 
chris garza a houston businessman stood outside the ins 
detention center near here last week and decided not to take his 
motherinlaw from nicaragua in to seek asylum instead the family 
will wait live underground and hope policies change 
they come here to get help and they get thrown out i dont 
think its right garza said 
mrs rocque the nicaraguan who came with her three children and 
whose husband made it to miami a year ago while the meese memo was 
in force doesnt fear jail here as much as being sent home 
let them do whatever they want to me but dont send me back 
she said 
brownsville mayor ygnacio garza says hes continually negotiating 
with federal officials to protect health and public safety and may 
even bill them for services and if necessary for running schools 
in the detention centers there has been no crime wave as a result 
of the influx he said 
our fear is we dont want to be an open detention center the 
mayor said we have one of the higher unemployment rates in the 
country but our economy is improving now we see lots of positive 
movement then all of a sudden we are faced with a policy decision 
made by our own government that puts those things in jeopardy 
garza and others hope the situation wont amount to a repeat of 
mariel where nearly 125000 cubans came to florida in 1980 and were 
placed in detention camps until they were resettled with relatives 
or sponsors 
about 8000 mostly mental patients and accused criminals remain 
in detention camps 
what does seem clear about the central americans officials say 
is that a permanent solution has yet to be put in place 
the ins obviously believes it can reduce the flow of central 
american immigration by sending a nofreeride signal that may be 
the case sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said but we cannot 
assume that we have taken care of the problem with this action 
the reality of the immigration problem is we have not dealt 
with the deeper problem professor hinojosa said the problem is 
as long as guerrilla wars continue economies get worse and worse 
and worse if we wanted to do something about central american 
refugees we would create a marshall plan for central america 
ins officials while defending their policies say they too 
believe congress must take another look at the asylum law 
only that might soothe the consciences of people here many the 
descendants of immigrants legal and illegal themselves 
there is a lot of emotion here on one side you just have 
people on the other its the law mayor garza said i dont 
know if id do anything different than what these people are doing 
if my family was hungry and i couldnt work 
if the central americans should end up staying those who have 
worked with them say they are a bright energetic honest and eager 
lot according to immigration experts theyll most likely succeed 
my sense is theyll be good workers and good citizens theyve 
been good citizens here said carolyn carlson a red cross 
volunteer from washington dc 
what has happened traditionally historically is that people 
have come over and been treated shabbily and they take it said 
hinojosa they work their butts off and they never lose sight of 
the american dream it takes two to three generations to make it 
and some never make it but many do

television viewers rated the california raisin 
industrys soulful animated commercials the best tv ads of 1988 for 
the second consecutive year but failed to spot any advertising 
breakthroughs a survey found 
dave vadehra president of the research firm video storyboard 
tests inc said thursday that the most popular ads last year also 
demonstrated a heavy reliance on safe standbys such as children and 
dogs 
video storyboards 11th annual list of outstanding ad campaigns 
put in second place the commercials for pepsi and diet pepsi 
including a fourpart ad starring singer michael jackson and an ad 
with actor michael j fox trying to avoid a watchdog blocking the 
way to the soda machine 
ads for mcdonalds restaurants ranked third mcdonalds spent an 
estimated 386 million airing its commercials compared with 68 
million spent by the california raisin industry 
vadehra blamed the lack of advertising breakthroughs on the 
merger mania that has seen huge advertisers swallowed up in takeover 
deals and advertising agencies consolidate after a massive 
restructuring within that business 
nobody is taking any risks everybody is trying to play it 
safe vadehra said 
richard karp director of creative services at grey advertising 
agreed that mergers unsettled the ad business last year distracting 
some advertisers while some ad agency people focused less on work 
than on their security 
in a telephone interview from los angeles where he is judging 
entries in an ad awards show karp said he found there were a lot 
of safe hits and not a lot of home runs last year 
video storyboards compiled its ranking based on responses from 
24000 people who were asked periodically over the past year to name 
the most outstanding television commercial they have seen in the 
past four weeks 
the california raisin advisory board aired its first commercials 
that use clay models of raisins which appear to dance and sing to 
heard it through the grapevine in september 1986 
the ads helped boost raisin sales and created a market for 
licensed products ranging from raisin shirts to a raisin board game 
robert phinney of the raisin board said sales of products 
licensed to use the raisin characters amounted to 500 million last 
year just short of the industrys 600 million in sales of the real 
thing 
in 1988 the board aired a commercial featuring an animated ray 
charles singing with the raisins new spots are planned for this 
fall 
phinney said the raisin ads remain popular because the characters 
are depicted as entertainers rather than pitchmen we have been 
very conscious of not making them salesmen he said 
vadehra said the california raisin industry also got credit from 
some consumers for ads others did using the raisin characters 
he said some consumers thought ads for post raisin bran cereal 
and hardees fastfood restuarants which each have been licensed to 
use the characters in their ads were commercials for california 
raisins 
ranked fourth behind the california raisins pepsi and mcdonalds 
campaigns were bud light beer ads vadehra said consumers cited ads 
featuring the bud light spokesdog spuds mackenzie three times as 
often as the ads that show amazing things that can happen when you 
order a light beer 
in fifth place were ads for isuzu cars and light trucks featuring 
the fictional lying pitchman joe isuzu another campaign introduced 
in 1986 and steadily gaining popularity 
miller lite beer ads ranked sixth followed by cocacola soft 
drinks strohs beer spots featuring alex the dog wendys fast food 
restaurants and levis jeans 
ads by the partnership for a drugfree america the industrys 
volunteer antidrug campaign placed 11th the groups trademark ad 
is a raw egg dropped into a sizzling frying pan meant to symbolize 
the effect of drugs on the brain 
falling out of the top 10 campaigns were ads for bartles amp jaymes 
wine coolers and dupont stainmaster carpets

sears roebuck amp co will close its 825 stores for 
42 hours next week to roll back prices on more than 15 billion 
pieces of merchandise an unusual move prompted by the huge 
retailers restructuring 
the stores will close from 6 pm monday until noon wednesday to 
cut the prices on clothes hardware appliances furniture and other 
items to conform with sears new everyday low price strategy 
some prices such as those on beds will be cut in half while most 
will be reduced by lesser amounts 
we expect it to bring more customers into sears with more 
reasons to shop us than ever before michael bozic chairman of 
the sears merchandise group said thursday 
bozic also announced a television print and mail advertising 
blitz to sell the concept to the public 
sears which reported a profit of 145 billion on sales of 
5025 billion last year currently uses a strategy of frequent 
sales on specific items to attract customers its new strategy 
while not new among retailers is seen as a move to help the company 
modernize its image and better compete with discount stores 
as part of the new pricing system sears promises to match the 
price of any competitor for brandname goods advertised in 
newspapers 
bozic said the stategy will improve the companys efficiency and 
reduce the cost of inventory distribution and promotion he said 
chicagobased sears also will run several sales each year 
we will always have to clear goods he said there will be 
the traditional efforts in july and after christmas but we will 
have a lot more time to look for extra special products to sell to 
customers 
as part of its restructuring sears said it also would offer 
about 1000 namebrand items which it will sell alongside its own 
kenmore and craftsman brands 
last october sears announced the plans to introduce daily low 
prices at its stores edward a brennan the companys chairman and 
chief executive officer said the move was part of an effort to make 
the company more competitive 
sears market share has eroded through much of the 1980s as 
discount stores such as walmart and k mart have grown 
in addition to revamping its merchandising group sears also 
plans to sell the 110story sears tower its headquarters in a bid 
to improve the companys earnings 
the company says it will concentrate on consumeroriented 
businesses retailing insurance residential real estate and 
financial services 
thomas morris sears vice president of marketing said the 
retailer will mount a threeweek advertising campaign touting the 
new pricing strategy as the biggest change in sears history 
our goal is to reach everyone in america several times during 
the launch he said 
one television ad shows shoppers stopping and looking around 
perplexed as the sound of sears employees changing prices with 
pricing guns fills the air 
bozic estimated the new pricing strategy could save the company 
up to 200 million a year through reduced paperwork inventory 
handling and other related costs 
bozic said sears however will not become a discounter 
sears doesnt fit into a discount box or a specialty store or 
department store box he said our strategy is to be a store 
with category dominance supported by competitive prices quality 
products and great values

william farley promises no production layoffs and 
a reinvigorated company when he assumes control of textile giant 
west pointpepperell inc within the next few weeks after a bitter 
takeover fight 
farley chairman of farley inc of chicago won the company 
thursday when the pepperell board of directors unanimously agreed to 
his 58pershare tender offer the deal when combined with 
required refinancing of pepperell debt totals about 3 billion 
the buyout will be financed with 300 million in equity from 
farley 16 billion in highyield or junk bonds sold by 
drexel burnham lambert inc and 12 billion in bank loans 
farley inc is one of the nations largest privately controled 
conglomerates its holdings include fruit of the loom inc the 
nations no 1 underwear manufacturer acme boot co which sell 
dingo and acmes boots and doehlerjarvis which makes diecast 
metal products for the automotive industry 
william farley predicted that pepperell with increased 
advertising and tighter management could match fruit of the looms 
25 percent growth in the three years he has owned the company 
farley went out of his way thursday to compliment pepperell 
employees 
we know we cannot build a firstrate company without firstrate 
employees and i want to commend the men and women who work for west 
pointpepperell he said in a statement 
the businessman has been the target of much criticism in the west 
georgia and east alabama communities where pepperell is the 
principal employer 
however farley told reporters in atlanta he held no bitterness 
toward the employees or management including chairman joseph l 
lanier jr who led the attimes bitter fight against farley 
i think joe lanier did not want bill farley to run west 
pointpepperell and i understand that hes fourth generation 
farley said referring to laniers family ties to the west point 
gabased company 
but farley noted that lanier apparently joined in a unanimous 
decision by pepperells board to accept the offer 
farley said lanier and president donald keller will leave the 
company once the merger is complete in about 30 days 
pepperell officials did not return phone calls thursday but 
issued a joint statement with farley saying directors determined 
that the terms of the offer and the merger are fair to 
shareholders 
one of managements criticisms of farleys offer was a fear he 
would sell parts of the company to pay down the debt 
farley said thursday i love all the company and i havent made 
any decision on what part if any i would sell 
however he later identified saturdays a highfashion line 
produced by pepperell subsidiary cluettpeabody as a likely 
candidate to be sold 
the companies said they agreed to cancel a special shareholders 
meeting set for march 2 the meeting had been called at farleys 
request in a bid to unseat the pepperell directors and replace them 
with a board more sympathetic to the conglomerates bid 
farley said his bid beat out two or three competing offers 
including one from management he said he did not know the size of 
the management offer 
farley fired the first shot in the battle for pepperell last may 
when it notified the pepperell it was seeking to buy up to 25 
percent of its stock 
however farley never reached that level stopping at 98 
percent or 29 million shares in order to prevent management from 
activating socalled poison pills that would make a takeover 
much more expensive those options do not become available until a 
bidder acquires 10 percent of pepperell stock 
instead on oct 24 farley initiated a hostile tender offer that 
resulted in lawsuits and countersuits as actions by state 
legislators and us congressmen and television and newspaper 
advertisements highly critical of the combatants 
farleys initial offer 48 per share later was increased to 52 
per share farley said thursday he had upped the ante to 56 after 
the board put the company up for sale in an attempt to avoid a 
farley takeover 
pepperell founded in 1886 became the nations largest publicly 
traded textile company last year through its 122 billion 
acquisition of most of jp stevens amp co inc its latest quarterly 
financial statement said the company had 9946 million in longterm 
debt 
pepperell has 41000 employees and 22000 stockholders 
for the fiscal year ended sept 24 the company reported a profit 
of 844 million on revenue of 215 billion

frantically working phones and fax machines to give their clients an 
edge over the competition 
plastic surgeons a mortuary the bulgarian film industry a 
psychologist a doughnut shop and even yogis new voice now claim 
publicists 
in los angeles the nations secondlargest media market 
publicity is proving to be as important and often more economical 
than normal promotions 
public relations wiz michael levine finds that for every ad 
inch an editorial inch is worth about 10 times the amount 
public relations no longer belongs to just the big people 
said publicist debra gold who promotes local communityinvolvement 
stories on behalf of burbanks valley funeral home for small 
businesses public relations is so much more costefficient than 
advertising 
the boom in smaller regional publicity operations reflects a 
national trend industry giant hill and knowlton collected fees of 
1145 million in 1987 up 143 percent from 1986 rival firm 
bursonmarsteller claimed revenue of 1487 million in 1988 up 176 
percent from 1987 billings of 1264 million 
press releases and announcements herald the successes of the 
venetian blind the california raisins law firms hospitals and the 
beverly hills high school 
joe molina whose jmpr firm stumps for budget rentacar of 
beverly hills which specializes in exotic vehicles estimates that 
on annual public relations billings of 70000 jmpr has delivered 
up to 7 million worth of promotion for the rental agency 
the media has generated constant word of mouth for the 
franchise molina said claiming story placement in forbes newsweek 
and the television shows pm magazine today and good 
morning america 
we built them budget into something they wouldnt be 
otherwise molina said 
charging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars a month 
press agents try to build a specific image for a customer which 
some clients believe advertisements cant always do 
you cant be credible today without being visible said 
levine whose firm plugs the likes of charlton heston designer 
donuts and tommy tang a local thai restaurateur with tommy 
were trying to establish a chef as a star in the renowned los 
angeles chef wolfgang pucktype situation 
publicist levine himself has a publicist who promotes levines 
the address book an index to help the starstruck find the 
stars 
then theres mansion seller mike silverman and his publicist 
jane harman 
harman boasts that silverman one of beverly hills most 
successful and visible real estate brokers has been featured on 
60 minutes usa today the tv show the cable news network 
and in the los angeles times the new york times usa today 
interview magazine and the associated press 
the media exposure she said is aimed at making silverman as 
large a star as his bigwig home buyers who include zsa zsa gabor 
and kenny rogers 
a celebrity name is a very important commodity to people who 
have the money to buy these kinds of houses harman said my 
primary goal is that he be seen as the ultimate realtor to the 
celebrities 
news stories establish a mystique and the glamor i think 
weve been terribly successful with him but mike has really made 
his reputation on his own harman said 
some publicists can be a nuisance but others can be invaluable 
especially when hollywood celebrities land in the hospital

narrower range of vehicles

chrysler were 151 percent below the rate through midfebruary last 
year

year compared with last year going to a daily rate of 3105 
compared with a 2899 daily rate last year

an investment group that includes oil 
tycoon gordon p getty says its 24 billion cash bid for emhart 
corp is friendly and it wants to meet with management soon to 
discuss the proposal 
but emhart officials have said little since late thursdays 
surprise offer from new yorkbased topper acquisition corp 
emharts board of directors will carefully study the offer in 
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisers said 
peter l scott emhart chairman and chief executive officer 
after completing this evaluation the board will promptly 
announce its conclusion and recommendation he said prior to 
that time we strongly urge emhart shareholders not to take any 
action with respect to the offer topper offered 35 per share in 
cash for all outstanding common shares of emhart which manufactures 
a wide range of consumer and industrial products including lawn and 
garden equipment hardware and materials used to make footwear 
the topper partnership includes getty and new york real estate 
developers lawrence fisher 78 and brother zachary fisher 77 the 
deadline for the tender offer is midnight march 23 
emharts stock closed at 3275 a share down 25 cents on the 
new york stock exchange thursday toppers offer was disclosed after 
the market closed emharts stock though has risen almost 10 a 
share in the past month amid takeover rumors 
one industry analyst said toppers bid appears too good to refuse 
the way their press release reads they are making a tender 
offer and they dont care what management thinks said rod cerny 
chief investment officer at kirkpatrick pettis smith polian inc 
of omaha neb 
but if you take into consideration that the stock one month ago 
was selling at about 23 to 24 this is a premium of about 50 
percent said cerny who is a shareholder we could hardly 
imagine management feeling that this is some kind of undervalued bid 
our contention all along was that the companys value is in the 
mid30s cerny said 
cerny said emhart which has about 1000 employees is made up of 
numerous subsidiaries that operate separately making it ideal for a 
traditional buyandbustup takeover strategy 
such a strategy would allow the acquirers to borrow money to 
complete the deal and then pay some of that money back by selling 
off subsidiaries he added that he didnt know whether topper was 
planning to do that 
topper an investment vehicle created for the acquisition of 
emhart notified emhart that it would nominate a slate of directors 
for the annual meeting scheduled for april 27 depending upon the 
boards response to the offer it might conduct a proxy contest for 
control of the board 
topper said in a statement that it would like to keep the 
companys headquarters in farmington and leave emharts management 
in place 
we strongly desire to negotiate an amicable transaction and we 
would like to meet with emhart management as soon as possible to 
discuss our offer topper said 
we believe our offer represents an opportunity for emhart 
shareholders to realize exceptional value it represents a 43 
percent premium over the market price of emhart stock on jan 23 
1989 before the recent runup of the companys stock the 
partnership said 
our objective is to acquire own and operate emhart and to 
continue to build its manufacturing businesses over the long term 
they said 
topper also said it has lined up financing chemical bank and two 
other banks have committed 12 billion and an affiliate of first 
boston corp said it would provide 11 billion in shortterm 
financing the fishers and getty also plan to kick in about 300 
million of their own money 
the fisher brothers are worth at least 800 million forbes 
magazine has said their participation in a nevercompleted 1984 bid 
for walt disney productions led by financier saul p steinberg 
netted them 30 million 
getty 54 gained his fortune through an inheritance from his 
father jean paul getty who turned his fathers oil company into a 
worldwide oil behemoth 
getty is worth at least 450 million and perhaps more than 1 
billion according to forbes

the federal reserve board ignoring critical 
comments by the bush administration concerning its 
inflationfighting efforts today boosted its key lending rate to 7 
percent from 65 percent in a move likely to trigger increases in 
interest rates charged consumers 
the central bank announced it was raising its discount rate the 
interest it charges on loans to member banks in light of 
inflationary pressures in the economy and after receiving requests 
from 10 of its 12 district banks 
the action taken on a 61 vote with fed member martha seger 
dissenting came just a day after treasury secretary nicholas brady 
issued the strongest critical comments yet by the new administration 
regarding the feds efforts to push interest rates higher in an 
effort to combat inflation 
i dont see as strong evidence of inflation right now as does 
the federal reserve brady told the house banking committee 
boosting the discount to the highest level in nearly three years 
is the most dramatic inflationfighting move the fed could have 
taken discount rate increases often signal that other shortterm 
loans from adjustablerate mortgages to automobile loans will soon 
become more expensive 
bradys comments followed several weeks of verbal jousting 
between the administration and the central bank president bush on 
several occasions has said that he believed the central bank was 
overly concerned about inflation and should be more worried that 
high interest rates could impede economic growth 
another member of the administration budget director richard g 
darman attempted today to get his colleagues to quiet their 
criticisms he said he believed it was extremely unhelpful just as 
a general matter to have an overt visible disagreement between an 
administration and the central bank 
he said such an open dispute tends to be unsettling to the 
markets and generally harmful to prospects for economic growth 
darman commented during a budget briefing for reporters that was 
interupted when an aide brought him a wire service story announcing 
the discount rate increase 
the increase came one day after two major banks chase manhattan 
bank and republic national bank of new york raised their prime 
lending rates to 115 percent from 11 percent 
several other large banks raised their prime rates as well today 
after the feds announcement both the dollar and stock and bond 
markets moved lower in trading today 
banks use the prime rate as a base for setting rates on a wide 
variety of business and consumer loans including car loans and 
adjustablerate home mortgages 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co in new york said 
the feds action had been widely anticipated and there even was some 
speculation the central bank might boost the rate a full percentage 
point rather than a halfpoint he said further tightening could be 
expected as the fed tries to control escalating prices 
it was an appropriate action and does bring the fed into 
rough alignment with the amount of restraint needed to stay even 
with the new inflation threat jones said we are in the process 
of accelerating inflation and it will require further fed 
tightening steps 
the fed last raised the discount rate on aug 9 to 65 percent 
from 6 percent todays increase was the third since alan greenspan 
took over chairmanship of the central bank in august 1987 
the discount rate last was at 7 percent from march 7 1986 to 
april 18 1986 when it dropped to 65 percent the rate bottomed at 
55 percent in august 1986 and since then has been on the rise 
the feds latest action follows two particularly worrisome 
inflation reports for the month of january 
the labor department said its producer price index jumped 10 
percent a 127 percent annual rate and the consumer price index 
soared 06 percent a 72 percent annual rate and the biggest jump 
in two years 
by increasing interest rates the fed hopes to slow down economic 
activity and thus ease inflationary pressures in the economy 
fed member seger the sole dissenter to todays action has 
expressed concern that higher interest rates could slow economic 
growth too much and hurt the ailing savings and loan industry 
greenspan told the senate banking committee on thursday that an 
increase of one percentage point in interest rates adds 3 billion 
to 4 billion to savings institutions operating losses 
the fed has been steadily nudging up interest rates since march 
1988 in an effort to check inflation by slowing economic growth the 
federal funds rate the interest that banks charge among themselves 
for overnight loans and is heavily influenced by fed policy has 
risen more than three percentage points over the last year topping 
95 percent thursday 
in congressional testimony wednesday greenspan called the latest 
increase in consumer prices disturbing and blamed it in part on 
recent acceleration in wage increases 
he said price increases had reached unacceptable levels and could 
increase the chances for and severity of a recession if not brought 
under control 
if inflation reemerges i think a recession will move up on us 
much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be 
a prolonged one greenspan said 
he maintained that the feds credittightening moves would 
prolong the 6yearold economic expansion and moderate the next 
downturn 
while many analysts have been predicting that growth will slow 
this year early reports indicated the economy entered 1989 with 
strong momentum 
fed efforts to slow the economy to a more sustainable level of 
growth could spell trouble for the bush administration which has 
pinned its deficitreduction hopes on optimistic assumptions about 
the economys performance 
todays discount rate hike was requested by the boards of the 
feds regional banks in boston new york philadelphia richmond 
atlanta chicago st louis minneapolis kansas city and san 
francisco

grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade reflecting slack 
export demand and increased precipitation in major crop growing 
areas 
a census bureau report today of largerthanexpected soybean meal 
stocks acted as a further drag on the grain markets and the soybean 
complex in particular despite a continued rise in soybean cash 
prices 
the wheat market has resumed its downward trend after rallying 
briefly earlier this week on news that the soviet union had 
purchased 400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
agriculture department secretary clayton yeutter said today that 
the return of wintry weather to the midwest was encouraging for 
spring crop conditions because the snow adds moisture to soil 
parched by last summers drought 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 425 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to cent lower with march at 271 a bushel oats were

the powerful federal reserve joined in a spree of bank interest 
rate hikes today raising its key lending fee in a move that 
underscored a tougher antiinflation fight and signaled higher 
borrowing costs for millions of americans 
the feds increase in the discount rate to 7 percent from 65 
percent was the first such rise since aug 9 and coincided with 
moves by new york banks to hike their prime lending rate to 115 
percent from 11 percent 
the steps jolted wall street today and sent stock and bond prices 
down sharply the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 28 
points to the 2261 level by late morning the 30year treasury bond 
fell nearly 750 per 1000 in face amount 
the discount rate is the feds loan fee to member financial 
institutions and historically has influenced other interest rates 
nationwide the increase today put the discount rate at its highest 
point in three years 
the prime is a benchmark for a wide range of business and 
consumer loan rates including car loans and adjustablerate home 
mortgages an increase in the prime means borrowers will have to pay 
more to finance their debts 
the halfpercentage point increase in the prime was first 
announced late thursday by chase manhattan bank and quickly followed 
by rivals it was the second increase in two weeks and lifted the 
rate to 115 percent the highest level since november 1984 
the prime hike reflects the higher cost of borrowing the banks 
face themselves indicating the fed is soaking up money in the 
banking system one of its weapons in restraining inflation 
the interest rate increases came against a background of signs 
that inflation is intensifying a partial result of low unemployment 
and strong economic growth on wednesday the labor department said 
consumer prices rose in january at an annual rate of 72 percent 
the highest level in two years 
fed chairman alan greenspan called the inflation trend disturbing 
and vowed to pressure rates up until he squeezes inflation out of 
the economy

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
today that no final decision has been made on how to reduce federal 
spending on farm programs but he indicated analysts are looking at 
many possibilities 
well find a way to do so because thats a requirement of the 
budget process yeutter told reporters agriculture will have 
to play its part in that process 
he added well look every where obviously itll have to 
be done on the basis of economic analysis were not going to do it 
in an arbitrary or capricious way and that means analyzing all the 
options and combinations of options 
yeutter said he is scheduled to appear before congress several 
times next week but would not have all the budget work done before 
then 
budget analysts have estimated that up to 2 billion may have to 
be whittled from usda programs in the fiscal year that begins oct 
1 those cuts were not specified in the budget proposals submitted 
by the outgoing reagan administration in january and were left open 
to be negotiated with congress 
yeutter was asked if 2 billion would be enough to cut farm 
programs mainly the price support operations for major commodities 
he replied that in the long run he would like to see less reliance 
on the largesse and generosity of the federal government 
in the long term i hope we can bring down the budget but only 
if we have similar reaction from our trading partners around the 
world yeutter said we do not want to individually disarm 
yeutter served for 3 years as us trade representative in the 
reagan administration before president bush tapped him to be 
secretary of agriculture 
no aides to yeutter at the agriculture department have yet been 
announced by the white house and key jobs are still being carried 
out by holdovers from the reagan administration 
however yeutter said at a news conference that he was hopeful an 
announcement would be made soon on the no 2 post of deputy 
secretary probably within the next few days 
reports circulated last week that yeutter and some presidential 
aides had been bickering over filling the deputy secretary job with 
yeutter opting in favor of jack parnell the california state 
agricultural commissioner or sam hollis a cotton warehouseman from 
memphis tenn 
but there were claims that white house pressure had developed for 
former kentucky governor louie nunn who told the associated press 
that he had been interviewed by yeutter several weeks earlier 
yeutter said the reports of him bickering with the white house 
were completely false and that there had been no disagreement 
whatsoever with the white house

aflcio leaders closed their annual 
meeting today confident that organized labor can present a united 
front against eastern airlines if its mechanics go on strike next 
week 
the eastern dispute dominated the federations executive council 
session this week and the union leaders as their last major event 
went to nearby miami on thursday for a noisy rally with the 
machinists outside the airlines headquarters 
federation president lane kirkland said organized labor would do 
everything possible within the law to ground eastern sister 
carrier continental airlines and their parent company texas air 
corp in the event of a strike 
the meeting ended after a closing council session today devoted 
mostly to internal housekeeping and passage of a few final 
resolutions on issues of concern to labor 
among those were calls for congress to pass provisions 
restricting private employers from using assets from overfunded 
pension plans to initiate or fight takeover attempts 
the council also condemned the treasury department for overruling 
a customs department classification of imported multipurpose 
vehicles such as small fourwheel drive vehicles as light trucks 
which subjected them to a 25 percent tariff 
the treasury department has capitulated to foreign political 
pressure pointlessly increasing the us trade deficit and 
undermining the jobs of us workers the council said 
the labor leaders also vowed to be a force in the 1991 national 
redistricting that will reshape congressional districts 
it is vital that the labor movement and its allies coordinate a 
longterm reapportionment strategy that will assist state 
legislative candidates who are committed to programs that benefit 
working americans the resolution said 
there has been rampant discussion this week about whether labor 
could mount a successful boycott of eastern if there is a strike 
the rally thursday left the labor officials in an upbeat mood about 
those prospects 
this kind of speaks for itself doesnt it federation 
president lane kirkland said as he marched in front of easterns 
complex at the miami airport 
fueling the confidence was the presence of several eastern pilots 
and representatives of their union whose support would be vital to 
any labor hopes of grounding eastern during a strike 
despite the show of solidarity and militant strike talk the 
labor leaders said it was still their hope president bush would put 
off the strike deadline for 60 days by naming an emergency board to 
mediate the dispute 
kirkland called on the president to intervene for the sake of 
the future of the airline for the sake of the communities eastern 
serves for the sake of the country 
the 8500 machinists and ground personnel members of the 
international association of machinists are scheduled to strike at 
1201 am march 4 unless a settlement is reached during mediation 
now under way in washington something iam leaders consider all but 
impossible 
among the eastern pilots union officials at the rally was 
secretarytreasurer rick chapman who irritated several aflcio 
leaders by saying wednesday the pilots would cross machinist picket 
lines if eastern management makes it worth our while 
we support the membership of the iam said chapman who 
apologized for any trouble his statement had caused and said it was 
reported out of context 
the pilots according to union policy will not decide whether to 
honor machinist picket lines until there is a strike but one bob 
breslin said the momentum is growing very rapidly to side with 
the machinists 
airline pilots traditionally have spoiled labors hopes of 
crippling airlines during strikes by crossing picket lines 
eastern management which has said it plans to operate in the 
event of a strike made its presence felt as well 
a sign hanging from a company building read welcome aflcio 
delegates eastern your official airline during the rally a 
small plane flew overhead toting a banner reading eastern 
official airline of the aflcio 
most of the federation officials here traveled on eastern which 
offered a group discount federation officials have acknowledged the 
irony in that but said they encourage people to fly eastern because 
they want the financially strapped airline to survive

the dollar finished marginally higher in europe on 
friday as the market reacted without enthusiasm to a hike in the 
us discount rate 
gold prices fell 
foreign exchange dealers said the us federal reserve boards 
move to raise the discount rate to 7 percent from 65 percent 
initially caused the dollar to steam to a session high of 18330 
west german marks 
although dealers had been complaining about the lack of strong 
action from the fed for months some thought the rate hike was not 
strong enough 
it would have been a full point many people thought and the 
dollar then went down said a trader at a large frankfurt bank 
others said the move came too late and had only a symbolic effect 
that wore off the dollar then traded in quiet ranges 
selected late dollar rates compared with late thursday 18270 
west german marks up from 18215 15602 swiss francs up from

the courts will review a 1 billion 
racketeering fraud claim lodged by continental airlines accusing 
rival carriers of overcharging travel agents who used the companies 
computers to make reservations a judge ruled 
us district judge edward rafeedie on feb 17 refused to dismiss 
the civil claim brought by houstonbased continental against rivals 
american airlines and united airlines nearly a dozen other airlines 
also were involved in the action 
rafeedie also denied motions for summary judgment filed by 
american and united the continental lawsuit charges the two 
airlines with violating the racketeer influence and corrupt 
organizations act 
at issue is the price the two airlines charged travel agents for 
use of the companies computer reservation systems the plaintiffs 
are seeking 1 billion in reimbursement of such fees paid from 1981 
to 1987 
american airlines attorney j edd stepp said the racketeering 
allegations stem from the fact that rates appeared higher if travel 
agents called up flights on the airlines computers 
since everybody knew it was that way and the airlines knew to 
us it seems incongruous to suggest that what existed was fraudulent 
or misleading to anybody stepp said we dont believe there is 
a shred of evidence 
that system which was phased out in 1984 had been investigated 
by the justice department which took no action stepp said

the government said friday it will seek 
to renegotiate its 22 billion foreign debt 
treasury minister enzo debernardi said servicing the debt now 
amounts to 300 million while the countrys central bank has only 
160 million in reserves 
the provisional government of gen andres rodriguez wont impose 
a unilateral moratorium debernardi said but cannot fully comply 
with what is owed 
the government has been in power since feb 3 when rodriguez 
toppled gen alfredo stroessner in a coup 
stroessner usually made good on paraguays debt payments but 
economists and foreign observers predicted last year that the 
countrys faltering economy would create problems in 1989 
a report by the us embassy in asuncion made public last 
december said brazil is paraguays major creditor nation and is owed 
400 million paraguay also owes the world bank 410 million and the 
interamerican development bank 450 million according to the report

the mayor of west point ga sent a letter friday 
congratulating william farley on his takeover of west 
pointpepperell inc but many local residents arent quite as 
enthusiastic about the textile giants new owner 
a year from now i want to hear how these people like working 
for a damn yankee one angry caller to west point radio phonein 
program said thursday after pepperell agreed to the buyout i was 
born into west point manufacturing co a predecessor of pepperell 
and i sure wanted to die a west pointpepperell 
but many residents of west point where pepperell for years has 
been the main employer appeared ready to work for farley even 
though pepperell bitterly had opposed his hostile buyout offers for 
months before capitulating 
buttons and bumper stickers proclaiming stop farley were on 
view friday one day after the takeover was announced with an 
altered handwritten message we love farley said terrell 
whaley general manager of west point radio station wcjmam 
we have no choice whaley said hes the man in power now 
pepperell employs about 8000 people in the area of west point 
in western georgia near the alabama state line many were concerned 
about their future upon hearing that farley chairman of 
chicagobased farley inc had succeeded in his fourmonth hostile 
takeover fight 
the pepperell board of directors on thursday approved farleys 
58pershare buyout offer which will total about 3 billion when 
combined with refinancing of pepperell debt 
farley has promised no production layoffs and praised the 
pepperell employees for working hard during the recent months of 
uncertainty but he also has indicated some portions of the company 
may be sold 
i just hope they dont shut the mills down vernon anderson 
a 20year pepperell employee from lagrange ga told the valley 
times of nearby lanett ala thats the way these people are 
living 
west point mayor he steele jr said in a telephone interview 
friday that he believes fears of mass layoffs are unfounded 
i never felt it was inevitable that farley would have mass 
layoffs the mayor said he wasnt buying west pointpepperell 
to go out of business 
steele also said he welcomed farleys presence in west point 
i feel it is the end of a tradition but the beginning of a new 
era he said i sent a letter of congratulations this morning on 
behalf of the city and myself personally 
other holdings of farley one of the nations largest 
privatelyheld conglomerates include fruit of the loom inc the 
nations no 1 underwear manufacturer acme boot co which sell 
dingo and acme boots and doehlerjarvis which makes diecast metal 
products for the automotive industry 
whaley who spent friday morning talking to people around town 
said many in the area arent buying farleys promises just yet 
i have a lot of apprehension whaley said in a telephone 
interview i wonder if mr farley is sincere when he says he wont 
sell off his immediate plan was to and now hes twice as much in 
debt 
but whaley said most local residents are willing to go the 
second mile to help him farley make it a success 
whaley said several local residents were disappointed that 
pepperell chairman joseph l lanier jr failed to stop farley and 
that he did not offer more of an explanation once the decision was 
made to accept farleys bid 
farley said lanier whose family was associated with the company 
for four generations and president donald keller will leave 
pepperell once the merger is complete 
pepperell is the lifeblood of this community whaley said 
over 8000 people here work for them theyve been a steady oak 
for 103 years 
weve leaned on them too much he said and now weve 
come to the crossroads

wheat futures prices closed substantially higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade in response to bullish chart 
signals and rumors of impending export sales 
other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed in light 
trading 
the rally in the wheat market capped four straight days of gains 
and may indicate that the market expects export sales to pick up 
next week 
among the rumors was one that the agriculture deparment plans to 
extend an offer of more subsidized wheat to china but analysts 
tended to discount those expectations 
the same rumor has been around for weeks said ted mao a 
grain specialist in new york with shearson lehman hutton inc 
speculative buying accelerated after prices for delivery of 
newcrop wheat topped the weeks previous highs 
soybeans for march delivery rose more than 6 cents a bushel on 
technical signals but other grain and soybean futures were little 
changed 
at the close wheat was 5 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 433 a bushel corn was cent

colombia will temporarily freeze oil 
exports to cooperate with opecs and independent producers efforts 
to stabilize world oil prices energy and mines minister oscar mejia 
vallejo said friday 
our decision is rather symbolic since we are not in a position 
to increase significantly our export levels which in turn 
represent only an insignificant portion of the world market he 
told reporters 
colombia is the second nonopec country to announce a change in 
exports since tuesdays meeting of independent producers in london 
mexico said earlier it would reduce exports by up to 5 percent 
in a statement released after the london meeting the group said 
several nations had agreed either to cut or to freeze exports in the 
second quarter to cooperate with the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries efforts to reduce output and increase world oil 
prices the group also said details of the agreement would be 
released later analysts speculated the cuts would total about 
200000 barrels a day 
opec established a new sixmonth quota that took effect jan 1 
under which it was to cut production to 185 million barrels about 
4 million barrels less than it was producing at the end of 1988 
although the cartel is said to be producing more than 19 million 
barrels prices have risen about 5 a barrel since the quota was 
announced last november 
colombia whose oil industry has experienced problems including 
guerrilla attacks on its pipelines has made it clear that it was 
not in the position to reduce exports 
colombia exports 180000 barrels out of a total 435000 barrels 
produced daily the south american country said it is working to 
expand domestic oil pipelines and increase its production capacity 
to 600000 barrels per day next year 
among those represented at the london meeting in addition to 
colombia were alaska canada the soviet union mexico china 
oman egypt malaysia north yemen and norway

consumers and businesses will pay more for a wide 
range of borrowing from car loans to mortgages because of the 
federal reserves intensified war on inflation economists said 
friday 
the fed is ratcheting up rates because its slowbutsteady steps 
to tighten credit so far have failed to prevent inflation from 
taking hold experts say 
the central banks interestrate steering wheel has gotten looser 
in recent years so like someone at the wheel of a carnival arcade 
driving game the fed may now have to oversteer to get the results 
it wants and hope it doesnt cause a crash 
indeed rooting out inflation now that it has become established 
will take measures so tough that there is a chance they 
unintentionally could produce a recession economists say 
in the entire last year the fed acted with so much discretion 
that it was almost painful to see now people know that they mean 
business said francis schott chief economist for equitable life 
assurance society in new york 
schott said there was about a 5050 chance of a fedinstigated 
recession although most other economists have said a downturn this 
year is unlikely 
on friday the federal reserve signaled its longterm commitment 
to a steppedup inflation fight by raising its discount rate on 
loans to member banks by half a percentage point to 7 percent its 
highest level since april 1986 
major banks which have been squeezed by fed pressure on other 
shortterm interest rates already had begun raising their prime 
lending rate half a percentage point to 115 percent 
the hike in the bank rate which now is at its highest since 
november 1984 will boost costs of some adjustablerate mortgages 
homeequity loans auto dealer inventory loans and other forms of 
borrowing tied to the prime 
the feds squeeze on credit will drive up lending rates across 
the board auto loans already have gotten more expensive they 
range from 11 percent to 135 percent nationally excluding special 
incentive rates from automakers because of the rising cost of 
funds for loan issuers 
any further fed tightening could push auto loans still higher 
said john andrews a spokesman for general motors acceptance corp 
fixedrate mortgages probably are least affected by the fed 
tightening but they too have risen about 1 percentage point over 
the past year 
the national average on 30year fixedrate mortgage loans is 
likely to rise another threequarters of a percentage point in 
coming months to the 1125 percent to 1175 percent range before 
trending downward as the fed gets a grip on inflation predicted 
john tuccillo economist for the national association of realtors 
unfortunately for borrowers painfully high interest rates are 
the only tool the fed has to control inflation 
if the increases arent painful economists say people and 
businesses will continue to borrow freely the economy will grow too 
quickly and shortages of labor and materials will drive prices 
higher 
in january strong economic growth produced annual consumer price 
inflation of 72 percent the highest in two years the labor 
department reported wednesday 
the feds influence on interest rates is less effective in 
controlling the economy than it used to be partly because it has 
less impact on the housing market dampening the housing market 
tends to ripple through the rest of the economy from lumber 
suppliers to appliance makers 
former federal limits on interest rates made it uneconomical for 
banks and savings institutions to make mortgage loans when their 
cost of funds got too high with those caps now gone mortgage funds 
are always available and customers are willing to pay higher rates 
87 and 88 were terrific for home sales in spite of 
gradually rising rates said the realtors tuccillo 
oddly in the past year the feds very success in establishing 
its credibility as an inflation fighter undermined its ability to 
fight inflation 
investors were so confident of the feds ability to whip 
inflation that they aggressively bought longterm government and 
corporate bonds which are sensitive to inflation that strong 
demand held down longterm interest rates and helped fuel economic 
growth not what the fed wanted 
now longterm rates are beginning to rise which should cool off 
the economy one reason is that the fed finally has raised 
shortterm rates so high that investors are switching to shortterm 
investments from longterm bonds said barry bosworth a brookings 
institution economist 
investors also are backing away from longterm bonds due to the 
loss of some confidence in the feds ability to quickly curb 
inflation yields on the bonds are consequently rising raising 
longterm borrowing costs and the feds objectives are being 
accomplished through the feds failure 
this is the kind of machiavellian thinking one has to go 
through schott said

public service co of new hampshire said 
friday it will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to 
settle a securitiesfraud lawsuit 
the suit against the company and top executives was brought more 
than a year ago by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that 
helped pay for completion of the idle seabrook nuclear power plant 
d pierre cameron jr chief counsel for public service said 
less than 1 million in cash would be paid to two new york 
securities firms that filed the suit he said the companys 
liability insurance and executive indemnification rights would cover 
the payments 
the case was set for trial next month in federal court in new 
york city before the settlement was announced thursday 
the settlement must be approved by the federal judge handling the 
case in new york and the us bankruptcy judge overseeing public 
services bankruptcy reorganization 
the company and the officers and directors have denied and 
continue to deny any wrongdoing but they have entered into the 
settlement to avoid further inconvenience disruption delay 
expense and the uncertainty of further litigation public service 
said in a statement 
the lawsuit was filed by spear leeds amp kellogg and elliott 
associates lp about a month before public service sought 
bankruptcy protection in january 1988 
it centered on the utilitys june 1986 suspension of warrants for 
purchasing public service common stock the warrants were due to 
expire in october 1991 
the firms charged that public service tried to mislead investors 
and stall attempts to seek relief by failing to give adequate notice 
it had suspended the warrants 
in a statement thursday public service said the settlement would 
include a new bondforstock exchange 
public service suspended the warrants as its finances worsened 
because of licensing delays for seabrook utility spokesman nicholas 
ashooh said public service owns 36 percent of the project which 
was completed in july 1986 but remains unlicensed because of 
emergencyplanning and financial problems 
public service issued more than 18 million of the warrants along 
with 425 million in 17 percent debentures in december 1984 the 
financing a utility industry record let public service pull back 
from the brink of bankruptcy and finish seabrook 
warrant holders were able to exchange each one for a share of 
common stock by paying 5 cash or turning in debentures with a 5 
face value the warrants are traded on the pacific stock exchange 
the debentures and common stock on the new york stock exchange 
the new york firms said they were unaware the warrants had been 
suspended when they bought the warrants and debentures in 1987 the 
firms alleged public service failed to disclose the suspension in 
1987 filings with the securities and exchange commission 
if the settlement wins approval warrant holders could exchange 
lots of 200 warrants and 1000 worth of debentures for lots of 200 
shares of common stock the utility said

employees in du pont cos fibers department 
will receive bonuses equal to 3 percent of their 1988 salaries next 
week in the first fruit of an experimental pay plan an executive 
said friday 
when the plan takes full effect next year a portion of 
employees pay raises will be tied to the departments 
profitability the wilmington delbased chemical giant has touted 
the plan as a way to increase profitability by giving employees a 
stake in the business 
the 20000employee fibers department makes products such as 
nylon dacron lycra orlon kevlar and antron 
next weeks bonuses are considered an incentive because the 
program is not fully in operation and no portion of employees 
salaries was actually at risk 
next year if the department performs poorly they could lose the 
entire amount they put at risk 
we announced to employees in early february that our 
performance in 1988 was such that we would have a 3 percent payout 
checks will be distributed monday and tuesday said robert mcnutt 
who led the team that developed the plan 
if the department meets 80 percent of its 1989 earnings goal 
employees will receive half of their pay that was at risk if the 
goal is met employees will receive all of the at risk money 
employees could receive three times the amount at risk if earnings 
goals are exceeded by 50 percent 
for 1988 the department overshot its goal for aftertax 
operating income of 626 million by about 125 percent resulting in 
the 3 percent payout according to mcnutt 
the bonuses are an incentive for the people participating in 
the program its a way of saying thanks for the job that we did 
together as a team in 1988 and so its a bonus as we move toward 
variable pay for 1989 mcnutt said 
it is expected to take three to five years to fully phase in the 
plan until the employee has a maximum amount of money at risk equal 
to 6 percent of what their pay would have been if they had received 
all scheduled raises 
employees who do not receive a raise this year will not have pay 
at risk and thus will not be eligible for bonuses 
during the phasein period each employee will always receive at 
least 1 percent of any raise regardless of the fibers business 
performance 
mcnutt noted however that late last year about 10000 employees 
voluntarily put 2 percent of salary at risk for this year 
the plan was mandatory for all department employees except 
unionized workers about 2000 production workers at the spruance 
plant in richmond va voted against the plan mcnutt said while 
the others voted to be in the department has about 6000 to 7000 
union workers at plants in delaware tennessee and virginia 
du pont said if the plan works it could become a model for the 
whole company

emhart corps stock soared friday 
following an unsolicited 24 billion takeover offer from an 
investment group that includes oil heir gordon p getty 
emhart a manufacturer of a wide range of consumer and industrial 
products said it would study the offer which came about a year 
after the companys own unsuccessful hostile bid for stanadyne inc 
emhart chairman peter l scott advised stockholders not to take 
any immediate action on the 35pershare offer announced by gettys 
group topper acquisition corp after the close of stock trading 
thursday 
investors reacted enthusiastically to the offer friday but 
apparently expected topper to bid higher emhart stock rose 712 
to 3987 a share in new york stock exchange composite trading 
emhart stock rose almost 10 in the past month amid takeover 
rumors 
topper told scott in a letter it would nominate a slate of 
directors for the emhart annual meeting scheduled for april 27 
depending upon the boards response to its offer the group said it 
might conduct a proxy contest for control of the board 
james paper who follows emhart for the investment firm 
kirkpatrick pettis smith polian inc in omaha neb said topper 
would likely increase its bid 
they have the resources to go higher paper said 
paper said emhart has been undervalued for several months but 
has caught investors eyes with series of wellplanned acquisitions 
over the past four years 
they have transformed this company from a machinery company to 
a very good multiindustry company he said 
among the businesses emhart acquired recently were gardenamerica 
corp a manufacturer of garden watering systems and price pfister 
inc a maker of faucets and plumbing supplies 
a year ago the investment firm forstmann little amp co outbid 
emhart with an 820 million offer for stanadyne a maker of plumbing 
fixtures automotive and metal products emhart had begun a hostile 
596 million tender offer for stanadyne after being rebuffed in a 
friendly buyout attempt 
another kirkpatrick pettis analyst rob cerny said emharts 
diverse subsidiaries made it ideal for a traditional buyandbustup 
takeover strategy 
topper which also includes new york real estate developers 
lawrence fisher and his brother zachary told scott it planned to 
sell price pfister and emharts information and electronic systems 
division 
but the group said its objective was to acquire own and 
operate emhart and to continue to build its manufacturing 
businesses over the long term 
topper said it had lined up financing for its offer the group 
said chemical bank and two other banks have committed 12 billion 
and an affiliate of first boston corp said it would provide 11 
billion in shortterm financing 
getty 54 gained his fortune through an inheritance from his 
father jean paul getty who turned getty oil co into a worldwide 
oil giant 
the fisher brothers participated in a 1984 bid for walt disney 
co led by financier saul p steinberg the bid ended with the 
steinbergled group selling their shares back to disney at a premium 
emhart earned 126 million during 1988 on sales of 276 billion 
up from earnings of 106 million and sales of 245 billion in 1987

stock and bond markets were battered friday after 
major commercial banks and the federal reserve boosted key lending 
rates as the central bank toughened its fight against inflation 
in the stock market the dow jones industrial average skidded 
4392 points to close at 224554 its biggest daily drop in three 
months 
the decline came only two days after the markets bestknown 
indicator lost 4250 points amid signs that inflation at the 
consumer level was accelerating 
in fridays broader market seven stocks fell for every two that 
rose among issues listed on the new york stock exchange 
bond prices fell as much as 5 for every 1000 in face value 
sending interest rates higher with yields on 30year bonds climbing 
to 919 percent from 914 percent late thursday 
shortterm interest rates finished even higher oneyear treasury 
bills were yielding 950 percent late friday offering investors a 
powerful incentive to dump stocks 
the dollar finished mixed in foreign exchange trading 
gary schlossberg senior economist for wells fargo bank in san 
francisco said he expects interest rates will move even higher 
before the economy slows enough to relieve inflationary pressures 
as the fed desires 
the fed will will have to continue to tighten a bit more 
aggressively a modest interest rate increase on the order of one 
percentage point should be enough to cool the economy off 
sufficiently he said 
such a move would increase chances that the economy could fall 
into a recession another worry for stock investors trying to divine 
the outlook for corporate profits 
but schlossberg said he believes the economy has enough 
inherent strength that there is a better than even chance a 
recession will avoided 
before the stock market opened friday the federal reserve 
boosted its discount rate its charge on loans to member banks by a 
half percentage point to a threeyear high of 7 percent 
boosting the discount rate is the central banks most dramatic 
signal that it intends to tighten credit and slow economic growth 
thus reducing borrowing wage and price demands 
some analysts said the feds move was overdue especially in 
light of federal reserve chairman alan greenspans statements that 
he found recent inflation disturbing and that the bank would 
continue erring on the side of retraint in fighting it 
fears about accelerating inflation have heightened in recent 
weeks with news that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in january 
and that consumer prices were up 06 percent last month their 
biggest jump in two years 
until friday the central banks moves had largely been conducted 
behind the scenes such as the draining of reserves from the banking 
system a maneuver that forces some banks to borrow to meet capital 
requirements 
the discount rate hike followed chase manhattan banks 
announcement after the stock market closed on thursday that it was 
boosting its prime lending rate a benchmark lending charge that 
affects rates paid on commercial home and other consumer loans to 
11 percent from 11 percent 
other major banks matched chases increase on friday it was the 
second half percentage point rise in the prime rate in the last two 
weeks 
the fed last raised the discount rate in august to 65 percent 
from 6 percent the discount rate last was at 7 percent from march 
7 1986 to april 18 1986 when it dropped to 65 percent

lumber futures fell sharply friday as traders anticipated higher 
mortgage rates and a slowdown in home construction after the federal 
reserve board increased its main interest rate 
on other markets frozen porkbelly futures plunged the permitted 
daily limit of 2 cents a pound livestock futures were mixed grains 
and soybeans were mixed energy futures rose and precious metals 
retreated 
lumber settled 340 to 4 lower on the chicago mercantile 
exchange with the contract for delivery in march at 18280 per 
1000 boardfeet 
the decline followed increases in both the prime lending rate 
which is the benchmark on which banks base their loan rates and the 
discount rate the interest rate that the fed charges on loans to 
its member banks 
most major banks raised their prime rates 05 percentage point to 
115 percent while the fed upped its discount rate to 7 percent from 
65 percent the increases were seen as efforts to fight inflation 
by slowing down the economy 
bud merrill a lumber market analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc in eugene ore said the higher interest rates could lead to a 
substantial weakening of the lumber market which has been in a 
twoyear upswing 
i tend to believe were going to be under pressure at least 
until the early part of spring merrill said 
futures prices for frozen pork bellies fell steeply on the 
chicago merc ahead of the agriculture departments monthly cold 
storage report which was expected to show recordhigh supplies of 
the unsliced bacon meat in the nations commercial meat lockers 
the report which was released after the close confirmed those 
expectations it showed 1134 million pounds of bellies in cold 
storage as of feb 1 far surpassing both the yearago figure of 63 
million pounds and the previous feb 1 record of 902 million pounds 
set in 1981 
the report also showed recordhigh total pork supplies and 
suggested that both turkey and ham would be in abundant supply for 
easter 
analysts said the massive porkbelly supply could become a major 
depressant on the futures market this summer unless retailers 
stimulate the movement of bellies out of storage by cutting bacon 
prices which now average about 149 a pound 
we need to knock 50 cents off the retail bacon price in a hury 
or this markets goose is cooked said charles levitt shearsons 
chief livestock market analyst in chicago 
live cattle settled 12 cent lower to 23 cent higher with april 
at 7815 cents a pound feeder cattle were 03 cent to 30 cent

the hausman computer school a post secondary training school 
with about 800 students closed in 1987 after losing is 
accreditation 
according to assistant us attorney deirdre daly many of the 
students were not high school graduates and thus were not eligible

school could only enroll high school graduates 
hausmans lawyer charles carnesi claimed a number of students

and are now gainfully employed

a florida defense contractor was accused 
friday of illegally using scrap alloy instead of new metal to make 
military turbine engine parts a federal prosecutor said 
aerodyne investment castings inc was charged with a single count 
of falsely certifying that the parts for aircraft and the m1 abrams 
tank were new metal said us attorney robert genzman 
the firm has agreed to plead guilty genzman said and will be 
placed on five years probation and fined 250000 
as part of the agreement russell k baker jr former

prosecutors alleged that aerodyne submitted false certificates to 
the defense department from 1980 through october 1987 the 
certifications pertained to whether the parts met contract 
specifications the government said 
according to prosecutors allegations 
aerodyne substituted scrap or reused alloy in the 
production of turbine engine parts in place of the newlyrefined or 
virgin alloy required under the contract with the army and air 
force 
aerodyne certified that the parts provided to those agencies met 
certain requirements demonstrated by tests performed on virgin alloy 
while the parts were made of a mix of scrap and alloy 
aerodyne has agreed to pay 25000 to the office of the inspector 
general of the us department of defense and 25000 to the fbi as 
reimbursement for investigative costs genzman said 
aerodyne which employs about 175 people has been a defense 
contractor for the past decade by agreeing to terms of the plea 
agreement the company has taken a step toward rehabilitating itself 
as a corporate entity genzman said in an announcement

gold prices paused their recent advance republic national bank 
of new york quoted a bid of 389 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 pm 
est down from thursdays late bid of 39070 
in early us trading the dollar rose during a temporary flurry 
of dollarbuying after the federal reserve board announced it was 
raising its discount rate by a halfpoint to 7 percent 
the buying subsided after currency dealers decided the rate hike 
would have little impact 
an increase in the key rate which is the interest the fed 
charges on loans to private banking institutions was widely 
anticipated in light of the decision by the nations private banks 
to raise their prime lending rates 
on thursday and friday a series of major banks drove up the 
rates used as benchmarks for variable loan interest charges to 115 
percent from 11 percent 
also the dollar was sold due to persistent worries that failure 
to solve the us trade and budget deficit problems will cause 
lasting economic damage 
many dealers decided to buy west german marks on the grounds that 
interest rates in that country will probably rise soon because 
inflationary pressures have been building up due to robust economic 
activity 
in new york the dollar finished at 181875 marks down from 
182175 thursday 
we are expecting some interest rate increases in germany as the 
government acts to get control of inflation said zlatko

texaco inc said friday that the first of two 
special dividends to be paid in late june will be made in cash 
rather than notes as previously announced 
texaco spokesman peter maneri said the decision to issue the

canada inc to imperial oil ltd for 324 billion on thursday 
maneri said

public service company of new hampshire 
and its top executives have settled a securitiesfraud lawsuit 
brought by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that helped 
pay for completing the troubled seabrook nuclear power plant the 
utility announced thursday 
the company and the officers and directors have denied and 
continue to deny any wrongdoing but they have entered into the 
settlement to avoid further inconvenience disruption delay 
expense and the uncertainty of further litigation the company 
said in a statement 
in part the settlement would let the plaintiffs exercise 
warrants for purchasing public service common stock the company 
statement said the suspension of the warrants in june 1986 five 
years before they were due to expire prompted the lawsuit 
i dont know whether this will give the plaintiffs the same 
rights they had originally before the warrants were suspended 
company spokesman nicholas ashooh said he also could not say 
whether the warrant and bondholders got anything else in the 
settlement 
full details will be filed in bankruptcy court in the near 
future ashooh said 
the settlement is subject to approval by public services federal 
bankruptcy judge and the us district court in the southern 
district of new york where the case was set for trial next month 
public service suspended the warrants as its finances worsened 
because of licensing delays for seabrook ashooh said public 
service owns 36 percent of the project which was completed in july 
1986 but remains unlicensed because of emergencyplanning and 
financial problems 
two new york firms spear leeds amp kellogg and elliott 
associates lp filed the securitiesfraud lawsuit about a month 
before public service sought bankruptcy protection in january 1988 
howard schiffman a lawyer for spear leeds said the firm sought to 
recover 7 million including punitive damages and lawyers fees 
the firms charged that public service failed to give adequate 
notice that it had suspended the warrants in an attempt to mislead 
investors and stall their attempts to seek relief 
public service issued more than 18 million of the warrants along 
with 425 million in 17 percent debentures in december 1984 the 
financing allowed public service to pull back from its first trip to 
the brink of bankruptcy and to complete seabrook 
holders of the warrants were able to exchange each for one share 
of common stock by paying 5 cash or turning in debentures with 5 a 
face value 
the new york firms said in legal briefs that they bought the 
warrants and debentures in 1987 unaware that the warrants had been 
suspended the firms alleged that public service failed to disclose 
the suspension in 1987 filings with the securities and exchange 
commission 
if the settlement wins court approval holders of the warrants 
would be able to exchange lots of 200 warrants and 1000 worth of 
debentures for lots of 200 shares of common stock the utility said 
in its statement cash exercise of the warrants would be barred 
public service said it could not predict what the securities 
would be worth after the company emerges from bankruptcy protection

bankamerica capital markets group in san francisco 
it was just confirmation that the fed really means business in

the hole that tore open on a united airlines 747 
on friday near hawaii was reminiscent of a neardisaster in the same 
area last year and seemed likely to become the latest in a series of 
public relations nightmares for boeing co 
problems with aging aircraft miswired emergency systems in some 
newer planes production delays on the giant 747400 and a series of 
tragic crashes have focused unusual attention on the worlds biggest 
maker of commercial jetliners particularly in the past 60 days 
what you have here is a series of events and the only 
correlation is that theyre happening in the same time frame but if 
you dissect each one you will find that theyre totally unrelated 
said david jimenez a spokesman for boeing commercial airplanes the 
boeing subsidiary that has prided itself on highclass workmanship 
and a strong safety record in its planes 
he added however that with news reports of problems coming one 
after another it does become one large blur to the public 
its made for a very intense period of being scrutinized 
sometimes unfairly and thats a difficult thing to counter because 
the incidents are happeningand we dont always have time to 
explain ourselves jimenez said 
there was no immediate word on the cause of fridays incident in 
which nine people apparently were sucked from the united airlines 
jet when a 10by40foot vertical hole opened in its fuselage the 
flight had taken off a few minutes earlier for auckland new 
zealand and sydney australia 
it brought to mind an accident april 28 also over hawaii a 
flight attendant was killed and 61 people injured when a portion of 
the fuselage on a boeing 737 peeled off during an aloha airlines 
flight from hilo to honolulu exposing the firstclass section to 
the open air at 24000 feet the pilot and copilot managed to land 
the jet although one of the two engines quit 
in december an eastern airlines boeing 727 with 104 passengers 
and six crew aboard was forced to land at yeager airport in 
charleston wva after a 14inch hole opened in its fuselage at 
31000 feet 
the first incident led to widespread concern about the safety of 
aging jets like the aloha 737 tiny cracks were found in nearly half 
the aging boeing 737 jetliners inspected in the months following the 
aloha accident 
more recently a series of crashes focused attention on boeing 
jets the dec 21 terrorist bombing of a pan american 747 over 
lockerbie scotland in which nearly 300 people on board and on the 
ground died the january crash of a british midland airways 737 in 
england killing 44 people and the feb 8 crash of a chartered 707 
in the azores which killed 144 people 
but airlines have voted with their dollars in expressing their 
continuing confidence in boeing airplanes all nippon airways on 
wednesday ordered 20 new 747400s in a deal valued at 31 billion 
orders in 1988 topped 30 billion for 636 planes both record 
figures for the industry 
but boeing has been plagued by various safety and production 
concerns of late 
the company confirmed wednesday that crossed tubes in cargohold 
fireextinguisher systems were found in two air canada 767s 
the federal aviation administration on feb 1 ordered checks on 
the plumbing and wiring of firesuppressant and monitoring systems 
in cargo holds and engines of boeing planes built since 1981 over 
the past year a total of 30 such problems have been found by 
airlines worldwide 
the issue arose after the british midland crash when 
investigators suspected that crossed wires may have led the pilot to 
shut down the wrong engine after a warning system indicated an 
engine fire however crossed wires subsequently were eliminated as 
a cause of that crash 
boeing has said it is taking steps to find the cause of the 
problems and to make changes so they cannot happen in the future 
the faa said earlier this month that it had asked boeing and 
mcdonnell douglas corp to determine whether inadequately tested 
nuts bolts and rivets made by voishan aerospace products were used 
in making aircraft voishan of chatsworth calif is being 
investigated over reports that test documents on the fasteners were 
falsified 
some major airlines have expressed anger at boeing for delays in 
its 747400 program and have said they will seek compensation for 
planes they will not receive on time 
boeing concedes it was too optimistic in putting together a 
timetable on the 747400 program but says that after delaying 
initial deliveries of the giant plane it is working to put the 
program back on track with no loss in quality 
boeing also said earlier this month that it had hired a public 
relations firm hill and knowlton inc the first sign of the pr 
firms influence was when boeing issued a statement expressing 
condolences over the 707 crash in the azores feb 8 the first time 
boeing has issued such a statement before the cause of a crash was 
officially determined

the pilots union said its petition will have implications for 
all eastern asset transfers including the pending sale of the 
airlines northeast shuttle service to developer donald trump for 
365 million in cash 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami said the airline would 
have no comment on the petition because officials had not seen the 
documents 
the pilots announcement came amid mounting tension as a march 3 
strike deadline against miamibased eastern set by its militant 
machinists union approaches 
intensified talks involving eastern management the machinists 
and federal mediators which began wednesday in washington have so 
far failed to produce a settlement 
the national mediation board recommended friday that president 
bush intervene and block the planned strike according to 
administration sources the agency suggested bush name a 
presidential emergency board to investigate the protracted dispute 
the sources said if the president accepted the recommendation it 
would automatically delay the strike by 60 days 
leaders of the union representing flight attendants at eastern 
meanwhile voted unanimously friday to ask members to honor a strike 
by the machinists 
the leadership of the eastern pilots union has polled its members 
on the strike issue 
in its earlier court arguments against the layoffs and reduced 
service the pilots union had asserted it was not an efficiency 
move but part of a continuing pattern of antilabor tactics 
designed to intimidate employees in the midst of ongoing labor 
negotiations 
last august a us district court judge in washington issued a 
restraining order against the eastern plan the airline appealed 
and in late september a threemember appeals court panel overturned 
the restraining order 
the pilots unions request to have the case heard by the full 
11member appeals court was rejected in early january
