hungarians voted sunday in their first 
free elections after 43 years of communist rule and early results 
indicated the party would lose despite taking a lead role in 
democratic reforms 
we will be an opposition party said rezsoe nyers chairman 
of the socialist party which was created by reformers to replace 
the old communist party this to use a religious term will be 
penance for the party 
we will come through it and we will be strong he added 
premier miklos nemeth a communist reformer and a key engineer 
of the nations conversion to democracy declared before he voted 
that he was relinquishing control head high and with a clear 
conscience 
a report by the official news agency said nemeth won a 
parliamentary seat as an independent in a district northeast of 
budapest but his party appeared to have done poorly elsewhere 
east germany held eastern europes first free elections in 
decades on march 18 and the communists were rejected there 
in hungary they competed with 11 other national parties for 386 
parliament seats no party held a clear lead in the early returns 
despite occasional showers voter turnout appeared heavy in 
budapest few irregularities were reported by 8 pm when polling 
stations closed several international observers had monitored the 
election 
about 78 million people were eligible to vote and janos nemeth 
chairman of the elections committee said preliminary figures 
showed turnout was more than 70 percent 
premier nemeth who voted at a staterun kindergarten serving as 
one of 11000 polling stations across the nation declined to 
predict the chances of his socialist party which has governed 
since reformoriented communists formed it after defecting from 
their party in october 
the only thing i hope for is that a strong government is 
created nemeth said adding that only a government not hamstrung 
by the opposition can deal with the nations ailing economy 
his comments reflected widespread acceptance even among 
socialists that his party would not do well despite its role 
unique in eastern europe in steering hungary to democratic reform 
instead of crediting the socialists for volunteering to play by 
democratic rules most voters remember the excesses of more than 
four decades of oneparty rule that have made communists unpopular 
throughout the soviet bloc 
i wont consider it an act of god if i dont make it into 
government nemeth told reporters i will hand over the reins 
head high and with a clear conscience i dont have bitterness in 
my heart but satisfaction 
the state mti news agency reported that nemeth won a 
parliamentary seat in szerencs a village about 70 miles northeast 
of budapest where he ran as an independent 
with voters able to vote separately for candidates and parties 
nemeth had one of two chances of election as an individual 
candidate or as a nominee of his party on the budapest regional 
slate he would be struck from the party list if he won in szerencs 
election results trickled in at election commission headquarters 
in the gothic parliament building and at the election studio of 
state television 
officials decided to stay with the familiar method of counting 
ballots by hand and using computers only to crosscheck the tally 
in east germany by contrast trends were established soon after 
polls closed with west german computer technology quickly 
delivering results in a system typical of western election coverage 
but hungarian officials in most districts had tallied less than 
25 percent of the vote by early monday and final results were not 
expected before late in the day 
the centrist democratic forum got the most votes in four 
districts and led in nine more the liberal league of free 
democrats got the most votes in one district and led in eight 
others the independent smallholders a rural party led in two 
districts and the socialists led in two others 
however no candidate or party gained the absolute majority in 
any of the districts where counting was complete and all of those 
parliament seats were subject to a second round of voting 
hungarys last elections were in 1947 when the communists won a 
relative majority largely through fraud a year later they 
consolidated power and forced all other parties out of existence 
throughout the monthlong campaign socialist candidates 
attempted to convince the electorate of their commitment to a 
multiparty system 
but preelection opinion polls indicated the socialists would 
finish no higher than fourth place with a maximum 10 percent of 
the overall vote 
a poll of 5000 people published by the state mti news agency 
less than one hour before polls closed indicated the centerright 
hungarian democratic forum would finish strongest with 31 seats 
the poll predicted the liberal free democrats would win 30 seats 
the independent smallholders 22 the activist liberal league of 
young democrats 18 and the socialists eight seats 
while proposing a variety of solutions on how to complete the 
transformation from an ossified command economy to one obeying free 
market rules most of the parties competing in some or all of the 
176 districts espouse centrist ideas 
election rules call for a second round in case no single party 
wins an absolute majority sunday and expectations were high that 
scattered voter loyalties would force a runoff tentatively 
scheduled for april 8 
even new elections however were not expected to determine a 
clear winner making a coalition government the most likely 
scenario 
the socialists were unlikely to play a role much beyond sunday 
leading parties such as the democratic forum and the free democrats 
have repeatedly stated they would reject them as government 
partners 
but democratic forum chairman jozsef antall refused to comment 
sunday when asked by reporters about possible coalition partners 
asked about his thoughts during balloting antall a medical 
historian said we want a free hungary and im happy that weve 
come this far 
free democrat leader janos kis said he expected his party to be 
one of the top two finishers 
as he waited for a polling booth to become free kis explained 
the ballot to his schoolage son 
many of more than a dozen voters questioned at random expressed 
optimism about the future but some appeared to carry the scars of 
the past 
this is a great day in our countrys history declared 
democratic forum supporter bela kiraly 50 im sure it marks a 
new beginning 
his wife irene also 50 said she voted for the democratic 
forum on the national list of candidates and for the free democrats 
on the local slate because the more diversity in parliament the 
better 
if any one party becomes too strong we might return to the 
same situation weve had for 40 years she said referring to 
past communist rule 
a 77year old woman refused to give her name and preference but 
suggested she was sceptical that democracy had arrived to stay in 
hungary 
ive survived too many systems to tell anybody who i vote 
for she said

the first rotary club in the soviet union has 
been officially established after several years of 
behindthescenes efforts the president of the international 
service organization said sunday 
a tired but happy hugh archer president of rotary 
international said three years of contacts between soviet 
ambassadors and rotary officials from around the world led to his 
final journey this weekend through the soviet bureaucracy 
it was difficult from the standpoint of intrigue in getting 
the word to the person who could help us archer said in a 
telephone interview sunday night after returning from to moscow 
nobody there wishes to speak as an individual what we had to 
do was get a lot of people convinced that it was ok to have a 
rotary club started in moscow 
archer finally got approval from soviet officials for a 
provisional club that will initially be made up of about 25 
business and professional people from moscow 
rotary international which has over 1 million members in more 
than 100 countries has forged growing links with eastern europe in 
recent years in june 1989 rotary established its first clubs in 
poland and hungary since world war ii said john obrien a 
spokesman for rotary international based in suburban evanston ill 
archer first met with soviet officials in december to explore 
the possibilities of opening a club in moscow he also visited a 
group eager to form a club in tallinn the capital of the soviet 
republic of estonia 
in a key discussion saturday with deputy minister of foreign 
affairs vladimir petrovsky archer said he received assurances the 
club can meet and select members without surveillance or 
restrictions and that it will be allowed to maintain contacts with 
clubs in other countries and contribute financially to the 
association 
rotarys constitution prohibits it from becoming part of another 
organization or being restricted by government or political forces 
it all follows from soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
because of his reforms that sort of paved the way obrien said 
but rotary has not gone cap in hand begging to open a club 
the members of the provisional club in moscow who have been 
holding informal meetings for the past six months range in age 
from 30 to 50 they include two lawyers three businessmen a 
theater manager and the head of a translation service 
archer said the group was delighted when told of the agreement 
and immediately began discussing ideas especially exchange 
programs with other countries involving rotary members as well as 
high school and college students 
he said the soviets at first had trouble understanding that they 
were expected to help people without receiving anything in return 
the concept of service as practiced by rotary and other groups 
is that you enjoy it without expectation of compensation archer 
said i think they got that idea 
rotary founded in chicago in 1905 is a notforprofit service 
organization consisting of business and professional men and women 
it sponsors educational and charitable programs and has a budget of 
56 million for 198990

a federal judge on monday extended a 
restraining order against enforcement of the most restrictive us 
abortion law 
us district judge alex munson had issued a temporary 
restraining order friday a few hours after a group of guam 
residents and medical groups filed a classaction suit on monday 
he extended the order until may 8 when a trial on the suit is 
scheduled to begin 
were very happy said anita arriola the plaintiffs 
attorney 
the law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers 
the life of the mother it makes it a thirddegree felony to 
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure a misdemeanor for a 
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person 
to solicit a woman to have an abortion 
the law in this pacific territory is seen by abortion opponents 
as a potential vehicle to challenge the us supreme courts roe 
vs wade decision that legalized abortion 
the guam law provides for a referendum in the nov 6 general 
election for guam voters to decide whether to retain or reject the 
abortion ban 
janet benshoof director of the american civil liberties unions 
reproductive freedom project defied the law last tuesday when she 
publicly encouraged women seeking abortions to have them done in 
hawaii she was charged in the territorial supreme court with 
solicitation to commit abortion a misdemeanor 
among those named in the suit is gov joseph ada who signed the 
measure into law march 19 
the plaintiffs include maria doe a guam woman who is eight 
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion the guam society of 
obstetricians and gynecologists the guam nurses association an 
episcopal priest and three guam doctors

at least 41 pilots of passenger aircraft have 
lost their minnesota drivers licenses in the past seven years 
because of alcohol abuse according to a published report 
of those who lost licenses 28 were employed by eganbased 
northwest airlines the star tribune reported in its sunday 
editions 
officials of northwest and the federal aviation administration 
declined to comment on the findings as did a national spokesman 
for the air line pilots association 
the issue gained widespread attention when three northwest 
pilots were arrested this month after a flight from fargo nd to 
minneapolis the pilots were later fired by northwest and have been 
charged with flying an airliner while under the influence of 
alcohol 
the paper made its count using an faa list of more than 2000 
minnesotabased pilots who hold an airtransport license the kind 
required of airline captains and a class 1 medical certificate 
the highest available a pilot must hold a transport license to 
carry passengers for money but private pilots also may hold such a 
license 
the pilot list was checked against department of public safety 
records and court files for alcoholrelated driving violations over 
the past seven years 
of 41 pilots with alcohol offenses 25 were convicted of drunken 
driving or equivalent charges and 15 pleaded guilty to lesser 
charges which enabled them to avoid reporting their alcohol 
violations to the faa the newspaper said it didnt list the 
offense of the 41st pilot 
ten of the pilots had surrendered their drivers licenses for a 
year at some point rather than take bloodalcohol tests 
the faa has relied on pilots to voluntarily report alcohol 
convictions to the agency pilots often dont do so for fear 
theyll be diagnosed as alcoholic and lose their licenses to fly 
the paper said 
a 1987 audit by the us transportation department found that 
threefourths of all us pilots who were convicted of 
alcoholrelated offenses failed to report them to the faa as 
required 
northwest doesnt ask its pilots to report violations to the 
company nor does it routinely check their driving records which 
are available to the public the star tribune said 
the faa said last year that it intends to begin matching pilot 
names with those on the governments national driver register 
which lists drivers whose licenses have been suspended or revoked 
the agency also is seeking authority to cancel the medical 
certificates of pilots with multiple alcohol offenses and is 
considering testing pilots after accidents

hungarians voted sunday in their first 
free elections since 1947 and seemed determined to oust the 
communists who initiated democratic reform in hopes of gaining 
credit at the ballot box 
polling stations opened at 6 am with the last scheduled to 
close 14 hours later about 78 million hungarians are eligible to 
vote 
hungarians will choose a 394seat parliament in eastern europes 
second free elections a week after east germans backed a 
centerright movement to lead them to unity with west germany 
in a soviet bloc rushing toward democracy hungary remains 
unique while the people forced the communists in east germany 
czechoslovakia and romania to grant demands for democracy 
hungarys communists initiated reform then changed their name to 
the socialists and said they espoused westernstyle social 
democratic ideals 
yet there is little sign voters will reward them opinion polls 
suggest the socialists will end up with only about 10 percent of 
the overall vote 
in a year of remarkable reforms begun in the fall of 1988 
hungarys communists pointed the way for eastern europe by 
scrapping their partys guaranteed leading role from the 
constitution legalizing a multiparty system passing a new 
electoral law and altering the countrys name and emblem to wipe 
out communist affiliations hungary also opened its western border 
allowing thousands of east germans to flee their homeland and 
helping to bring about the fall of east germanys hardline 
communist leaders 
but those changes were overshadowed by memories of 43 years of 
communist rule in hungary 
in 1947 elections the communists won a relative majority 
largely through fraud a year later they consolidated power and 
forced all other parties out of existence 
all opposition parties contesting sundays ballot declared 
themselves open to almost any coalition scenario but excluded 
governing with the socialists 
a popular poster from the hungarian democratic forum one of the 
leading contenders for power symbolized the anticommunist 
antisoviet slant of the campaign it showed a bullnecked soldier 
with the russianlanguage caption comrades its all over 
while united in opposition to communism hungarians are unlikely 
to show a firm preference for any one party this would require a 
second round of voting tentatively scheduled april 8 
opinion polls suggested up to 25 percent of the voters were 
undecided about whom to back sunday 
international groups sent delegations to monitor the elections 
former vice president walter mondale leading a 50member group 
said there were a couple of pimples here and there in the 
campaign but no major problems 
the campaign centered mostly on unpleasant economic truths that 
are taking the edge off the thrill of choosing a government 
most parties agree that the stultified centralized economy 
should be converted to one governed by market forces none can deny 
the transformation is likely to bring unemployment and still higher 
prices to a country battling doubledigit inflation 
the new government also will inherit a 20 billion foreign debt 
the highest per capita in eastern europe 
another primary issue was romanias treatment of its ethnic 
hungarians at least seven people were killed last week in ethnic 
unrest in transylvania uniting all hungarian parties and awakening 
fears of neighboring romania 
at one opposition rally friday a woman expressed concern over 
any opposition move to accelerate the total withdrawal of soviet 
troops saying she feared a possible romanian military threat 
twelve parties garnered enough support to run on the national 
list in the complex electoral system forged by the communists and 
opposition last year 
seventeen other parties are running candidates on the local 
level with as many as 14 candidates in some races twentyone 
parties offered no candidates 
the six considered most likely to win seats in parliament are 
the hungarian democratic forum the league of free democrats the 
independent smallholders party the governing socialist party the 
league of young democrats and the social democratic party of 
hungary 
despite the broad palette of parties there were only two basic 
ideological trends on the political landscape the populist 
nationalism of the center right and more radical leftofcenter 
liberalism 
the conservative democratic forum lays considerable emphasis on 
hungarian traditions and christian values which are also espoused 
by the smaller hungarian peoples party and the christian 
democratic peoples party their strength lies largely in 
provincial towns outside budapest 
the forum led slightly in the most recent gallup poll from march 
12 with 21 percent 
next strongest with 203 percent were the free democrats a 
liberal party with social democratic leanings that wants to move 
hungary quickly toward a westernstyle society there was no margin 
of error cited in the poll 
third in the poll with 157 percent of support of the 1000 
respondents were the independent smallholders their main support 
is in rural hungary where they have pledged to return land taken 
by the communists to its owners 
the league of young democrats espouses views close to those of 
the free democrats and hopes to garner 10 percent of the vote

a speech by cuban president fidel castro that could 
be heard on radios as far away as north carolina raised concern 
saturday that the warning shot across the bow may have been 
fired in the battle over tv marti 
the federal communications commission complained to cuba about 
the broadcast over six am frequencies said spokeswoman lorrie 
secrest 
tv marti the usfinanced television station is expected to 
begin beaming programs to cuba this month from a balloon over the 
florida keys in spite of cubas protests 
cuba regards the prospect of us news shows sitcoms and soap 
operas as a blatant intrusion on national sovereignty or 
teleagression as castro calls it 
in the midst of final preparations for the debut of tv marti 
castros havana speech popped onto the airwaves friday night ms 
secrest said 
us signals have been jammed many times in recent years 
especially when the 5yearold radio marti the model for the tv 
station was being debated in congress 
the cuban government has threatened retaliation if the bush 
administration went ahead with a 90day test of tv marti previous 
radio jamming from the communist nation has come at different 
times frequencies and power levels 
we are very vulnerable in the united states said susan 
kraus spokeswoman for the national association for broadcasters 
we have to wonder if this is the warning shot across the bow 
preceding an allout radio war 
of primary concern to us broadcasters is cubas transmitting 
potential including a 1 millionwatt and two 500000watt 
transmitters the highest power level allowed by fcc licenses is 
50000 watts 
they have the capability of jamming am stations in more than 
30 states all the way north to the canadian border and all the way 
west to utah kraus said saturday in a telephone interview from 
washington they have demonstrated this in the past 
although stations as distant as colorado have reported previous 
jamming only two stations wamb in donelson tenn and wyru in red 
springs nc had filed complaints by late saturday night said 
ms secrest 
she said the fcc is following up on reports that the speech 
interfered with the signal of at least six am stations south of 
palm beach 
the cuban communist party newspaper granma mentioned friday 
morning that castros remarks would be broadcast toward to united 
states on friday evening and the fcc picked up the broadcast at 9 
pm est 
castro who has been holding fast against the reforms of the 
east bloc said in his speech that he recognized the socialist 
world has reached a delicate point but added capitalism hasnt 
solved the problems of latin america

prime minister bob hawke said sunday it 
appeared his labor party prevailed in parliamentary elections and 
his conservative opponent andrew peacock conceded a labor victory 
was likely 
hawke speaking a day after saturdays vote said he expected a 
oneseat majority in the 148seat house of representatives he said 
a worst case scenario would give labor 73 seats and the 
conservative coalition 73 with two independents 
hawke clearly surprised by the apparent tight outcome said 
that when final results are in i hope it may be a bit better 
than that one seat it will give a sense of discipline for sure 
and we can do it 
peacock 51 would not concede defeat but on sunday the leader 
of the liberal and national party coalition acknowledged labor had 
a better chance of taking the election 
if you are setting a book i suggest the shortest odds would be 
regrettably on a hung parliament followed then by a labor 
government just ahead of a possibility of a coalition government 
peacock said in melbourne 
peacock who made his second bid for the prime ministership 
emphasized however the outcome of six or seven seats in the 
states of western australia and queensland still had not been 
decided 
vote counting routinely suspended for sunday was to resume 
monday political leaders said the results wont be known for sure 
until thursday when mailin ballots are counted 
forty of 70 senate seats were also contested saturday and early 
results showed the small democratic party made strong gains the 
house the more powerful chamber chooses the prime minister 
communities with undecided races included the small town of 
kennedy in northern queensland where several thousand voters were 
unable to cast their ballots because polling booths were cut off by 
floodwaters 
hawke 60 has governed for seven years he campaigned on his 
record of economic management despite dissatisfaction over record 
home mortgage interest rates and a 100 billion foreign debt 
hawke said the 1990 election would set the course for australian 
politics into the 21st century 
australia has 106 million eligible voters among its 165 
million people and voting is compulsory 
when vote counting closed saturday night labor appeared to have 
won 73 seats the coalition 70 and the independents two 
the independents the first elected in 24 years could hold the 
balance of power in the house labor which had 85 seats in the 
previous lower house needs 75 seats for a working majority 
australia is a close us ally and president bush said he hoped 
to visit the country before the years end 
hawke came to power in 1983 was reelected the following year 
and again in 1987 he has said that if reelected in this race he 
will seek a fifth term before retiring

the most rev robert runcie said sunday he will 
retire next january as archbishop of canterbury the leader of 70 
million anglicans worldwide 
runcie made the announcement during a morning service at 
canterbury cathedral marking the 10th anniversary of his 
enthronement his london office said 
runcie offered his resignation to queen elizabeth ii in her role 
as head of the church of england one of 27 selfgoverning churches 
within the anglican communion which also includes 25 million us 
episcopalians 
the church of england requires its bishops to retire at age 70 
but runcie said he would step down on january 31 eight months 
before his 70th birthday on oct 2 1991

appoint his successor it is widely believed she will select 
someone whose social and economic views are more in tune with her 
own 
runcie a liberal prelate has often spoken against the policies 
of mrs thatchers governing conservative party

in the 1982 falklands war he supported coal miners during their 
1984 strike and in 1985 runcie said the english church should 
contribute millions of dollars to relieve poverty and homelessness 
in britain 
i judge the beginning of 1991 to be the right time for me to 
hand over to the next archbishbop of canterbury runcie said in a 
statement 
the public announcement today will give sufficient time for 
the name of my successor to be known well before the end of this 
year i ask for prayers in support of those responsible for making 
that choice 
runcie has been credited with holding his church together during 
controversy over the ordination of women bishops about 1200 women 
priests have been ordained by us episcopalians and anglicans in 
canada and new zealand but the church of england still does not 
permit the ordination of women

were out to have fun i saw walltowall bodies an indication 
of mass confusion and panic 
the blaze was brought under control by 6 am said a fire 
department spokesman lee rodriguez 
officials said the fires rapid spread suggested an accelerant 
was used that heavy volume of fire immediately arouses 
suspicion said assistant fire chief robert ungar 
one witness heard what sounded like gunshots before the fire 
but unger would not comment on reports that there was a fight 
before the fire broke out or that gasoline cans were found at the 
scene 
ems lt roy david said he got to the scene just a man believed 
to be the lone survivor apparently the clubs disc jockey was 
staggering out 
he walked toward me david said he couldnt talk he 
couldnt say anything all we could do was treat him 
another witness victor perry said there were no people 
coming out the djs clothes were stuck to his burnt skin which was 
coming off 
the building received an eviction notice in january because of 
improper exits and was in the process of being condemned said 
building commissioner charles smith 
the sad part of it is that this did not have to happen said 
mayor david dinkins who visited the scene a few hours after the 
fire many of an estimateed 700 similar clubs operating in new york 
city may be unsafe and are being investigated he said 
a fire at another bronx social club killed 25 people on oct 24 
1976 
ungar put the death toll at 87 or 88 people a makeshift morgue 
was set up in the building next door and relatives gathered at the 
scene authorities said the victims were mostly latin immigrants 
primarily hondurans 
lynn schulman an ems spokeswoman said most of the victims died 
from smoke inhalation but added some people were trampled 
she said the survivor was a 25yearold man who suffered 
secondand thirddegree burns on his arms and legs and was taken to 
jacobi hospital in guarded condition 
five firefighters including a battalion chief who broke his 
leg were taken to jacobi hospital after inhaling smoke and at 
least six other firefighters were treated for minor smoke 
inhalation at the scene she said 
perry said three sounds like gunshots were heard just prior to 
the fire in the building that housed the club which was only 20 
feet by 50 feet 
rosemary green whose sisterinlaw and cousin were at the club 
said she and other people were coming from a neighborhood birthday 
party and going to club when she encountered the scene 
people were screaming they were all burned were looking 
for friends and relatives and nobodys telling us anything she 
said once you got in the entrance there was no way to get out 
the building housed a group that organized childrens baseball 
as well as adult socializing said lillian rivera a neighbor who 
lives across the street from the club 
at least 30 firefighters from six companies were called to the 
scene rodriguez said 
the fire was the deadliest in the continental united states 
since a may 28 1977 blaze that consumed the beverly hills supper 
club in southgate ky killing 164 people a dec 31 1986 fire

1988 as new construction failed to keep pace with a 54 percent 
increase in the number of prisoners the justice departmnt said 
sunday 
the size of housing space for each inmate shrunk 6 percent from 
543 square feet in 1983 to 509 square feet in 1988 despite a 437 
percent increase in total jail space according to a study by the 
departments bureau of justice statistics

a 42yearold rift between sri lankas 
sinhalese majority and tamil minority begins a new and possibly 
less hostile chapter this week with the end of indias 
pendulumlike intervention in the conflict 
the last indian soldiers left sri lankas northeastern shores 
saturday ending a 2year jungle war against the tamil guerrillas 
they once trained 
now the sinhalesedominated government and tamils seeking an 
independent nation are reassessing their traditional antagonism 
both sides want to build on the tenuous peace they forged last 
summer a peace that grew out of mutual opposition to the indian 
presence 
but the durability of their newfound understanding is being 
questioned 
i am afraid the peace will break down once the convergence of 
their aims ends a western diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity and the convergence ends when the last indian soldier 
steps on a ship for home 
the tamilsinhalese discord simmering since sri lanka became 
independent from britain in 1948 spawned a tamil insurgency in 
1983 it also fueled an uprising against the government in 1987 by 
ultranationalist sinhalese who objected to peace overtures made to 
the tamils 
the twin wars have killed at least 17000 people and brought 
this tropical island once famed as a sunandsand holiday 
destination to the brink of anarchy 
in the tamildominated north and east the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam and other tamil groups launched a guerrilla war first 
against the sri lankan army and then against the indian 
peacekeepers 
sinhalese radicals and government forces were locked in a grisly 
battle in the south and center of the island every morning they 
left bodies of victims in remote villages and along the coastal 
highway 
the sinhalese uprising came to a virtual halt in december after 
most radical leaders were killed by sri lankan security forces 
on the tamil front the militants and the government reached a 
rare understanding both wanted indian forces off the island 
we are both against foreign occupation armies ajit 
mahataya the tigers secondincommand told the island a colombo 
newspaper this may have helped build up trust that has allowed 
us to negotiate seriously 
india encouraged by its own tamil minority became involved in 
the tamil war for an independent nation soon after it began in 
1983 most tamil rebel groups including the tigers were based in 
the southern indian city of madras and were trained in military 
camps in india 
when the sri lankan army stepped up repression against the 
tamils in 1987 india tried to pressure colombo into calling a 
ceasefire 
the pressure tactics worked but with a twist the sri lankan 
government agreed to give the tamils limited autonomy but said 
indian soldiers must enforce a surrender of arms by the guerrillas 
india acting on behalf of the tamils signed a peace pact with 
sri lanka on july 29 1987 two months later the tigers repudiated 
the agreement claiming they were not consulted and turned their 
guns on the indians 
soon india was fighting a fullscale war at one point pitching 
as many as 125000 soldiers against an estimated 2000 tiger 
guerrillas and countless parttime fighters 
at least 1155 indian soldiers and about 2000 tigers were 
killed in battle 
last summer sri lanka demanded the indians leave the new 
government headed by president ranasinghe premadasa said it could 
handle the tamil insurrection 
after initial hesitation india agreed to go 
we are leaving with at least part of our job done an indian 
diplomat said on condition of anonymity we may not have got an 
aplus but we did not get a cminus either we are leaving sri 
lanka a united nation and that is a tremendous achievement 
considering the situation in 1987 
some analysts believe the sinhalesetamil unity will last 
the government of sri lanka does not want to go back to square 
one said neelan tiruchelvam a tamil political analyst 
another confrontation will destroy the nation state 
at the root of the problem is the tigers demand for 
independence which they have not renounced despite the truce with 
colombo 
talks center on what kind of power the tigers will exercise 
government officials say tamil areas will form a loose federal 
state with considerable local autonomy 
the answer is somewhere between a totally independent state 
and the kind of provincial power we have now said bradman 
weerakoon president premadasas top adviser 
i see a superb chance for coming to terms weerakoon a 
sinhalese said previous governments had not completely realized 
that there were some areas that could be perceived as being 
discriminatory to the tamils this president realizes that tamil 
demands have some kind of basis 
tamils claim discrimination by the sinhalese who form 75 
percent of the countrys 16 million people and control the 
government military and most employment opportunities sinhalese 
say the tamils who comprise 18 percent of the population hold 
jobs and wealth disproportionate to their numbers 
premadasas efforts to ease ethnic tensions have struck a chord 
among the tigers but they say they are prepared to return to the 
jungle 
we are giving him all the opportunities we can stanley 
dominic a senior guerrilla said from the northern tigerheld town 
of jaffna if he doesnt use them properly and as a result there 
is another war we are prepared for it

saloth suong devoted his life to 
cambodian buddhism and royal tradition his brother tried to 
eradicate both and stands accused of slaughtering 33 million 
compatriots 
saloth suongs brother is saloth sar alias pol pot whose 
primitive communist revolution ranks in savagery with adolf 
hitlers holocaust and the mass purges of soviet dictator josef 
stalin 
saloth suong 78 says he is unsure what drove his younger 
brother to impose the reign of terror whose victims included 
members of their own family 
he does not want to see his brother again either for a personal 
reunion or as head of the khmer rouge guerrillas pol pot is said to 
still lead 
but i am not afraid if they come i am too old already for 
fear he said i pray often at the pagoda 
his 71yearold wife chea samy is less fatalistic the most 
prominent mistress of cambodian classical dance she works to 
preserve the art as a teacher at the fine arts university 
in one of the many tragic ironies of the couples lives it was 
pol pot who tried to stamp out the exquisite dance along with 
other centuriesold cultural legacies 
if they came back they would destroy it again so i must teach 
and document as much as possible she said sitting beside her 
husband in their spartan rooms in a decrepit apartment block 
saloth suong bears a striking resemblance to his infamous 
brother he has the same stocky build fleshy cheeks and high 
forehead and he says the two were close as boys and young men 
saloth sar was a very polite gentle boy he respected the old 
people and they liked him his brother said i have no idea why 
he became so evil i keep wondering about that maybe it was the 
things he studied and the friends who influenced him 
pol pots father is said to have been a landowning farmer of 
good standing a cousin who married into the royal family took some 
of the nine children including pol pot and saloth suong to phnom 
penh for studies 
through the cousin pol pot is distantly related to prince 
norodom sihanouk the former cambodian leader imprisoned by pol pot 
and now chief of the uneasy guerrilla alliance fighting phnom 
penhs vietnamesebacked government the usbacked resistance 
includes the khmer rouge 
saloth suong says pol pot lived with him for years chea samy 
bought him food washed his clothes and helped him with life in the 
capital the cousin connected to the cambodian royalty proved a 
second mother 
with a scholarship in hand pol pot left to study radio 
electronics in paris in 1949 but failed his exams much of his time 
was reportedly spent talking leftist politics with fellow 
cambodians some historians say the khmer rouge was born on paris 
left bank 
saloth suong says he saw his brother for the last time in the 
early 1960s 
sihanouks police were hunting for the fledgling revolutionary 
who fled to the jungle to help organize the ultraradical movement 
he would soon dominate for years saloth suong thought his brother 
had been killed 
saloth suongs own career was spent within the royal palace as 
an administrator protocol official and personal assistant to 
sihanouks mother queen kossamak 
sihanouk was toppled in 1970 and the ensuing fiveyear war ended 
with a khmer rouge victory saloth suong a brother and sister were 
forced into agrarian communes along with the entire population 
the brother died of hunger and illness and pol pots second 
mother starved to death 
saloth suong and chea samy say they labored from 5 am to 7 
pm he cut logs for firewood she washed 700 dishes daily in a 
communal kitchen illness sapped their strength 
in late 1978 while cleaning the communal kitchen saloth sar 
watched workers putting up a photograph of the shadowy khmer rouge 
leader who had discarded his real name for that of pol pot 
at first i didnt recognize him but some people noted the 
resemblance and told me that pol pot was saloth sar he said 
recalling his feeling of anger 
people asked me why dont you go to pol pot he is a big 
man but i told them he was not really a brother to me so i could 
not come to him 
vietnamese forces overthrew the khmer rouge in late 1978 the 
government has said the regime killed 33 million people in 
executions famine and civil unrest other estimates are lower but 
still astounding given cambodias 1975 population of about 8 
million 
after the new government was installed in early 1979 saloth 
suong and his wife returned to phnom penh and his brother fled back 
to the jungle despite his announced retirement in 1985 pol pot is 
believed to still lead the khmer rouge 
vietnam said it withdrew all its troops from cambodia last year 
leaving the government led by prime minister hun sen to fight the 
resistance 
saloth suong lives quietly and works parttime as a keeper of 
artistic property at the ministry of culture late last year he 
returned to his native village for a reunion with three surviving 
siblings there was a buddhist ceremony of gratitude and 
remembrance of dead family members 
the village temple traditional center of rural life had been 
turned into a hospital by the khmer rouge its images smashed its 
monks derobed asked if they were shunned because of their brother 
saloth suong laughed gently 
not at all he said the villagers welcomed us with warmth 
because they knew we too had suffered under pol pot

a legless armless woman who won 
custody of her daughter 14 years ago by changing the babys diaper 
with her teeth now plays we shall overcome and over the 
rainbow on this citys boardwalk by pressing her tongue against a 
keyboard 
however her music strikes the wrong chord with municipal 
prosecutor steve smoger who said celestine tate is a con 
artist taking advantage of a special permit given her by the city 
by not living up to an agreement to pay a fine in exchange for 
being allowed to perform 
ms tate a 34yearold mother of two who lives in ventnor said 
during a break from a recent performance in front of ballys park 
place casino hotel that she just wants to play her music 
its a nice way to occupy my time rather than just sitting 
around doing nothing ms tate said in a singsong voice 
she frequently asks god to bless passersby who drop quarters 
and dollar bills into the bucket in front of her hospital gurney 
smoger estimates ms tate earns from 120000 to 140000 a 
year ms tate puts the figure at more like 70000 to 80000 
she said her two daughters ages 11 and 14 attend private 
school in philadelphia and that she has to pay her 750amonth 
rent plus the expenses of a woman who comes in to help her at a 
weekly cost of 158 
in 1976 ms tate had to prove to a philadelphia judge that she 
could care for the first of those girls after the welfare 
department said she lacked the ability to raise the child 
i changed her diaper in court and the judge gave her back to 
me ms tate said adding the childs paternal grandmother forced 
her to break up with the girls father because she was disabled 
it was the lords will that i give birth to her so it must be his 
will that i have her 
ms tate was born in philadelphia suffering from birth defects 
that left her legs and arms undeveloped during the interview she 
had to ask her cousin to pull a blue blanket over her when the wind 
blew off the atlantic ocean onto the boardwalk 
god gave me ways to use my mouth that people with hands 
cant she said i wouldnt trade me with anybody 
ms tate reaches the boardwalk spot with the help of a cousin 
who pushes her gurney two miles from ventnor she said she likes to 
pass the boardwalks rolling chairs en route 
ill be saying beep beep when i pass them said ms 
tate who laughs and smiles easily raising her eyes from her 
keyboard to see whomever she is talking with 
she learned her craft in philadelphia at a music school for the 
disabled and came five years ago to atlantic city a tourist 
destination she remembered as a child and wanted to return to as an 
adult 
tourists and residents alike seem to gravitate toward her 
filling her bucket as if it it were a wishing well with requests 
guaranteed 
i think its beautiful said millie vixson after she floated 
a 1 bill into the bucket i admire the idea 
ms tate who is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds 
has had to battle repeatedly to preserve a spot on the boardwalk 
and make a living and her battles may not be over 
in march 1989 the city gave ms tate a special permit that 
exempted her from the citys 80yearold ordinance barring 
boardwalk panhandling as part of the agreement municipal judge 
bruce weekes said she had to pay a 2600 fine over the next year 
for 26 violations that followed a similar agreement reached in 
november 1986 between her and city officials 
smoger said she has reneged on her latest agreement ms tate 
freely acknowleges she hasnt paid the fines arguing that since 
that shes not a beggar she shouldnt have to pay them 
she said she is not worried about possible further legal action 
against her 
youre going to lock me up and feed me in jail or im going to 
eat on my own ms tate said 
smoger said he sympathizes with ms tates disability but grows 
tired of sparring with her over her failure to pay the outstanding 
fines 
she has done a remarkable job and should be commended for 
elevating herself to the position she has smoger said shes a 
con artist every benefit that could be bestowed on to her has been 
bestowed by the city of atlantic city 
he said he will seek revocation of her license if she does not 
pay the full 2600 when her license comes up for its yearly 
renewal in june 
smoger defended the antibegging ordinance as necessary to 
prevent the boardwalk from being swamped with people asking for 
money ms tate said shes an entertainer not a beggar or a public 
nuisance 
i could not be begging with my mouth full she said 
her latest court battle involves something different than her 
freedom to make a living she is scheduled for a hearing in egg 
harbor township municipal court friday on marijuana possession 
charges ms tate said she is innocent 
howard mitchell ms tates cousin and the most recent relative 
to push her gurney down the boardwalk and watch over her said he 
has faith in the woman he calls teeny 
i get up and run away from life when i get scared mitchell

disclosure that the veterans affairs 
department is reviewing its 12 billion benefits program has caused 
more scrambling than a battle alert among veterans advocates 
the enemy real or imagined wont be known until the va 
issues its proposals in the next six weeks still veterans groups 
are upset because va began the review without telling them and 
didnt announce it until the disabled american veterans obtained 
internal va documents and revealed their existence at a 
congressional hearing feb 27 
the american legion says the disclosure has set back relations 
with veterans service organizations that had begun to improve with 
the elevation last year of the va to cabinet level and the 
appointment of a new va chief 
it angers me that the department is looking for ways to 
eliminate certain benefits particularly when these deliberations 
have been carried out without the knowledge of those who serve as 
consumer advocates for veterans legion commander miles s epling 
said in a letter march 8 to va secretary edward j derwinski 
va says it is only trying to make the system more fair that 
savings would be plowed back into the financially strapped health 
care system and congress would have to approve any modifications 
furthermore va says there would be increases in benefits as 
well as decreases and any cuts would apply only to future veterans 
i think they should wait until we put a package on the 
table said deputy secretary anthony j principi who is leading 
the benefits review 
but try telling that to organizations representing the nations 
27 million military veterans tinkering with social security could 
be easier 
the va pays 12 billion a year to 22 million veterans 310000 
widows or widowers and 1 million dependents or spouses to 
compensate for disabilities and death 
the review follows a general accounting office study last july 
that said va paid 17 billion in 1986 to compensate for diseases 
that arose during military service but were neither caused nor 
aggravated by service 
the report said congress may wish to reconsider whether 
eight diseases should be considered as serviceconnected and 
eligible for compensation arteriosclerotic heart disease 
diabetes bronchitis and emphysema arthritis hemorrhoids 
multiple sclerosis uterine fibroids and crohns disease 
congress did nothing its not a sacred cow and well look at 
it some day in the future said rep gv sonny montgomery 
the mississippi democrat who chairs the house veterans affairs 
committee 
the va is considering the gao recommendations although principi 
says the internal review would have been undertaken regardless va 
says costcutting recommendations are balanced by ones to make it 
possible for a veteran to be declared 100 percent disabled after 10 
years instead of 20 years for mentally ill veterans to retain 
benefits while trying to enter the job market and by paying a flat 
compensation rate for surviving spouses 
veterans organizations say they became suspicious of the va 
because of it did not challenge the gaos conclusions more 
forcefully 
va is not required to examine the nature of certain diseases 
or to determine a causal connection to military service 
derwinski told gao in a letter that was part of the report 
f david parker president of the paralyzed veterans of america 
said we will never accept the argument that veterans who served 
24 hours every day always on call while on active duty in every 
corner of the world should not be compensated for a disability 
that was not the result of an actual military duty 
the veterans groups say va is resurrecting proposals made by 
groups more interested in slashing the budget than in helping 
veterans 
they say va had been discussing such proposals as eliminating 
costofliving payments for people with 10 percent to 20 percent 
disability ratings or even eliminating payments for people in 
those lower disability ratings and means testing for certain 
payments 
i think we blew their scenario said john heilman 
legislative director of the disabled american veterans he said 
that without davs intervention va would have acted behind the 
scenes 
heilmans group and the pva claim principi is carrying out the 
agenda of sen alan k simpson rwyo former head of the senate 
veterans affairs committee and a critic of the benefits system 
principi formerly was a top aide to simpson who urged his senate 
colleagues in a letter march 7 to keep an open mind and not be 
sucked in by the hysterical hype of these professional fundraising 
veterans 
principi says there was no secrecy involved many proposals were 
rejected early in the process he said and the va wanted to settle 
on a group of proposals before releasing them

the share of doctors who use breast 
xrays to look for cancer in symptomfree women has doubled to 
nearly 100 percent in five years marking a milestone in early 
cancer detection the president of the american cancer society said 
sunday 
ninetysix percent of physicians said last year they used 
mammograms to screen symptomfree women at least some of the time 
compared with 49 percent in a 1984 survey said dr robert 
schweitzer 
while that does not mean all women are receiving the mammograms 
as often as the cancer society recommends the trend is an 
important milestone in the road toward that goal schweitzer said 
the percentage of doctors who said they met or exceeded the 
cancer societys recommended mammogram guidelines tripled from 11 
percent in 1984 to 37 percent in 1989 
schweitzer discussed the survey findings at a science writers 
conference sponsored by the cancer society 
under the societys guidelines a woman with no symptoms of 
breast cancer should get a mammogram between ages 35 and 39 a test 
that serves as a baseline for comparison in future tests women 
40 to 49 should have a breast xray every one to two years 
depending on physical condition and previous mammogram results and 
those age 50 and over should have one every year 
mammograms and other cancer screening tests are aimed at finding 
cancer in its early stages when it is more curable 
the physician survey was commissioned by the cancer society it 
covered 1029 general and family practitioners internists and 
obstetricians and gynecologists 
results were weighted so that the percentages would reflect all 
doctors in those specialties now practicing in the continental 
united states the margin of error was generally plus or minus 2 
percent to 3 percent 
sixtyone percent of physicians said they were giving greater 
emphasis to early breast cancer detection in symptomfree patients 
than they had five years ago in 1984 39 percent had said they 
were giving it increased emphasis 
fortyfour percent said they were putting greater emphasis 
specifically on mammograms last year compared with 14 percent in 
1984 
the survey also found that the number of doctors who check for 
blood in the stool a potential sign of colorectal cancer rose 
from 75 percent in 1984 to 89 percent in 1989 
schweitzer said the only screening test not reported to be 
widely used was proctosigmoidoscopy in which a tubeshaped device 
is used for inspecting the colon fortynine percent of doctors 
reported using that test last year up from 35 percent in 1984 
only 23 percent of physicians said last year that they followed 
or exceeded cancer society guidelines for the test which the 
society recommends every three to five years in symptomfree 
persons age 50 and over 
fortyone percent of doctors said they use chest xrays to 
screen symptomfree patients a practice the cancer society does 
not recommend

government scientists are expected to release 
a study this week that will help determine officially whether 
vietnam veterans who were exposed to the herbicide agent orange 
suffered cancers and other ailments as a result 
the study by the federal centers for disease control which the 
veterans affairs department says will be released thursday 
examines the incidence of five kinds of cancer among vietnam vets 
it is another step in a 12year battle to gain benefits for 
veterans who blame cancers skin disease and miscarriages in their 
spouses on the powerful foliage killer 
va secretary edward j derwinski last november said he would put 
off a determination on whether to award benefits until after the 
study was completed following its release the study must be 
reviewed by a va advisory committee of outside scientists 
derwinski will make a determination at the end of may after the 
committee meets va spokesman don smith said last week final rules 
should be in place in october the decision also could influence 
legislation in the house and senate requiring compensation to 
veterans 
derwinski said in a recent interview that the decision on agent 
orange will be the most difficult hes made since becoming the 
first va secretary a year ago 
the advice is so terribly conflicting he said theres no 
consensus out there 
nearly 35000 claims have been filed citing agent orange as a 
cause of disabilities an additional 230000 veterans have told va 
they were exposed to the herbicide which contained highly toxic 
dioxin and other suspected harmful ingredients 
the new selected cancers study by the cdc in atlanta does not 
look at whether veterans were exposed to agent orange which was 
sprayed to remove foliage and kill crops 
according to the va the new study will determine whether 
vietnam veterans are at higher risk of developing softtissue 
sarcoma lymphoma and nasal nasopharyngeal and liver cancer the 
study began in 1985 
cdc spokesman chuck fallis said he could not confirm that the 
study would be released thursday the day given by the va and the 
american legion 
va says the study can be combined with other studies mostly 
dealing with the exposure of industrial and farm workers to dioxin 
to tilt the balance one way or the other regarding a possible 
connection to disorders 
the legion however is telling veterans not to hold their 
breaths 
the government has ducked the issue of agent orange for more 
than a dozen years national commander miles s epling said we 
are tired of waiting for more studies especially irrelevant ones 
the legion contends the cdc scuttled an earlier attempt at a 
study by saying no reliable sample of veterans can be found the 
legion says cdc has ignored detailed military records of troop 
movements and spraying activities that could produce such a study 
group 
a legion study claims to have established a connection between 
agent orange and skin rashes and blisters fatty tissue tumors 
hypersensitivity of the eyes to light and an increased risk of 
miscarriages among spouses the legion says the study was too 
limited to reach further conclusions regarding other cancers 
va says scientific advisers to congress and the administration 
have rejected the legion study because it relied on questionnaires 
filled out by the veterans themselves 
the agent orange issue was revived last may when us district 
judge thelton e henderson said va had used too rigid a standard 
cause and effect between exposure and disease in evaluating agent 
orange studies 
derwinski decided not to appeal hendersons order that the va 
need only find a significant statistical association between 
exposure and disease before determining to award compensation 
the vas outside environmental hazards advisory committee met in 
november to review about 30 studies dealing with herbicide exposure 
and its relation to nonhodgkins lymphoma using the new criteria 
the group said it could neither find nor rule out a significant 
statistical association giving little guidance to derwinski 
derwinski said afterward he would wait for the new cdc study he 
cited remarks by members of the committee that such a study would 
be useful

prime minister bob hawkes conservative 
challenger said incomplete election returns sunday indicated he was 
likely to fail in his attempt to block hawke from serving a record 
fourth consecutive term 
hawke who has governed for seven years said he and his labor 
party expected to stay in power with a onevote majority in the 
148seat house of representatives after saturdays balloting 
andrew peacock the opposition leader of the liberal and 
national party coalition acknowledged labor probably had the 
numbers in parliament 
if you are setting a book i suggest the shortest odds would be 
regrettably on a hung parliament followed then by a labor 
government just ahead of a possibility of a coalition government 
peacock told reporters in melbourne 
when counting was halted saturday night labor appeared to have 
won 73 seats the coalition 70 and the independents two labor 
which had 85 seats in the previous lower house needs 75 seats for 
a working majority 
there was no further counting sunday and the earliest results 
were expected monday the final outcome may not be known until 
thursday when mailin ballots are counted 
hawke 60 told a news conference early sunday that he will 
continue in a caretaker capacity and that he expected to form a 
government that would keep him in power for another threeyear term 
hawke clearly surprised by the close election said that when 
final results are in he expected a onevote majority but added i 
hope it may be a bit better than that 
australias sagging economy had been the focus of a largely 
uneventful fiveweek campaign during which peacock told the 
countrys 106 million voters that hawkes policies could lead to a 
recession 
peacock criticized the government for record 18 percent mortgage 
rates and a 100 billion foreign debt in this nation of 165 
million 
peacock who at 51 had made his second bid for the prime 
ministership said he would continue planning for the transition of 
government because the outcome of six or seven seats in the states 
of western australia and queensland still had not been decided 
political pundits had said peacocks political career hung in 
the balance with defeat likely to lead to him being dumped as 
leader of the liberal party 
he said his coalition could pick up several of the doubtful 
seats which includes the small town of kennedy in northern 
queensland where several thousand voters were unable to cast their 
ballots because polling booths were cut off by floodwaters 
hawke came to power in 1983 was reelected the following year 
and again in 1987 he has said that if reelected in this race he 
will seek a fifth term before retiring

troops dispersed hundreds of 
demonstrators in kosovo province sunday after the government 
accused albanian nationalists of causing a mysterious illness that 
sickened hundreds of ethnic albanian teenagers 
the republic of serbia which assumed direct control of police 
in the southern province saturday sent 2500 police reinforcements 
to maintain law and order radio belgrade reported 
sreten lukic chief of serbias police force in kosovo 
announced a purge of ethnic albanian policemen who allegedly did 
nothing to protect serbs from attacks last week the belgrade daily 
politika ekspres reported 
police sunday morning dispersed 2000 members of kosovos ethnic 
albanian majority demonstrating near titova mitrovica 24 miles 
north of the provincial capital pristina 
ethnic albanians also reportedly manned occasional roadblocks 
checking drivers papers in the poor rugged province bordering 
albania 
at urosevac 18 miles south of pristina about 800 serbs and 
montenegrins from kosovos slav minority rallied to demand that 
police confiscate weapons from all ethnic albanians radio belgrade 
said 
nearly 1000 schoolchildren most of them members of kosovos 
ethnic albanian majority were hospitalized last week complaining 
of lung and other complaints and alleging they were poisoned by a 
mysterious gas 
at least one serb policeman and one serb schoolgirl also 
reportedly sought treatment in titova mitrovica north of pristina 
for the illness 
a yugoslav health ministry friday dismissed claims of poisoning 
but ethnic albanian leaders in kosovo claimed their investigations 
were biased 
late saturday the federal government announced that the 
mystifying incident was an action of albanian separatists 
intended to stir more unrest in kosovo 
evidently this involved a planned action by albanian 
extremist nationalists designed to spark further deepening of 
nationalist skirmishes with possible tragic consequences the 
government said according to the official news agency tanjug 
military authorities say no trace of poison has been found among 
the victims and in the statement the government did not say what 
it thought the illness was or how it was caused 
more than 60 people have died in ethnic violence in the past 
year in the province which is administratively part of serbia 
ninety percent of its population are ethnic albanians seeking to 
regain autonomy lost last year when serbia assumed direct control 
of kosovos judiciary and schools 
serbia the largest of yugoslavias six republics argued this 
was necessary to protect the slav minority in kosovo the cradle of 
serbias medieval kingdom

thousands of prodemocracy 
demonstrators gathered in the capitals central square sunday to 
demand democratic reforms including an end to government funding 
for the ruling communist party 
speakers also demanded the abolition of party cells in 
ministries and schools some of the 7000 people in the square 
carried banners reading democracy is our gun and national 
unity 
the speakers who stood in a truckbed rigged with loudspeakers 
said they invited communist party officials to make speeches but 
none accepted 
the communist party formally called the mongolian peoples 
revolutionary party receives about 20 million tugriks a year or 
66 million at the official rate new political parties that plan 
to challenge the communists in upcoming elections receive no 
funding and lack money for offices and basic equipment 
demonstrations began in mongolia in december as communist 
governments throughout the soviet bloc began to give way to 
democratic movements 
protesters in mongolia have won a complete shakeup of top party 
and government ranks and promises of free elections but the 
opposition claims that in talks with the communist party authorites 
have reneged on their promises 
the opposition halted those talks last week claiming that the 
government representatives were changed each time talks were held 
and lacked the authority to reach agreemenmts 
we will go back if it will be televised live and have real 
decisionmaking power said i javkhlant leader of the mongolian 
democratic association one of the opposition groups 
if not he said his group will resort to more aggressive 
tactics he did not elaborate 
it is unclear whether the government will legalize all of the 
new opposition groups a top legislative official indicated 
saturday that only socialist parties would be permitted 
mongolia has been a satellite of moscow since soviet troops 
helped it win independence from china in 1921 but many mongolians 
resent the presence of about 60000 soviet soldiers and some 50000 
civilian experts and dependents 
moscow plans to withdraw its troops by 1992 and has called home 
some of the civilians 
at sundays rally the crowd gave some of its loudest cheers to a 
journalist dogoodorg who interviewed former dictator yumjaagiyn 
tsedenbal in february for the first time since his 1984 ouster 
like many mongolians dogoodorg uses only one name 
the interview aired saturday night on mongolian television saw 
the nowfeeble tsedenbal defend decades of harsh rule 
the authoritarian system has its positive side tsedenbal 
73 said from his moscow home he insisted party officials purged 
in the 1960s were chinese spies 
his soviet wife anastasia tried repeatedly to stop the 
interview shouting at the reporter and stepping in front of the 
camera

gov cecil andrus who once pushed for 
jailing women and doctors who participated in abortions now must 
decide the fate of another bill that would ban almost all abortions 
through civil rather than criminal sanctions 
the decision puts the threeterm democrat at the center one of 
the most divisive issues the country has seen since the vietnam 
war within the next three weeks he will either approve or veto 
the most restrictive state abortion law 
andrus refuses to discuss his intentions for the bill that would 
ban more than 90 percent of the 1500 abortions performed in idaho 
each year 
the idaho legislature on thursday gave final approval to a bill 
to ban abortions as a means of birth control allowing them only in 
cases of nonstatutory rape reported within seven days incest if 
the victim is younger than 18 severe fetal deformity or threat to 
the mothers life or health women who violate the provisions would 
not face sanctions but the physicians involved could face fines up 
to 10000 for a first offense 
on the night of the vote at a party andrus gave for democratic 
lawmakers he made a few noncommittal jokes about the decision 
awaiting him but his quip about just leaving town and letting the 
republican lieutenant governor handle the bill indicated his 
wariness of the issue 
in the days before that however andrus vehemently reaffirmed 
his longstanding opposition to abortion except in the case of rape 
incest and the life of the woman 
let there be no doubt in anyones mind as to cecil andrus 
position on abortion the governor said when he announced for 
reelection just days before the senate sent him the bill 
i have always opposed legalized abortion said andrus who 
is lutheran my views havent changed 
the bill headed to his desk is the one the national right to 
life committee wants to test the us supreme courts commitment to 
legalized abortion 
it would seem to fit the criteria set by andrus seventeen years 
ago in his first term as governor he signed legislation in the 
wake of the roe vs wade decision that would if the supreme court 
decision is ever overturned ban all abortions except to save the 
womans life and imprison the women and doctors involved 
a leading opponent of the abortion restrictions democratic sen 
marti calabretta said the discussions hes had with andrus in the 
past havent led me to believe he will do anything different 
still in making his decision the governor is also juggling 
economic and political considerations in the midst of his bid for 
an unprecedented fourth term as chief executive 
party leaders hoping to attract prochoice voters in the fall 
have been pressuring him to veto the bill that 14 of the 19 
democratic senators and 13 of the 21 democratic house members voted 
against 
it would be damaging for him sen karl brooks said citing 
public opinion polls showing that while a majority of idahoans 
oppose abortion even more oppose government intervention in the 
decision 
he would be out of touch with the party hes in and the state 
he governs brooks said thats bad politics 
but at age 58 with 30 years of public service under his belt 
both in idaho and in the cabinet under jimmy carter andrus is 
anything but bad at politics 
as carters interior secretary in 1980 he successfully guided 
the alaska lands bill through a national debate to create americas 
largest wilderness 
eighteen months ago he stared down the federal government he 
once served to end its use of his state as a temporary storage dump 
for radioactive waste 
a onetime logging and mill worker andrus served three terms in 
the state senate before making his first and only unsuccessful 
race for governor in 1966 
andrus is a heavy favorite this year to become the states first 
fourterm governor his only announced republican opponent in the 
prochoice camp is boise stockbroker milton erhart a political 
novice the likely gop nominee state sen rachel gilbert of boise 
backed the antiabortion bill 
andrus has reportedly been pressured by some of his major 
contributors on the potential negative economic impact of the 
restrictive abortion law that critics claim would drive doctors out 
of a state already seriously short of rural medical care 
there have also been threats by abortion rights supporters in 
other states that if the bill is not vetoed they will boycott 
idahos no 1 commodity potatoes 
but the independent governor has bristled at threats in the 
past and the latest controversy does not seemed to have changed 
that 
on the eve of the abortion bills final approval he told one 
supporter who was lobbying him for a veto if you make this one 
issue your determination of whether you support me after 30 years 
i dont want your support

the archbishop of canterbury the most rev robert 
runcie announced sunday he will resign as leader of the worlds 70 
million anglicans next jan 31 
runcie said his chief hope before retiring was to be 
reunited with his envoy terry waite one of the 18 westerners held 
hostage in lebanon waite disappeared in beirut three years ago 
while trying to negotiate the release of other hostages 
my thoughts are very much that we shall be united again 
runcie told reporters thats what i pray for before i lay down 
this office 
runcie tendered his resignation a few weeks ago to queen 
elizabeth ii the temporal head of the state church of england 
said his spokeswoman eve keatley 
he delayed making a public announcement until sundays morning 
service at canterbury cathedral in southeast england marking the 
10th anniversary of his enthronement as the 102nd successor to st 
augustine 
the archbishop of canterbury is spiritual leader of the church 
of england and 26 other selfgoverning churches which make up the 
anglican communion including the 25 millionmember us episcopal 
church 
the church of england requires its bishops to retire at age 70 
but runcies planned departure date falls eight months before his 
70th birthday 
in a statement runcie said his early announcement is intended to 
give prime minister margaret thatcher time to appoint his successor 
later this year 
i am resigning now because it is 10 years and i think it is 
time to leave and hand over to somebody else runcie told 
reporters 
mrs thatcher will select the new archbishop from a list of two 
candidates drawn up by a committee of senior churchmen she will 
then make her recommendation to the queen who will make the formal 
appointment 
speculation about possible successors has touched on most of 
englands senior bishops as well as archbishop robin eames head of 
the anglican church in ireland mrs thatcher has consulted him in 
the past about northern ireland 
the sunday telegraph a conservative weekly which has rebuked 
the archbishop in the past said runcie would be difficult to 
replace 
there seems little prospect of finding anyone who would do 
this impossible job any better partly it is because he is a 
genuinely decent person intelligent witty and lacking in 
pomposity in a bureaucratic institution full of selfimportant and 
ruthless men 
it is widely expected that mrs thatcher will want to appoint 
someone more in step with her conservative views 
runcie had frequently been at odds with mrs thatchers 
government preaching forgiveness for argentina after the falkland 
islands war in 1982 and offering moral support to striking miners 
during their bitter yearlong strike 
he urged that more be done for the homeless and for decaying 
inner cities and last year he said britain was in danger of 
becoming a nation of pharisees pharisees were members of an 
ancient jewish party who were denounced by jesus christ for 
selfrighteousness and hypocrisy 
runcie has been credited with holding his church together during 
a time of falling attendance and a divisive debate over the 
ordination of women bishops women priests have been ordained by 
us episcopalians and anglicans in canada and new zealand but are 
still not permitted by the church of england 
runcie was born into a working class family which he described 
as not particularly religious he won a scholarship to study at 
oxford university and fought in world war ii as a tank commander 
where he was decorated for bravery 
church historians say he was the first primate to have fought 
for his country since the middle ages runcie said it was the 
horrors of the battlefield that inspired him to enter the 
priesthood in 1951 
mrs keatley said runcie and his wife rosalind a concert 
pianist would retire to st albans 19 miles northwest of london 
where they recently bought a home 
runcie told reporters he planned to spend his retirement 
reading watching cricket and spending time with his family

bucking the trend of multiparty 
reform in other parts of the world intellectuals and officials in 
this socialist country ended a threeday conference sunday by 
agreeing to keep their oneparty system 
intellectuals and party officials however acknowledged that 
recent events in eastern europe and the soviet union carried a 
message for their east african country 
rather than allowing a multiparty system the participants 
agreed tanzania should reform its single party to permit greater 
participation and end corruption 
walter bgoya general manager of the tanzania publishing house 
said the experience of eastern europe showed only the death of 
stalinism not of socialism 
stalinism he said was characterized by a cult of personality 
and secrecy in government he urged tanzanias government to open 
itself to public scrutiny 
the symposium was called to explore the effects of changes in 
eastern europe and the soviet union on tanzania which has had a 
socialist oneparty system of government since independence from 
un trusteeship in 1961

pope john paul ii on sunday appealed for 
sincere dialogue to find a just and peaceful solution to the 
standoff over heavily catholic lithuanias declaration of 
independence from the soviet union 
in his first public comments on lithuania since its march 11 
independence declaration the pope referred to the lithuanian 
nation and emphasized its centuriesold ties with the vatican 
however john paul stopped short of recognizing the independence 
declaration observers said the pope is reluctant to jeopardize the 
vaticans newly forged diplomatic ties with moscow 
in denmark the government urged an international condemnation 
of the soviet union for its attempts to cut off lithuania from the 
rest of the world news reports said sunday the soviet ambassador 
in copenhagen was called to the foreign ministry to receive an 
official protest note the reports said 
in washington president bushs national security adviser brent 
scowcroft said saturday that any soviet use of force or 
intimidation in lithuania would be counterproductive to 
ussoviet relations 
scowcroft said the bush administration would take appropriate 
measures in response to what it considered excessive soviet 
pressure or an increase in tensions in the baltic republic 
he did not elaborate but said military action was not a likely 
option 
moscow has sent tanks rumbling through lithuanias capital in 
what legislators there regard as an attempt by the red army to 
intimidate them so they will reconsider their declaration of 
independence 
the soviet foreign ministry also ordered foreign diplomats 
including two americans out of lithuania and said foreign 
journalists would no longer be allowed to travel to the baltic 
republic 
lithuania an independent country before world war ii is of 
special interest to the pope because it is the roman catholic 
stronghold in the soviet union an estimated 25 million people or 
80 percent of lithuanias population are roman catholics 
the vatican has never recognized the soviet annexation of 
lithuania and there is a lithuanian diplomatic mission accredited 
to the holy see 
today lithuania finds itself at the center of interest of 
europe and the world the pope said in his sunday noon angelus 
from his balcony overlooking st peters square let us pray to 
divine providence so that the lithuanian question finds a just and 
peaceful solution through sincere dialogue and in the framework of 
the international order 
may god give light and strength to all all those upon whom 
this resolution depends he said speaking in italian 
john paul who has often expressed the wish to visit his flock 
in lithuania noted that he was twice refused permission to make 
the trip in 1984 for celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of 
the death of lithuanias patron saint casimir and in 1986 for the 
600th anniversary of the evangelization of the area 
monsignor algimantas bartkus rector of the pontifical 
lithuanian college in rome hailed the popes remarks 
this spiritual and moral solidarity and support gives us the 
strength we need at this moment he said in a telephone interview 
lithuania has posed a delicate situation for the vatican which 
only 10 days ago established diplomatic ties with moscow for the 
first time since the 1917 russian revolution 
bartkus said he understands that the pope does not want to 
offend the kremlin by openly endorsing lithuanias independence 
we cannot ask for too much he said the holy father has 
always shown very special attention to lithuania and we know he is 
on our side 
the situation of the church in lithuania has improved 
substantially under soviet president mikhail s gorbachev but 
lithuanian cardinal vincentas sladkevicius recently told the 
catholic weekly il sabato that the church is not yet free and 
that lithuania should be independent 
gorbachev has invited the pope to visit the soviet union but 
the cardinal said he hopes john paul will travel to lithuania 
separately perhaps at the time of his trip to poland in june 1991 
lithuania is ready for the holy father bartkus said his 
visit would probably be the biggest event of the century for 
lithuania

rival christian forces fought with 
howitzers tank cannons and rocket launchers on mountaintops 
northeast of beirut on sunday and police said three people were 
killed and five wounded 
the artillery battle and an earlier one on saturday threatened 
a ceasefire agreement that brought months of fighting to ahalt on 
march 3 
police said the latest battle began at daybreak and raged past 
noon in the highlands of kesrouan province pitting troops of 
maverick gen michel aoun against the lebanese forces militia of 
christian warlord samir geagea 
both sides blamed each other for the fighting which police 
feared could lead to another allout battle for control of 
lebanons christian enclave the enclave includes 310 squares miles 
north and northeast of beirut 
the truce is fraying it will definitely collapse if the 
accelerating tempo of violations is not arrested a police 
spokesman said 
he said three civilians were killed and five people including 
two militiamen wounded in the exchanges that raised the overall

brazils new economic plan has led 
to the arrest of about 30 businessmen and bankers for economic 
crimes and a police raid on a company that publishes a book 
describing tax shelters 
several of the arrested businessmen have been held in jail for 
days without being charged and without a bail hearing some have 
been detained in cells containing people suspected of committing 
violent crimes 
the incidents critics say show that president fernando collor 
de mellos new economic measures have resulted in serious civil 
liberties violations 
we are heading for a dictatorship the arrests are a flagrant 
violation of rights consecrated in the constitution legal 
scholar gofredo de silva telles said in a television interview 
marcio tomaz bastos former president of the brazilian bar 
association told the associated press the new law is a 
violence if you kill someone you can respond to the charge at 
liberty but if you raise the price of a beer you can be jailed for 
months without trial 
collor announced his economic plan on march 16 one day after 
taking office as brazils first popularly elected president in 29 
years 
he passed the package using provisional measures which 
became law immediately but can be voted down by congress within 30 
days 
brazils supreme court is due to hear arguments on wednesday 
regarding the legality of the economic crime portion of the 
plan 
the measures designed to bring down record inflation that 
reached 2700 percent in the past year include a 30day price 
freeze a new national currency and a freeze on assets of more 
than the equivalent of 1200 from private savings accounts and 
600 from shortterm money market deposits 
the freeze withdrew an estimated 115 billion from circulation 
about 80 percent af all bank deposits 
also included was a controversial provisional measure that 
subjects managers and owners of companies that commit crimes 
against the popular economy to twotofouryear jail terms the 
law does not provide suspects with the right to apply for bail 
between the time they are arrested and tried 
in the 10 days since the plan was passed at least 30 
businessmen and bankers have been arrested and charged with 
violating the new law according to newspaper and television 
reports 
last week antonio gaspar manager of an eldorado supermarket 
was arrested in sao paulo brazils biggest city and charged with 
economic abuses the most serious being increasing the price of 
some fish by 500 percent 
on friday four members of the prominent verissimo family which 
owns the eldorado chain were arrested in connection with the case 
those charged were placed under house arrest and presumably will be 
tried later 
several bank managers in major cities have also been arrested 
and jeered by crowds as they were led away by police the managers 
were charged with denying clients the right to withdraw up to the 
legal maximum from their bank accounts 
public opinion polls show the economic plan has overwhelming 
public support one survey by the brazilian institute of public 
opinion and statistics the nations leading polling outfit found 
that 94 percent of the people supported jail time for economic 
crimes the company interviewed 2250 people in brazils eight 
largest cities no margin of error was provided 
several of the arrested businessmen have been held in jail for 
days some in cells containing people charged with violent crimes 
others accused of committing economic crimes have been freed on 
their own recognizance 
police raided the tama publishing house in rio on march 19 
seized copies of the book tax havens which describes various 
tax shelters and charged two of the companys officials with 
inciting tax evasion 
brazils 1988 constitution prohibits all censorship 
four days later the offices of folha da manha which publishes 
the prominent folha de sao paulo newspaper were raided by heavily 
armed federal police agents who arrested two company officers for 
allegedly postdating an invoice to avoid the currency freeze 
the newspaper has been critical of collor publishing a number 
of reports during last years presidential campaign that accused 
him of corruption during his 1987 to mid1989 term as governor of 
the northeastern state of alagoas 
the papers owner believes the police action was no coincidence 
not even during the dictatorship were we victims of violence 
like that folha de sao paulos owner octavio frias told the 
newsweekly veja referring to brazils 1964 to 1985 rightwing 
military regime 
rep renan calheiros congressional leader of collors national 
reconstructuion party also criticized the raid on folha de sao 
paulo however he denied it was an attempt to silence the 
newspaper 
he defended the law against economic crimes and the need for 
coercive measures so people dont undermine the economic plan 
but others see the raid on the newspaper as part of an ominous 
trend that is a natural consequence of the governments law against 
economic crimes 
as with the previous case of the tama officials i foresee the 
federal police with its new powers being transformed into an 
organ of repression said barbosa lima sobrinho head of the 
brazilian press association

only six other states are supporting 
minnesotas contention before the supreme court that control of 
national guard training missions is a states rights issue 
the justices are scheduled to hear oral arguments tuesday on a 
suit by minnesota gov rudy perpich challenging the 
constitutionality of a 1986 law enacted in reaction to opposition 
from some democratic governors to former president ronald reagans 
central american policies 
perpich contends the montgomery amendment named after rep gv 
sonny montgomery dmiss violates the militia clause of the 
constitution because it denies governors authority to control the 
peacetime training of national guard units 
the amendment specifically bars governors from withholding 
consent to a national guard unit serving on active duty outside the 
country because they dont like the location purpose or schedule 
of the mission 
it was enacted after several governors said they opposed the 
reagan administrations policies in central america and did not 
want national guard units from their states assigned to train in 
the region 
officials from 29 states including 19 governors have filed 
briefs with the court supporting the montgomery law the supreme 
court last year rejected hearing a similar challenge to it by 
massachusetts officials 
perpich a democrat has not viewed the question as a foreign 
policy matter but as one of states rights 
the montgomery amendment is an unnecessary federal power grab 
that violates an unambiguous command in the text of the united 
states constitution minnesota officials said in their brief to 
the court 
the plain meaning of the militia training clause cannot be 
more evident the authority of training the national guard is 
reserved to the states 
massachusetts and five other states iowa maine montana ohio 
and vermont have filed a brief supporting minnesotas contention 
represented by their attorneys general the states wrote the 
supreme court that the founding fathers intended for states to 
control the militia to prevent abuses by the federal government 
there is no doubt that state control over the militia was an 
integral part of the framers planned structure as a means of 
securing the blessings of liberty won in the war of independence 
according to those states 
however the governors of 19 states and attorneys general for 10 
more states contend in their own brief filed with the supreme court 
that perpich is seeking to arrogate to himself a role in foreign 
affairs 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled in june that the 
montgomery amendment is constitutional saying that the states 
power to organize militias cannot constrain congress authority 
to train the guard as it sees fit 
in minnesotas view justice department lawyers contend 
congress could require national guard units to fight overseas 
without the authority to train them properly 
american forces have fought in tropical climates nothing like 
minnesotas nearly every time theyve been sent into battle over 
the past 20 years rep bill frenzel rminn and 23 other members 
of congress said in a brief supporting the administrations 
position 
no longer are the militia if mobilized likely to fight in 
their own states defending their own territory the lawmakers 
said 
the national guard has been under dual state and federal control 
since congress made it a component of the army in 1933 enlistees 
enroll simultaneously in the state militia and a reserve unit of 
the us armed forces 
the army national guard now provides 46 percent of the armys 
combat units and 28 percent of its support forces and the air 
national guard now represents 73 percent of the nations 
interceptor forces 25 percent of its tactical fighters and 24 
percent of its tactical air support 
states whose governors signed the brief in opposition to 
perpichs suit are delaware florida georgia idaho illinois 
iowa kansas louisiana maryland mississippi nevada new mexico 
north carolina north dakota oklahoma south carolina texas west 
virginia and wisconsin 
the 23 states whose attorneys general signed the brief are 
alabama alaska delaware florida georgia idaho indiana 
kansas louisiana maryland mississippi missouri nevada new 
mexico north carolina oklahoma south carolina south dakota

former president richard m nixon says in a new 
book that he made the inexcusable error of asking the cia to 
block an fbi probe of the watergate breakin but that the cia 
declined 
nixon said a decision by then cia director richard helms and his 
deputy vernon walters to ignore the request discredits 
watergates most serious myth the one that ultimately forced me 
to resign that the cia in fact obstructed the fbi probe on his 
specific orders 
in addition nixon writes in in the arena his new book 
excerpted in the latest issue of time magazine he later 
emphatically told fbi director patrick gray to go forward with 
the investigation 
nixon said he made the request to the cia on the recommendations 
of staff members who had a personal stake in covering up the 
facts 
nonetheless in an interview with the magazine accompanying the 
book excerpts nixon said he expects historians to judge him more 
by watergate than by his diplomatic overtures to china 
historians are more likely to lead with he resigned the 
office nixon said in the interview the jury has already come 
in and theres nothing thats going to change it theres no 
appeal historians will judge it harshly 
in the book nixon writes that the most widely believed myth 
was that i ordered massive illegal wiretapping and surveillance of 
political opponents members of the house and senate and news 
media reporters all of these charges are false 
another misconception he writes was that he ordered the 
breakin at the democratic national committee not one piece of 
evidence was discovered indicating that i ordered the breakin 
knew about the plans for the wiretapping ore received any 
information from it he writes 
nixon also denies paying for any coverup 
it is clear that i considered paying the money he says 
referring to the famous taped conversation he had on march 21 1973 
with white house counsel john dean but nixon adds that he later 
ruled out payments 
nixon however does not directly address in the watergate 
section of the book a key aspect of the smoking gun tape in 
which he and white house chief of staff h r haldeman discussed 
the fbi investigation 
that tape recorded june 23 1972 six days after the watergate 
breakin contradicted nixons previous statements that he did not 
know of white house involvement in the watergate coverup until the 
march 1973 conversation with dean 
here was the smoking pistol the investigators had been 
looking for the direct undeniable evidence that from the very 
beginning nixon had been in on had approved had condoned and 
supported the attempt to bury the watergate mess us district 
judge john j sirica later wrote in his memoirs 
attempting to debunk what he calls the myths of watergate 
nixon writes that others in my campaign and in my administration 
attempted to cover up the connection between the burglary and his 
reelection campaign 
i failed to take matters firmly into my own hands and discover 
the facts and to fire any and all people involved or implicated in 
the breakin he says 
on a more personal note the expresident says that following 
his nearfatal attack of phlebitis shortly after his resignation in 
august 1974 i could see no reason to live no cause to fight 
for 
but he recovered physically spiritually and mentally he says 
because of strong support from his family and a circle of devoted 
friends and through writing his memoirs

hungarys foreign minister sunday 
criticized the state airline for suspending flights of soviet jews 
to israel after it received terrorist threats from proiranian 
extremists 
the state airline malev suspended flights wednesday and appealed 
to the soviet airline aeroflot to stop bringing jewish emigres to 
hungary the soviets announced friday they would comply 
both suspensions followed threats by the lebanesebased islamic 
jihad for the liberation of palestine against airlines that help 
fly soviet jews to israel 
hungarys foreign minister gyula horn said malevs decision to 
suspend the flights was made without prior consultation with the 
government 
he called the suspension a rush decision and added that 
bowing to threats could encourage terrorism 
malev chief executive officer lajos jahoda told the hungarian 
daily mai nap the decision was taken to protect passengers and 
malev employees 
we had to take the threats seriously because we consider 
safety a priority he was quoted as saying 
budapest was the main transit station for soviet jews 
immigrating to israel the soviet union does not have direct 
flights to israel and transit stations including vienna and 
bucharest are used 
israels highestranking official on east european affairs 
foreign ministry assistant directorgeneral yosef govrin flew to 
hungary sunday to ask hungary to reconsider its decision a foreign 
ministry official in jerusalem said 
israels foreign minister moshe arens was quoted by the 
hungarian state news agency mti saturday as saying israel hoped 
that hungary which has just become a democracy will not give an 
example for surrendering to terrorism 
the polish national airlines lot and israels el al airlines 
were expected to provide an alternatate route for immigrants by 
adding two weekly flights between warsaw and tel aviv a lot 
official in tel aviv said 
israeli officials claimed no knowledge of the move which was 
reported on the front pages of three major daily newspapers 
el al spokesman nachman kleinman denied special arrangements 
were made to increase flights but noted that lot and el al have a 
standing agreement to add flights as demand warrants 
arab nations have criticized the wave of immigration partly out 
of concern that some newcomers may settle in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
israel has banned publication of soviet immigration figures but 
before censorship was imposed the government said 16700 arrived 
between january 1989 and feb 1 1990 according to the new york 
times some 6000 are expected this month 
it is estimated that 200 soviet jewish immigrants have settled 
in the occupied territories 
almost 750000 soviet jews are expected to immigrate this decade 
following a relaxation in soviet restrictions and increased 
wariness about growing expressions of antisemitism in the soviet 
union

talks in libya between presidents hosni 
mubarak of egypt and hafez assad of syria sealed the end of a 
12year rift bringing diplomatic gains for both countries 
the history of relations between syria and egypt is a stormy 
one the two countries were joined for three years as the united 
arab republic with egypts gamal abdel nasser as head of state but 
the union broke down in 1961 
the onehour assadmubarak meeting took place late saturday 
during a ceremony at tobruk marking the 20th anniversary of the 
expulsion of british forces from libya 
it followed a resumption of diplomatic relations last december 
ties were broken a month after the late egyptian president anwar 
sadat flew to jerusalem in 1977 to begin the process that led to 
the camp david peace treaty two years later the only such pact 
between israel and an arab country 
in one sense its a defeat for syria said a western 
diplomat in damascus like other foreign observers he attributed 
the move largely to assads desire to escape from diplomatic 
isolation after egypt was readmitted to the arab league last may 
and other arab nations resumed diplomatic ties 
but the diplomat who like other sources in damascus insisted on 
anonymity said the move also presented opportunities for the 
59yearold syrian president to persuade fellow arab leaders to 
follow his firm line toward israel 
by meeting mubarak assad has shown once again that he is a 
master of maneuver in the arab world limiting his losses by 
joining the arab mainstream without abandoning his cherished 
hardline policies diplomats said 
for mubarak the reconciliation with assad is a big payoff for 
his cautious policy of acting as a gobetween he has been working 
with israel the united states and the palestinians on the one hand 
while trying to improve cairos relations with other arab nations 
on the other 
syria is the most implacable enemy of the jewish state and assad 
has vowed to continue building up his forces until he reaches 
strategic parity with israel so the arab world can negotiate 
from a position of strength 
but the soviet union preoccupied with internal affairs and 
economic problems has told syria the parity concept is no longer 
tenable and said damascus a major soviet client should purchase 
only the weapons it needs for defense 
syrian and soviet military leaders have agreed to the withdrawal 
from syria of an undisclosed number of soviet military instructors 
an informed syrian source said 
meanwhile ties between the soviet union and israel have slowly 
improved the two countries have set up modest representation in 
each others capitals and are exchanging lowlevel visits 
earlier this month assad expressed his dismay saying the 
changes sweeping eastern europe were a boon to israel as the 
formerly communist countries dropped their hostility to the jewish 
state 
syria also is at odds with palestine liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat and has rejected his peace initiative toward 
israel which is strongly backed by egypt and the united states 
there is no sign yet that assad is cutting support for 
damascusbased antiarafat radical palestinian factions which have 
been fostering relations with iran just in case 
but assad appears to want inclusion at least indirectly in the 
current process involving egypt the plo the united states and 
israel aimed at holding elections leading to some autonomy for 
palestinians in israelioccupied arab territories 
former president jimmy carter said after a meeting with assad 
earlier this month that syria is ready for bilateral talks with 
israel if they include the golan heights taken by israel from 
syria after the 1967 war 
egyptian officials in cairo said they expect better but still 
limited relations with syria in view of egypts close ties with 
iraq syrias archrival in the arab world 
a meeting between assad and mubarak after decembers resumption 
of diplomatic ties was originally expected to take place in syria 
there were several syrian reports of an imminent damascus meeting 
but mubarak never showed up perhaps unwilling to be seen as 
knocking on assads door perhaps fearing resentment by iraq 
diplomats in damascus said the egyptian president would like to 
act as a matchmaker between assad and iraqi president saddam 
hussein but given the deep hostility between two of the arab 
worlds most ruthless and ambitious leaders there were no signs 
that there will be an opportunity for reconciliation 
intensifying the feud between the iraqi and syrian wings of the 
arab baath socialist party ruling in both countries baghdad has 
supplied weapons to lebanons antisyrian christian leader gen 
michel aoun thwarting assads effort to impose a pax syriana on 
its wartorn neighbor 
syria was the only major arab country to side with persian iran 
in its war against arab iraq

geneva on sunday and got away with the equivalent of 26 million 
the haul was believed to be the largest in swiss history police 
said 
the robbers confronted two security guards at the personnel 
entrance around 8 am and forced them to turn over the keys of the 
main branch office of the union bank of switzerland police 
spokesman marcel vaudroz said 
the thieves then entered the branch and emptied various 
safedeposit boxes driving off with 400 pounds of banknotes of 
various currencies

said

injuries suffered when he was struck with a rifle butt

despite mikhail s gorbachevs show of 
force and barrage of demands lithuanians keep assuring themselves 
the soviet president will not use force to crush their independence 
because his reform program would die with it 
it would be the end of perestroika and gorbachevs policy and 
his authority said lithuanian premier kazimiera prunskiene i 
dont think gorbachev would take such a measure 
western diplomats and political figures agree 
it would undermine his policy in europe end perestroika and 
probably not even be successful said one highranking diplomat 
in moscow in an era of reform soviet soldiers might refuse to use 
force against lithuanians the diplomat said 
in the past week tanks and armored personnel carriers have 
rumbled through the lithuanian capital vilnius and gorbachev has 
issued a flurry of directives to lithuanians including a demand 
that they turn in all their firearms and stop signing up for 
volunteer service 
soviet media have painted the lithuanian government that 
declared independence march 11 as pushing the republic either 
toward anarchy or political repression in an interview printed 
sunday gen valentin i varennikov commander of soviet ground 
forces charged that independence leaders were preparing to jail 
communists 
but the streets of the lithuanian capital have been calm 
throughout the political tension and citizens interviewed on the 
streets have expressed few fears of pending military action 
gorbachev and his advisers have said they do not intend to use 
force in lithuania foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze a 
close adviser to gorbachev told reporters during his trip to 
africa last week that the soviet union is particularly against 
the use of force domestically 
but gorbachev has pledged to keep the soviet union together and 
he has been unable to bend the lithuanians with argument and 
political pressure his tough reaction to the declaration of 
independence has added caution to the lithuanians confidence that 
he wont use force 
the lithuanian government on thursday night appealed to the 
world to speak out against any possible use of force by soviet 
soldiers and early saturday passed a resolution transferring power 
to a longtime diplomat of independent lithuania in washington if 
the government is detained 
the soviet union is accustomed to solving its problems 
externally and internally with the use of force said algimantas 
cekuolis who until independence was declared served as a 
legislator in the soviet parliament 
lithuanian officials and western diplomats say gorbachev would 
risk wrecking his opening to the west including the nearly 
completed agreements on slashing nuclear weapons by 50 percent and 
the removal of hundreds of thousands of troops from front lines in 
central europe 
sen edward m kennedy arriving in moscow on sunday said use 
of force would put gorbachevs relationship with the united states 
at risk 
any resolution of the issue other than through discussions 
would have very significant and damaging implications for that 
relationship said kennedy dmass 
on thursday the us senate passed a resolution 930 urging the 
soviet union to stop intimidating lithuanians and warning that use 
of military force would have severe repercussions for ussoviet 
relatons 
if he uses force in the baltics he cant maintain his current 
worldwide standing prunskiene said and relations between the 
soviet union and other states could not remain the way they have 
been until now 
a violent reaction also likely would cut the flow of foreign 
investment so desperately needed by the soviet unions collapsing 
economy kremlin officials last week for the first time hinted that 
the economy is in such bad shape that it might need outright 
foreign aid similar to the marshall plan that helped germany 
recover after world war ii 
western credits were temporarily suspended to china after that 
country cracked down on prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen 
square foreign businessmen who had been increasingly disenchanted 
with china because of growing economic problems have been 
reluctant to return because of uncertainty about the countrys 
stability 
use of force also would cause a ferocious debate within the 
soviet union such as the assault by soldiers on peaceful 
demonstrators in the capital of the georgian republic tbilisi last 
april nineteen people were killed and one was shot later for 
violating curfew 
angry hardliners want some sort of crackdown on secessionists 
but reformers have thrown their support to lithuanias parliament 
the army also might not be totally reliable if gorbachev 
decided to use it in lithuania 
in january soviet mothers took to the streets to protest the 
mobilization of their sons to restore order in azerbaijan a 
caucasus mountain republic engaged in a bitter dispute with 
neighboring armenia soviet officials quickly backed down and ended 
the mobilization 
weighing the costs and benefits leaves lithuanians wondering 
why the war of nerves 
at worst they worry gorbachev is preparing the ground for armed 
intervention 
at the least he is forcing lithuania residents from the police 
to everyone owning a hunting gun to take sides publicly and at 
personal risk 
still there is hope the issue will be solved peacefully 
if gorbachev lets them go freely theyll be so grateful that 
they will put up his statue instead of lenins said bill hough 
an american expert on international law concerning annexation and 
is in vilnius advising the lithuanian government

two strong earthquakes rocked costa 
rica sunday damaging buildings causing landslides and sending 
panicstricken people into the streets no injuries were reported 
the quakes measuring 55 and 69 on the richter scale struck 
at 716 am 816 am est and 723 am according to waverly 
person an official at the us geological survey in golden colo 
the epicenter of the quakes was located in the pacific ocean 80 
miles southwest of san jose he said 
federico guendel of the vulcanological and seismological 
observatory in san jose said 60 aftershocks struck in the hour 
after the second quake 
people in san jose and other cities rushed out of homes and 
buildings as the structures rocked violently many terrified people 
huddled in the capitals streets and parks waiting for the earth 
to stop trembling 
plaster cornices and other adornments on older buildings 
crashed into the streets of san jose many windowpanes and shop 
windows also shattered 
a water boiler exploded at the hotel balmoral during the 
earthquakes and several of the buildings walls cracked walls also 
cracked at the la merced roman catholic church one of the 
capitals oldest buildings 
in alajuela a city 12 miles north of san jose the cupola of 
the local cathedral cracked in half during the second quake and 
long fissures appeared in the sides of many buildings 
the main highway linking san jose with the atlantic coast was 
blocked by several landslides and police ordered traffic halted 
until further notice 
a red cross news release reported considerable damage to 
buildings in the pacific coast port of puntarenas heavy structural 
damage also was reported in the nearby village of cobano no 
details were immediately available 
a spokesman for the red cross carlos gutierrez said a 
nationwide check by his organization police and the fire 
department turned up no casualties 
the quakes were the strongest in the nation since 1983 when a 
pair of temblors measuring 62 and 73 on the richter scale rattled 
southern costa rica causing widespread panic but no casualties 
another quake of 47 rocked san jose in february 1989 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph 
a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage while one 
measuring 6 can cause severe damage every increase of one number 
of the richter scale means that the ground motion is 10 times 
greater

the dead sea scrolls which include some of the 
earliest known biblical texts will be subjected to carbon14 
dating to discover whether they were written by a jewish group or 
early christians officials said sunday 
magen broshi custodian of the israel museums shrine of the 
book where some of the scrolls are on public display said at 
least 12 of the 799 scrolls will be dated using new carbon14 
techniques 
the dating would help settle arguments and conflicting theories 
about whether the scrolls were the product of a jewish group known 
as the essenes or a much later group of early christians said orna 
hess a spokeswoman for the antiquities authority 
most biblical scholars believe the scrolls date to the second 
century bc or late third century bc based on paleography or 
analysis of handwriting styles broshi said 
we relied on paleography we will now see if this method 
agrees with physics broshi said i dont believe there is any 
urgent need but this will keep people happy 
broshi said the testing would quiet critics like robert 
eisenman head of religious studies at california state university 
at long beach who do not accept the nonscientific dating 
in a telephone interview eisenman demanded that objective 
observers be allowed to witness the dating process and that more 
than one laboratory carry out the tests 
he said this was necessary because the scrolls are controlled by 
a team of scholars who have a vested interest in preserving their 
theories which are based on the established chronology 
in order to have a fair process one that would not be open to 
future questions people of differing shades of opinion should be 
brought into the process as observers eisenman said 
eisenman has backed the controversial theory that the 
unpublished scrolls may be the work of early christians his 
argument is based on the wording of the texts such as the use of 
certain phrases known to have been common among early christians 
and indirect references to the rule of king herod the great 
traditionally the scrolls are viewed as the work of a small 
mysterious sect known as the essenes scholars of this traditional 
school say they provide an insight into the life and religious 
thought of the ancient sect of jews as well as the roots of 
christianity 
ms hess said a small fragment had already been dated at 
israels weizmann institute of science she declined to discuss the 
results or give details as to how large a fragment was tested 
broshi said negotiations were under way with a european 
university with more advanced techniques to do the main body of 
work which was expected to start within the next few weeks 
neither broshi nor hess would say which university was involved 
none of the papyrus scrolls have been previously carbon dated 
because until a few years ago too much material had to be destroyed 
in the process broshi said 
the linen wrapping in which some scrolls were found was dated 
more than 30 years ago using primitive techniques it dated the 
cloth to 33 ad plus or minus 200 years 
scientists can date organic material on the basis of the amount 
of radioactive carbon14 remaining 
the new carbon14 technique called accelerator mass 
spectrometry requires only a small about of parchment for testing 
it was first employed to date a 27000yearold wooly mammouth 
found in siberia in 1977 
the first scrolls were found in caves at qumran overlooking the 
dead sea in 1947 and others were excavated over a 10year span 
from 11 caves some scrolls represent the earliest existing copies 
of books of the bible others contain poetry stories and legal 
texts

the united states has stepped up support 
for antimarxist angolan rebels and has shipped specially equipped 
fourwheeldrive vehicles that could give them an edge a us 
diplomatic source said 
the rebels in recent months have been facing one of the biggest 
offensives in the 15yearold civil war from the government backed 
by cuba and the soviet union 
three toyota landcruisers are being stripped daily here and 
outfitted with heavy machine guns they the rebels are going to 
use them for hitandrun attacks said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the vehicles are considered ideal for traveling on the sand and 
scrubcovered roads in southeastern angola the site of most of the 
fighting in the war 
the source said at least 120000 gallons of diesel fuel were 
also being shipped from kinshasa to jonas savimbis unita national 
union for the total independence of angola rebels 
the united states has pledged to support savimbi until angolan 
president jose eduardo dos santos agrees to national 
reconciliation shorthand for accepting negotations that will 
lead to powersharing with unita 
during last weeks tour of southern africa by secretary of state 
james a baker iii a senior official traveling with the secretary 
reaffirmed his government would not permit the angolan government 
to crush savimbis rebels 
the united states provides about 50 million annually in aid to 
the rebels and stepped up assistance after south africa agreed to 
cease unita support as part of a regional peace plan 
in washington white house spokesman bill harlow said he was 
unaware of any stepped up aid shipments to the angolan rebels 
during bakers visit to kinshasa on saturday one of at least 
two american c141 transport planes believed used to resupply unita 
had disappeared from sight both were on the tarmac sunday morning 
a week earlier a reporter passing through the airport counted 
four of the camouflaged planes bearing the us flag 
baker last week held talks with the angolan president and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze while in windhoek namibia 
for independence celebrations baker met savimbi on friday night 
and zaire president mobutu sese seko on saturday 
mobutu has been serving as a mediator for the warring parties in 
angola he brokered a ceasefire last june but it quickly fell 
apart he continues to allow the united states to supply the unita 
rebels through zaire 
officials traveling with baker said no major progress had been 
made because the angolan president continued to insist on terms 
that amounted to a surrender by savimbi whose forces had not been 
defeated on the battlefield 
baker has sought to enlist soviet support in efforts to 
negotiate an end to the angolan fighting and shevardnadze has 
indicated his government is ready to cooperate in peace efforts 
savimbi says the soviets have been pouring weapons into angola 
more than 1 billion worth in the last two years in a bid to 
shore up the angolan government forces before all cuban forces have 
withdrawn 
under a soviet and usbrokered agreement between south 
africa angola and cuba the 50000 cuban troops in angola are to 
be pulled out by mid1991 
south africa granted namibia independence march 21 as part of 
the arrangement and has withdrawn support for unita 
angolan government forces have pushed farther into rebel 
territory during an unprecedented rainyseason offensive than ever 
before in the war for the past several weeks there has been heavy 
fighting near the strategic southeastern town of mavinga 
fourwheel drive vehicles could give unita an edge once the rain 
stops in the next month or so

theyre few in number and their skyisland 
habitat has long lain undisturbed but 180 tiny mount graham red 
squirrels could prove a big obstacle to construction of the worlds 
most powerful optical telescope 
the university of arizona wants nothing more than to coexist 
with the mountaintop rodents an endangered subspecies but the 
builder of a 200 million observatory atop 10709foot mount graham 
is having to tread carefully 
the 8ounce squirrel or tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis 
has touched off a twoyear ecological controversy that has split 
the scientific community pitted one federal agency against 
another and drawn environmentalists into a battle against 
telescope proponents from as far away as the vatican 
us district judge alfredo c marquez will hear closing 
arguments monday afternoon on whether a third federal biological 
study is needed before construction begins this year on two smaller 
telescopes 
if all goes smoothly the columbus project a 600inchdiameter 
device expected to be six times more powerful than any telescope in 
use will be built in the mid1990s on the 86acre tract in the 
pinaleno mountains 110 miles northeast of tucson 
just 180 of the squirrels which have been traced back 10000 
years or more are believed to remain and mount graham is their 
only known habitat 
opposition groups say perching the telescopes on emerald peak 
one of mount grahams three peaks can only assure that the 
squirrels become a biological footnote 
its biologically indefensible to develop on that mountain 
said dr robin silver spokesman for the maricopa audubon society 
we will win this case the question is will we win it before the 
university wreaks too much destruction on the mountain 
the university argued its vice president for research michael 
cusanovich is the most likely participant to provide the basis 
for the mount graham red squirrels recovery it spent more than 
200000 last year on research and monitoring and will put aside 
more than 100000 annually for several years he said 
a twomile access road for the mount graham international 
observatory has already been built but opponents have so far held 
up construction of the observatory buildings 
the squirrels apparently have some militant supporters one 
mailed an anonymous death threat to telescope proponent conrad 
istock head of the university of arizonas ecology and 
evolutionary biology department 
eleven of the departments 28 faculty members and 41 of 58 
graduate students have voiced opposition to the observatory but 
students at the 38000student university later voted down by 57 
percent to 43 percent a nonbinding initiative opposing the 
observatory fewer than 5000 students voted 
in july 1988 the us fish and wildlife service concluded in a 
biological report for the us forest service the sites landlord 
that the telescopes could coexist with the squirrel 
arizonas congressional delegation then pushed through 
legislation ordering the forest service to grant the university a 
specialuse permit allowing construction 
but an environmental coalition intervened with a lawsuit 
naturalists have staged demonstrations outside the vatican embassy 
and the smithsonian institution in washington 
the university says it will advertise soon for construction bids 
for the two smaller telescopes one of which is partly financed by 
the vatican observatory pope john paul ii is among the vaticans 
astronomy buffs 
two biologists who took part in the fish and wildlife service 
study alleged in depositions that officials at the agency ordered 
researchers to argue in favor of construction 
the agencys regional director mike spear upheld the study as 
biologically sound but last month after the construction 
site was designated as a critical habitat spear called for a 
review study 
however the forest service says the congressional act 
authorizes the first three telescopes and exempts them from further 
review 
spear said the endangered species act makes clear there should 
be reconsultation before change in the habitat while forest 
service regional chief dave jolly said congress intentionally 
skirted the act 
university officials contend that poor cone crops in recent 
years have hurt the squirrel population that hunting logging use 
of offroad vehicles and christmas treecutting have been stopped 
because of the planned observatory and that 60 to 80 acres will be 
reforested 
silver who is a wildlife photographer likened the squirrels 
predicament to that of the snail darter a 3inch fish that delayed 
the tennessee river dam project for six years during the 1970s 
before it was transplanted to the hiwassee river 
theyre very similar in that the developmental groups managed 
to ignore ecosystem destruction and focused the issue on one 
creature that was easily demeaned in their project silver said 
the dam was completed with congress first amending the 
endangered species act in 1978 to allow an exemption from the law 
then exempting the dam from any law that would hinder its 
construction he said 
dan campbell director of the nature conservancy in arizona 
says mount graham has arizonas greatest density of black bears 
and is the farthest south that elk can be found in the united 
states 
its the general habitat which we really need to protect and 
conserve in order to protect the species he said its like a 
lifeboat if you keep the lifeboat from sinking then the species 
stay there

television viewers got the latest sunday about 
the affair that is scandalizing israel the case of the israeli 
army captain suspended from his job over alleged trysting with a 
palestinian woman 
the wronged wife in whats being called the love and the 
intefadeh affair appeared as a blackedout figure on the evening 
tv news to support her husbands story that he was really trying to 
recruit the darkhaired arab woman as an informer 
the story of capt avi marak and 20yearold abir mattar has hit 
newspaper front pages this weekend largely because with the wall of 
hatred that has grown between jews and arabs in the intefadeh or 
uprising such a romance seems unthinkable 
a military source sunday confirmed that marak who was a company 
commander for israels military government in the occupied west 
bank is being investigated on suspicion of inappropriate 
behavior 
according to israeli newspapers marak held nightly secret 
rendezvous with the young woman from the christian village of beit 
jallah near bethlehem for between four and eight months 
they usually spent their time together in military jeeps or 
pickup trucks the reports said 
the trysts ended after maraks wife ricky found out the 
maariv daily said early one morning mrs marak went to the home 
of the palestinian woman who also is married and the two got into 
a scuffle according to news reports the captain then hauled his 
wife off in a jeep the reports said 
but the shadowy figure on the evening news backed her husbands 
story that he was recruiting an informer to act against 
palestinians involved in the 27monthold uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
after saying some unpleasant things about mrs mattars 
reputation mrs marak added this is a relation based on 
military security 
she said her husband never told me anything because he doesnt 
let me in on military affairs 
marak who is still being questioned after removal from his post 
earlier this month told maariv that he had been seeking an 
informer other newspapers noted mrs mattars family had a 
reputation of assisting israeli authorities 
mrs mattar was quoted as saying she wants to divorce her 
husband who is in jail for attempted murder and marry marak 
we are happy together she told the yediot ahronot daily 
when avi divorces his wife i will also get a divorce and convert 
to marry him 
mrs marak told newspapers she hopes to keep her marriage 
intact on television she said she saw her husbands story as 
material for a television script she has been writing as a hobby 
i am putting this all in the script she said

an office of the hungarian state 
airline was set on fire sunday in romanias capital and protesters 
rallied nationwide in anger over purported secessionist plans by 
ethnic hungarians in transylvania 
no injuries were reported in the fire and damage was minor 
a police officer blamed hooligans but antihungarian slogans 
had been painted on the malev airline offices facade in the last 
week as ethnic tension mounted 
several hours later hungary demanded romania take steps against 
terrorist acts and protect hungarian citizens and offices in 
this country hungarys mti news agency said 
despite romanian government appeals for calm antihungarian 
sentiments burst into the open sunday at rallies by several hundred 
people in bucharest the romanian capital smaller protests were 
reported in other romania towns 
romanians fear that a campaign by transylvanias 2 million 
ethnic hungarians for education in their own language is a veiled 
push for autonomy or even union with hungary which ruled the 
disputed region for centuries 
transylvania was given to romania in 1920 in the aftermath of 
world war i it was briefly ceded again to hungary during world war 
ii 
the postrevolutionary government has ruled out any possibility 
of secession for the region 
authorities at the scene of sundays fire at the airline office 
provided few details a paramilitary police officer standing guard 
over burned debris outside told reporters that unidentified 
hooligans set fire to the office about 3 am the officer declined 
to give his name 
in the transylvanian town of tirgu mures where at least seven 
people were killed last week and about 300 injured in ethnic 
strife romanian churchgoers prayed for peace outside the citys 
orthodox cathedral sunday 
in bucharest about 700 people chanting tirgu mures is 
romania and barbarians behind bars circled the headquarters 
of the interim romanian government on victory square troops and 
paramilitary police armed with automatic rifles and batons guarded 
the government building 
critics say the government which took control after the 
december revolution ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
has not done enough to control the ethnic unrest 
with the end of ceausescus hardline regime both romanians and 
ethnic hungarians have more freedom to express themselves and the 
new atmosphere has led to clashes 
ceausescu hated us but at least we were not afraid to walk in 
the streets said a hungarian writer in tirgu mures declining to 
give his name

more than 100 of this areas trademark palm 
trees have caught fire over the last five months and investigators 
suspect an arsonist possibly working with a driver is to blame 
officials said 
some of the fires have spread to nearby houses or cars doing 
minor damage said fire battalion chief william burmester 
burmester said he was worried the consequences of future blazes 
could be more serious there is always a danger even with a guy 
like this who is not setting large fires he said 
most of the 104 fires since october have occurred in early 
evening in the adjoining suburbs of reseda canoga park and 
northridge about 20 miles north of downtown los angeles on several 
occasions trash rather than trees was set on fire 
the outbreak represents the largest number of apparently related 
arsons in memory arson investigators said no motive has emerged 
on jan 23 a 16yearold reseda boy with emotional problems was 
arrested after admitting he set fire to palm trees and trash in 
copycat arsons 
arson investigator glen lucero said there may be other copycats 
at work but suspected that most of the fires were set by one 
person or perhaps two people working together 
the fires are set so quickly lucero said it could be one 
guy lighting them and somebody else doing the driving 
it is almost completely random as far as the locations go 
said fellow investigator bill cass recently hes been more 
interested in trees than trash we dont know what that means

nelson mandela on sunday urged 
black students to return to class and call off antiapartheid 
boycotts that have disrupted schools for the past several years 
without education you can forget about liberation mandela 
told an estimated 30000 blacks in the northern town of pietersburg 
the statement appeared directed at young militant blacks who 
have led the school boycotts under the slogan liberation before 
education 
the tactic of the boycott cannot hope to win our battles in 
the educational arena said mandela who is deputy president of 
the african national congress the nations leading antiapartheid 
group our stayaways and boycotts are giving the education 
departments one long holiday 
since the mid1980s black students have staged frequent and 
prolonged boycotts to protest the inferior education system for 
blacks and to press other grievances in some parts of the country 
blacks students have attended classes only a few days this year 
black teachers also have been on strike in some areas 
the boycotts have coincided with declining test scores by black 
students last year only 42 percent of blacks passed their 
matriculation examination following their final year of high 
school it was the poorest showing in years 
mandela a lawyer has repeatedly stressed the importance of 
education in recent speeches he also has criticized the conditions 
of black schools most of which are understaffed and lack proper 
materials 
on sunday mandela also called on blacks to unite saying 
factional violence was diverting attention from the struggle 
against apartheid south africas system of racial segregation 
apartheid has deeply wounded our society making us enemies of 
each other he said 
more than 300 blacks have been killed mostly in factional 
violence since mandela was released from prison feb 11 after 
serving 27 years for launching the ancs sabotage campaign 
president fw de klerk legalized the anc and other 
antiapartheid groups last month as part of his white governments 
program to create a political role for the countrys black majority 
elsewhere sunday the zulu homelands leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi said he planned to meet soon with mandela an old friend 
and now a political rival 
supporters of mandelas anc and buthelezis inkatha movement 
have been battling since 1986 for political supremacy in the 
southeastern province of natal leaving more than 3000 blacks dead 
it is violence against democracy and against the black 
struggle for liberation buthelezi told several thousand people 
at a stadium in the port city of durban 
buthelezi gave no date for the meeting with mandela but he said 
it could be as soon as this week

a key afghan rebel commander who was 
also known as leader of a drug empire in southern afghanistan was 
killed sunday in an ambush outside this border city western 
diplomats said 
nazim akhundzada and his six heavily armed bodyguards were 
gunned down outside a guerrilla compound 10 miles east of peshawar 
diplomats said on condition of anonymity 
no one claimed responsibility for the killings and the 
diplomats said they had few details 
akhundzadas drug operation took in most of afghanistans 
southern province of helmand afghan and diplomatic sources said 
afghanistans marxist government regularly accuses the rebels of 
financing their insurgency with largescale poppy production the 
guerrillas and pakistan have made similar charges against the 
sovietbacked kabul government 
late last year akhundzada reportedly asked the united states 
for 2 million a month to stop growing poppies which can be used 
to make opium and heroin us embassy officials in islamabad 
denied he was given any money 
it just wasnt true said a us diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity he was told that because he was growing 
poppies we couldnt deal with him at all 
afghan rebels have been fighting for almost 12 years to oust 
successive communist governments in kabul afghanistans capital 
the insurgents are supported by the united states pakistan and 
several arab states including saudi arabia 
the protracted war has been blamed for increased poppy 
production particularly in the lawless border frontier between 
pakistan and afghanistan 
afghan and western sources said akhundzada had many enemies 
it got to be a long list very quickly one diplomat said 
the commander had a longstanding feud with a rival rebel group 
hezbiislami led by the firebrand fundamentalist gulbuddin 
hekmatyar 
he threw almost all hezb people out of helmand province 
said one afghan guerrilla leader who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
akhundzada belonged to harakatiinqilabiislami or the 
islamic revolutionary movement it is one of the seven major rebel 
groups with headquarters in peshawar 
he was one of harakats strongest and most powerful 
commanders said hamid karzai a rebel spokesman 
last year akhundzada waged a bloody drug war in helmand 
province against a rival commander of rasul sayyafs fundamentalist 
ittihadiislami or islamic unity guerrilla party 
akhundzadas death came five days after one of sayyafs field 
commanders painda mohammad was killed outside peshawar said

soviet military commanders sunday sent 
soldiers with automatic weapons to occupy two communist party 
schools in lithuania but later agreed to discuss building security 
with the breakaway republic 
it was the latest escalation in the war of nerves between the 
kremlin and the leadership of this baltic republic which declared 
itself independent march 11 
the commander of all soviet ground forces gen valentin i 
varennikov accused independence leaders of plotting to arrest 
communists and send them to prison 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said he talked twice 
on the telephone with varennikov whose presence in vilnius was a 
sign of moscows concern with the situation in the small baltic 
republic the general reportedly said no more buildings would be 
taken overnight but made no promises beyond that 
the soldiers occupied lithuanias institute of marxismleninism 
and the higher party school 
the republics deputy premier romualdas ozolas said earlier he 
feared soviet forces might storm lithuanias legislative 
headquarters 
landsbergis asked for a meeting to receive an explanation about 
the building seizures and varennikov sent four officers to the 
lithuanian parliament building 
in a brief news conference afterward landsbergis quoted the 
officers as telling him the buildings had been seized at the 
request of communist party members who remain loyal to moscow 
we expressed surprise and astonishment that the military can 
occupy buildings at the request of a political organization and we 
asked if such requests come from other organizations whether they 
will fulfill them landsbergis said we did not receive a 
concrete answer 
although varennikov made no promises not to seize more buildings 
monday landsbergis said the two sides agreed to form a joint 
committee on control of such buildings more meetings on the issue 
were set for monday morning he said 
franciskas benucius a director of the higher party school said 
30 soldiers who arrived there told him they were sent to guard the 
building 
i asked what are you protecting it from and they didnt 
know he said 
the school is used by both the lithuanian communist party that 
has broken with moscow and the smaller group that remains loyal 
officials expected the school to open monday despite the soldiers 
presence 
despite the increasing tension there was no sign sunday that 
the soviet army was trying to round up hundreds of lithuanians who 
deserted a deadline of saturday had been set for their return 
for days as president mikhail s gorbachev and other moscow 
officials have squeezed the defiant baltic state official media 
reports have criticized a draft bill in lithuanias new parliament 
that they say could mean imprisonment for those who speak out 
against independence 
varennikov said workers he met with at a vilnius electronics 
factory were convinced that sajudis is trying to create in the 
republic a real dictatorship 
sajudis is the grassroots political movement that has pressed 
for lithuanian independence from the soviet union its candidates 
won an absolute majority in the parliament that declared 
independence and election commission officials said sunday it also 
won a sizeable majority in voting saturday for the vilnius city 
council 
but varennikov charged sajudis headed by landsbergis is 
conducting an open psychological war against dissidents 
in conditions of this democracy many people are 
frightened he said in an interview printed sunday by the 
newspaper sovietskaya rossiya the official newspaper of 
lithuanias giant neighbor the russian republic 
and when a law is adopted prohibiting criticism of the 
government you can expect arrests varennikov said 
asked by the paper whether he meant communists who remained 
loyal to moscow could be arrested he replied 
all communists i think they already have divided the party 
now it remains to send communists to prison camps or jails 
the lithuanian government has vowed to establish a fully 
democratic multiparty political system that respects all 
internationally recognized human rights 
but it says that as lithuania establishes its own law residents 
of the republic will be expected to obey it rather than soviet law 
lithuanian leaders accuse gorbachev of conducting his own 
psychological war against them through the media and with a series 
of demands and military maneuvers including a convoy of about 100 
army vehicles that roared through downtown vilnius early saturday 
gorbachev and his advisers have pledged not to use force but 
the soviet leader has ordered lithuanians to surrender all firearms 
and told them not to sign up for volunteer units under the 
republics government 
at least 28 lithuanian deserters were in a refuge organized by 
the lithuanian government at the new vilnius psychiatric hospital 
dormitory as sunday dawned 
we expect that nobody would dare to attack the red cross 
said one of them 20yearold darius baceulis 
and if troops do come after them 19yearold arunas vazinskas 
said life would still be better in prison than in the army 
many baltic draftees have complained of brutality and harassment 
by fellow soldiers and officers especially since their republics 
strengthened their drive for independence 
landsbergis on saturday suggested that the soldiers seek 
protection in churches a traditional haven for people seeking to 
avoid arrest but no soldiers appeared to have taken his advice 
many preferred to stay with friends 
a roman catholic priest preaching at the main cathedral in 
vilnius on sunday urged believers to remain calm 
our big enemy would like to make us lose our patience in order 
to use force he said i beg you to be calm be patient

two strategies that boost the immune 
system to battle the most dangerous form of skin cancer show 
promise in early tests with patients a researcher said sunday 
twentythree percent of patients showed evidence of some 
remission of melanoma after injections in one of the experimental 
treatments primed their bodies to attack certain proteins found on 
melanoma cells said malcolm mitchell 
the injections are called theraccines short for therapeutic 
vaccines because they seek to treat cancer rather than prevent 
disease he said 
mitchell a professor of medicine and microbiology at the 
university of southern california school of medicine in los 
angeles described the work at a science writers seminar sponsored 
by the american cancer society 
about 27600 new cases of melanoma are expected this year with 
6300 deaths the society says intense exposure to the sun is a 
chief cause 
mitchells experimental injections make the immune system seek 
out proteins called antigens on cancerous cells the preparations 
are made from melanoma cells grown in the laboratory 
injections were done under the skin once a week for four weeks 
with a final injection on week six patients who responded were 
treated with a single monthly booster and semiannual courses of 
five more doses 
in 79 melanoma patients the treatment produced a complete 
remission in 5 percent and a partial remission in 18 percent 
mitchell said another 10 percent showed minor responses defined 
as tumor shrinkage of 26 percent to 50 percent 
no major side effects were observed he said 
other researchers have reported similar work clearly this is 
an attraactive approach said john laszlo the cancer societys 
senior vice president for research 
mitchell also reported on results from treating melanoma 
patients with low doses of interleukin2 a natural substance used 
by the immune system and a standard cancer drug called 
cyclophosphamide both drugs were given at about onethird the dose 
used in experiments or therapy 
in 39 patients the combination produced a 28 percent response 
rate including two complete remissions and eight partial 
remissions mitchell said 
potentially this treatment could be done by any hospital and 
its results are comparable to a more complex treatment in which 
interleukin2 is combined outside the body with white blood cells 
and then reinjected into the patient mitchell said 
in what he called the down note of his talk mitchell said 
some other forms of therapy will have to be found to deal with the 
spread of melanoma cells to the brain where they can form new 
cancers 
in a separate presentation a researcher said a study of 200 
people with or without melanoma suggests that six factors define 
people at high risk for getting the disease 
they are blond or red hair marked freckling of the upper back 
the presence of rough red bumps called actinic keratoses caused by 
to sun exposure a history of melanoma in other family members 
having had three or more blistering sunburns during ones teenage 
years and having spent three or more years at an outdoor summer 
job as a teenager 
having any one or two of these factors gives a person a three to 
four times increased chance of developing melanoma said darrell 
rigel of the new york university school of medicine 
people with three or more of the factors run an increased risk 
of 20 to 25 times he said 
people at high risk should be taught the ways to detect melanoma 
early when it is at a highly curable stage he said

hundreds of dangerous and illegal social clubs 
thrive in new york despite efforts to close them because people in 
poor neighborhoods have few alternatives for entertainment 
officials say 
people are literally taking their lives in their hands at 
these clubs bronx borough president fernando ferrer said after a 
fire sunday killed 87 people at the happy land social club 
it was the citys deadliest blaze since 145 people were killed 
in a fire at a garment factory the triangle shirtwaist co of 
manhattan 79 years ago to the day 
authorities said most of the predawn revelers were trapped on a 
secondstory dance floor and died from smoke inhalation the 
building lacked proper exits and other safeguards 
the 4yearold club which didnt have a liquor or cabaret 
license was shut down for the second time nov 1 1989 by the 
city buildings department but reopened illegally mayor david 
dinkins said 
despite periodic campaigns to close them social clubs have been 
centers of urban problems ranging from noise and doubleparking to 
gambling drug dealing and prostitution 
mayor david dinkins estimated there are at least 700 social 
clubs in the city 
they often are rife with building health and fire code 
violations that can lead to tragedy six people died in a 1988 fire 
at a bronx club five in a brooklyn club fire in 1985 and 25 
people were killed in another bronx fire in 1976 
i dont know what its going to take an army to stop them 
from going to places like this said newly elected us rep jose 
serrano after visiting the scene sunday 
city records reviewed sunday showed 173 social clubs had been 
given orders to vacate dinkins said at an afternoon news 
conference 
tonight we will commence to check those places see that 
theyre in fact closed he said well see to it that they 
certainly arent open come the next weekend 
just about anyone can go to a social club despite the terms 
implication of exclusivity an employee usually keeps an eye on the 
door but a club member is generally anyone who walks in on a given 
night 
they range from a group of elderly men who get together to 
play cards and watch a ballgame on a sunday afternoon to 
fullfledged nightclub operations said richard chernela a state 
liquor authority spokesman 
new york state liquor licenses cost up to 5100 and are good 
for three years but many club operators dont apply for one 
sometimes because they or potential employees may have criminal 
records that would disqualify them 
while the citys licensed bars are required to close by 4 am 
social clubs often stay open until dawn or later usually to the 
distress of nearby residents neighborhood residents said happy 
land stayed open until 6 am 
often theres a cover charge 5 at happy land often the clubs 
sell drinks 
many who go to the clubs are looking for a place to socialize 
that they can afford and where they feel welcome but they also 
attract a criminal element 
a state task force reported several years ago that alcohol 
consumption is often of secondary importance 
the primary function of these operations has developed into 
prostitution gambling drugs and trafficking in stolen property 
it said 
just sunday morning a police task force in brooklyn raided 
several social clubs and arrested five people for weapons 
possession said sgt tina mohrmann a police spokeswoman 
some clubs are closed under the citys padlock law which 
allows police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are 
committed on the site within a 12month period 
but the owners if they can be found are rarely convicted 
defendants arrested in police raids often end up pleading guilty to 
a lesser charge which then doesnt qualify as a criminal 
conviction under the padlock law 
even when the clubs are shuttered the owners often open up 
again around the corner or down the street attracting the same 
crowd 
thenmayor edward koch put together an interagency task force 
after the 1988 fire sparked a public outcry about the dangers of 
social clubs 
the ironic thing is that all the legislation is on the 
books said clint roswell a spokesman for ferrer its just 
an enforcement problem

investigator with the west columbia police department theyre so 
poor theyre willing to take an aspirin and put up with the pain 
five people were arrested in the case police said sunday

republican gubernatorial nominee clayton williams 
said sunday his offthecuff remark suggesting victims of rape 
should relax and enjoy it was insensitive after initially 
downplaying it as just a joke 
womens groups and the millionaire ranchers political foes 
reacted with outrage state treasurer ann richards who is in the 
april 10 runoff for the democratic nomination said sunday that 
williams seemed not to realize that rape is a crime of violence 
while preparing for a cattle roundup at his west texas ranch 
saturday williams compared the cold foggy weather spoiling the 
event to a rape 
if its inevitable just relax and enjoy it williams said 
to ranch hands campaign workers and reporters sitting around a 
campfire 
on sunday his campaign issued a statement in which he said i 
feel just terrible about this i had no intention in my heart to 
hurt anyone especially those women who have traumatized by rape 
looking back i realize it was insensitive and had no place at 
the campfire or in any setting the statement said 
williams who is making his first run for public office 
initially downplayed the remark on saturday he said it was a joke 
and he apologized if anyones offended 
pressed further for an explanation for the remark williams 
said thats not a republican womens club that we were having 
this morning its a working cow camp a tough world where you can 
get kicked in the testicles if youre not careful 
asked if some people might be offended williams said im not 
going to give you a serious answer it wasnt a serious deal it 
wasnt a serious statement 
marilyn rickman head of the texas womens political caucus 
which has endorsed ms richards for governor said saturday that 
williams remark was inexcusable 
rape is never a joke with women under any circumstance 
she said i dont think i know any woman who would say hey sit 
back and enjoy it 
he needs a brain transplant reacted joyce gersh chairman 
of the houstonarea national organization for women which also has 
endorsed ms richards 
anyone who is not sexist would not have come up with that 
remark she said 
williams wife modesta and several republicans defended him 
if the word rape was in a joke if sex was in a joke it was 
just a joke she said hes about as much of a gentleman a 
caring person as there is 
its an old joke which weve heard a million times said 
state republican executive committee member virginia steenson he 
certainly couldnt have meant that seriously 
williams won the march 13 gop primary over three major 
challengers spending more than 6 million of his oil ranching and 
business fortune on the campaign he has said he owns no shoes 
only cowboy boots and his campaign tv commercials often featured 
him wearing a cowboy hat 
williams will face either ms richards or attorney general jim 
mattox in the november general election the two democrats meet in 
a runoff april 10 because unlike williams neither one gained a 
simple majority in their partys primary 
ms richards said the remark questions his ability to 
understand the kinds of problems faced by the people of texas rape 
is a crime of violence 
just because youre in the barnyard doesnt mean you have to 
act like clayton williams does mattox said i just think that 
women voters are going to remember his attitude about this

fire raced through an illegal social club early 
sunday and turned a packed dance floor into a deathtrap of smoke 
and flame that killed 87 a man who allegedly had earlier fought 
with a club worker was charged with arson and murder 
the fire the nations worst in 13 years tore through the happy 
land club which authorities said lacked proper exits and other 
safeguards 
the 340 am fire killed 61 men and 26 women most of them 
honduran and dominican immigrants most were found on the second 
floor 
people literally were stacked on top of each other said 
anthony de vita the fire departments command chief it was a 
firetrap he said of the twostory building in an impoverished 
neighborhood near the bronx zoo 
some of the victims broke a hole through a wall to an adjoining 
hall in a desperate attempt to save their lives said red cross 
worker margaret glugover 
julio gonzalez 36 was charged with arson and murder in the 
case said lt raymond odonnell a police spokesman the district 
attorneys office later would determine how many counts gonzalez 
would be charged 
we believe the motive in this case was the result of a dispute 
he had with a female employee of the club police commissioner 
lee brown said at a city hall news conference sunday evening 
gonzalez emigrated in 1980 from cuba during the mariel boatlift 
that brought 125000 cubans to the united states 
police said gonzalez went into the club about 3 am and began 
arguing with his former girlfriend who sold tickets near the 
entrance 
hes trying to talk her into making up shes saying leave me 
alone odonnell said 
a club bouncer evicted the man half an hour later and police 
alleged he returned and started the fire near the entrance 
the woman employee left before the fire brown said 
at least two women and one man believed to be the clubs disc 
jockey escaped the man was seriously burned the condition of the 
women was unknown 
most of the dead were believed to have suffocated from the thick 
smoke which billowed hundreds of feet but some were trampled 
said lynn schulman an emergency medical service spokeswoman 
this is the worst thing i have seen in my career said 
emergency medical services specialist christopher mccarthy it 
hurt my stomach it was sickening 
most of the bodies were in dance clothes mccarthy said 
they were out to have fun i saw walltowall bodies an 
indication of mass confusion and panic 
the fire was the deadliest in the continental united states 
since a may 28 1977 blaze at the beverly hills supper club in 
southgate ky that killed 164 people a dec 31 1986 fire at a 
hotel in san juan puerto rico a us commonwealth killed 96 
people 
the tragedy occurred in east tremont a section of the bronx 
borough deputy mayor bill lynch described it as an economically 
disadvantaged workingclass latino neighborhood 
the building housed a group that organized childrens baseball 
as well as adult social events said lillian rivera a neighbor 
a makeshift morgue was set up at a hall next door authorities 
took polaroid pictures of the bodies and showed them to 200 friends 
and relatives at a school across the street where the cries and 
wails of relatives could be heard outside then the bodies were 
moved to a hospital morgue 
after viewing the bodies mayor david dinkins called the scene 
graphic and sad 
dinkins said a vacate order was issued in november 1988 because 
the club lacked a proper sprinkler system exits emergency 
lighting and signs 
city records show the club was again ordered closed on nov 1 
1989 by the buildings department dinkins said 
i dont know what subsequent visits were made there the 
mayor said 
the club had no liquor or cabaret license 
two neighborhood residents said three gunshots were heard just 
before the fire robert ungar deputy fire commissioner said he 
could not confirm another report that cans of accelerant were found 
socalled social clubs proliferate in new york citys poor 
neighborhoods and despite their name many of them admit virtually 
anyone who wants to enter functioning essentially as unlicensed 
taverns or dance clubs 
new york police officials have estimated that alcohol is sold 
without a license at more than 200 locations 
authorities said the victims tried to escape the windowless club 
down a stairway just wide enough for one person a second stairway 
apparently wasnt used perhaps because it couldnt be reached from 
the club 
sixtynine of the victims died upstairs where the dance floor 
was located 
people were screaming they were all burned said rosemary 
green who found the club on fire when she arrived to meet her 
sisterinlaw and cousin once you got in the entrance there was 
no way to get out 
denise garcia 20 a filing clerk who lives in the neighborhood 
said she and her friends avoided the club because they considered 
it too sleazy the building was rickety and the dance floor 
sometimes trembled she said 
ms garcia said the clubs patrons included many illegal 
immigrants 
the tragedy occurred on the 79th anniversary of the triangle 
shirtwaist co fire in manhattan which killed 145 people most of 
them immigrant garment workers and led to reforms governing 
workplace safety 
ems lt roy david said he got to the scene just as the male 
survivor was staggering out 
he walked toward me he couldnt talk he couldnt say 
anything all we could do was treat him david said 
five firefighters including a battalion chief who broke his 
leg were taken to jacobi after inhaling smoke six other 
firefighters were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation

here she said as she dabbed her eyes now i dont know

efforts to form the countrys first 
democratic government faltered sunday because of mounting charges 
of past ties between political leaders and the hated secret police 
social democratic party leader ibrahim boehme the latest 
politician to come under suspicion of having collaborated with the 
secret police called for all coalition talks to be suspended until 
the allegations are investigated 
in its latest issue the west german newsmagazine der spiegel 
said two former agents of the police known as stasi had denounced 
boehme as a regular secret collaborator 
boehme forcefully denied the charge in a letter to members of 
the leftleaning party 
lothar de maiziere leader of the conservative christian 
democratic union that won the nations first free parliamentary 
elections on march 18 is also trying to counter reports he too 
was a stasi informer 
the west german newspaper cologne express has said de maiziere 
had the code name scerny in the files of the secret police who 
for years enforced the repressive tactics of the hardline 
communist regime 
de maiziere the frontrunner to head the new government has 
denied informing for the police 
an official in charge of dismantling the stasi has said many 
newly elected lawmakers may have been informers 
east germanys chief prosecutor has ruled out an inquiry before 
the new parliament is actually seated 
on sunday however boehme said talks on a government coalition 
between the social democrats and the christian democrats should not 
be held until after an investigation he said the delay would serve 
the national interest 
the social democrats came in second in the elections 
the west german government is urging the two parties to form a 
coalition that would ensure the parliamentary majority in east 
germany needed to speed unification 
bonn has said it expects the new 400member east german 
parliament to be seated early next month and to name a premier and 
cabinet soon afterward 
preparations for a currency union between the german states are 
proceeding quickly and the merger will take effect july 1 the west 
german welt am sonntag newspaper reported sunday 
the monetary union a major step toward full germany unity 
would replace east germanys noncovertible currency with west 
germanys powerful mark 
the newspaper also published a timetable under which east 
germany would assume west germanys pension system and unemployment 
benefits by sept 1 
the paper said the timetable was worked out during talks in bonn 
earlier this month involving west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
finance minister theo waigel and leaders of east germanys 
alliance for germany the alliance is a threeparty group that ran 
as a coalition in the elections it includes the christian 
democrats 
waigel told welt am sonntag that east german savers will be able 
to change their marks for west german marks at a 11 rate up to a 
certain limit he gave no details 
the finance minister also said west germany will assume east 
germanys foreign debt but the size of the debt was unclear 
according to the newspaper

survivors of a vessel that listed and 
quickly sank in the icy bering sea say an alarm failed to sound and 
may have cost some of the nine missing crewmen their lives an 
investigator said sunday 
at least two of the crew i interviewed said they felt that the 
delay didnt allow people to search for survival gear or to get to 
the deck before the fishprocessing ship aleutian enterprise 
rolled and sank within minutes of listing to port thursday said 
alaska state trooper robert stevenson 
two crew members said theyd been given little or no instruction 
in using flotation suits designed to protect against the arctic 
waters 
stevenson stationed at dutch harbor about 800 miles southwest 
of anchorage said several survivors told him the alarm system had 
not worked for months stevenson interviewed 21 of the 22 survivors 
the nine people from the seattlebased trawler are missing and 
presumed drowned 
dan roberts executive vice president of arctic alaska fisheries 
corp the company that operates the vessel said saturday he 
didnt know why the alarm might have failed to sound or have been 
inoperable company officials did not return telephone messages 
left sunday with a secretary 
i just went on instinct the people all around me were 
screaming help me help me crewman derrik santy told the 
anchorage daily news saturday as he waited in line at anchorage 
international airport for a ticket home to seattle 
santy said he was below deck when the ship began to roll in calm 
seas about 60 miles south of saint paul island on thursday 
afternoon scrambling to the deck santy jumped into the water and 
grabbed anything that floated 
he said he was in the water with the other 21 survivors for 
about 10 minutes when they were picked up a sister ship the 
pacific enterprise 
stevenson said ships are supposed to be equipped with general 
alarms some of which sound automatically when the vessel lists too 
far the alarm also can be sounded manually from the wheelhouse he 
said 
the information we have is it just didnt work and hasnt 
worked for some time stevenson said 
santy 18 of seattle said sunday that he received little 
instruction on using flotation suits 
the only thing they told me about survival suits was theyre 
in these lockers and thats all he said in an interview with 
seattle television station king 
in reply to a question he said he didnt know how to put the 
suits on shoot i never saw one before 
crew member matt price 19 of aberdeen wash said he searched 
a locker for a survival suit but didnt have time to get one 
that was my first time being on a boat and they should have 
explained the procedure if it was going to sink price said 
they never did that 
stevenson said none of the crew members managed to don survival 
suits 
he said water temperatures in the bering sea are in the low 30s 
and people die of shock in such cold water fairly quickly 
the aleutian enterprise a 162foot 195ton cod fishing and 
processing factory trawler sank about 250 miles northwest of dutch 
harbor 
the ship owned by a group of california investors was operated 
by arctic alaska the company operates 22 other vessels the 
largest trawler fleet in the bering sea 
stevenson said survivors told him some crewmen were pulling in a 
netload of fish when the vessel started listing to port the 
skipper mark siemons slackened the line and gave full power to 
the starboard engine and took other actions in an attempt to right 
the 195ton vessel stevenson said 
it didnt work it continued to list and then capsized it 
sank within five minutes of capsizing he said 
he said survivors told him a handful of crewmen were off duty 
and sleeping below deck when the trawler began to list and some 
were roused by other crew members and the commotion 
the skipper meanwhile managed to radio a sister ship for help 
some survivors scrambled into two lifeboats and others clung to 
floatation devices or debris until another trawler arrived 15 or 20 
minutes later stevenson said 
coast guard spokesman greg robinson said investigators 
interviewed 10 crew members as they arrived at anchorage 
international airport from dutch harbor national transportation 
safety board investigators and lawyers representing the vessels 
owners also participated in the closed interviews he said 
the ship had set out from dutch harbor on march 2 and was to 
have returned friday

president fernando collor de mello 
ordered the destruction of about 100 clandestine amazon jungle 
airstrips to keep thousands of gold miners from returning to land 
reserved for indians 
dynamite them and be fast about it the new president told 
federal police chief romeu tuma on saturday while visiting roraima 
state in the northwest amazon 
during the trip his first since taking office march 15 collor 
also visited an indian village and flew over mining camps ordered 
shut by former president jose sarney 
the order to destroy the airstrips was given to keep an 
estimated 40000 miners from returning to lands owned by the 
yanomami indians the worlds largest remaining primitive tribe 
last week the government reported the end of an 80day 
operation to force miners off indian lands and onto three mining 
reserves however roman catholic church officials say some miners 
still remain on yanomami territory 
collor promised a solution without conflicts when about 500 
people greeted him at the airport in boa vista the roraima state 
capital 3682 miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
we must respect without a doubt our brother indians but we 
must also respect those who take from the land what is necessary to 
kill their hunger the president said 
the invasion of yanomami lands by the miners began three years 
ago when it was discovered the indians lived on reserves rich in 
minerals especially gold and diamonds 
the miners have scared away fish and game polluted rivers and 
streams and also brought diseases previously unknown to the 
yanomami 
since 1987 the tribes numbers have fallen from about 9000 to 
7500 because of malnutrition venereal diseases and malaria 
others have died in armed conflicts with miners 
the government has steadily carved up indian lands reducing the 
yanomami to territories totaling 5 million acres on 19 scattered 
reservations the tribe once claimed 23 million acres of the amazon 
forest along brazils northern border with venezuela guyana and 
colombia

president bush sat through nearly three hours 
of entertainment in historic fords theatre sunday night and 
afterwards quipped that abraham lincoln would have really enjoyed 
this program parts of it 
the show was an annual fundraising gala for fords theatre and 
the talent ranged from scat singer diane schuur to dancing 
puppeteer christopher to the gatlin brothers to tony bennett to 
comic jim morris who did a wicked imitation of both bush and his 
predecessor ronald reagan 
the show a festival at fords will be televised on ted 
turners broadcasting system on the night of july 4 
this april 14 is the 125th anniversary of the night when 
lincoln the 16th president was assassinated by john wilkes booth 
in the presidential box at fords theatre 
bush an avid theatergoer himself recalled that lincoln loved 
to go to the theater the night that booth struck was lincolns 
tenth visit to fords 
he loved entertainment and i believe he would have really 
enjoyed this program parts of it said bush to laughter and 
applause from the audience of more than 500 
the theater closed after the assassination remained dark for 
103 years until it was restored by congress and the national park 
service in 1968 as both a museum and a living theater 
rep sidney yates dill received the lincoln medal from the 
theaters trustees for his advocacy of the arts frankie hewitt 
the theaters executive director said that in recent years amid 
congressional efforts to censor national endowment for the arts 
grants yates had quite literally protected the integrity of the 
arts for all americans 
yates who last week survived a tough primary fight drew 
applause in turn when he applauded bush for the great statement 
you made in support of the arts 
bush last friday said he opposes attempts to write into law 
antipornography restrictions on nea grants 
i am deeply offended by some of the filth that i see and to 
which federal money has gone and some of the sacrilegious 
blasphemous depictions that are portrayed by some to be art bush 
said 
but he said he prefers to let his new nea director john 
frohnmayer use his discretion rather than risk censorship of 
getting the federal government into telling every artist what he or 
she can paint or how he or she might express themselves

unpredictable weather redevelopment and shaky 
attempts to reach new markets added up to a bad winter for the lake 
tahoe resort in california and nevada tourism officials said 
but officials are optimistic the economy has bottomed out and 
that new hotel development at pristine sierra lake and possible 
events such as the miss usa pageant will help tahoe rebound 
the number of rooms booked on the california side of the popular 
resort fell 822 percent in julydecember 1989 compared with the 
same period in 1988 for january the figure was 176 percent below 
january 1988 
room tax collections on the california side which relies on ski 
resorts to lure winter tourists dropped 23 percent to 29 
million in the last half of 1989 compared with the same period a 
year earlier 
the casinolined nevada side of the lake showed a 1 percent 
increase in room taxes in the same period improvement in january 
pushed the rise to 2 percent for the sevenmonth period 
things were pretty bad this winter kathleen farrell 
executive director of the tahoedouglas chamber of commerce said 
friday the lack of snow hurt us and a controversy over how to 
market the area exists about whether to go after skiers in the 
winter or not and where to advertise 
ski resorts peppered the dallasfort worth market with ads this 
winter to attract visitors who usually go to colorado slopes but a 
lack of significant snow kept texans away 
when storms did hit they typically came on fridays causing many 
driveup tourist from northern california to stay home 
the last time i saw such bad timing of storms was six years 
ago ms farrell said wed look out the window and say its 
storming it must be friday thats how it was this winter 
in may the tahoe tourism authority plans to launch a 320000 
advertising campaign to run through september in los angeles to 
attract summer visitors to the lake and with hope make up for the 
poor winter 
negotiations are continuing to bring the 1991 miss usa pageant 
to renotahoe in february or march 
i think that in the past two months weve already started to 
turn the situation around and so things arent as alarming as they 
appear to be said barbara klein executive director of the lake 
tahoe visitors authority at south lake tahoe calif 
ms klein said ground will be broken in april and may for two 
new hotel projects at south lake tahoe bordering the stateline 
nev casino row that sits above the lake about 35 miles southwest 
of reno 
about 900 old motel rooms in the city were torn down to allow 
construction of a 400room embassy suites hotel and a 320room 
stillunnamed hotel 
tahoe tourism authorities also have hired people to greet 
passengers flying into the reno cannon international airport and 
are putting together minivacation packages to lure visitors to 
stay longer than a weekend 
an estimated 25 million to 3 million people visit lake tahoe 
each year with many staying overnight in one of the 11000 hotel 
and motel rooms around the 72mile shoreline ms klein said

britains top treasury official said sunday he 
expects the nations 77 percent inflation rate and 15 percent 
interest rates to be materially lower by 1991 
in due course it would be very nice to get inflation down to 
nil but inflation doesnt suddenly come down to nil and stay there 
forever chancellor of the exchequer john major said 
major said in a british broadcasting corp television interview 
that inflation and interest rates will be materially lower at the 
beginning of next year at the middle of next year at the end of 
next year and in 1992 
britains inflation rate has sat at 77 percent despite the 
governments high interestrate policy and economists predict it 
could climb as high as 9 percent 
major the treasurys top official said in his budgetary 
statement earlier this month that inflation is worse in britain 
than in other countries because of heavy borrowing and strong 
consumer spending

workers at 11 hawaii hotels achieved a goal of 
parity with mainland workers under a tentative agreement ending a 
monthlong strike that left some hotel guests making their own 
beds labor leaders said 
the deal between local 5 of the hotel employees and restaurant 
employees and the council of hawaii hotels would give workers an 
average pay increase of 10 percent a year 
the strike affected about onefourth of the 37000 hotel rooms 
in waikiki the states tourist capital and about oneseventh of 
the states total number of hotel rooms 
as is the case with all contracts we didnt get everything we 
want but we did satisfy our needs union leader tony rutledge 
said after the agreement was announced saturday 
nearly 80 percent of workers will be earning nearly as much 
money as hotel workers in san francisco by the time the contract 
expires in 1994 rutledge said meeting one of the unions main 
goals 
the walkout by 7500 maids bellhops clerks restaurant and bar 
workers and others left some hotel guests doing without room 
service and making their own beds as managers struggled to fill the 
gaps some of the affected hotels offered discounts of up to 20 
percent 
the tentative accord reached after an allnight bargaining 
session was announced by union and management representatives 
gov john waihee and federal mediator frank schoeppel 
this will give stability to the industry for the next five 
years said william crawford executive director of the 
management council and chief negotiator for the hotels 
the union achieved its main goal of bringing pay in line with 
that of mainland hotel workers union spokesman roderick rodriguez 
said 
union members were to meet sunday to discuss the settlement and 
procedures for ratification but members were told they didnt need 
to wait for formal ratification and could return to work as soon as 
their hotels called for them to come in 
under the agreement wages and benefits for nontipped workers 
will increase 7 percent this year and 6 percent each of the next 
four years tipped workers will get raises totaling 85 cents an 
hour over the life of the contract 
workers also will get an increase of 99 cents an hour in health 
and other benefits to bring the total to 229 an hour 
the union failed to win a 5 percent room surcharge or a 15 
percent food and beverage surcharge that would have been divided 
among workers two issues it had labeled critical for a settlement 
rutledge said the tentative agreement would add about 40 cents 
per hour across the board to the one approved at another hawaiian 
hotel the union had been seeking increases of about 10 percent a 
year for three years 
salaries under the old contract range from an average of 385 
an hour for bellhops to an average of 1104 an hour for cooks 
waihee intervened out of concern for the states 
6billionayear tourist industry 
the strike which began feb 24 affected eight hotels on oahu 
and three on the neighbor islands 
the affected hotels on oahu were the hilton hawaiian village 
2523 rooms sheraton waikiki 1900 rooms hyatt regency waikiki 
1250 rooms princess kalulani 1150 rooms ilikai hotel 800 
rooms sheraton moana surfrider 793 rooms royal hawaiian 525 
rooms and kahala hilton 369 rooms 
neighbor island hotels affected are the sharaton maui 495 
rooms sheraton kauai 456 rooms and kona hilton 445 rooms in 
addition two other hotels the turtle bay hilton and royal 
waikoloan agreed to abide by terms of the settlement

a sign outside this red bricked town 
along the missouri river proudly proclaims its the place where the 
pony express began and jesse james ended 
but empty warehouses vacant storefronts and quiet rail yards 
are grim reminders that the glory days for st joseph like many 
towns in the manufacturing midwest are long past 
for residents with few skills the only jobs around are those 
paying minimum wage or just above hundreds of high paying jobs 
vanished when meat packing plants closed and the farm crisis set in 
those scraping by at the bottom of the wage scale have been 
looking forward to april 1 when the minimum wage goes up 45 cents 
an hour from 335 to 380 its the first such hike for the 
working poor since 1981 
it doesnt sound like much really but it would help us 
out said diane fanning who supports an 8yearold daughter on a 
410anhour job making beds and doing other chores at a nursing 
home 
her employer like businesses across the country that pay above 
380 an hour is faced with the dilemma of whether to provide 
raises to rival the hike in the minimum wage 
i know how to stretch a penny i have to but theres not much 
money to do anything right now not for the extras anyway it 
would let us maybe go do something once in a while fanning said 
of a 45cent raise that would translate into about 18 more a week 
she now takes home around 140 a week she said 
under the measure passed by congress last year the 4 million 
americans who make the minimum wage will see the hourly rate go to 
425 on april 1 1991 it also establishes a training wage for 
teenagers first entering the work force which will be 335 an 
hour this year and 361 an hour in 1991 
had the minimum wage kept pace with inflation since 1981 it 
would have been 459 an hour in 1989 and 528 an hour by 1992 
supporters said 
ive been waiting on this for a long time said tim 
turrieta another nurses aide at the carriage square health care 
center our wages have been holding steady but the economys 
been running away its only fair that we get something 
its going to let you buy that pair of shoes youve been 
looking at but havent been able to afford turrieta said 
but to others the increase is so long overdue it wont have 
much impact lowwage workers also fear bigger paychecks might 
translate into higher grocery and clothing prices 
after they raise it to where a man can start to make it im 
afraid the economy and the price of everything else will just take 
off too said greg fairchild who helps support four children on 
a 360anhour cooks job at burger king without his wifes 
865amonth take home pay as a psychiatric aide his family 
wouldnt make it he said 
though st josephs downtown business district has suffered in 
recent years its threemile strip of fast food and retail 
establishments known as the belt has continued to grow 
the good paying jobs in st joseph a town of 76000 located 50 
miles north of kansas city are at the lone meat packing plant left 
in town a wire rope manufacturer the mead paper plant and quaker 
oats 
being in the heart of the farm belt we suffered with the 
agriculture crisis but things have improved significantly said 
alan kenyon president of the areas chamber of commerce 
he noted that a pet food firm is opening a test facility soon 
and that more than 30 stores have just been added to the expanded 
shopping mall at the edge of town unemployment posted a relatively 
low 55 percent rate last year the same level as the entire state 
one county in southeast missouri suffered a 15 percent jobless rate 
merchants here paying low wages dont think workers will get 
much benefit from a few more nickels an hour 
the dollars just pass from one hand to another whos really 
gained from all of it said clara lash who runs the 120bed 
facility where fanning and turrieta work 
nina casey who owns the savon unclaimed merchandise and 
furniture store out on the belt said the increase wont hurt her 
profit margin 
its no skin off our nose because well just raise the prices 
to match it casey said your bottom line has to stay the same 
any thirdgrader can tell you that so how does their minimum wage
