she rose out of the sea at midnight 
and carefully dug a nest in the sand as her ancestors have done for 
about 90 million years 
only this time the giant loggerhead sea turtle had an audience 
twodozen flashpopping oohingandaahing beachgoers encircled 
the 200pound turtle and watched transfixed as she slowly deposited 
more than 100 eggs the size of pingpong balls into a hole in the 
sand covered them and lumbered back into the surf never to see 
them again 
its almost a religious experience maybe its a female thing 
but i empathize with the turtle all that multiple labor said 
sue sheehan 44 a teacher from nearby jupiter who brought her 
mother from phoenix to see turtles give birth behind the jupiter 
beach hilton 
the women were among thousands of locals and tourists taking 
part in turtle watches on floridas east coast last week during the 
peak of the mayseptember nesting season 
biologists credit the latenight watches with raising awareness 
and aiding research about the endangered sea turtles which seem to 
face threats from every corner 
but the watches also have raised concerns among some biologists 
who want to minimize human impact on the skittish turtles and 
prevent the excesses of swim with the dolphin programs and 
parks where bears accept handouts from tourists 
you have to be careful when we interfere with nature are we 
really doing the best thing or causing more harm asked maj 
roger bennett of the florida marine patrol 
while scientists arent sure how many sea turtles remain 
loggerheads are classified as a threatened species and 
leatherback green and kemps ridley turtles are on the endangered 
list 
adult turtles can live about 75 years in the wild and each 
female digs up to seven nests a year the incubation period is 
about 60 days right after hatching baby turtles head for the 
ocean 
pollution beach traffic poachers storms and natural predators 
prevent all but one or two of every 100 eggs from surviving the 15 
years to maturity says marc lavasseur a marine researcher 
licensed by the state and paid by the hilton to give lectures and 
protect the eggs on the beach next to the hotel 
several nights each week lavasseur patrols the area if 
leatherback green or kemps ridley turtles reach the beach he 
keeps everyone away but when a more common loggerhead begins to 
lay eggs he ushers the crowds in for a look at the primordial 
ritual 
i love stuff like this said mary lynn fischer who brought 
her husband and two children along from naperville ill 
with earth day and recycling the consciousness is just 
there said mrs fischer all of our friends are going to 
yosemite and yellowstone theyre not doing the cruises any more 
lavasseur says the oddlooking animals need human help 
when miami beach was just a sand bar and palm beach only a 
dream sea turtles nested all along floridas shores returning 
each year to the same spot to lay their eggs but now that 
condominiums and hotels loom over much of the coast private 
landowners in particular should make the beaches as hospitable as 
possible lavasseur says 
man never should have built on the barrier islands he said 
now that we have its our responsibility to help mitigate the 
problems weve put in 
the 29yearold former hotel bellhop has persuaded managers to 
dim the lights during the nesting season so that pregnant turtles 
and hatchlings wont mistake them for moonlight and become 
disoriented he also relocates nests laid in front of the hotels 
boardwalk to safer areas 
the ultimate effects of his efforts are unclear but state 
department of natural resources statistics show 931 nests were laid 
last year on the mile beach lavasseur patrols already this year 
hes documented 235 nests an indication that nesting is on the 
increase 
still state officials are keeping close tabs on the turtle 
watches to be sure they dont become too much of a good thing 
we certainly would never permit every area of the beach to 
watch turtles every night said barbara schroeder who 
coordinates sea turtle programs for the department we have to 
weigh the educational benefit against harrassment to the turtles

when a municipal office building goes up 
across the road from the town common it will be a monument to the 
drawing power of bake sales bottle drives and fourth of july 
chicken barbecues 
along with car and quilt raffles turkey suppers lobster bakes 
fall foliage festivals boat trips and dinner theaters not to 
mention a hawaiian pig roast a jazz concert and a white elephant 
sale 
plus letters and doortodoor solicitations that brought in 
contributions from 648 people 
instead of having taxpayers shell out an average of 15 for each 
of the next 20 years a civic group has staged dozens of 
fundraisers to come up with the 250000 to buy a site for the 
building and then donate it to the town 
its like a dream said henry rowe one of the founders of 
the boothbay civic association and its president now only 40000 
away from its goal the nonprofit association expects to complete 
its campaign this fall 
the level of commitment is amazing said town manager 
victoria dyer 
the association formed after the town initially decided to build 
the new town offices now situated up a steep flight of stairs over 
the town garage at a ball field half a mile down a side road 
association members decided to buy the property in the center of 
town that now holds an abandoned garage and turn what many 
consider an eyesore into a landmark 
the central location is at a crossroads the gateway to boothbay 
harbor and other villages along a scenic peninsula where thousands 
of visitors stream in and out on summer days 
the association answered protests the site would be too costly 
by raising the money on its own the town will pay for construction 
of the building 
i think that every community in the country ought to have a 
civic association to do whats right away from the tax dollar 
said former boat builder chetley rittall regarded as the moving 
spirit behind the project 
rittall and his followers organized the association in 1987 
with the first 100 coming from a supper put on by the fire 
department within months the group had raised 50000 enough to 
secure a 200000 mortgage on the garage 
fishermen donated 1250 pounds of lobsters for two lobster 
bakes at times 100 women were enlisted to turn out pies for bake 
sales 
the project has not been without hitches association leaders 
felt badly served when the town of 3500 yearround residents sent 
a bill for 2500 for taxes on the garage property despite the 
groups nonprofit status 
although the association plans to appeal the assessment its 
leaders are amused at the irony 
if we dont pay the taxes the town will have a lien on the 
property but were going to be donating it to the town anyway 
rowe said

charles vest provost of the university 
of michigan has been named president of the massachusetts 
institute of technology a post he called one of the greatest 
bully pulpits in science 
the 48yearold mechanical engineer was elected unanimously 
monday by the mit corporation the schools governing body 
the selection of the schools 15th president ends a trying 
yearlong effort to replace the retiring paul gray in which three 
leading candidates withdrew 
vest will be leaving a statesupported university with 50000 
students on three campuses for a private research institution with 
9700 students mit founded in 1861 has long ranked among the 
worlds finest universities 
the presidency of mit is one of the greatest bully pulpits for 
science and technology in the united states and i will make use of 
it vest said monday 
in a statement vest said mit will lead in the redefinition 
of engineering education in light of scientific change and the new 
global and social realities 
vest said the training of engineers needs to be expanded to 
include more exposure to the humanities and other areas 
mit has long performed research for the pentagon and vest said 
he expects that to continue but as defense needs diminish vest 
said he hopes more researchers can devote themselves to fields such 
as manufacturing health and biotechnology 
the choice of the softspoken vest was praised at mit and at ann 
arbor where vest arrived from his native west virginia as a 
graduate student in 1963 and went on to become dean of engineering 
and in 1989 provost 
mit made the right choice said james duderstadt president 
of the university of michigan 
vest has extraordinary vision and depth and that rare 
ability to get people to do things by believing they want to do 
them duderstadt said 
gray said in march 1989 that he intended to step down next month 
after 10 years and become mit corporation chairman 
the frontrunner for president mit provost david deutch 
withdrew after his nomination drew strong opposition from some 
faculty 
nobel laureate and mit biologist david baltimore was viewed as 
the probable best alternative to deutch but he took a job as 
president of rockefeller university 
in february mit professor phillip sharp said he would take the 
job but before the mit corporation had a chance to vote on him he 
had a change of heart sharp said he preferred to continue his 
cancer research and teaching

beijing will evict 102000 migrant workers in the 
coming months as part of a drive to spruce up its image before it 
hosts the asian games in september an official newspaper reported 
today 
the china daily said only those migrants with special 
certificates would be allowed to stay in the capital 
the newspaper said thorough checks will be made of workplaces 
hiring rural labor and those employing unregistered laborers will 
be fined 
the report said the sweep against migrant workers would keep 
urban unemployment down and ensure a clean and secure environment 
for the asian games 
an estimated 100000 foreign athletes sports officials and 
tourists are expected in the capital for the games they will be 
the largest international sports event ever staged in china 
chinese authorities trying to improve the nations image after 
the bloody military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement last 
year are intent on making sure the games go off without a hitch 
in 1987 more than 1 million rural workers flooded beijing a 
city of 10 million to work in the construction and service 
industries and take manual labor jobs unpopular with city residents 
the peasant workers shoddily dressed and carrying all their 
belongings on their back camped out at the overcrowded railway 
station and set up makeshift stalls on city streets 
chinese are legally allowed to live and work only in places 
where they are officially registered with the government 
authorities previously did little to stop the migrants because they 
provided a needed source of unskilled labor 
the demand for the unskilled workers declined sharply in late 
1988 after the government introduced an austerity program that 
brought an abrupt end to the construction boom 
last year beijing asked 284000 migrant workers to leave the 
capital the china daily said it quoted city officials as saying 
the desirable number of rural farmers allowed to work in beijing 
should be no more than 350000

1990 is fast becoming one of the worst 
years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and 
southern sections of the nation 
so far this year 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide 
well ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first six 
months of last year and the 30year average of 482 tornadoes 
recorded between january and july said frederick ostby of the 
national severe storms forecast center here 
the nation had 747 tornadoes in the first six months of 1973 
one of the biggest years for tornadoes since 1950 when the 
forecast center began keeping reliable records of the storms there 
were 756 tornadoes reported in 1982 
we seem to be on a pace that would put us up with those two 
years ostby said 
the culprit in this tornado barrage across the plains is a 
persistent west coast pattern of low pressure in the upper 
atmosphere that is keeping the jet stream anchored at a southern 
latitude 
this years storms seem particularly violent as illustrated by 
the march 13 tornado that cut a swath a mile wide and brought winds 
of 300 mph to a field in kansas the tornado was the strongest to 
hit the united states since 1985 
the first weekend in june saw the worst outburst of tornadoes 
since 1974 ostby said 101 tornadoes touched down from kansas to 
kentucky leaving nine people dead 
but a break in the storm pattern may be at hand 
as summer wears on the land warms up and cold air from canada 
retreats this moves the boundary of the jet stream to the north 
ostby said 
our longer range computer forecasts are suggestive of that 
there is some kind of a readjustment beginning to take place in the 
upper atmosphere he said 
however a study of tornado trends indicates parts of the 
midwest particularly kansas and missouri are heading into a 
sixyear period of more intense tornadoes 
the study of tornadoes since early this century shows that they 
are concentrated in regions for five or sixyear periods said 
michael smith president of weatherdata inc 
but warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated 
leading to fewer deaths tornadoes have caused 20 deaths this year 
while an average year in the 1980s saw 52 deaths and in the 1970s 
nearly 100 ostby said 
there are better watches better warnings and a better 
response ostby said 
ostby credited the quicker response to computers that allow 
meteorologists to see many sources of data such as satellite 
readings more clearly 
flooding in the south and the plains has been as destructive as 
the tornadoes 
the death toll from last weeks flash floods in shadyside ohio 
rose to 21 on monday making the flood one of the most deadly in 
recent years authorities held out little hope for more than a 
dozen others listed as missing 
wegee and pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5 
inches of rain in 3 hours the floods destroyed as many as 70 
houses and damaged up to 40 officials said 
flooding in texas has been blamed for at least 16 deaths since 
april an estimated 10000 people were forced from their homes and 
high water caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage

a helicopter swooped into the 
exercise yard of a maximumsecurity prison early monday and in a 
daring maneuver flew two inmates to freedom 
officials said a prison guard was shot in the leg during the 
escape at kent prison about 50 miles east of vancouver 
the prison holds some of the most dangerous criminals in canada 
almost half the inmates in the allmale facility are kept in 
protective custody and about onequarter are serving life sentences 
dianne brown a federal corrections spokeswoman identified the 
two escapees as robert ford 32 and david thomas 24 
she said ford was serving a life sentence for firstdegree 
murder while thomas was serving an eightyear term for robbery 
ford and two other men escaped from a prison in victoria in 
march 1989 while awaiting trial they were captured 11 days later 
lori stevens who lives across the road from the prison 
witnessed the escape from her living room it was fun to watch 
it looked like a bad movie she said 
the bell 206 helicopter and its pilot fred fandrich had been 
hijacked from valley helicopters ltd said a transport canada 
official fandrich owns the company 
at about 840 am the helicopter touched down inside the 
prisons inner fence and a man inside the helicopter opened fired 
at corrections officer ripley kirby hitting him in the leg police 
said 
police said two inmates emerged from a nearby workshop ran to 
the helicopter and jumped aboard 
i was told to get out of there so i got out of there said 
fandrich 50 
there was a lot of gunfire inside the helicopter from the guy 
with the gun and it was very very loud when hes shooting a foot 
away from your head the pilot added 
the helicopter was then flown to silver creek about 50 miles 
north of the prison police said fandrich was tied up and the two 
escapees and an accomplice left the area in a bluishgray car 
fandrich managed to escape and contact police 
the escape was the second since kent opened in 1979 assistant 
warden judy croft said two inmates escaped eight years ago by 
hiding in a truck as it left the grounds they were captured less 
than an hour later 
dennis finlay another federal corrections spokesman said the 
situation at the prison was under control the prison has 260 
inmates 
a similar attempt failed in february in france when three gunmen 
hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to fly to a 
maximumsecurity prison south of paris the hijackers dropped a 
rope from the helicopter but it snapped as prisoners grabbed it 
one man was killed and another was seriously injured 
last august in colorado two women in a hijacked helicopter 
plucked two men from a prison yard the escape attempt ended in a 
shootout with police 400 miles away 
a similar prison escape in miami in april ended when the 
helicopter crashed inside the prison yard

how does a country count more than 1 billion 
people especially if many dont want to be counted 
china has started by drafting nearly 7 million census workers 
more than the entire population of finland 
hundreds of thousands of training centers have been set up to 
teach the workers how to conduct the worlds biggest headcount 
which begins july 1 and will take about 10 days 
in addition millions more chinese have been mobilized to hang 
red banners in the streets beat drums sing songs and hand out 
publicity materials to popularize the slogan the population 
census everyone is responsible 
most chinese have responded with the passive acquiesence they 
give all government campaigns such as those calling for killing 
flies or studying socialist labor models 
but the census last held in 1982 strikes fear in the hearts of 
a substantial minority 
they are the millions of people who have moved to cities without 
permission and millions of others who have violated 
familyplanning regulations by having more than one child 
fearful of being fined thousands of dollars parents often fail 
to register additional children and try to keep them deep secrets 
hence their nickname black children 
its very possible that theres a black child in each 
apartment building said census worker zhang yuesi who was 
taking part one recent afternoon in a precensus trial in northeast 
beijings zuo family village neighborhood 
she and five other workers visited three households and filled 
out questionnaires as a practice run 
we must deeply arouse the masses and do propaganda work among 
them in order to get a correct count said mrs zhang a brisk 
woman who usually works in the municipal statistics bureau like 
other census workers she was temporarily drafted in march to help 
make the count 
census officials insist they wont punish anyone for having more 
than one child or living illegally in a city 
at a recent news conference zhang sai deputy director of the 
central governments census leading group or committee 
promised that data on individual families wont be shared with 
police or family planning officials 
but it is not the census questionnaire per se that worries some 
families 
it is the prolonged glare of official attention including 
precensus checks of household registrations little booklets that 
list household members one copy is kept at home and one in the 
local police station 
since spring officials already have made doortodoor checks to 
confirm registrations are up to date and have quizzed neighbors 
about suspect households if there were any black children in 
zuo family village they likely were uncovered during this stage 
when there was no confidentiality 
zhang yuesi the census worker didnt want to release figures 
for her own turf but she disclosed that in fengtai a rural area 
of beijing more than 300 unregistered children were found in 
just one census district 
li honggui deputy director of the national census office said 
some have speculated the nationwide total of black children 
will reach several tens of millions 
the last census in 1982 counted 103 billion people and 
registered births and deaths since have produced a tentative count 
of 1112 billion making china by far the most populous country in 
the world 
india is no 2 with 880 million people 
zhang sai said an exact figure is needed for the smooth running 
of chinas planned economy thats why censustakers are going 
doortodoor this year instead of asking residents to visit census 
stations as in the other three counts made during four decades of 
communist rule 
computers are playing a bigger role too replacing the abacus 
first results will be released in october and a detailed 
tabulation in 1992 
our standard is to be off by no more than onethousandth 
said zhang yuesi who is not related to zhang sai 
peculiarities of chinas housing allocation system have created 
pitfalls that will test even the bestprepared counter 
take the case of liu yugui a retired union official in zuo 
family villages east no 10 building his household registration 
book shows five people living in a tworoom apartment 
in reality his son daughter and grandson have found unofficial 
housing elsewhere but they often visit and spend the night liu 
said where should they be counted 
there are other special cases families swap assigned 
apartments trying to move closer to work grown children marry 
outside beijing but stay registered with their parents hoping one 
day to return to the capital doublecounting seems as much a risk 
as missing heads 
but most problems can be resolved with a simple rule mrs zhang 
said people will be counted at their place of registration unless 
theyve lived somewhere else more than one year

president bush is prodding israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to open a dialogue with palestinian arabs 
as the first step in reviving longstalled middle east peace talks 
bush in a lengthy letter asked the prime minister what his new 
rightwing government was willing to do to promote peace and 
whether he still supports a plan for elections of palestinian 
representatives in the occupied territories officials said monday 
the presidents letter sent in the last few days adds weight 
to a warning by secretary of state james a baker iii that the 
united states will stop trying to get peace talks under way unless 
shamir makes compromises to open a dialogue with palestinians 
confirming receipt of bushs letter shamir said bush asked me 
for replies and explanations about our path in the framework of the 
peace process 
naturally we will reply to him shamir said in a televised 
interview in jerusalem we will explain to him to the best of 
our ability our attitude our proposals and i sincerely hope if 
here and there there are differences of opinion we will reach an 
agreement 
the white house did not release bushs letter but presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said it congratulated shamir on forming 
a new government after a threemonth political deadlock 
the president asked him for a description of where he stands 
on the peace process at this month fitzwater said he said bush 
expressed hopes that shamir remained committed to the plan he 
espoused last year 
the united states and israel have been deeply divided over steps 
to implement shamirs plan 
last week shamirs government set restrictive new conditions on 
his proposal darkening prospects that it ever would be implemented 
baker in an appearance before a house committee last wednesday 
appeared to question whether the israeli government was genuinely 
committed to the peace process 
he said officials of shamirs new government had dismissed the 
plan for a palestinian dialogue and were adding new conditions that 
palestinians must meet as a price for talks 
now if thats going to be the approach and thats going to 
be the attitude there wont be any dialogue and there wont be any 
peace and the united states of america cant make it happen 
baker said 
he offered the white house telephone number and said in a clear 
message to israel when youre serious about peace call us 
in may 1989 shamir proposed holding elections among palestinian 
arabs who live on the west bank and gaza these palestinians would 
negotiate with israel the terms for five years of limited 
selfrule to be followed by a second round of talks on an overall 
settlement of the arabisraeli dispute 
baker concluded last fall that shamirs plan was the best 
approach to getting negotiations started he consulted over several 
months with egypt israel and through egyptian intermediaries 
with the palestine liberation organization 
a formula devised by baker to implement shamirs proposal called 
for talks between israelis and palestinians in cairo it also 
provided for the participation of palestinians expelled from the 
territories and others who had residences in east jerusalem 
shamir evidently objecting to the provisions on the 
palestinians refused to submit the plan to the israeli cabinet for 
approval 
bush meanwhile declared east jerusalem which shamir has 
vowed to retain occupied territory 
the israeli government collapsed in turmoil in march and the 
us initiative went on hold as israel struggled to form a new 
government 
david levy the foreign minister of israels new government 
charged last week that bakers proposal was out of sync with the 
plan outlined last year by shamir 
the israeli government peace initiative has been changed and 
distorted and turned into questions the baker questions to which 
israel was required to answer yes or no levy said no 
nation can be asked to gamble with its own survival

president bush is prepared to assure nelson 
mandela that he wont push for removal of us sanctions against 
south africa until that country meets all the conditions specified 
by congress american officials say 
the black leader is due to arrive in the united states on 
wednesday but wont meet with bush until next monday using the 
interim period more for ceremonial activities than for substantive 
discussions 
a tickertape parade in new york on wednesday after a ceremonial 
arrival at the airport will launch mandelas threeday visit to 
that city he also will visit boston before coming to washington 
although he is philosophically opposed to sanctions bush is 
expected to promise mandela that his administration will comply 
faithfully with the terms of 1986 legislation for ending the 
sanctions said the us officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
other analysts said the president also does not wish to inject 
controversy into what are expected to be tumultuous receptions for 
the deputy leader of the african national congress as he makes his 
12day us visit 
in addition efforts to undercut mandelas prosanctions message 
would have the added effect of setting back republican efforts to 
recruit more blacks to their ranks the analysts said 
the sanctions deny us landing rights for south african airways 
and ban importation of certain south african products also 
prohibited are new us investments and bank loans 
democrats on capitol hill who generally are strong supporters 
of sanctions contend that the liberalizing measures thus far 
adopted by south african president f w de klerk are largely 
cosmetic they detect signs that some in the administration want to 
give a boost to de klerk by scaling back some sanctions 
the administration says its policy will be guided by the 1986 
sanctions legislation the president can consider lifting any of 
the sanctions if south africa meets four of five conditions set 
forth by congress 
however there may be disagreement between the administration 
and congress over precisely what south africa must do to be in 
compliance 
no one on either side is claiming that south africa has met the 
congressional requirement that all political prisoners be released 
on that basis mandela will receive assurances next week there will 
be no relaxation of sanctions the us officials said 
but a confrontation over that issue may lie ahead because of 
differing estimates over the number of south african prisoners 
detained for political reasons the range is between 350 and 3500 
another ambiguity is the status of the us condition that the 
state of emergency in south africa must be lifted south africa 
announced an end to emergency rules in three provinces on june 8 
but they remain in effect in natal which has been plagued by a 
wave of blackonblack violence 
the administration is studying the legal implications of what 
this partial step means in terms of south african compliance with 
the us conditions the june 8 action was hailed by the white 
house as evidence of the remarkable progress south africa has 
made under de klerks leadership 
one condition on which there has been no progress is the repeal 
of restrictions on the movements of nonwhites and on where they 
can live 
but as the administration sees it south africa has fulfilled 
other us conditions by unbanning black groups that previously had 
been proscribed and by showing a willingness to negotiate a new 
arrangement for the countrys black majority 
some in congress say these actions have fallen short of 
congressional intent

dick tracy debuted on top with 225 
million in ticket sales over the weekend but the crime stopper 
soon goes up against enough big guns to make nemesis big boy look 
like small fry 
over the next three weeks dick tracy clashes with such 
potential summer blockbusters as robocop 2 days of thunder 
and die hard 2 
according to figures released monday by exhibitor relations co 
warren beattys dick tracy claimed the biggest opening weekend 
ever by a film released by walt disney studios 
so far dick tracy has received mostly good reviews and 
positive word of mouth but in this crowded movie season the film 
failed to surpass arnold schwarzeneggers total recall for the 
seasons top opening weekend 
total recall opening three weeks ago grossed 255 million 
its debut the dick tracy haul included 12 million in 
tshirts that served as tickets at midnight openings the film is 
playing on 2332 screens in north america 
the best debut ever was that of another comicbook crime 
fighter batman which collected 405 million for warner bros 
in its first weekend last summer

add two new dangers to life in the trendy 
lane espresso makers wrist and choking from eating 
eversolightly done california cuisine while wearing a dental 
retainer 
cases of the two new perils of modern living were reported in 
letters published in the june issue of the western journal of 
medicine 
in one case berkeley physician dennis shusterman said that 
during a visit to a restaurant he noticed an elastic bandage 
around the owners right wrist 
the restaurateur told the doctor he had suffered increasing 
wrist pain for two months 
the pain was exacerbated each time he inserted spigots 
containing fresh coffee grounds into an espresso machine with a 
rotating motion of the handle a maneuver that he repeated 80 to 
100 times a day shusterman wrote 
the doctor performed tests an determined the restaurant owner 
suffered de quervains tenosynovitis an inflammation of the sheath 
surrounding a tendon in the wrist the condition previously was 
seen in assembly line workers and in women who spend a lot of time 
wringing wet clothes shusterman said 
while the prevalence of this disorder among espresso makers is 
unknown the recent surge in popularity of espresso drinking may 
place additional persons at risk he wrote 
the second hazard involved choking associated with two 
relatively recent trends adult orthodontics and california 
cuisine said a letter by drs albert w wu and haya r rubin of 
the medical school at the university of california at san francisco 
the patient was a 31yearold woman who had worn braces for an 
improper bite had the bands removed and then was fitted with a 
retainer which she was told to wear even during meals 
at a lunch meeting while discussing the benefits of a lowfat 
diet over a platter of al dente vegetables she suddenly stood and 
raised both hands to her neck in the international sign of 
choking wu and rubin wrote 
her companion did a prompt heimlich maneuver ejecting an 
intact nearly 2inchlong piece of broccoli they said 
the doctors said the broccoli had lodged in her throat between 
her windpipe and the back of the retainer 
the doctors said that to their knowledge this is the first 
report of choking associated with an orthodontic appliance 
patients should consider removing their retainers before eating 
as for the case of espresso makers wrist the restaurant owner 
recovered almost completely after spending three weeks letting his 
right wrist rest and taking nonprescription antiinflammatory 
medicine shusterman said 
he adapted to this occupational disability by using his 
opposite hand to insert spigots into the espresso machine taking 
care to avoid any abrupt or strenuous maneuvers in the process 
the doctor said

the bush administration wants assurances from 
the senate that a proposed overhaul of the governments housing 
programs will not be used to begin a new wave of public housing 
construction 
as the senate began debating a bill monday to discard 
scandalplagued housing and urban development programs of the past 
20 years administration officials indicated a willingness to 
accept 3 billion more in spending on housing than it wanted but 
only on condition 
budget director richard darman said the administration wants 
sections of the bill rewritten to assure that new construction of 
public housing is deemphasized in favor of renovating and 
preserving the current stock of dilapidated and unused units 
it also wants stronger language on targeting the new aid to the 
poor rather than middleincome families and it seeks a requirement 
that buyers using federal housing administrationbacked mortgages 
put up more of their own money in the closing costs as a 
disincentive for walking away from the loans 
darman and housing secretary jack kemp met with sen alan 
cranston dcalif and other democratic and republican authors of 
the bill monday morning 
their aides continued the negotiations throughout the afternoon 
and cranston said he doubted that final senate action on the bill 
will be completed this week 
house democrats meanwhile want to bring similar legislation to 
the floor before congress recesses for the july fourth holiday at 
the end of next week 
the senate bill would scuttle or consolidate several existing 
programs under a proposed new housing opportunity partnership that 
would funnel some 2 billion next year to state and local 
governments for rehabilitating affordable housing for the poor 
sixty percent of the money would go to cities and 40 percent to 
state governments which would be required to match from their own 
tax receipts 1 for every 3 in federal aid they receive 
in addition the legislation would extend for two years the 
124875 ceiling on fhainsured mortgages that congress last year 
raised from 101250 in most highcost areas 
in his proposed budget for fiscal 1991 beginning next oct 1 
president bush proposed increasing the current 145 billion in 
federal spending on housing by only 80 million 
however cranston quoted darman and kemp as telling senators at 
mondays meeting that bush would not veto the senate banking 
committees 176 billion version if compromises can be found on 
new housing construction how the money is targeted and new 
protections for the fha insurance fund 
if we can work these three policy areas out were prepared to 
go well over our budget i assure you we would not veto the bill on 
the dollar figures alone cranston quoted darman as saying 
although darman offered no specific dollar figure acceptable to 
the administration cranston said he was confident that bush would 
accept a 3 billion increase 
coupled with anticipated increases of 42 billion in fiscal 
1992 and 48 billion in fiscal 1993 the legislation would provide 
housing assistance to an additional 730000 lowincome families he 
said 
cranston expressed confidence that compromises with the 
administration on new public housing construction and targeted aid 
to the poor could be found easily 
more complicated he said will be finding an accord on measures 
to bolster the security of the fha insurance funds he said the 
administrations proposal in a typical case would raise the 
upfront closing costs to a young family seeking their first home 
with an fhainsured mortgage from 3500 to 4400 
an increase that big would knock many people out of the 
market cranston said we believe we can avoid that and still 
assure that the fund remains actuarially sound 
the fha lost 42 billion to bad loans in 1988 and now has a net 
worth of only 26 billion compared with 8 billion in 1979 
if housing prices which are now flat or falling in much of the 
country dont rise at least 4 percent a year the fha insurance 
fund will require an infusion of tax dollars to remain afloat the 
congressional general accounting office said earlier this month

an interfaith group of religious leaders 
called today for a renewed effort to teach children common moral 
values in school apart from the context of a specific faith 
children lack fundamental values like honesty integrity 
tolerance loyalty and belief in human worth and dignity the 
national council of catholic bishops and the synagogue council of 
america said in a joint statement 
all of these values are grounded in our respective religious 
traditions the constitution the bill of rights much of the 
worlds great literature and ethical business practices the 
statement said 
the two groups said their unprecedented cooperative statement 
was prompted by a rash of problems besetting american youth from 
drug addiction depression suicide crime alienation and aids to 
academic failure emotional illness teen pregnancy alcoholism 
intolerance and violence 
in our society parents can use all the help they can get 
the rabbis and bishops said therefore it is urgent that there 
be a national effort to implement moral public education in our 
schools 
the religious leaders condemned what they called a growing 
reluctance to teach fundamental values in the public school system 
for fear of indoctrinating children with religious beliefs 
we are convinced that even apart from the context of a 
specific faith it is possible to teach these shared values they 
said 
the two groups made several recommendations 
state governors and legislators should create committees to 
promote values education in public schools 
public schools should introduce moral education into their 
curricula stressing basic civic and personal values 
all faiths should work together to bring about systemic change 
foundations should underwrite values education programs in 
public schools 
the media especially television should promote civic and 
personal values in their programming 
the two religious groups asked roman catholics and jews to begin 
a widespread dialogue about moral education in the public schools 
and said they would emphasize anew their commitment to moral values 
in their own educational institutions

the head of military intelligence in 
hungary says a former us military mans spying for the east bloc 
may have actually helped the cause of peace 
retired army sgt clyde lee conrad 43 was sentenced to life in 
prison this month by a west german court that found him guilty of 
passing secrets to hungary and czechoslovakia from 1975 through 
1985 in return for 12 million 
the trial judge in the case said conrad who was convicted of 
treason had endangered the entire defense capability of the 
west 
but brig gen janos kovacs who has headed hungarian military 
intelligence since october said the spying probably led to better 
eastwest ties because the information conrad produced made it 
clear nato was not planning to attack the soviet union or its 
allies 
kovacs said in an interview monday that this knowledge helped 
lead to a new approach to eastwest relations on the part of the 
warsaw pact 
the interesting paradox was that conrads information helped 
prove that there are no offensive nato plans and this led 
soberthinking people to reassess the situation and to develop a 
new approach he said 
the two military alliances the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the sovietled warsaw pact are now undergoing 
identity crises and discussing taking on a greater political role 
now that eastern europe has freed itself of soviet domination 
hungarian leaders have said they wish to quit the warsaw pacts 
military organization by the end of next year 
kovacs said that as far as he knows just one person istvan 
belovai is in jail in hungary for spying for the united states 
belovai is a former assistant military attache in the hungarian 
embassy in london 
the news magazine beszeloe carried an interview with belovai in 
its june 16 edutions that quoted him as saying he contacted the cia 
because he was shocked at the volume of nato secrets making their 
way to the soviets via hungarian intelligence sources 
belovai is due to serve another 15 years his espionage trial 
was secret and the magazine did not say when he was sentenced 
asked about the renegade cia agent edward lee howard who 
defected to the soviet union just a step ahead of the fbi and later 
moved to hungary kovacs said to the best of my knowledge 
howard left hungary in january 
he said he did not know where howard had gone us officials 
said late last year that they had been trying for months to 
persuade hungary to expel howard 
asked about roderick james ramsay arrested june 7 in tampa 
fla and charged with conspiracy to gather or deliver defense 
information to aid a foreign government kovacs said we knew 
nothing of ramsay 
ramsay 28 who allegedly worked directly under conrad could 
face a life sentence if convicted 
kovacs said hungary is seeking to put the cold war spy era 
behind it 
while conducting among other things intelligence activities 
we consider it vital to share information on terrorism narcotics 
traffic and on the transfer of biological chemical and nuclear 
weapons and their components he said

when nelson mandela visits the land of the free 
he might glimpse americas own racial inequities 
even africans from the blackdominated countries tend to be 
surprised at the level of prejudice and racism that still exists 
in the united states said linda williams a research fellow in 
race issues at harvard universitys kennedy school of government 
the south african antiapartheid activist who will be in new 
york from wednesday through friday will come away with a rather 
mixed feeling said daniel walkowitz director of new york 
universitys urban studies program 
there are strong signs of the ways in which blacks are 
integrated into american life and also the tragic irony of the 
way their situation has become polarized at the same time said 
walkowitz 
the national commission on children released a report in april 
that said the poverty rate in 1987 was 45 percent for black 
children 39 percent for hispanic children and 15 percent for white 
children 
a congressional study released in october found that black 
males age 15 to 19 die by homicide execution or as a result of 
police actions at the rate of 515 per 100000 white males in the 
same age group die at the rate of 86 per 100000 in the same 
circumstances it said 
saskia sassen director of urban planning at columbia 
university agreed that many black south africans despite their 
own complex struggle might be shocked if they saw what we 
see in the united states 
there is a growing physical separation of blacks and whites 
in this country said sassen part of it has to do with 
economy part of it with the housing market and part of it with 
racism 
sassen said 70 percent of the nations blacks live in the 100 
largest cities public schools for example in new york and 
chicago are increasingly all minority white public schools are in 
the suburbs sassen said we are creating two societies 
aids homelessness drug abuse poverty and broken homes also 
can spell hopelessness for innercity blacks 
the congressional study said that in 1988 less than 40 percent 
of black children lived with both parents compared with 79 percent 
of white children in 1980 the figures were 827 percent of white 
children and 422 percent of black children 
a january report in the new england journal of medicine said 
that partly because of a lack of basic health care the life 
expectancy of a male born and living in harlem is likely to be 
shorter than that of one born in bangladesh 
despite the problems we have a legal system that guarantees 
the rights of all people and that is an incredibly powerful tool 
its the crucial distinction from south africa said sassen 
williams noted that mandelas main goal is to garner support for 
blacks in south africa not to study american problems 
people should not expect him to be a leader for black 
america she said well have to have our own homegrown 
nelson mandelas symbolically he will raise the spirits of black 
america 
i think that we have had to a very great extent similarities 
with black americans in our struggle said walter sisulu 
internal leadership chairman of the african national congress who 
was imprisoned with mandela 
sisulu said from south africa that mandela will listen to issues 
concerning black americans while asking americans help for his own 
country 
we know conditions in some areas are quite poor he said 
no doubt they will derive inspiration from mr mandela 
mandelas new york visit in his first stop on an eightcity us 
tour his us stay is part of a sixweek tour of 14 nations in 
africa europe and north america that began june 6 
mandela 71 was freed from south african prison in february 
after serving 27 years of a life sentence for sabotage and plotting 
to overthrow the whiteminority government

president bush is prepared to veto a bill that 
guarantees parentalcare leave to workers even though as a 
candidate in 1988 he endorsed such time off in his appeal for a 
kinder gentler america 
the white house insisted monday that bushs position hasnt 
changed then as now he only supports such protection if it is 
voluntary for employers said presidential spokeswoman alixe glen 
he has always been opposed to the federal government dictating 
or mandating what every business in this country should do this 
particular bill would badly impact a lot of companies ms glen 
said 
at issue is legislation given final congressional approval last 
thursday that would guarantee workers as much as 12 weeks unpaid 
leave for childbirth adoption or serious family illnesses the 
measure would apply to all businesses with 50 or more employees 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush stands 
ready to cast the 13th veto of his presidency on the leave bill 
i wouldnt be surprised to see it this week he said 
the president has yet to have a veto overridden 
fitzwater said that as of monday the bill had not reached the 
white house but he indicated bush would deal with it swiftly once 
it arrives 
during his presidential campaign bush touched on the issue of 
parental care as he spoke to a republican womens group in 
rockford ill on sept 9 1988 
departing from his text thenvice president bush told the 
illinois federation of republican women look we also need to 
assure that women dont have to worry about getting their jobs back 
after having a child or caring for a child during serious illness 
bush did not elaborate at the time on whether the protection 
should be voluntary on the part of businesses 
when asked about bushs 1988 comment monday fitzwater said 
im not aware of what he said during the campaign i had not 
heard that before 
fitzwater was press secretary for thenpresident reagan 
throughout 1988 
the spokesman said bush opposes the present legislation because 
it is a federally mandated benefit and were opposed to 
federally mandated benefits 
ms glen who was a 1988 bush campaign aide and is now a deputy 
press secretary remembered bushs remarks but she said he did not 
mean to suggest at the time that he favored governmentmandated 
family leaves 
bush supports and encourages parental and medical leave 
policies that are designed to meet the needs of individual 
companies and employees she said 
she said that since taking office bush has urged businesses to 
adopt flexible parentalleave programs and has called on members of 
his cabinet to follow such policies in their own departments 
as an example ms glen cited a recent directive urging a 
liberal leave policy for federal employees who adopt a child 
the bill approved by congress last week reduces small business 
flexibility reduces us competiveness and really could undermine 
the current trend toward flexible policies she said

settlement of a 123yearold dispute between 
the united states and the soviet union over the maritime boundary 
in the bering sea is unlikely to prove a bonanza to the fishermen 
and oil drillers of either nation 
neither side can say they beat anybody out of anything says 
clement tillion an alaska commercial fisherman who is chairman of 
the american section of the international north pacific fisheries 
commission its a very nice agreement 
tillion and others said that for the fishermen of both countries 
the main benefit of the agreement signed with little fanfare 
during the recent ussoviet summit here will be that they now 
know for sure where the line is supposed to be 
for oilmen the effect will be less than for fishermen there 
are lots of fish in the bering sea but nobody has yet discovered 
any oil 
the dispute arose out of the negotiations that led to the us 
purchase of alaska from russia in 1867 the argument has revolved 
around whether the negotiators used a terrestrial globe or a 
mercator projection map 
theres a 60mile difference in the middle because of the 
distortion of the mercator projection tillion said in a recent 
interview we in effect split the difference 
a state department official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the boundary line did not become an issue until 
the 1970s when both sides claimed exclusive jurisdiction to 200 
miles offshore 
then they started bumping up against each other he said 
in the most recent of many incidents the coast guard seized a 
soviet fishing vessel on may 11 after authorities said it was 
caught with its nets in the water inside the us 200mile fishery 
limit 
now the fishermen can fish without threat of being harassed 
because of the uncertainty of the boundary line the state 
department official said 
tillion however cautioned against expecting that fishermen 
will no longer get in trouble by straying over the border 
commercial fishermen are larcenous he said 
as for oil it doesnt really make a lot of material 
difference said susan hall a spokeswoman for the minerals 
management service in the interior department we didnt lose or 
gain resourcewise by it 
the advantage of course is that it is settled ms hall 
said it does define beyond dispute a sort of western edge to our 
planning areas 
oil companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the early 
1980s on bering sea oil and gas exploration leases but discovered 
nothing they generally shied away from tracts inside the disputed 
area 
despite the agreement spokesman bill smith of exxon one of the 
leaders in the earlier bidding said the company had no plans at 
present for further bering sea exploration 
it is too early for us to say anything about it smith said 
we do not know what the effects will be 
the soviets conceded their rights to the united states in three 
areas within their 200mile zone and the united states made a 
similar concession regarding an area farther south within its zone 
the state department official said 
tillion said this gives the united states the right to manage 
the pollock fishery in the areas that it gains he said the soviet 
gains were smaller but on neither side did they amount to very 
much 
its almost a wash he said 
giorgi shchekochikhin a spokesman for the soviet embassy said 
the basic provisions of this treaty eliminate a problem between 
the two countries in the pacific 
in the past he said most official ussoviet dealings had 
been between the east coast of the united states and the western 
part of the soviet union 
with increasing contacts between siberia and alaska he said 
it is becoming of more major importance to have no more problems 
between our two countries at this point

inocencio muniz did not even wait until 
the police officer had returned to his patrol car before ignoring a 
warning not to drive until he sobered up 
munizs next warning about his right to remain silent and have 
an attorney did not come until after police videotaped him 
slurring his speech in response to questions about his age height 
and weight 
the supreme court ruled 81 monday that police did not violate 
the pennsylvania motorists rights by videotaping his answers to 
the routine questions and it ordered a lower court to consider 
reinstating his drunken driving conviction 
the decision along with a supreme court ruling in a michigan 
case last week that sobriety checkpoints do not violate motorists 
rights have strengthened police powers to curb drunken driving at 
what some civil liberatarians say is too high a price 
there seems to be the continued pattern of the high court 
cutting back on the rights we thought we enjoyed said stefan 
presser legal director of the pennsylvania american civil 
liberties union 
but sherry walker executive director of the pennsylvania 
chapter of mothers against drunk driving said the benefits of 
roadblocks and video cameras outweigh any inconvenience 
the decisions are the will of the majority of americans who 
are fed up with the senseless daily slaughter ms walker said 
in 1988 a total 23351 people died in drunken driving accidents 
muniz was arrested by upper allen township police in 1986 after 
an officer noticed munizs car stopped by the side of the road with 
the motor running 
the officer said he smelled alcohol on munizs breath and that 
the mans eyes were glazed and bloodshot the officer said he told 
muniz not to drive until he was in a condition to operate the car 
safely but muniz drove off anyway 
the patrolman pursued muniz ordered him to stop and told him to 
perform some sobriety tests muniz failed all the tests 
the officer took muniz to a police station where the motorist 
was videotaped answering questions about his name address height 
and other personal characteristics 
only after those responses was muniz read his rights 
muniz convicted previously of drunken driving was convicted 
again and sentenced to 45 days to 23 months in prison the supreme 
court action monday reversed a pennsylvania appeals court ruling 
that threw out the conviction 
justice william j brennan writing for the court said the 
judge who convicted muniz was entitled to hear the slurred manner 
in which muniz responded to the questions 
law enforcement officials applauded the decision 
it gives us a couple more tools to work with said upper 
allen township police chief richard hammon its not acceptable 
to drink and drive anymore and the court says here are a few more 
tools 
hammon said if a police officer reads a person their rights 
first they will quit talking 
presser said he worried the decision and the one allowing 
roadblocks restrict individual rights 
while it looks commonsensical to get these people off the 
road and we want drunks off the road roadblocks can be used for 
lots of purposes he said its unfortunate to go down this 
path no matter how much to the good it looks like at this moment

the number of farms growing tobacco in the 
united states is declining and an agriculture department analyst 
says the trend will probably continue 
in 1987 only 137000 farms produced tobacco an average of 46 
acres per farm that compared with 179000 farms and an average of 
52 acres in 1982 
the figures were reported in a new outlook report by verner n 
grise and thomas capehart of the departments economic research 
service the figures were based on the governments census of 
agriculture which is taken every five years 
going back further the report said the 137000 farms growing 
tobacco in 1987 represented a 73 percent drop from 512000 in 1954 
in north carolina the major fluecured state the drop was 85 
percent from 150000 to 22000 the report said 
consolidations occurred because of 1961 changes in the 
governments program that allowed the lease and transfer of closely 
guarded tobacco quotas within counties the report said that 
practice except under emergency conditions was abolished in 1987 
outright sales of quotas within counties were authorized in 
1982 also helping to speed consolidations the report said and 
there were a number of advances in technology and marketing that 
reduced labor requirements 
the number of producers in kentucky the major producer of 
burley tobacco declined but not as dramatically as in fluecured 
areas 
the decline in the number of burley producers has been slower 
because laborreducing technologies have not been adopted as 
rapidly the report said there has been little mechanization 
of the burley harvest and only since the late 1970s has it been 
sold looseleaf in bales 
in 1954 the report said 29 percent of the us farms that grew 
tobacco were in north carolina by 1987 that had dropped to 16 
percent because the number of grower plunged so steeply from 
150000 to 22000 
meanwhile 27 percent of farms that grew tobacco were in 
kentucky compared with 45 percent in 1987 reflecting a relative 
smaller decline in the number of producers 136000 to 62000 
similar changes occurred in the other fluecured and burley 
producing states the report said 
in 1987 the average of 46 acres of tobacco grown per farm was 
down from 52 in 1982 because of the large cutback in production 
during the fiveyear period the report said prior to that the 
average per farm showed steady growth from 1959 when it was 27 
acres 
still the averages tend to hide the diversity in tobacco 
growing the report said for example in 1987 average per farm 
varied from 16 in west virginia to 354 in connecticut 
the acreage varies by type of tobacco grown tenure 
arrangements topography technology competing crops and 
availability of labor the report said

a joint research project by the united states 
and soviet union will sent 14 scientists into the back country of 
siberia this summer to study climate changes 
the agriculture department said tuesday the team seven from 
each country then will collect similar information in the united 
states names of the scientists were not announced 
the project is sponsored by the departments forest service and 
moscows state forest committee officials said the objective is to 
gather information to assess the possible effects of climate change 
on forests 
the project is organized by the institute for resource 
management a nonprofit environmental organization founded by 
actor robert redford 
field research will be coordinated by the university of 
california at santa barbara under the direction of daniel b botkin 
and the soviet unions allunion scientific research center of the 
state forest committee directed by anatoly z shvidenko 
patricia kearney acting assistant secretary for natural 
resources and environment said in a statement the cooperative 
venture is a unique opportunity to work cooperatively with the 
soviet union toward improved management of natural resources 
kearney and terrell minger president of the institute are in 
moscow attending a climate change workshop to coordinate procedures

the once banned and hunted radio 
solidarity has finally taken to the airwaves legally 
on monday the radio station that operated underground for eight 
years began regular daily fm broadcasts to the warsaw region 
programming is to feature music and independent news reports 
at first the station is to broadcast 6 hours a day 
eventually it plans to have programming 20 hours a day the 
staterun pap news agency reported 
the station is a private company jointly owned by the foundation 
of radio solidarity an english company called radio trust the 
state radio committee and a british citizen ludomir lasocki all 
earnings from the station in its first three years are to be 
reinvested in the station 
the station had operated illegally from march 1982 until april 
28 1989 when it was permitted limited broadcasts on state radio 
channels as part of the agreement with thencommunist authorities 
to promote solidaritys electoral campaign 
the last such electoral broadcast was june 30 and the 
underground activists associated with radio solidarity immediately 
began planning for legal operation on a separate wavelength 
according to pap the selection of topics for broadcasts will 
depend largely on listeners with whom the station hopes to be in 
permanent contact 
radio solidarity was born four months after the december 1981 
martiallaw crackdown on solidarity it made brief clandestine 
broadcasts from time to time on various fm frequencies using hidden 
transmitters 
occasionally it would broadcast audio messages on the 
frequencies used by state television interrupting the official 
news 
it was constantly playing hideandseek with the police who 
with limited success would track the signal to seize the 
transmitters and broadcasters 
officials also learned to counter the broadcasts by jamming them 
with loud disco music

two inspections missed the crack in an engine 
rotor disk that led to the crash of a united air lines jetliner 
last summer and current inspections probably would fail too 
according to federal safety investigators 
one hundred twelve people out of 396 on board the dc10 died as 
a result of the crash during an emergency landing attempt at sioux 
city last july 19 
the national transportation safety board said monday the flaw 
that led to the crack might have been caught if a manufacturing 
inspection step using chemical etching had been done on the disk 
carrying engine fan blades in its final shape rather than an 
intermediate shape 
another inservice inspection should have caught the crack the 
board said and its not known why it didnt 
the new ultrasonic inspection routines ordered by the federal 
aviation administration last fall are inadequate to detect these 
potentially critical cracks the board said in a letter to the 
faa these methods detect cracks by passing highfrequency sound 
waves through the materials 
the board called on the faa to require the chemical etching 
inspection during manufacturing on the final instead of an 
intermediate part shape and called for the agency to substitute 
another inspection method such as electrical eddy current testing 
for the inservice ultrasonic methods it ordered last fall 
computer modeling by the manufacturer has shown that using one 
ultrasonic method such surface cracks could propagate from a 
size just below the level of detectability to a critical size in 
significantly fewer than 500 flights and the second ultrasonic 
method ordered may be no better at spotting subsurface cracks the 
board said 
before the crash there was no federal requirement for 
inspecting the part in question but the manufacturers 
specifications called for airlines to look for surface cracks in 
ultraviolet light after a special wash every time the engine was 
disassembled 
such a test was performed 760 flights before the crash and the 
engine passed the safety boards investigation has revealed 
evidence suggesting that at the time of this fluorescent penetrant 
inspection the crack was of detectable size the safety board 
has not yet determined if the crack was not detected because of an 
inadequate inspection method an inadequate application of that 
method or a combination of both the board wrote 
it did not discuss what this evidence is 
in another recommendation the board also called on the faa to 
adopt for engines the assumption now used for aircraft structures 
when calculating inspection intervals not that the part is 
flawless originally but that it contains a flaw just below the 
level of detectability 
there were 227 general electric co cf66 engines in service on 
early models of the dc10 containing rotor disks made from a 
process changed in 1971 six made from the same ingot of titanium 
were removed from service and regular ultrasonic inspections 
ordered for the rest made from different ingots 
the middle tailmounted engine of the three on the dc10 
exploded in flight after a fatigue crack on the inner bore hole in 
the doughnut surface of the rotor grew so large that it came apart 
while rapidly rotating it was the first time such a disk had 
disintegrated 
the shrapnellike pieces of the engine severed all hydraulic 
lines to the planes control surfaces leaving the aircraft almost 
impossible to control and forcing the pilots to try to bring it to 
the ground by varying the power on the two remaining wingmounted 
engines 
the aircraft manufacturer mcdonnelldouglas corp has added 
valves to the hydraulic system to keep some fluid in the lines and 
at least some controllability in such an accident

the food and drug administration is putting 
out the word that some models of a device designed to warn parents

said those who suffer from apnea temporarily stop breathing during 
sleep 
the models involved are re134b and monatherm respirate for 
those older than 4 years old and models re134c and re134d for 
infants 
some models may fail to signal an alarm the fda said in 
issuing a firstclass alert its most serious health warning the 
agency said the problem is with a defective time delay switch 
fda said the company was recalling the 1583 monitors it 
distributed sixty percent went to hospitals and the rest were sent

most cities would shun the name 
ghost town campbelltown embraces it wholeheartedly 
the city of 140000 people is growing briskly but it would like 
to see a few more tourists from sydney about 25 miles to the 
northeast 
so officials are investing 200000 to build a special monument 
to the citys most famous resident fishers ghost 
we want to be known as the liveliest ghost town in the south 
hemisphere alderman john hennessey one of the projects 
backers said today 
campbelltown already has a 32yearold fishers ghosts festival 
two weeks each november as many as 50000 people attend the annual 
parade 
now comes the 20foot glass monument which will contain 60 tons 
of glass in about 480 sheets it will feature special lighting at 
night and fog machines to enhance the supernatural effect 
fred fisher was a former convict who by 1826 was a wealthy 
farmer and builder he stabbed a man during a fight and expecting 
a long jail term gave powerofattorney over his considerable 
holdings to his neighbor an exconvict named george worrall 
on the evening of june 17 1826 fisher disappeared worrall 
said he had sailed for england but officials got suspicious when 
worrall started selling off fishers possessions 
this is where legend and historians diverge 
according to legend a farmer named john farley spotted the 
ghost while walking home one night after a stint at the local pub 
farley is said to have sparked the murder investigation after 
seeing the ghost sitting on a bridge railing pointing a finger 
upstream where fishers body was found 
but carol liston author of campbelltowns bicentennial history 
says in her official version that two boys found bloodstains a 
lock of hair and a tooth on a fence on worralls farm a tracker 
then discovered fishers remains in a shallow grave 
whatever the truth worrall was tried and convicted for murder 
then confessed on the gallows before he was hung 
hennessey said fishers ghost has been seen at least four times 
since the farmers murder including once 20 years ago on the 
anniversary of the death when many in a crowd of 20000 claimed to 
have spotted the specter

nelson mandela says south africa is on the 
threshold of major change in its racial policies but that the 
final stages of the struggle against apartheid may prove to be the 
most difficult 
as the black nationalist leader addressed a rally outside 
ontarios provincial legislature in toronto many people stood with 
their right fists raised and interrupted his speech with cries of 
mandela and freedom 
mandela who arrived in the canadian capital of ottawa on 
sunday was flying to montreal today on wednesday he is to travel 
to new york to begin an eightcity us tour 
the 71yearold african national congress leader appeared strong 
and fit as he addressed the rally monday but he canceled an 
afternoon speech at torontos city hall citing fatigue 
his wife winnie instead attended for him 
we are on the threshold of major change in south africa he 
told the crowd we are confident that victory is in sight but as 
in a steeplechase race the last hurdles are the most difficult to 
jump 
earlier monday mandela addressed canadas parliament and called 
for maintaining economic sanctions against south africa to ensure 
that reforms continue 
any move at this stage toward lifting or lessening 
international pressure would create a situation in which the white 
minority would feel comfortable with the minimal changes which have 
taken place mandela told a joint session of the house of commons 
and the senate 
canada imposed economic and political sanctions on south africa 
in 1986 like many other countries it has pledged to maintain the 
bans until there is clear evidence of irreversible change in the 
apartheid system of racial segregation 
president fw de klerk of south africa has argued that the 
reforms show that his country is changing and he has urged foreign 
countries to lift economic sanctions 
in his speech mandela paid tribute to black south africans who 
during years of oppression met torture without flinching and 
met the hangmans noose with songs of freedom 
he was interrupted several times by applause and received a long 
standing ovation from lawmakers 
mandela is in the midst of a sixweek tour of 14 nations in 
africa europe and north america that began june 6 he was freed 
from prison in february after serving 27 years of a life sentence 
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whiteminority 
government 
his release was part of a program of social reforms by the de 
klerk government including legalizing the anc and other 
antiapartheid groups 
de klerk has also opened talks with black groups on giving a 
political voice to the countrys 28 million blacks south africas 
5 million whites control the government and economy 
at a dinner speech at a glitzy toronto hotel mandela told a 
mostly white audience that whites are not the enemy in the fight 
against apartheid 
we are facing a common front not against whites but against 
racial oppression he said to resounding applause

an east german church has filed a lawsuit 
demanding the return of medieval artwork believed stolen by an 
american officer in the final days of world war ii 
after hearing oral arguments by telephone monday us district 
judge sidney a fitzwater barred movement of the church treasures 
without a court order 
fitzwater also ordered that representatives of the lutheran 
cathedral in quedlinburg be allowed to inventory the cache the 
artwork is believed to be held in a bank in whitewright a town of 
1760 about 60 miles north of dallas 
the church hopes to recover 15 treasures that had been hidden in 
a mineshaft during the war the treasures disappeared in 1945 
shortly after american forces occupied the medieval castle town 
among the treasures said thomas r kline the lawyer who filed 
the lawsuit are a rock crystal flask of byzantine origin a wooden 
box decorated with silver gold ivory and precious stones dating 
from the 9th or 10th century and containing relics of henry i and 
two manuscripts one from about 1300 and the other from 1515 bound 
in precious metals and encrusted with gems 
joe t meador a former army lieutenant who was among the us 
troops who entered quedlinburg in april 1945 is believed to have 
stolen the artifacts 
after he died of cancer in 1980 his brother and sister jack 
meador of whitewright and jane meador cook of mesquite obtained 
the treasures and stored at least some in a vault at the first 
national bank the dallas morning news said today 
they apparently sold at least two of the pieces the bejeweled 
illuminated manuscripts the newspaper said 
a secretary for jack meador told the associated press on monday 
night that meador had no comment on the lawsuit mrs cook also 
declined to comment 
an affidavit filed with the lawsuit said a church representative 
had met with bank president john farley to demand the treasures 
farley confirmed that some of the artifacts are at his bank the 
new york times reported today 
farley said he first saw the artworks in 1986 when a customer 
of the bank brought me two manuscripts to have appraised he 
would not reveal the customers name or disclose the number of 
artworks stored in the bank 
ely maurer a state department assistant legal adviser for 
cultural property said the lawsuit was filed primarily because 
negotiations for return of the collection reached an impasse during 
the weekend 
an unidentified fbi agent was quoted by the morning news as 
saying it was unclear whether charges could be brought in the case 
he said that the statute of limitations for interstate 
transportation of stolen property is five years and that 
international treaties governing theft of art and antiquities have 
a 30year statute of limitations 
maurer said charges might be pursued under the national stolen 
property act a statute prohibiting interstate or international 
transport of stolen art 
the law would extend to heirs who knowingly transferred the 
property across state lines maurer said the fact that they 
moved some of the artworks as recently as this year might make the 
statute apply 
he said there is evidence the family knew for some time that the 
art was stolen

president corazon aquino has turned 
to a formula once used by her discredited predecessor in order to 
revive the people power spirit that propelled her to office 
last week mrs aquino unveiled plans for a nationwide movement 
to channel government private business and volunteer organizations 
to deliver basic services and improve lives of millions of 
impoverished filipinos 
the plan is to bypass traditional politicians in congress 
and the bureaucracy those institutions have blocked many of the 
grandiose plans for reform promised but not delivered by the 
4yearold aquino government 
for the movement mrs aquino chose the name kabisig a 
tagalog word for people locked arminarm she cited the spirit 
of the 1986 uprising against ferdinand marcos when hundreds of 
thousands of filipinos stood arminarm to block tanks seeking to 
crush a military mutiny against the late president 
were fasttracking all of corys priorities said transport 
secretary oscar orbos a former congressman and leading figure in 
kabisig 
the roman catholic magazine veritas said kabisig was 
designed to circumvent traditional centers of power and the 
sluggish energy and timeconsuming bureaucracy grown fat and 
complacent with inaction 
mrs aquino hopes to bring into the movement the social activist 
groups human rights organizations and labor federations that stood 
at the forefront of the struggle against marcos those groups have 
been largely disillusioned with mrs aquinos failure to institute 
reforms after the people power revolution 
at the same time the kabisig movement has drawn fire from 
proaquino politicians 
there were statements in corys speech which made me feel 
insecure forlorn dejected and rejected said sen rene 
saguisag a former human rights lawyer and one of mrs aquinos 
most loyal senate supporters 
saguisag said the president appeared to be seeking a 
rubberstamp legislature 
another proaquino senator wigberto tanada pointed out that 
marcos himself used the term kabisig to describe an 
organization he set up in 1985 to muster political support 
use of socalled nonpolitical mass movements is a 
timetested formula for bypassing established parties after 
declaring martial law in 1972 marcos banned political parties 
then organized various grassroots organizations ostensibly to 
invigorate and transform philippine society 
his most successful venture was the new society movement which 
evolved into a megaparty similar to the largely defunct communist 
organizations that once held sway in eastern europe 
for years mrs aquino has excused the shortcomings of her 
administration by claiming that inefficiency was the price of 
democracy after 20 years of marcos tyranny 
she pointed proudly to her new constitution and elected 
bicameral legislature as examples of her restored democracy 
ironically at a time when surveys show her popularity declining 
mrs aquino is now bypassing those institutions to deliver reforms 
she already has the entire government machinery at her beck 
and call wrote columnist emil jurado in the manila standard 
what reason would she havefor depending on cory loyalists and 
nongovernment organizations for the survival of her 
administration isnt she admitting that her administration is a 
failure 
political analysts cite the controversy over land reform as a 
watershed in mrs aquinos political strategy 
as social activists had predicted congress watered down 
legislation establishing the land reform program in april 
congressmen blocked confirmation of her agrarian reform secretary 
florencio abad because of his antilandlord views 
kabisig is calculated to save the elite from itself yank 
itout of high living and make it smell the poverty until it 
hurts wrote former presidential spokesman teodoro benigno in the 
philippine star she knows that if she heads in the same old 
direction with the traditional politicians her administration is 
due for a train crash

a man who shot and killed a policeman trying 
to arrest him for a double murder said he held no grudges 
before being put to death in the electric chair in arkansas first 
execution in 26 years 
john edward swindler 46 was pronounced dead at 905 pm 
monday three minutes after being given 2300 volts of electricit 
in the big oak chair 
arkansas became the 14th state to carry out an execution and 
swindler the 130th inmate put to death since the us supreme court 
in 1976 let states resume use of capital punishment 
swindler was condemned for the 1976 murder of fort smith 
policeman randy basnett who was shot at a gas station while trying 
to arrest swindler for two murders in south carolina swindler was 
later convicted of those slayings as well 
the us supreme court denied a stay of execution on saturday 
in final remarks dictated in his cell to roman catholic 
monsignor john odonnell swindler said i have no animosity 
toward anyone no grudges 
i hope this brings to light the injustice of capital 
punishment and the need to abolish it he said 
swindlers body was to be turned over to odonnell for 
cremation swindlers family didnt want the body 
he has professed that he believes in satan and i hope he gets 
to see him real soon his brother robert e swindler of 
lexington sc said recently 
the last person executed in arkansas was charles franklin 
fields who was electrocuted in 1964 for rape r gene simmons 
convicted of killing 16 people including 14 family members is 
scheduled to be die monday by injection 
because swindler was sentenced before arkansas changed its 
method of execution from electrocution to injection he was given a 
choice of either method he left the choice up to authorities who 
selected the method specified in his sentence 
shanon howard the daughter of basnetts widow cindy said 
after the execution all i can say is justice has been done 
this is randy basnetts day said randy manus who was 
selected as a witness to the execution 
a handful of demonstrators for and against the death penalty 
gathered outside the prison as the execution approached including 
several members of the fort smith police department some in 
tshirts decorated with a lightning bolt and the slogan turn out 
the lights the partys over john swindler 1990 
some of those opposed to the death penalty sang amazing 
grace 
when told of swindlers death several police officers cheered 
grinned shook one anothers hands one broke into song 
on sunday about 50 members of amnesty international held a 
26minute vigil commemorating 26 years without an execution in the 
state 
the human rights group implored gov bill clinton not to end 
the decency of the past 26 years by reinstituting this brutish form 
of violence

guatemala honduras costa rica and panama a day after a central 
american summit produced a sweeping plan for regional economic 
integration and development 
central america is poised as never before to consolidate 
democracy and achieve lasting peace and disarmament and create 
conditions for growth and opportunity in which all of the peoples 
of this region particularly the poor can share he said 
one of the presidents concerns going into the summit was 
whether the region would lose out to eastern europe in its bid for 
international assistance baker said that would not happen 
thats why we are exploring with japan the european 
community canada and other industrialized democracies ways to give 
more support to democracy and development in central america he 
said 
baker outlined plans for coordinating aid trade and investment 
during a twohour breakfast with the presidents he also met 
privately with each one 
im here today at the request of president bush to make it 
very clear that the us will continue to be fully engaged to be 
fully supportive of this regional peace process baker told a 
news conference afterward 
the central american economic accord grew out of the nobel 
prizewinning regional peace plan signed in 1987 
the idea baker broached is based on the program adopted by 24 
western nations to help poland and hungary nurture freemarket 
systems and democratic institutions baker said it was favorably 
received 
honduran president rafael callejas estimated that central 
america will need 25 billion in aid over three years to 
revitalize its economies but said the presidents did not discuss 
specifics with baker 
we didnt talk about sums or structures he told a joint 
presidential news conference 
central american officials have expressed two main concerns 
about the program who would run it and whether the net effect 
will be less us aid 
they also made it clear they need and welcome help but on 
their own terms 
we are going to decide what we want when we want it under 
what conditions and with whom said nicaraguan foreign minister 
enrique dreyfus 
guatemalan president vinicio cerezo said baker assured the 
presidents he thinks central americans should have a strong say in 
aid matters 
on sunday the presidents of el salvador nicaragua honduras 
guatemala and costa rica all elected civilians signed accords 
for joint action on ending the poverty and underdevelopment that 
fueled war and revolution in the region for more than a decade 
the accords call for the creation of a central american economic 
community 
attending the meetings as an observer was president guillermo 
endara of panama which considers itself part of south america due 
to its former ties to colombia but is thinking of joining the 
central american economic community 
the threeday antigua meeting was the eighth central american 
summit but the first to deal almost exclusively with economic 
issues seven earlier summits focused on the search for peace 
the 1987 regional peace plan authored by former costa rican 
president oscar arias managed to bring about an end to the civil 
war in nicaragua and the february elections in which the leftist 
sandinistas were defeated 
the sandinistas were succeeded by the coalition government of 
president violeta barrios de chamorro 
the peace plan was also the catalyst for talks now under way 
between the governments of el salvador and guatemala and leftist 
rebels in these two countries

close of 15388 yen it opened at 15345 yen and ranged between

the 225share nikkei stock average shed 33642 points or 104 
percent from mondays close ending the day at 3204038 
traders attributed the nikkei indexs decline to an increase in 
us interest rates and a big drop in the dow jones industrial 
average in new york overnight 
higher interest rates tends to discourage stock investment 
a rise in the us interest rate largely discouraged investors 
here because they have been expecting the opposite movement out of 
their expectation for the slowdown in the us economy said 
masahiro umemori an analyst with nomura securities co 
he said the index started recovering at midmorning as market 
players were reassured by the relative stability of the japanese 
bond market 
the price of the benchmark no 119 10year japanese government 
bond slipped to 8758 points from mondays close of 8765 boosting 
the yield to 706 percent from 7045 percent

dutch police arrested a fourth 
suspected irish republican army terrorist early today after a 
manhunt involving more than 135 officers with dogs and helicopters 
police said 
the suspect was found hiding in a forest and surrendered without 
a struggle nine hours after fleeing a police identity check said 
dutch national police spokesman henk ketelaar 
britains press association quoted belgian police as saying the 
man was paul hughes 26 of county down northern ireland 
ketelaar would only give his initials pmh in line with 
dutch police practice and say he is an ira member 
police have declined to comment on dutch press reports that the 
four belong to the ira group believed responsible for the may 28 
shooting deaths of two australian tourists in the southern dutch 
city of roermond 
the ira later said it tragically mistook the two australians 
for british soldiers 
the string of events leading to todays arrest began saturday 
when belgian police arrested an ira suspect identified as donna 
maguire the womans two companions escaped police custody and fled 
across the virtually unguarded dutchbelgian border 
one was arrested hours later in the netherlands while the other 
was spotted roaming around this border village monday still 
wearing belgian police handcuffs 
approximately 20 minutes after the arrest of the handcuffed man 
police saw a britishregistered car driving down the same village 
street and ordered it to stop the cars driver accelerated at high 
speed immediately after being asked to show his papers and the car 
was later found abandoned in a nearby forest 
police sealed off the entire village and deployed helicopters 
and tracker dogs to search for the driver of what they believed to 
be the handcuffed mans getaway car 
at about 145 am today the man was spotted hiding behind a 
tree by a police dog and surrendered he was not armed ketelaar 
said 
police have identified the other two apprehended ira suspects as 
gerard majella harte 27 of northern ireland and a man known only 
by his alias andrew edward thornton 
the outlawed ira which seeks to end british rule over northern 
ireland and unite the province with the irish republic has waged a 
decadeslong bombing and shooting campaign against british targets 
in northern ireland britain and the european continent

even before he takes office presidentelect 
alberto fujimori is staking his power and prestige on a highstakes 
quest for international aid 
the political neophyte sets off this weekend for the united 
states japan and south korea on a trip that represents a dramatic 
turnabout for peru 
outgoing president alan garcia turned his back on the 
international financial community fujimori who takes office july 
28 wants to bring peru back into the fold 
the presidenttobe has a powerful motivation for his effort 
the peru he will inherit is bankrupt battered by 2000 percent 
annual inflation thousands of peruvians are on strike and four in 
five lack steady work a 10year guerrilla war has claimed more 
than 18500 lives 
if fujimori succeeds it wont be the first time hes overcome 
long odds 
his landslide win over famed novelist mario vargas llosa in the 
june 10 runoff election capped a comefrombehind campaign as 
perus 86th president he will join the small minority of 
democratically elected leaders in the countrys 169year history 
since independence 
analysts say the survival of perus latest 10yearold stint of 
democracy likely hinges on fujimori a restless military is ready 
to intervene if the government proves unable to keep peru from 
falling into chaos they say 
in washington where his 12day tour will start june 25 
fujimori is to meet officials of the international monetary fund 
the world bank and the interamerican development bank 
it may be something of a fencemending mission 
garcia upon coming to power in 1985 limited payment on the 
nations 20 billion foreign debt to 10 percent of export earnings 
shortly afterward peru stopped payment altogether 
in the first third of this year alone peru missed 16 billion 
in payments to international lending institutions the amount 
overdue to private banks is believed to be even higher 
fujimori will travel next to japan which has said it is willing 
to resume loans to peru if the country shows a willingness to deal 
with its serious social and economic problems 
fujimoris japanese ancestry has raised hopes of greater access 
to japanese aid peru was the largest recipient of japanese aid in 
latin america in cumulative terms until 1988 but dropped to 
fourthlargest after it defaulted on payments and japan cut off its 
yen credits 
one official in japans foreign ministry said peru owes japan an 
estimated 1 billion in government and private debts 
garcia contended in a recent interview that peruvian democracy 
has survived because he resisted the austerity measures recommended 
by the perus creditors but many believe perus economy cannot 
survive much longer without the drastic measures advocated by 
vargas llosa 
inflation in the first two weeks of june alone was 25 percent 
central bank reserves stand at 900 million mostly in gold and 
silver liquid reserves are 134 million enough to pay for less 
than two months of imports 
during the campaign fujimori played on worries about vargas 
llosas plans for economic shock treatment and cultivated poor 
indigenous peruvians who associated the novelist with the 
europeandescended elite 
he said the economy could recover with gradual measures but 
never fully explained what those would be 
vargas llosa planned to privatize most of the chronically 
inefficient public enterprises and cut the bloated bureaucracy 
but in a country where 40 percent of the population lives in 
extreme poverty vargas llosas proposals raised the specter of 
greater suffering fujimori was the beneficiary of those fears 
in order to get anything accomplished fujimoris government 
will have to court support from other parties but garcias 
leftleaning aprista party opposes austerity measures and fredemo 
the centerright coalition that supported vargas llosa is still 
feeling the sting of defeat 
an aprista leader speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
expects serious instability if fujimori fails to forge a broad 
consensus in six months or less 
since fujimori is a newcomer in peruvian politics he has no 
links to traditional parties and no established base of support 
but analysts say he may be able to turn that lack of political 
connections into an asset when its time to compromise a time 
that could come soon

the purdy school board has reinstated a ban on 
school dances after winning a fouryear battle that reached the 
supreme court 
the board wants to go back to the business of running a good 
school and have some quiet board attorney ransom ellis iii said 
monday 
in 1986 21 students and parents sued to overturn the ban 
claiming it was imposed for religious reasons and thus violated 
separation of church and state 
the board in the town of about 1000 argued dances might lead to 
drinking and discipline problems 
the supreme court in april upheld the centuryold ban by 
agreeing with an appeals court that the rule was not motivated by 
religious beliefs 
ellis said the dance ban was never taken off the books but had 
been suspended while the case worked its way to the supreme court 
tonights vote reinstates the old rule he said

three people hijacked a soviet airliner 
on a domestic flight today and the plane landed in helsinki where 
it was surrounded by police and negotiations began finnish air 
authorities said 
the twinjet tupolev 154 with 54 passengers and five crew 
aboard had been flying from the latvian capital riga to murmansk 
on the northern kola peninsula when it was hijacked said irmeli 
paavola of the finnish aviation authority 
the three hijackers had demanded to be flown to stockholm 
according to spokeswoman malin engstedt of the rescue service at 
arlanda airport outside the swedish capital 
instead the plane touched down at vanda airport outside the 
finnish capital shortly before 11 am and taxied to the side of a 
runway witnesses said it was surrounded by police 
in stockholm the swedish national news agency tt quoted finnish 
aviation officials as saying the hijackers had threatened to blow 
up the plane during negotiations with finnish authorities 
the agency said negotiations were hampered because the hijackers 
spoke only russian details were not immediately available on the 
hijackers demands 
it was the second hijacking in 10 days of a soviet airliner on a 
domestic flight on june 9 dimitry semionov a 17yearold soviet 
youth hijacked a plane with 114 passengers during a flight from 
minsk to murmansk 
the plane was forced to fly to stockholm where semionov 
surrendered he said later through a lawyer that he had acted on 
impulse after a family quarrel and wanted to go to a free 
country 
semionov was arraigned in a stockholm court and could face up to 
four years in prison depending on results of psychiatric tests

a new infrared device that measures a cars 
exhaust from the side of the road as the vehicle drives past may 
someday replace state testing programs in which emissions are 
collected from the tailpipe of an idling auto 
in a test in illinois the device showed that 8 percent of 
chicagos autos produce about half the citys carbon monoxide 
pollution and that relatively new vehicles as well as old clunkers 
are among the worst polluters 
in nevada the environmental protection agency concluded that 
the device called feat for fuel efficiency automobile test was an 
accurate tool 
some officials believe the device invented three years ago by 
university of denver chemistry professor donald h stedman could 
streamline emissions testing and improve pollution control 
further down the road the ultimate goal is to identify 
precisely that relatively small percentage and require them to come 
in for inspection and maintenance rather than requiring everyone 
said bill denham of the illinois department of energy and natural 
resources 
in the conventional testing station the emissions are collected 
from the tailpipe 
with feat the infrared beam source and the detector are placed 
on opposite sides of a road and take their reading as the car 
passes stedman said monday a computer calculates the emissions 
and a camera snaps a picture of the license plate to determine the 
vehicles age 
he said the feat can measure 1000 cars an hour in contrast 
illinois testing stations typically check 17 vehicles per hour 
said james matheny of the illinois environmental protection 
agencys vehicle emission testing program 
marc pitchford who was in charge of testing the device for the 
epa in nevada said roadside testing would save illinois 12 
million a year on its emissions program which state officials put 
at 21 million to 23 million 
stedman said hydrocarbon pollution would be reduced by catching 
cars that pollute sooner he said many drivers tamper with their 
cars to pass annual emissions tests 
but the feat has its skeptics 
matheny said little research exists on how many sensors would be 
needed and on where to locate them for thorough testing 
and steven cadle a research scientist for general motors who 
developed a test similar to stedmans said the roadside tests 
assume an autos output remains constant 
i would not feel comfortable writing that person a ticket

the state and us governments have filed a 
lawsuit that accuses eight companies of toxic dumping in california 
waters and takes the unusual step of trying to force industry to 
return the area to the way it was 
the lawsuit filed monday in federal court contends the 
companies dumped hundreds of tons of such chemicals as ddt and pcbs 
since the mid1940s harming fisheries and births of the bald 
eagle peregrine falcon and sea lion 
lawyers called the lawsuit unique 
in the past the state recovered funds for cleanup of ocean 
dumping but theres never been an attempt to collect money to 
restore the marine habitat said michael r valentine an 
attorney for the state lands commission 
targets of the lawsuit are montrose chemical corp atkemix 37 
inc stauffer management co ici american holdings inc 
chriscraft industries inc westinghouse electric corp potlatch 
corp and simpson paper co 
state attorney general john van de kamp said the damages could 
run in the millions of dollars 
we are encouraging these polluters to accept the 
responsibility to clean up the contamination and to restore the 
marine environment for future generations said van de kamp 
the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration also 
joined the state in the lawsuit 
simpson spokeswoman maureen frisch said she knew nothing about 
the lawsuit 
officials for the other companies could not be reached in calls 
made after business hours 
the lawsuit seeks restoration of an approximately 20mile 
stretch of coast from the northern tip of santa monica bay south to 
palos verdes 
it was filed under the 1980 superfund law and the 1972 clean 
water act 
under the reagan administration the superfund law was 
restricted to human health concerns it could not be invoked in 
cases of damage to natural resources the bush administration 
however restored 25 million to pursue litigation that would 
force polluters to restore land and wildlife

nelson mandela is drawing huge 
crowds and garnering accolades at every stop on his international 
tour but at home the reaction ranges from indifference to 
criticism 
teacher strikes in black schools the african national congress 
rivalry with other black groups and even the troubled marriage of 
a black pop singer have all been judged more interesting by the 
editors of the sowetan the largest black daily newspaper 
the sowetan based in the soweto township where mandela lives 
generally gives close coverage to his activities but it has not 
published a frontpage story or picture of his trip since he left 
south africa on june 4 
mandela begins an eightcity us visit on wednesday when he 
will arrive in new york 
mandelas repeated calls for continued economic sanctions 
against south africa have drawn criticism from another leading 
black newspaper one that traditionally backs the anc 
sanctions cannot be prolonged any longer city press said in 
an editorial sunday we do not want to inherit a wasteland 
the newspaper south africas largest black weekly argued that 
it might be time for a policy reassessment by the anc in the 
light of the governments reform policy has the time not come for 
the anc to review the use of sanctions as a strategy to end 
apartheid 
mandela released feb 11 after more than 27 years in prison 
has received almost daily coverage in whiteoriented newspapers and 
governmentrun television 
most of the reports have focused on the sanctions issue and what 
the publications perceive as uncritical adulation of the anc leader 
we do not begrudge the americans their right to fete him 
said the citizen a progovernment daily but we do feel they 
should welcome mr mandela the man rather than mr mandela the 
legend the god the new christ 
many south africans both black and white believe the 
countrys political and racial conflicts are largely internal 
matters that will be decided by south africans rather than 
outsiders 
that may be the reason that reports about foreigners response 
to mandelas message has drawn little interest in the country 
during mandelas absence from south africa however his 
organization appears to have put some major decisions on hold 
midlevel government officials and anc members last month 
produced a joint plan designed to clear the way for blackwhite 
negotiations on a new constitution and ending apartheid 
de klerk said the government has accepted the plan and is ready 
to implement it the anc has asked to wait until july 10 before 
responding mandela is due back in late july 
de klerk lifted the state of emergency in most of the country 
june 8 
we are on the threshold of the real negotiation process 
the anc must now stop vacillating he said then

the parents of an illinois man kidnapped 
while working for a mining company have arrived in ecuador to try 
to win his freedom 
roy and marge heimdal of peoria ill were met by us embassy 
officials on their arrival monday at quitos international airport 
the heimdals refused to talk with reporters about the kidnapping 
of their 27yearold son scott but before boarding a plane in 
chicago mrs heimdal said im not coming back without my son 
meanwhile court sources in quito said heimdals supervisor had 
filed legal papers suggesting a disgruntled former employee of the 
iminco mining company may be responsible for the april 28 
kidnapping 
for weeks officials have been saying the kidnapping was the 
work of communist guerrillas 
heimdal was kidnapped while traveling on the bermeja river in 
the jungle near ecuadors border with colombia he was working for 
iminco dredging river bottoms for gold deposits 
officials say a band of armed men attacked his boat killed the 
pilot and took heimdal and an ecuadoran student hostage the 
student was later released with a ransom demand 
the heimdals a workingclass family gathered 60000 in 
community donations that they believed to be the ransom demand but 
to their dismay the kidnappers said last week that they were 
demanding 612000 
on thursday the heimdals made public a fourpage letter from 
their son in the letter he said he was being moved daily in the 
colombian jungle and surviving on armadillo and monkey meat 
the letter said the kidnappers became angry and believed the 
family to be rich after seeing a television report last week about 
the fundraising in peoria 
us embassy officials had said earlier they were concerned that 
the wide publicity the kidnapping has received could complicate 
negotiations to win heimdals freedom and might jeopardize his life 
the court sources in quito told the associated press that 
jeffrey fino imincos general manager filed a written accusation 
with police on may 1 suggesting a former employee may have 
instigated the kidnapping 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
documents accuse the man who had a contract with iminco for 
transporting mining equipment to the jungle area had threatened 
fino 
fino who is representing the heimdal family in the kidnapping 
negotiations was not available monday to comment since last week 
he has not gone to his office according to his secretary 
in an interview last week fino said he was beginning to fear 
the kidnappers were bandits not guerrillas 
the kidnappers have identified themselves as members of the 
peoples libertion army a communist guerrilla group from colombia

government troops today shot their way 
into an east coast town that had been in tamil rebel hands and were 
sweeping it for mines and booby traps military officials said 
batticaloa 140 miles northeast of colombo in this indian ocean 
island nation has been a flashpoint in recent fighting in the war 
that has grown out of bitter ethnic rivalries 
troops moved in from a nearby airstrip and military camp the 
officials said speaking on condition of anonymity 
tamil rebels withdrew from the town on monday into the 
surrounding jungles to continue fighting military officials said 
law and order in the town had broken down and that looting of 
stores was widespread 
also today government forces overran tamil rebel positions in 
the east and repulsed an attack on an army garrison in the north 
officials said 
the army used helicopter gunships and repeated machinegun fire 
to stave off an early morning attack by rebels on the jaffna 
military garrison said military officials who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
jaffna 190 miles north of colombo is headquarters to the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam the main rebel milita 
the officials said the rebels used bulldozers and heavy 
earthmoving equipment in their bid to seize the 200yearold dutch 
fort where the garrison is located about 150 soldiers were in the 
garrison at the time they said 
in the east government police commandos overran two rebel camps 
and freed 75 people who had been held captive the officials said 
eightdayold rebel sieges of two military camps near the town of 
batticaloa were broken when army reinforcements crossed swamps and 
jungles to reach the area they said 
there were no details of casualties in the latest fighting but 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne said monday that 600 
rebels had been killed since june 11 he did not speak of 
government casualties 
in addition at least 378 people are reported to have been 
killed the figure includes at least 137 unarmed policemen said to 
have been massacred by the rebels the death toll was compiled from 
reports by witnesses military officials and rebel sources 
the fighting began june 10 after tiger rebels overran police 
stations in the tamildominated northern and eastern provinces 
ending a yearlong ceasefire with security forces 
two further attempts during the week to stop the fighting broke 
down 
tamil rebels have been fighting for an independent nation since 
1983 claiming their minority community is being discriminated 
against by the sinhalese who control the army and the government 
in may 1989 the rebels agreed to a ceasefire with the 
government 
ten months later indian peacekeeping soldiers who had tried in 
vain to disarm the rebels over 32 months withdrew from sri lanka 
that left the rebels in control of most major towns in the north 
and east 
at least 11000 people including 1100 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the war 
the government and the rebels began talks on the political 
future of the regions but the talks had not made much headway 
before the fighting resumed 
tamils make up 18 percent of the islands 16 million people and 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent

the leader of the rebel delegation 
to liberian peace talks has rejected the governments offer of a 
general amnesty that would let the insurgents set up their own 
political party 
thomas woewiyu interviewed monday night also reiterated the 
rebel demand that president samuel doe leave the west african 
country 
the liberian leader announced two weeks ago he would not stand 
for reelection but he has refused to resign immediately saying 
it would leave a dangerous power vacuum during the conflict 
on monday doe lifted a ban on several opposition political 
parties and said the national patriotic front rebels could set up a 
party with no fear of reprisals 
doe has no authority to grant anybody amnesty he is not in a 
position to grant amnesty he can only grant himself amnesty 
woewiyu said 
the two sides adjourned talks saturday for a week the rebel 
delegation signed an agreement urging both sides to exercise 
restraint during the recess and calling for mutual inspections of 
troop and supply movements 
fighting had virtually ceased before the talks began 
the churchmediated negotiations got under way in neighboring 
sierra leone after liberian government forces inflicted their first 
major defeat on the rebels since they invaded from neighboring 
ivory coast on dec 24 
in that fighting rebels were driven from the firestone rubber 
plantation and neighboring international airport 35 miles from 
monrovia after their chief military commander was killed in a 
skirmish 
woewiyu said the restraint agreement applies more to does 
extramilitary activities his death squads chopping off peoples 
heads and throwing away their bodies that has nothing to do with 
a ceasefire 
survivors who have fled rebelcontrolled territory say the 
insurgents also committed atrocities reporters who have visited 
them saw the skulls of dead liberian soldiers stuck on stakes along 
the roadside 
the talks mediated by the liberian council of churches were to 
resume june 25 
woewiyu said the rebels accepted the recess to give doe time to 
flee 
it is doe who needs an amnesty and he better take it now 
before it is too late he said 
doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted descendants of 
the freed american slaves who founded liberia in 1847 they 
historically monopolized power and discriminated against indigenous 
liberians in their country of 25 million residents

actor raymond huntley who specialized in comedy 
roles debunking pompous officialdom in a career on the stage in 
movies and on television has died he was 86

industrial city in central england where he was born 
a tall man with a mustache huntley during his long career 
played judges bank managers churchmen bureaucrats and other 
figures of authority 
he could play them straight if necessary but in comedy his 
natural dryness of delivery was exaggerated to the point where the 
character he was playing invited mockery as a pompous humbug

pimlico launched him as a noted film comedy actor 
his other movies included the sharply satirical farce im 
alright jack by the filmmaking brothers john and roy boulting in 
1959 about britains disastrous industrial relations at that time 
room at the top in 1958 and hostile witness in 1968 
apart from upstairs downstairs his television work

suffered from racist attitudes and abuse during the 1980s 
the 13 charged they were the target of physical and verbal 
harassment by some white firefighters who hassled their black peers

east german police have arrested yet another 
alleged red army faction terrorist a suspect in the 1981 bombing 
of a us air base and the ninth reputed member of the group 
captured in less than two weeks 
east germanys interior minister said a tip from a former member 
of the countrys nowdisbanded stasi secret police had led police 
to henning beer 31 
it has been widely believed that the secret police helped 
fugitive members of the leftwing west german terror group resettle 
in the east where they were harbored by the hardline communist 
government 
the same tip that snared beer led authorities to silke 
maierwitt whose arrest was announced late monday interior 
minister petermichael diestel told reporters in east berlin 
maierwitt and beer were both captured on monday in the east 
german city of neubrandenberg he said both had been living and 
working under false names 
the wave of arrests has led to fears of reprisal by the leftist 
terror gang red army faction 
diestel said that since the arrests started on june 6 his 
office has received up to five anonymous death threat letters per 
day aimed at him prime minister lothar de maiziere and others 
he said there were no indications that east germany was used as 
a base of operations for attacks in the west but that harboring 
west german terrorists was the personal hobby of former 
communist leader erich honecker and his ousted security chief 
erich mielke 
beer is suspected in the 1981 bombing of the ramstein air base 
which seriously injured 17 people said hansjuergen foerster a 
spokesman for the west germany federal prosecutors office red 
army faction member helmut pohl has already been convicted in the 
ramstein bombing 
in addition beer has been charged in a bungled bombing attempt 
in the spanish city of cadiz in june 1988 foerster said 
the red army faction has been waging attacks against nato us 
and west german industrial targets since the early 1970s among 
those killed were a us army officer and leading west german 
bankers and industrialists 
about two dozen members of the red army factions old guard are 
at large 
ms maierwitt 40 is wanted in the 1977 kidnapslaying of west 
german industry chief hansmartin schleyer and an attempted rocket 
attack that same year against west germanys federal prosecutors 
office 
the first of the recent arrests occurred june 6 when east 
german officials announced the apprehension in east berlin of

resign after kaifu reprimanded him for engaging in stock deals last 
year an official said today 
aide mitsuo ando offered his resignation on monday said shozen 
kaneishi kaifus private secretary kaneishi said he would decide 
whether ando should leave after further investigation 
ando said kaifu harshly reprimanded him for the stock deal ando

timed in light of the recruit stock scandal 
kaifu who has carefully sought to maintain his own clean 
reputation was named prime minister aug 9 after the recruit and 
sex scandals forced his two immediate predecessors to resign 
the stock scandal involved the recruit co informationservices 
conglomerate which made large donations and questionable stock 
sales to leading politicians and businessmen

and 12 politicians public officials and corporate executives were 
indicted on bribery charges 
members of kaifus cabinet and other highranking parliamentary 
officials agreed to refrain from dealing in stocks real estate and 
golf course memberships that restriction apparently also applies 
to top politicians aides who played a key role in questionable 
stock deals in the recruit affair 
ando confirmed a report in the masscirculation asahi shimbun 
that he had bought 8000 shares in meitech a firm specializing in 
hiring out computer engineers 
he said the transaction was worth nearly 194000 when ando 
bought meitech shares the stocks were traded at 24 per share now 
they cost 40 
i bought the shares on the recommendation of a securities 
firm because i thought meitech was a good company ando said 
i have about 20 years of experience in stock trading and used my 
own funds from sales of other shares and plan to keep the shares 
five or six years he said 
theres absolutely nothing to be ashamed of like insider 
trading or anything but while at the time i didnt see anything 
wrong with the deal now i realize it was careless of me given the 
timing he said

if students at simon lake elementary 
school leave home without it they wont be able to say charge 
it when it comes time for a power lunch of soup sandwich and 
milk 
the school is taking part in a pilot program being tested in 
milford and west hartford to allow the use of debit cards 
instead of cash to pay for lunch in the cafeteria 
milford food service director edward huff and computer companies 
introduced the cards two months ago the debit cards resemble 
automatic bank tellers cars and have proved popular 
this is a tremendous time saver collecting money from pupils 
each day is a very cumbersome task that takes valuable time away 
from the teaching huff said 
under the old system teachers had to record which pupils paid 
for lunch and how many were absent with the cards teachers 
collect money in advance and that information is sent into a 
computer system 
the students insert the card into a little machine that lights 
up red green or yellow to tell students how much money they have 
left to spend 
one student firstgrader guy duarte said there is a potential 
for embarrassment i think its dumb because what if your ticket 
shows up red guy said you dont get lunch that would be 
awful 
but huff said if the system showed any pupils had run out of 
money they would still get lunch 
janet bantley school lunch coordinator for the state board of 
education praised the new system saying it not only offers 
greater accountability but guarantees the privacy of children on 
assistance programs 
huff said he expects the debit cards will be in all 12 of the 
citys elementary schools within the next two years

a judge said poems by an israeli arab incited 
violence and today placed him under house arrest it was one of the 
strongest steps against an arab citizen during the 30monthold 
palestinian uprising 
israel radio said the judge also ordered that any poetry by 
shafik habib be submitted to the military censor before publication 
habib a 49yearold accountant said in a telephone interview 
that police were trying to set a precedent we are in a 
democratic country there should be freedom of expression 
he called the action a very serious move against an arab 
intellectual 
an arab legislator demanded a parliamentary debate on the action 
against the poet this regime is very weak if they are afraid of 
words legislator abdul wahab darousha said in a telephone 
interview 
jamal kawwar chairman of the palestinian israeli writers 
union said habib was the first israeli arab citizen to be arrested 
for his writings 
most punitive measures by israel during the uprising have 
involved the 17 million palestinians who live under military rule 
in the occupied west bank or gaza strip the 810000 arabs who live 
within israels boundaries have the full rights of citizens 
a military court has sentenced a palestinian journalist and 
writer samaan khoury to 45 months in jail after he was convicted 
of being an uprising leader active in a syrianbacked palestine 
liberation organization faction military officials said today 
khoury who is from east jerusalem and a supporter of the 
democratic front for the liberation of palestine is not an israeli 
citizen he was accused of writing some of the leaflets espousing 
violence in the uprising against occupation 
he also received a suspended term of 39 months after a yearlong 
trial that ended thursday the officials said 
the action against habib came in the acco magistrates court 
where judge eitan magen put him under house arrest after he was 
charged with identifying with an unspecified terrorist group 
because of his poetry 
the domestic news agency itim quoted the charges as saying 
habibs poems encouraged readers to violence liable to bring 
about death or injury it said habibs passport was seized and he 
was ordered to pay a 5000 bond 
magen said habib must remain in his home in deir hanna near acco 
until further hearings could be held on a police request to jail 
him until his trial no trial date was set 
habib was jailed on june 13 and then released today by the judge 
before being placed under house arrest 
the arrest came at a time when more of israels arab citizens 
have taken part in uprisingrelated demonstrations mostly in the 
aftermath of a may 20 massacre of arab workers by an israeli gunman 
near tel aviv 
the maariv daily said the action against habib came after a 
collection of his poems were confiscated from a palestinian in the 
west bank city of ramallah 
police claimed the poems called for attacks on israel using 
firebombs stones and even live ammunition the newspaper said 
habib disputed the claim of incitement 
in the occupied gaza strip today a palestinian accused of 
collaborating with israel was gunned down by masked assailants as 
he rode in a taxi arab reports said 
the victim mahmud abu harb 35 was shot in the head in rafah 
and masked youths later spraypainted the towns walls with slogans 
denouncing abu harb as a traitor 
harbs death raised to 224 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs for similar allegations in the 30month uprising at 
least 717 other palestinians have been killed by israelis and 45 
israelis have been slain by palestinians

the silent gunman who killed eight 
people and seriously wounded five at an auto loan agency that had 
repossessed his car also killed two people on a street the day 
before police said 
james edward pough 42 shot himself to death after his rampage 
monday at a general motors acceptance corp office 
the day laborer from jacksonville began firing a semiautomatic 
rifle almost immediately after entering the large oneroom office 
he shot two customers then went desk to desk shooting at 
employees cowering underneath 
seven employees and one customer ages 30 to 45 were killed 
six victims were women 
the shots kept coming closer and i kept hearing the moans of 
people i know said rick langille a loan manager the guy was 
pointing his gun under peoples desks and killing them one by one 
i just saw the bottom of the carpet and just prayed 
sheriff james mcmillan said pough has also been identified by 
witnesses as the killer of a man and woman in separate shootings on 
sunday the victims ages 39 and 30 were killed with the same 
30caliber rifle used monday he said 
the shootings sunday occurred near poughs home and at least 
one stemmed from arguments over services of a prostitute 
mcmillan said he did not elaborate before mondays rampage pough 
was not a suspect in the sunday shootings 
the sheriff also said investigators were trying to determine 
where and how pough got his guns pough had been charged with 
manslaughter in 1971 and pleaded guilty to a lesser felony 
generally felons may not own firearms but under an agreement 
poughs record was to be wiped clean at the end of the five years 
if he obeyed the terms of probation 
a records check showed pough successfully completed probation 
asa higgs a police spokesman said today authorities were 
checking to confirm that the conviction had been removed as 
provided for in the agreement but apparently he does not 
qualify as a convicted felon higgs said 
gmac said it had repossessed poughs 1988 pontiac grand am in 
january 
whether the repossession was poughs only motive for the 
massacre we just dont know the sheriff said 
the gunman never said a word gmac employees told police and 
counselors called in after the twominute shooting rampage about 
80 people worked in the onestory building 
he just shot until he saw no one else to shoot mcmillan 
said 
pough used a clipfed semiautomatic rifle for the shootings 
then turned a 38caliber revolver on himself authorities said 
theres numerous magazines plus numerous rounds in his 
pockets said deputy ken bozeman he was loaded for war 
the death toll equaled the worst shooting rampage in florida 
history a 1982 massacre at a miami machine shop where nine died 
and three were wounded 
of those injured monday four were in critical condition and one 
was in serious condition this morning some were shot seven or 
eight times officials said 
i had to keep stepping over bodies to give victims cpr said 
sheriffs patrolman steve dubberly its the worst slaughter ive 
ever seen in my life 
poughs revolver was registered in 1979 mcmillan said federal 
agents were checking whether the rifle was registered 
a 9mm semiautomatic pistol registered to pough was found in his 
car outside of the building mcmillan said he also had a

weapons used by a man to kill at least 10 people in two days before 
taking his own life 
authorities reviewed registration forms and other leads on how 
james edward pough 42 obtained the weapons for the rampage that 
began sunday in a jacksonville neighborhood and ended monday inside 
an auto loan company 
were trying to find the answer to that right now sheriff 
james mcmillan said 
pough had been convicted of a felony in the 1970s and it is 
illegal in florida for convicted felons to own handguns but a 
police spokesman today said pough would apparently not have been 
considered a convicted felon 
in 1971 pough was charged with manslaughter in a shooting 
death he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to 
five years probation court records show 
the records show that if pough obeyed the terms of his 
probation the case was to be removed from his record an overnight 
records check showed that pough successfully completed his 
probation said asa higgs a police spokesman officials were still 
checking to confirm that the case was removed 
under florida law background checks before a weapons purchase 
depend heavily on what the buyer discloses 
until strengthened gun laws take effect oct 1 gun purchasers 
are required only to have some identification such as a drivers 
license and fill out a questionnaire on arrests mental illness 
and drug use 
merchants are not required to check the information and there 
is no way for them to confirm it other than by calling police 
agencies themselves 
the new statute requires that all applications be checked by a 
central computer in tallahassee 
pough entered a general motors acceptance corp office monday 
and shot customers and employees some cowering under their desks 
pough killed eight people and seriously injured five before taking 
his own life

that may not have been poughs sole motive but he offered no 
further suggestions

killed a man and a woman in separate shootings sunday near poughs 
home 
police said those killings were done with the same 30caliber

registered in 1979 mcmillan said federal agents were checking 
whether the rifle was registered 
a 9mm semiautomatic pistol registered to pough was found in his 
car outside the building mcmillan said he also had a registered

a republican challenging gov mario cuomos 
reelection bid may have exaggerated some claims about his 
political and education experience a newspaper reported today 
some former nixon administration officials disputed pierre 
rinfrets suggestion that he was a major adviser to the president 
the new york times said 
the times also said rinfret never earned a doctorate but has 
used the title dr rinfret on resumes on legal documents and 
in his political biography 
the state gop nominated rinfret 66 last month the millionaire 
economist a political unknown was chosen after the party made a 
monthslong effort to persuade betterknown republicans to run 
against the popular twoterm democrat 
in his acceptance speech at the state republican convention 
rinfret said he was offered the equivalent of three cabinet 
posts by nixon 
in an interview he told the times that nixon personally offered 
to make him a member of his council of economic advisers in 1968 
and secretary of commerce in 1972 rinfret also said two nixon 
aides asked him if he would be interested in becoming secretary of 
the treasury in 1971 
calls to rinfret at his home and office this morning were not 
immediately returned but his son and adviser peter rinfret 
promised to release an information packet with primary sources 
that would provide much detail including his fathers world war ii 
heroics 
im not going to respond to that said peter rinfret when 
asked if his father might have exaggerated his credentials 
elizabeth deltorto a top aide to state gop chairman j patrick 
barrett said the party would have no comment adding if mr 
rinfret wants to say anything thats up to him 
nixon did not respond to several telephone messages left at his 
office the newspaper said but top aides in his administration 
including chief domestic policy adviser john erlichman treasury 
secretary john connally and two chairmen of the council of economic 
advisers paul mccracken and herbert stein said they did not know 
that rinfret had been considered seriously for any of the posts 
several nixon aides said rinfret did occasionally have the ear 
of the president but the times quoted one top nixon adviser as 
saying that nixon consulted rinfret to placate him because he 
was prone to criticizing administration policy 
new york times columnist and former nixon aide william safire 
however said he recalled that rinfret was offered a job on the 
council of economic advisers after nixons election in 1968 safire 
also said nixon valued rinfrets advice 
rinfret earned a diploma at the university of dijon in france in 
1946 that university officials said was the equivalent of an 
american masters degree 
after returning to the united states rinfret was told by a 
french diplomatic official that he could call the degree a 
doctorate the times said 
but university officials told the times he would have had to 
study at least four more years and finish a dissertation to earn 
the french equivalent of a doctorate 
rinfret said that even if the dijon doctorate does not count he 
can claim a doctorate because of an honorary degree he received 
from pepperdine university in malibu calif in 1973 
rinfret is president of rinfret inc a group of consulting and 
financialfutures trading firms

friends of kerri polivka say they are not 
surprised she put a 9yearold girl into a bathtub that was whisked 
safely away from a trailer home as it was torn apart in a flash 
flood 
the body of 13yearold kerri was found monday in the ohio 
river bringing to 21 the number known to have died in the 
flooding thirteen people were listed as missing 
kerri of wegee was babysitting at the home of amber colvin 
when a storm thursday dumped 5 inches of rain in about three 
hours sending a wall of water rushing down two small creeks that 
empty into the river 
kerri put amber in the tub and got in with her the two became 
separated after kerri was hit on the head as the trailer collapsed 
amber said friday 
amber said she survived by holding onto logs and was rescued 7 
hours later when she reached the bank of the ohio river she 
suffered cuts and scratches 
she would have thought of amber first because she was watching 
her that night said angel halpin a sixthgrade classmate and 
one of kerris closest friends 
angel said she believed searchers sifting through debris along 
the wegee and pipe creeks would find kerri alive i kept saying 
to myself that she had a broken leg or something and was just 
sitting somewhere waiting for help she said 
rescuers held out little hope that any of the missing would turn

nothing that shows that she was the smartest girl in the world

consulate on tuesday after destroying an american flag and 
scrawling graffiti on the building 
scuffles broke out between police and the protesters who flooded

the aids coalition to unleash power or act up timed the 
protest to coincide with worldwide actions marking the sixth 
international aids conference which opens in san francisco on 
wednesday

several governments have boycotted the conference to protest a us 
law under which people testing positive for the aids virus can be 
barred from entering the country 
act up spokesman bruce brown told the protesters who numbered 
more than 100that president bush is historys greatest serial 
killer because of his wimpish stand against acquired immune 
defiency syndrome 
he said many infected people are homeless and begging on the 
streets because of government inaction 
the travel restrictions are fueling discrimination against 
homosexuals and people with aids and they are a political rather 
than health measure brown said

housing starts fell in may for the fourth 
consecutive month to their lowest level since the last recession 
the government said tuesday 
analysts who said the decline was further evidence that the 
housing market continues to weaken attributed the 14 percent fall 
to high mortgage rates tight credit a large inventory of new and 
existing homes wet weather and a sluggish economy resulting in 
slackening consumer confidence 
the commerce department said starts of new homes and apartments 
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 121 million units 
the smallest number since 117 million units got under way in 
october 1982 at the end of the last recession 
david seiders the national association of home builders chief 
economist said a survey of its members in early june pointed to 
continuing weakness 
applications for building permits often a barometer of future 
housing activity also have fallen for four straight months noted 
martin regalia chief economist with the national council of 
savings institutions 
such applications declined 46 percent to 106 million after 
falling 101 percent in april the may level was the lowest since 
104 million were recorded in september 1982 
its not a rosy picture at all for the remainder of the 
year regalia said 
mortgage rates which dropped into the single digits toward the 
end of last year rose above the 10 percent level in january and 
ranged from 1033 percent to 1067 percent in may according to 
surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp rates fell to 1012 
percent by last friday 
david berson chief economist with the federal national mortgage 
association said declining rates may help the singlefamily 
sector but he said builder uncertainty over proposed federal 
regulations governing handicapped access to apartment buildings 
will continue to slow the multifamily sector 
john a tuccillo chief economist for the national association 
of realtors said many builders have had trouble getting 
construction loans because of the constraints of the savings and 
loan bailout law and tighter lending restrictions by banks 
economist richard peach of the mortgage bankers association 
noted that may was a very wet month over parts of the nation but 
also cited interest rates and large inventories of new and existing 
homes 
its not an environment in which builders wanted to go out on 
a limb and start a whole slew of new units he said 
part of the inventory problems regalia said is the effect of 
the slowing economy on consumer confidence 
consumers rather than spending to the limit are starting to 
increase savings dramatically he said one of the first things 
that goes when you have this kind of retrenchment is bigticket 
items cars and houses things that people can discretionarily 
push off into the future 
construction of singlefamily homes in may fell 1 percent to an 
annual rate of 896000 units on top of a 91 percent drop in april 
it was the lowest number of singlefamily starts since 862000 got 
under way in december 1982 
apartment construction slipped 25 percent to an annual rate of 
311000 units after rising 26 percent the previous month 
the building activity means the pace during the first five 
months of 1990 was 53 percent below that of the same period of 
1989 
starts slumped 8 percent to 266000 units in the midwest and 
fell 33 percent to 337000 units in the west 
increases were posted in the south up 32 percent to 486000 
units and the northeast up 16 percent to 129000 units

president mikhail s gorbachev today endorsed the 
formation of a separate communist party in the soviet unions 
biggest republic but warned of friction between national leaders 
and those in the russian republic 
i view the russian communist party as part of the soviet 
communist party and i sharply disagree with those who seek the 
salvation of russia in withdrawing from the soviet union he said 
at the opening of a party conference expected to formally 
reestablish the separate party 
the champion of that movement for greater russian independence 
is the newly elected president of the russian federation boris n 
yeltsin who sat near gorbachev on the dais 
radicals including yeltsin view formation of the party a means 
of weakening central authority and hastening economic and political 
reforms conservatives especially nationalists see a russian 
party as a vehicle of preserving political and cultural traditions 
gorbachev was expected to receive criticism from both groups 
the speaker after gorbachev ivan osadchi said the party 
leadership has reduced the party to crouching instead in the 
trenches under massive shelling by antisocialist forces which 
have rapidly organized themselves 
the russian party session is viewed as a bellwether of the 28th 
congress of the national communist party due to start july 2 
russia with more than half of the soviet population and 
threequarters of its territory is home to 58 percent of the 
countrys more than 18 million communist party members 
the delegates to the russian conference will also represent the 
republic at the national congress 
the delegates voted 2607 to 61 with 16 abstentions to adopt 
the agenda proposed by gorbachev to consider the formation of the 
russian party and to debate the proposed platform of the national 
congress and not to discuss their own platform 
the separate russian communist party was absorbed into the 
national party 65 years ago 
of the 15 soviet republics only russia has not had its own 
party in large part because russians have controlled the national 
and regional parties 
gorbachev is seeking to steer the conference on a centrist 
course between radicals who want to hasten steps toward a market 
economy and conservatives who want to slow the reforms 
he defended his cautious economic and political reforms and 
resisted efforts by radicals to open a debate on russian 
sovereignty 
already we hear the opinion that perestroika has worsened the 
situation in the country he said citing accusations that the 
reforms had lowered living standards and raised tensions among 
ethnic groups 
he claimed his reforms had accomplished more at home and abroad 
in three years than similar efforts over the previous 30 years he 
cited the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan as a 
signficant step toward reducing global tension 
but he said domestic restructuring is hampered by an 
ossified and conservative public consciousness that was formed 
during decades of totalitarian ideology 
this conference comes a week after the russian republics 
parliament approved a resolution calling for further legislation to 
declare that russian laws supersede soviet laws on russian 
territory 
the resolution which did not carry the force of law opened the 
door for the russian parliament to pass legislation transferring 
most political and economic decisionmaking power from central to 
republic authorities 
although gorbachev acted as chairman of the session he was not 
among the candidates considered likely to be elected as first 
secretary or leader of the new party 
those in the running were the soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov 
interior minister vadim bakatin yuri mananenkov a secretary of 
the national party said andrei girenko another national party 
secretary 
delegates to the russian party conference voted 2607 to 61 
with 16 abstentions to adopt the agenda proposed by gorbachev 
under it they will consider the formation of the russian party and 
debate the proposed platform of the national congress

bigcity mayors are angrily attacking congress 
after being told by a leading democrat that they stand little 
chance of getting any new federal help even if theres a peace 
dividend from defense cuts 
if you have a 500 suit and unlimited campaign contributions 
like the greedy and corrupt savings and loans you can get whatever 
you want from washington boston mayor raymond flynn said monday 
but if you try to get a few dollars for the poor and needy you 
are totally ignored 
flynn and other mayors attending the summer meeting of the us 
conference of mayors went on the offensive after house ways and 
means committee chairman dan rostenkowski told them cities stood 
little or no chance of getting any more federal help in the near 
future 
today new york mayor david dinkins made his first appearance at 
the conference and despite rostenkowskis message led the mayors 
in a populist appeal for a city share of the peace dividend 
peace has brought with it a spendable dividend dinkins 
said and if that money was available to build bombers it 
certainly is available to rebuild our cities it is a challenge 
that we the mayors of america must mobilize to meet 
rostenkowskis assessment came as a blow to the mayors who 
spent the weekend crafting a new urban agenda that depends heavily 
on cities getting billions from the government after a decade of 
cuts in aid 
theres no money for such programs until the budget blockade 
is broken rostenkowski said in a blunt speech to the more than 
200 mayors 
we need movers and shakers in congress who will stand for the 
cities like they stood for the corrupt sampls mayor sharpe james 
of newark nj said in an interview being in congress now is 
like getting tenure youre not accountable to the people any 
more 
not all of the attacks came from bigcity northeast mayors 
were trying to control the intense level of frustration that 
we have right now said mayor lee robinson of macon ga 
congress keeps telling us to man the front line on the war on 
drugs and other issues but while were out there getting beat up 
theyre not offering any help and are hiding 
not long after rostenkowski spoke the mayors heard a somewhat 
more encouraging speech from democratic sen robert kerrey of 
nebraska 
but while supportive of the mayors causes kerrey too said no 
funding for them would come from any peace dividend instead he 
said mayors would have to take their case to the people much like 
ronald reagan did in the early 1980s when his proposed military 
buildup faced congressional opposition 
if they believe it is worthwhile they will do it kerrey 
said of the american public 
kerrey said congress has been hiding behind the federal deficit 
and brushes off the requests of cities and other constituencies by 
pointing to the defict targets contained in the grammrudman law 
but kerrey said congress could solve the deficit problem if it 
had the political courage to defend higher taxes and other 
necessary steps

scientists from mexico and the united states 
are launching an intense study of the monsoonlike weather that 
brings summer rainfall to the southwest the government announced 
tuesday 
the monthlong analysis begins july 8 seeking to learn more 
about the wet and dry seasons in portions of the united states and 
mexico 
the southwestern climate can contribute to severe weather as far 
away as the great lakes said robert maddox director of the 
national severe storms laboratory in norman okla 
scientists said it may take about a year to analyze the 
information they collect and they hope to use it to more 
accurately predict severe storms 
although monsoons are usually associated with the climate of 
southeast asia they can also occur in climates with seatoland 
breezes in summer and landtosea winds in winter 
that type of circulation occurs over the southwestern united 
states and northeastern mexico summer heat in the region causes 
the air to rise drawing moist air from the pacific ocean and gulf 
of california and contributing to thunderstorms 
mexican and american scientists will launch balloons to check 
upperair conditions at several sites in the region and studies 
will be conducted from aircraft based in phoenix ariz 
in addition scientists will also seek to determine if added 
heat generated by the city of phoenix affects weather nearby 
particularly the summer storms in nearby mountains 
taking part in the study are scientists from the noaas national 
weather service and national environmental satellite data and 
information service arizona state university the university of 
arizona the salt river project the mexican weather service the 
noaauniversity of colorado cooperative institute for research in 
the environmental sciences and the mexican centro de investigacion

ten albanians arrived in greece this week 
after fleeing their homeland leading to speculation the hardline 
country has relaxed border controls a foreign ministry official 
said tuesday 
the refugees included two brothers whose alleged torture in 
their homeland last year sparked diplomatic tension between greece 
and albania the official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with 
standard procedures said the 10 albanians crossed into northern 
greece on sunday and monday eight of the 10 are ethnic greeks he 
said 
the fact that more than 50 albanians have crossed the border 
since january has led to speculation that albanian authorities are 
slackening border controls the official said 
albania the last bastion of stalinism in europe has indicated 
it wants to end its international isolation by resuming ties with 
the two superpowers and joining the 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe 
brothers george and dimitris prassos who were among those 
arriving in greece this week said in an interview published 
tuesday that albanias secret police repeatedly beat them after an 
abortive attempt to escape last october 
they were tied to a tractor and dragged around border villages 
to set an example for possible defectors the two told the athens 
daily newspaper eleftheros typos they claimed they were jailed 
until dec 22 and lived on a diet of macaroni and rotting onions in 
custody 
the orthodox church of greece reported in december that the 
brothers had been killed after trying to flee albania

an oil slick lingering in the gulf of 
mexico remained stalled some 7 to 10 miles offshore today as 
cleanup crews readied for the arrival of tar balls for the second 
day 
coast guard officials said an early morning flyover showed no 
signs that tar balls from the supertanker mega borg spill had 
washed ashore overnight earlier officials in louisiana had said 
that tar balls were found on some beaches but that it was possible 
they were not from the mega borg 
the slick changed direction slightly with predictions that it 
would reach land closer to high island northeast of galveston than 
sea rim state park farther east the coast guard said 
thats good news said petty officer mark sedwick that 
means it will be away from the marsh areas where we were concerned 
about the wildlife 
officials had predicted the 30mile oil slick would hit the 
shore along a 45mile stretch northeast of galveston between high 
island and sabine pass near the texaslouisiana border there are 
three national wildlife refuges in the area 
meanwhile about 1200 volunteers in five counties remained on 
alert to help clean the beaches if the messy tar balls hit the 
general land office expected at least 100 volunteers to arrive at 
sea rim state park today for the second day to prepare for the tar 
balls 
on monday about 60 volunteers mobilized for the supertanker tar 
cleanup instead picked up hundreds of pounds of debris seaweed and 
old oil on a sixmile stretch of the state park beach clearing the 
beach of debris will make it easier to clean up the oil later 
they said they needed volunteers and i said does that mean 
me and i said why not me said jo krose who drove two hours 
from kirbyville 
offshore cleanup operations from the supertanker mega borg 
continued today as well with the oil sheen so faint that it could 
only be seen by helicopter crews 
were getting close to the point where you have to really look 
for the oil said coast guard chief warrant officer rick meidt 
the cleanup crews have to have a helicopter up there because they 
cant see it in the water 
the cleanup effort today included the stateoftheart mexican 
skimmer ecopemex and 10 other skimmers some working within four 
miles of the shoreline booms and other deflector devices also have 
been deployed along a 45mile area the coast guard had five beach 
patrols in areas stretching up to sabine pass today 
coast guard officials said 39 million gallons of oil has leaked 
from the mega borg since it was rocked by explosions june 8 some 57 
miles off galveston most of that oil has either burned off 
evaporated or been collected the coast guard said it had no good 
estimate of how much oil remains in the gulf 
the vessels owner arranged for a tanker to begin transferring 
the angolan crude off the damaged ship today said company attorney 
robert klawetter but sedwick said crews are continuing tests of 
the vessel today before any cargo is transferred

marion barry was snorting dope up his nose 
while warning his constituents about the dangers of drugs a 
federal prosecutor said today in opening arguments at the mayors 
trial 
barrys lawyer r kenneth mundy quickly countered by telling 
the jury the mayor was the victim of entrapment and that 
prosecution witnesses include notorious drug dealers who are 
not believable 
barry was accompanied by his wife effi in court he said on 
his way in that he felt fine but he wiped his forehead when 
assistant us attorney richard roberts said the jury would be 
shown an fbi videotape showing barry smoking crack on the night 
of his arrest 
the case against the mayor is about deceit and deception 
designed to keep the police the public and the government from 
discovering the truth said roberts 
the defendant had been smoking crack all over town for 
years said the prosecutor sometimes even accepting a supply of 
drugs in his office 
mundy disparaged the prosecutions witnesses as a cast of 
characters who have struck deals with the government so that they 
wont be prosecuted or who have been allowed to plead guilty to 
reduced charges 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to criminal charges alleging 
that he possessed cocaine repeatedly over a fiveyear span and that 
he lied to a federal grand jury in 1989 about his alleged 
involvement with drugs 
he could face up to 26 years in prison and 185 million in 
fines if convicted on all counts 
the opening arguments were a prelude to what is expected to be a 
monthlong trial featuring the fbi videotape made in a hotel room 
the night of jan 18 
the jurors will see black and white video of barry smoking 
crack lighting with a cigarette light just like this 
said the prosecutor demonstrating for the jury roberts twice 
extended his arms inhaled deeply held his breath for several 
seconds and exhaled 
the evidence will show entrapment of barry by the fbi at the 
vista hotel said mundy the government went all the way to 
california to bring exmodel rasheeda moore to washington as part 
of the sting operation mundy said 
but roberts told a different story you will learn that while 
preaching about not using dope he was snorting dope up his 
nose roberts said of barry the district of columbias mayor 
since 1979 
the prosecution will bring a series of friends and acquaintances 
to the witness stand to testify about barrys drug use said 
roberts 
but mundy quickly attacked the credibility of defense witnesses 
he said charles lewis a key government witness against barry has 
pleaded guilty to drug charges and agreed to play any tune the 
government wanted him to 
barrys lawyer characterized lewis as one of the notorious 
drug dealers who will testify in the case 
roberts said that barrys friends and acquaintances kept him 
supplied with drugs over a fiveyear span and that they 
conspired with him to keep his secret 
in his first visit to lewiss hotel room in december 1988 barry 
took out a matchbox containing rocks of crack cocaine said 
roberts 
you took care of me in the virgin islands i will take care of 
you up here roberts quoted barry as telling lewis 
on another visit lewis and barry smoked their way all the way 
through monday night football and well into ted koppels 
nightline said roberts 
a jury of five whites and 13 blacks was chosen monday to hear 
the evidence in barrys trial which is moving into the full trial 
stage after plea bargaining discussions failed to produce any 
agreement 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson ordered the 18 
sequestered for the duration of the trial

a towns ordinance strictly regulating 
signs discriminates against political speech and therefore is 
unconstitutional a superior court judge ruled this morning 
judge melanie famiglietti threw out the case against a 
barrington man who had been convicted of erecting signs in his yard 
in 1984 and 1985 without a permit as required by town ordinances 
the judge said the signs that james lemoi 70 installed in his 
yard were appeals for help after the death of his wife and a fire 
at his house and a political statement about town officials both 
of which were prohibited without a permit from the town 
barrington allows a variety of signs to be installed without a 
permit to advertise a house for sale or a professional business 
such as a law firm in a home or signs in connection with a holiday 
decoration other signs are permitted only if a permit is obtained 
before they are erected 
famiglietti said that the town cannot regulate signs by their 
content which was what it did in the case of lemoi if these 
very same signs indicated a doctors office in lemois home or 
were a theater marquee or were holiday decorations mr lemoi would 
not be in court today and would not be fined 13000 the judge 
said 
in december 1984 lemois wife died and just a few days later 
his house caught fire causing extensive damage he was not home at 
the time and was not hurt 
about 10 days after the fire lemoi put a sign up in his yard 
seeking public help seven months later after he was unable to 
obtain police or fire department reports about the fire he erected 
another sign stating simply come clean 
it was after that sign that barrington charged lemoi in district 
court with violating the town sign ordinance he was found guilty 
and fined 13000 he challenged his conviction and the american 
civil liberties unions rhode island affiliate took up the case 
when it reached superior court 
an attorney for the town michael mosco said he did not know 
whether he would appeal the ruling to the state supreme court he 
said that decision would be made by the town council 
mosco defended the ordinance saying that requiring a permit for 
certain types of signs was logical we consider any sign in the 
town of barrington as permissible he said we think its a 
reasonable sign ordinance 
but aclu attorney elizabeth colt said judge famigliettis 
decision clearly stated that the ordinance is unconstitutional 
you cant distinguish among signs ms colt said adding that 
sign regulations have to be contentneutral

defense secretary dick cheney told budget 
negotiators today that a 25 percent cut in the nations military 
force over the next five years would reduce pentagon spending by 
only about 10 percent 
cheneys figures dissatisfied many congressional democrats who 
attended the talks house armed services committee chairman les 
aspin argued that the defense chief could have made different 
decisions in the structure of the military that could have yielded 
savings of 18 percent to 27 percent 
they have made a set of policy choices to get there that i 
think are awfully cautious aspin dwis told reporters 
according to cheneys numbers a 25 percent reduction in army 
divisions navy fleets and air force wings would reduce the fiscal 
1991 defense budget president bush submitted in january from 3033 
billion to 302 billion over five years it would cut 86 billion 
from bushs proposal 
the 25 percent cut in military strength did not yield a 
corresponding dollar savings because it would be phased in 
gradually and because some of the more expensive elements of the 
pentagon budget such as weapons development and acquisition 
would not be cut deeply 
cheney said his numbers were meant as an illustration not an 
offer to budget negotiators 
in the budget talks bush administration officials and congress 
are searching for somewhere between 45 billion and 60 billion in 
new taxes or spending cuts before fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 
a major source of funds could be the military budget but cheney 
says hes concerned that spending could be cut too sharply or too 
quickly harming the nations defense 
he agreed to present budget negotiators with his study which 
would look at the effect of reducing the military force structure 
by 25 percent over a fiveyear period 
the good news was that cheney would entertain such a cut 
aspin said in his memo the bad news was that he believes it can 
be done while cutting the defense budget by only 10 percent over 
the same period 
aspin contended that when highcost items are pared from the 
pentagons spending list he could find a cost savings of between 
18 and 27 percent 
aspin sent the memo to majority leader dick gephardt dmo and 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif two of the 
most important democrats in the budget negotiations 
but cheneys aides have insisted that his report to the budget 
negotiators is not to be taken as a plan for reducing the forces 
or the pentagon budget even though those cuts might be in store 
for the nations military 
besides the 25 percent paredown cheney also planned to lay out 
the effects of far deeper cuts in defense spending called for in 
the house and senate 
pentagon officials have said the study would keep spending 
levels along the lines that cheney has projected for the coming 
years which is a proposal for a 2 percent cut in real growth after 
inflation is taken into account 
along the lines of such a cut the administration proposed in 
january to spend 3033 billion for the 1991 fiscal year the house 
has passed a more drastic cut to 2954 billion while the senate 
budget committee has approved an even leaner 2939 billion plan 
in testimony on capitol hill last week cheney said if he were 
forced to accept the house proposal he would be forced to lay off 
140000 military men and women 
a 25 percent cut in forces he added would result in cutting 
five or six army divisions and the same number of air force 
tactical fighter wings 
last week pentagon spokesman pete williams decried the house 
and senate numbers as taking a mindless meat ax to the defense 
budget 
cheneys report to the budget negotiators amounts to trying to 
educate the people who are going to make those budget decisions on 
why they should not make big reductions in our budget williams 
said 
the spokesman accused the house and senate with coming up with 
defense budget figures out of thin air dedicated only to 
slashing the budget and not taking into account what it would do to 
the nations military force 
part of the exercise were going through is to say guys if 
you swing that ax this is what youre cutting williams said

volunteer organizations said tuesday they will 
hold simultaneous candlelight vigils in 15 countries this fall to 
call attention to the plight of children around the world 
they are trying to fight preventable diseases that experts say 
may kill 100 million children in the next decade 
over 40000 children are dying daily of malnutrition and 
preventable disease said sen bill bradley at a news conference 
to launch the effort 
the nations of the world must act together to declare that 
children are a priority that they have a right to learn and grow 
in peace and freedom the new jersey democrat said 
the candlelight ceremonies are a prelude to the world summit on 
children to be held at the united nations on september 2930 
they are to begin at sunset sept 23 in australia and other 
countries will join in as twilight reaches their part of the world 
ending in the united states in hawaii 
all the successful communities of the world have become 
successful because they have become concerned about the health and 
education of their children said james p grant executive 
director of the un childrens fund unicef which is helping 
organize the summit 
nearly 15 million children under five die each year according 
to unicef 
one day of the worlds expenditures on arms is all it would 
take to save the lives of 20000 children said grant

german and jewish experts will meet in east 
berlin next week to start negotiating how much east germany will 
pay for the war crimes of nazi germany the world jewish congress 
announced tuesday 
the june 25 meeting follows exploratory talks on the 
compensation issue between wjc leaders and east german prime 
minister lothar de maiziere during his visit to new york earlier 
this month 
the negotiations will focus on reparations to israel and to 
jewish organizations for housing and rehabilitating survivors of 
the nazi holocaust said wjc executive director elan steinberg 
the scope of the east german payments is uncertain in large 
part because the country is being merged with west germany which is 
assuming responsibility for all east germanys financial 
obligations 
the talks will not deal with compensation of individual victims 
or survivors just as the 1952 reparations agreement with west 
germany known as the luxembourg agreement did not address that 
issue steinberg said 
the luxembourg agreement which will serve as the model for the 
talks with east germany only covered west german payments to 
israel and jewish institutions the west german parliament later 
passed a law providing for compensation of individual claims 
in all west germany has paid more than 40 billion in 
reparations over the years the luxembourg agreement stipulated 
that west germany pay twothirds of the total compensation owed by 
the german people 
for more than 40 years east germanys communist leaders refused 
to recognize any responsibility for the war crimes and refused to 
pay the remaining third of the claims citing the systematic 
persecution of communists by the nazis 
one of the first acts of the new democratic east german 
parliament elected last march after the communists fell was to 
concede a share of the blame for the deeds of the nazis and their 
systematic annihilation of 6 million jews 
we recognize the very complex nature of these negotiations 
said steinberg but we hope they wont be too lengthy

a house banking committee member called on 
federal regulators today to lift the veil of secrecy 
surrounding their investigation of president bushs son neil in 
connection with a colorado thrift collapse 
if it has brought charges against neil bush it should make 
those charges public rep frank annunzio said referring to the 
federal office of thrift supervision no law or regulation 
prevents the agency from revealing the charges 
neil bush denied any wrongdoing in the collapse of silverado 
banking savings and loan association of denver he appeared may 23 
before the committee which was probing whether his business 
interests in colorado conflicted with his role as a director of 
silverado he called allegations of conflict of interest 
frivolous 
im calling on the office of thrift supervision to lift the 
veil of secrecy which shrouds this matter annunzio dill said 
at the outset of the latest hearing on the silverado failure 
annunzio cited an undated and unsigned internal office of thrift 
supervision document which he said contained proposed charges 
against neil bush but he said no charges were ever brought nor 
has there been any indication of whether any charges will be 
forthcoming from the government 
the last time i checked neil bushs father was the head of 
that organization annunzio said 
can any agency of the united states fairly and impartially 
investigate the son of the president of the united states he 
asked 
rep stan parris rva defended neil bush noting that he has 
declared his innocence and citing a may 22 statement by federal 
regulators that they could find no basis for issuing a prohibition 
on his further involvement in the banking industry 
parris said the document cited by annunzio is undated its 
unsigned it was never circulated it is in fact a draft mr 
bush appeared here voluntarily for eight hours he 
believes he is innocent of any wrongdoing 
i think it raises the question is neil bush paying a 
penalty because of who he is not being given some kind of unique 
benefits because of who he may be parris said 
one focus of the hearings is the length of time it took 
regulators to close the thrift after problems developed the thrift 
was closed in late 1988 two years after trouble surfaced 
nothing has been more costly than regulatory hesitation 
through the entire savings and loan crisis committee chairman 
henry b gonzalez dtexas said in an opening statement 
meanwhile the white house blasted democrats for the sampl crisis 
a big part of the problem here is that in the dead of night a 
few years ago the democrats pushed through a bill raising the 
limits of coverage for insured deposits to 100000 a person 
said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater the increase was 
part of a broader bipartisan bill to overhaul the entire sampl 
industry 
im saying the democrats have a big role in it he said 
among those subpoenaed to testify were michael wise the former 
chairman of silverado and kenneth good and bill walters neil 
bushs former business partners 
wise was likely to be questioned about his role on the federal 
reserve boards thrift institutions advisory council wise was on 
the prestigious panel for three years serving as its president in 
1987 
the advisory group meets with the feds board of governors four 
times a year to advise it on developments relating to the thrift 
industry and other regulatory matters 
meantime sen timothy wirth dcolo acknowledged he wrote 
letters in 1984 to paul volcker then the chairman of the federal 
reserve board promoting wises appointment to a related panel the 
feds consumer advisory council 
in a handwritten letter to volcker wirth said of wise he is 
extremely able and would be an excellent appointment copies of 
two letters wirth sent to volcker were obtained by the associated 
press from house sources 
wirth who was a house member when he wrote the letters 
received a campaign contribution of 750 from wise for a senate bid 
in 1985 according to the federal election commission wise also 
gave to republicans including 1000 to wirths 1986 opponent in 
the senate race ken kramer 
wirth who is a member of the senate banking committee played 
down the significance of the letter and blamed its release on 
political backbiting 
he said in a statement that the letter was one of hundreds of 
letters that i write each year on behalf of my constituents 
wirth recently cosponsored legislation to create a separate 
justice department division charged with investigating and 
prosecuting illegal activity in the savings and loan industry 
we must send a strong message to those in the financial 
services industry who violate the law that their actions will be 
punished he said last week 
meanwhile monday sen christopher bond rmo called on 
president bush to create an independent commission to investigate 
the savings and loan crisis he said he was disappointed by the 
increasingly partisan nature of the debate over how the crisis 
occurred 
pending in the house is a resolution calling for appointment of 
an independent counsel or special prosecutor to handle sampl 
investigations 
at an earlier house banking committee hearing neil bush 34 
testified there was no conflict of interest between his business 
relationships with good and walters and the loans they received 
from silverado 
but regulators have alleged there was a conflict because neil 
bush who had an oil and gas exploration company didnt tell 
silverado about his separate ties to good and walters

an israeli arab poet was placed under house 
arrest tuesday and faces trial on charges that his poems about the 
palestinian uprising incite violence by arabs against jews 
shafik habib is the first israeli arab author to be prosecuted 
for his writing 
this is a very serious move against an arab intellectual this 
lit up a red light for all of us said habib a father of six who 
lives in the northern israeli village of deir hanna 
police claimed after habibs arrest last week that in a 
collection of poems titled return to the future he calls for 
the continuation of the uprising and appeals to arabs to use 
firearms and kill the jews 
judge eitan magen on tuesday ordered habib placed under house 
arrest after he was charged with identifying with a terror group 
through his writing israelis usually mean the plo when they refer 
an unspecified terror organization 
magen said habib must stay at home until further hearings could 
be held on a police request that he be jailed until trial no trial 
date was scheduled 
the israeli news agency itim said habibs passport was seized 
and he was ordered to pay a bond of 5000 
the charges against habib come at a time of growing 
identification among israels 810000 arab citizens with the 
antiisraeli revolt of their 17 million brethren living in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
last month after an israeli gunman killed seven palestinian 
laborers rioting erupted in many arab towns and villages within 
israel police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets tactics 
they frequently use in the occupied lands but rarely in israel 
there are many close ties between israeli arabs and those in the 
territories many in the territories fled from homes that fell 
under israeli control at the founding of the jewish state in 1948 
habib who defines himself as a palestinian arab living in 
israel said he used to write love poems until the uprising began 
in december 1987 
anger over the methods used to crush the revolt prompted him to 
change subjects 
in one of his poems news bulletin he writes about alleged 
army brutality 
the commander has issued an urgent order break arms and 
legs smash necks crush skulls and chase them leave them as 
corpses rotting in the soil 
but he denies his work incites violence 
i see something on television and i write a poem about it 
but its impossible to encourage stonethrowing and i know not to 
cross the red line im a responsible person he said in a 
telephone interview from his home 
habib also argued that all the poems in the return to the 
future collection had previously been published by israeli arab 
newspapers which are subject to censorship 
the army routinely reviews material submitted to arabiclanguage 
newspapers in israel and the occupied lands and it frequently bans 
publication of items 
israeli arab leaders said the charges against habib violated 
free speech and contradicted prime minister yitzhak shamirs pledge 
that his new rightwing government would seek peace 
this regime is very weak if they are afraid of words we are 
not talking about stones or bombs said legislator abdul wahab 
darousha

lithuanias president made clear tuesday that his 
republics legislature will not rush to consider mikhail s 
gorbachevs proposal to suspend its declaration of independence 
the lithuanian proindependence group sajudis staged a rally 
outside the parliament building in the republics capital of 
vilnius to oppose suspension of the march 11 act of independence 
the news agency interfax reported 
in an effort to break the kremlins impasse with the baltics 
gorbachev last week offered to end his economic embargo against 
lithuania and conduct negotiations in return he asked lithuania 
to freeze implementation of its declaration of independence 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis told lawmakers the 
proposal would not be considered by the full parliament until the 
republics prime minister returns from a foreign trip 
i think that today there isnt such a compelling reason to 
begin debates without clarifying our position beforehand in 
commissions and groups landsbergis told parliament his comment 
was reported by haroldus subacius a parliamentary spokesman 
lithuanias council of ministers or cabinet accepted the 
moratorium proposal saturday and asked the supreme council or 
parliament to endorse it as well 
the lithuanian government under prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene is considered far more disposed to compromise with the 
kremlin than the parliament which is headed by landsbergis and 
dominated by members of sajudis 
subacius account of landsbergis comments differed markedly 
from a report given by the soviet unions official tass news 
agency tass quoted landsbergis as saying in a radio broadcast 
the supreme council of lithuania will not discuss the proposal of 
the government in the form in which it was received wont vote for 
or against it today this week and perhaps ever 
subacius denied the lithuanian president made the remark he 
said landsbergis made it clear the proposal on the moratorium would 
eventually be discussed 
there was no explanation for the conflicting reports 
mrs prunskiene was visiting greece and not expected to return 
until friday subacius said in a telephone interview 
lithuania was forcibly absorbed into the soviet union in 1940 
along with the republics of latvia and estonia those republics 
have declared they want to regain their independence but they have 
taken a slower approach than lithuania

the white house said tuesday it was willing to 
compromise on the civil rights act of 1990 to avoid a presidential 
veto but a key gop senator voiced skepticism that such a deal 
could be struck before nelson mandelas visit to washington 
i dont think anybody wants to see the president veto any 
civil rights bill but on the other hand hes made it quite clear 
that he wants it changed and he wants the changes to work sen 
orrin hatch rutah told reporters after a meeting with bush 
the civil rights dispute dominated the agenda of bushs tuesday 
meeting with gop congressional leaders but participants emerged 
from the session suggesting a compromise on the issue did not 
appear to be at hand 
the administration has been discussing possible compromises in 
hopes of avoiding a battle over the bill during mandelas visit 
the african national congress leader meets with bush on monday 
hatch a senior republican on the senate judiciary committee 
said that because the issue is so contentious he did not believe a 
deal could be struck before mandela arrives 
in addition he cautioned against democrats bringing the matter 
to the senate floor during mandelas visit to try to embarrass the 
administration 
this deserves more consideration than that hatch said 
the legislation cosponsored by sen edward m kennedy dmass 
and augustus f hawkins dcalif would overcome a series of 
supreme court decisions last year that made it harder for workers 
to bring discrimination suits against employers 
the administration claims that the bill as drafted would in 
effect force businesses to resort to hiring quotas to reduce their 
exposure to lawsuits sponsors deny that the bill requires quotas 
directly or indirectly 
president bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said after 
tuesdays white house meeting he does not want to veto the bill 
he wants a civil rights bill he can sign 
but fitzwater added were willing to veto this bill if it is 
a quota bill this is the bottom line 
fitzwater said the possibility that the bill might come up in 
the senate during mandelas visit came up at the white house 
meeting but there was no concern about it 
fitzwater said that while were not there yet in terms of a 
compromise the consensus of everybody at the gop meeting 
including some republican cosponsors of the bill was that they 
want something to be for 
attorney general dick thornburgh briefed gop senators at the 
white house session on possible administrationbacked compromises 
in wording that would avoid the quota problem 
well be doing some heavy negotiating said sen alan 
simpson rwyo

the zebra mussel is one of many exotic species 
invading us waters and a broad strategy is needed to keep them 
from wreaking economic and environmental havoc experts said 
tuesday 
the river ruffe spiny water flea and tubenosed goby soon may 
become as familiar to the great lakes as the zebra mussel 
witnesses said at a hearing of the senate subcommittee on 
environmental protection 
meanwhile the asiatic clam japanese seaweed and the red tide 
are damaging shellfish and marine industries along the ocean coasts 
the newcomers threaten many native species interrupt the food 
chain and pose a danger to the us fishing industry and other 
segments of the economy said gillman d veith director of the 
environmental protection agencys office of research and 
development 
given the rate of technological change and movement of people 
it is likely that the problems resulting from invasions of 
nonnative species will increase said veith

the pentagon revised its figures today on the 
number of soldiers accidentally wounded by their comrades in the 
panama invasion saying 16 of the 310 servicemen wounded in action 
were hit by friendly fire 
on monday the defense department released figures showing that 
two soldiers and possibly three of the 23 killed during the 
dec 20 military operation had been killed in such a manner as 
well the department had originally said 19 of the 324 soldiers 
wounded in action had been hit accidentally by their comrades 
pentagon spokesman pete williams told reporters that the 
department had refined the figures in an overnight study of the 
death reports the review was prompted by a newsweek magazine 
report that nine us soldiers had been killed by their comrades 
and that more than 60 percent of the casualties had been caused by 
friendly fire 
in his first comment on the issue defense secretary dick cheney 
lamented the deaths saying such things will occur in complex 
night military operations where hightech weaponry is used 
i wished it had not happened on the other hand i dont think 
it detracts from the overall quality of the operation he told 
reporters after a pentagon briefing on the budget 
williams in his briefing said that of the 23 killed in action 
two rangers were killed by friendly fire at rio hato during an 
intense fire fight with the pdf panamanian defense force near 
dawn 
he added that there was one other possible death due to friendly 
fire and that it was under investigation 
of the 310 wounded in action it now appears that 16 were 
wounded by friendly fire in several isolated incidents throughout 
panama williams said 
yesterdays report of 19 wounded in action included some 
accidental injuries that we have now determined were not caused by 
hostile fire the spokesman said adding that since the cases 
were being looked at very closely the numbers could change again 
williams added that another 21 wounded during an intense night 
fire fight near the commandancia the headquarters of gen manuel 
noriega may be the result either of friendly fire from an ac130 
gun ship or pdf mortar fire it is impossible to distinguish 
whether they were wounded by friendly fire or by enemy fire 
if those americans were wounded by the gunship the incident 
might have been caught on the videotape that every ac130 gunship 
shots of its mission but williams said he did not know that for 
certain and was looking into it 
williams said the pentagon has looked into every case and deeply 
regrets any loss of life for whatever reason 
nothing can diminish the sacrifices that all these men made to 
their country casualties caused by friendly fire are an 
unfortunate circumstance of war he said 
the report in the june 25 newsweek issue quoted unidentified 
military officials as the source of its information 
williams said confusion over the deaths could have arisen 
because noriegas troops used ussupplied bullets and weapons

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze blamed 
soviet officials for fueling a chemical arms buildup to win an 
honor banner of socialist competition 
the outspoken soviet diplomat said in an interview with new 
times a soviet weekly that people were correct to point out 
imbalances in the weapons stocks of east and west and that those 
responsible for soviet advantages acted irresponsibly 
those who apparently not in a struggle with imperialism but 
in a drive to win an honor banner of socialist competition poured 
barrels full of chemical poisons at a time when the world had 
stopped producing them already should be called to account 
shevardnadze said 
the edition of new times containing the interview was scheduled 
for release friday the associated press obtained an advance copy 
tuesday from soviet sources 
shevardnadzes admission that the soviet side was to blame for 
imbalances in chemical weapons stocks came a few weeks after 
president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush signed an 
agreement on the issue in washington 
the pact concluded when the us and soviet foreign ministers 
met in moscow in may requires the superpowers to destroy 80 
percent of their chemical weapons immediately they would reduce 
their stocks to 2 percent of existing levels in the next eight 
years and destroy the rest two years later if all other countries 
capable of producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban 
officials said 
the united states has an estimated 30000 tons and the soviets 
50000 tons of the weapons according to government sources and 
independent experts 
in the interview shevardnadze did not identify which soviet 
officials were responsible for the chemical weapons buildup which 
he cited as an example of overall bad policy in the arms race 
our partners act like a rational hostess who buys only as much 
food as she needs to fix a lunch when the guests leave shes not 
left with a lot to throw away we had a different psychology buy 
everything and as much as possible only to discover later a mound 
of excess he said

a former landlady was ordered today to 
stand trial on charges of murdering nine elderly tenants of her 
boardinghouse in order to get their pension and disability benefits 
sacramento county municipal court judge gail ohanesian 
culminating a fiveweek preliminary hearing ruled that the 
61yearold dorothea puente should be arraigned in superior court 
on july 10 
i do find that there is ample evidence that death was by 
criminal means she said in ordering puente to stand trial on 
all the counts with which she had been charged 
puente was arrested after a social worker complained that one of 
her clients a roomer in puentes home had disappeared in 
november 1988 authorities dug up seven bodies from the grounds of 
the home a victorianstyle welling in downtown sacramento 
puente was later linked to two other deaths 
prosecutors said puente had a record of administering stupefying 
drugs to intended robbery victims and contended the matronly 
exconvict killed her victims for their social security and 
government benefit checks 
defense attorneys said the tenants who died ranging in age from 
52 to 80 and mostly poor and alcoholic did so either by natural 
causes or suicide among the victims ailments were a brain tumor 
lung disease heart disease and diabetes 
puente has pleaded innocent she could face the death penalty if 
convicted 
the judges ruling came more than seven weeks after the start of 
puentes preliminary hearing on april 27 but two of those weeks 
were spent in recess as defense lawyers prepared their case 
the hearing featured testimony by 70 prosecution witnesses and 
at least eight defense witnesses and more than 100 exhibits 
puente displayed little emotion throughout her hearing she sat 
quietly at the defense table occasionally writing notes to or 
leaning over to whisper to her attorneys

an air traffic control center handling 2 million 
flights a year has had more than 500 radio communication glitches 
this year creating a hazard in the skies union officials said 
six of about 40 sectors of airspace controlled by the center 
have suffered total radio failure during the last year leaving 
controllers and pilots with no way to communicate said james 
poole president of the national air traffic controller association 
chapter at the center 
union officials contended monday that the center is fraught with 
aging radio equipment lack of funding and bureaucratic delays in 
making repairs 
the regional center in suburban chicago controls planes over the 
central midwest including those bound for ohare international 
airport 
mort edelstein a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration acknowledged some problems at the center but said 
the faa is taking steps to correct them 
he said agency experts say the center is safe he contended 
there has been no case of loss of proper distance between planes 
due to radio problems in the last three years 
poole said the duration of the communication blackouts in the 
six airspace sectors ranged from about two minutes to about two 
hours they came after failure of three separate communications 
systems he said 
the air traffic system is extremely safe when everything is 
working said mark scholl chairman of the union chapters safety 
committee when you cant talk to the airplanes the system is 
not safe 
edelstein said communications improvements at the center have 
been extensive since april 1987 the faa has earmarked 740000 to

one of about 30 to 50 florida panthers 
believed to be surviving in the wild was struck and killed by a 
car game officials said tuesday 
it was the fourth of the endangered animals known to have died 
this year 
the 50pound 10monthold male was run over monday while 
crossing a remote road about six miles north of the big cypress 
seminole indian reservation in the everglades 
it was the 13th road kill of a panther since july 1984 
commission records show its the leading contributor to their 
demise right now said a commission spokesman lt jim huffstodt 
the previous panther deaths this year were from other causes 
walter mcgowan a biologist with the florida game and fresh 
water fish commission said that although the deaths are 
disturbing the panther population seems to have held its own or 
grown slightly during the past decade 
the animals we are following are reproducing and having young 
consistently and they seem to be replacing themselves he said 
but on the larger question of panther survival we just have no 
really hard answers

an associated press survey of congress shows 
that the vote on president bushs antiflagburning amendment is 
too close to call with undecided moderate democrats in control of 
its fate 
neither side in the politically charged battle could yet claim 
victory according to the survey the amendment was short of the 
required twothirds majority in both chambers but still could go 
over the top in the showdown just before congress fourth of july 
recess 
the house may vote as early as thursday and the senate by the 
end of next week 
i dont know what the vote outcome will be i expect it will 
be close senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said 
monday 
in the senate where 67 votes are needed to pass the amendment 
58 lawmakers surveyed favored it or were leaning in that direction 
while 24 were against or leaning against of the 18 who did not 
take a position 15 were democrats 
supporters and those leaning in favor outnumbered opponents 254 
to 114 in the house where 289 votes are required for passage of 
the 65 who were undecided or had no known position 54 were 
democrats 
the telephone survey was conducted late last week and monday 
some lawmakers responded in person and some through aides 
house democratic and republican leaders were working furiously 
behind closed doors to sway the undecideds in the final days before 
the vote 
both camps said they had won over some of the swing votes even 
though they stayed publicly uncommitted and both sides predicted 
the outcome could hinge on the decisions of a halfdozen lawmakers 
the fact that the survey found so many democrats still on the 
fence illustrates the political difficulty of the issue for the 
party 
republican campaign operatives have promised to use the flag 
vote to portray democrats opposing the amendment as less patriotic 
than their gop challengers and its already an issue in many races 
in the face of the gop threat the democratic leadership in both 
chambers has remained strongly against the amendment as a weakening 
of the first amendment but in deference to the divisions in the 
party and to those members with tough challenges they have been 
careful not to make it a party position 
mitchell kept up his rhetorical pressure monday saying that 
approval of the amendment would provide a victory for flagburners 
who seek to goad the nations leaders 
it will be a sad irony if a few obnoxious publicity seekers 
are able to stampede those who love america into changing the 
bill of rights he said 
house speaker thomas foley dwash has spoken out repeatedly 
against the amendment and has said he would vote against it making 
a rare exception to the tradition of the speaker not voting 
even that one vote could make the difference 
the survey showed that while the amendment is favored by the 
vast majority of republicans in each chamber and has divided the 
democrats there are many curious exceptions to the ideological 
pattern 
some of the most conservative republicans such as sen gordon 
humphrey rnh came out against the amendment while many liberal 
democrats supported it 
sen edward m kennedy dmass has spoken out against the 
amendment while his nephew rep joseph p kennedy dmass said 
he was undecided 
some senate democrats with tough races those who might seek 
political safety by voting for the flag amendment werent 
necessarily doing so 
sens daniel akaka dhawaii paul simon dill claiborne 
pell dri and tom harkin diowa all came out against the 
amendment akaka simon and harkin face challengers who plan to 
vote for the amendment in the house 
pells challenger rep claudine schneider rri said she 
also would vote against the amendment 
flag symbolism was used adroitly by bush in his 1988 
presidential campaign against democrat michael dukakis and 
democrats still fear it 
among congressional democrats who have been mentioned for the 
1992 presidential race sen lloyd bentsen dtexas put himself in 
the leaning yes category while sens albert gore dtenn and 
bill bradley dnj listed themselves as uncommitted sen 
charles robb dva said yes 
sen bob kerrey dneb has bucked the tide by coming out 
strongly against the amendment and accusing bush of trying to use 
the issue to reopen the generational animosities of the vietnam 
war kerry won a medal of honor in vietnam

experts who advise congress on taxes 
recommended a simplification package tuesday that could dilute the 
deduction for home mortgage interest 
two of three proposals for simplifying the tax treatment of 
nonbusiness interest would mean less than a full deduction of 
mortgage interest for many homeowners the third option would 
retain the existing deduction for mortgage interest 
either of the three recommendations would allow a deduction for 
at least some consumer interest including credit cards under 
present law only 10 percent of consumer interest is deductible for 
1990 starting next year no such deduction will be allowed 
overhaul of the deduction for nonbusiness interest was the most 
dramatic of a series of changes proposed in the name of 
simplification by the staff of the joint committee on taxation the 
recommendations were made to rep dan rostenkowski dill 
chairman of the house ways and means committee who earlier this 
year announced a renewed effort to simplify the tax laws 
rostenkowski released the proposals from the staff of the joint 
committee along with some from the treasury department and others 
from the democratic staff of his own committee the committee also 
received hundreds of pages of simplification suggestions from tax 
professionals and the public in general 
at the least we will have hearings on the proposals in the 
fall said a spokesman for ways and means those hearings will 
help determine whether an effort will be made to write a 
simplification bill he said 
treasury and the ways and means staff offered their own 
proposals for simplifying the interest deduction but neither went 
so far as the joint committee proposal that proposal included 
these options 
combine all nonbusiness interest including for mortgages 
consumer debt and investment borrowing and deduct a set 
percentage perhaps 75 percent 
deduct interest equal to net income on investments plus some 
additionl dollar amount 
retain a deduction as under present law for mortgage 
interest and allow a separate writeoff for other interest limited 
to net investment income the portion of other interest that could 
not be deducted in the first year because of the limitation could 
be carried over into future years 
the joint committee staff said either of the recommendations 
would minimize complexity of present law in addition the first 
option would remove the incentive for individuals to structure 
loans as homeequity debt in order to avoid the presentlaw limit 
on the deductibilty of personal interest the report stated 
present law has one set of rules for mortgage interest another 
for investment interest and a third for credit cards and other 
consumer debt 
the treasury department said there is a need to simplify the 
paperwork burden on families who employ domestics and other 
household workers 
the department said it is not ready to make a specific 
recommendation but is exploring the feasibility of requiring 
annual rather than quarterly tax filings by household employers

the defendant in criminal case no 900068 
wore a red carnation in his left lapel as he arrived at us 
district court at the last minute he seemed in low spirits 
not a word passed between marion barry mayor of the district of 
columbia and his wife effi as they walked slowly down the 
hallway 
they seemed in no hurry to get to the courtroom on the second 
floor 
few events save of course the verdict are as tough on the 
defendant in a criminal trial as the opening statements by lawyers 
thats when the gloves come off and the defendant hears the 
allegations put in the harshest possible light 
assistant us attorney richard roberts called barry a dope 
user a liar and a hypocrite 
as the mayor looked down at the defense table and fidgeted with 
paper and pen roberts said barry was preaching against using drugs 
while snorting dope up his nose using hand gestures roberts 
said a videotape would show barry smoking crack just like this 
barry averted his eyes 
defense lawyer kenneth mundy painted a different picture of the 
former eagle scout charged with possessing cocaine and lying to a 
grand jury he said the mayor was trapped by prosecutors who 
provided the drugs and the pipe 
mundy was particularly scornful of charles lewis a convicted 
drug dealer and the major government witness lewis mundy said 
was willing to put to music any tune the government wanted him to 
play 
in the front row scarcely five feet behind her husband sat 
effi barry the 54yearold mayors third wife 
barry is a 1960s civil rights activist who organized lunch 
counter sitins demonstrations and boycotts in the south he first 
was elected mayor in 1978 
the mayors limousine arrived at a side door of the courthouse 
only three minutes before the start of the 10 am trial barry was 
in the back seat with his coat off 
news photographers were on all four sides of the building but 
the heaviest concentration had their lenses aimed at the circular 
driveway where the limousine pulled up barry obliged them with a 
wan smile and a wave as he put on his coat 
the smile vanished in the nearempty courthouse corridor a 
reporter asked the mayor how he felt and barry managed a fine 
courthouse guards whose habit it is to be deferential to celebrity 
defendants cleared a path through a nonexistent crowd 
us district judge thomas penfield jacksons courtroom is the 
same one used by us district judge john j sirica for the 
watergate coverup trial 15 years ago 
about 80 people waited to get into the courtroom only a dozen 
made it 
in the past as the mayors case moved toward trial there had 
been demonstrations outside the courthouse tinged with accusations 
that the case against barry would never have been brought were he 
not black 
us attorney jay stephens is white 
but there were no demonstrators on this first day the citys 
business went on as usual 
in washingtons city hall 10 blocks away from the courthouse 
councilwoman betty ann kane introduced a resolution calling on 
barry to work for a voluntary early retirement program for city 
employees 
barry has already announced he wont seek a fourth term but 
pointedly said he would not retire early

as it has for the past decade new york is 
importing a dash of genuine ticker tape to give an oldtime flavor 
to nelson mandelas parade on wednesday 
about 150 miles of the inchwide paper ribbon was shipped here 
friday in 85 plastic bags from translux corp in norwalk conn 
which believes it is the last supplier in what once was a nation of 
stock tickers and tape computers have almost completely replaced 
tickers 
the city still calls a ride through its canyon of heroes on 
lower broadway a tickertape parade although what snows down 
on the lionized these days is mainly computer cards and fanfold 
printout paper 
oldtimers say the cards simply cannot duplicate the look of 
streaming ticker tape the blizzard effect one sees in film of 
the great parade for charles a lindbergh in 1927 
but with a token amount of tape mixed with all the other 
confetti mandela will know hes having a tickertape parade 
said translux spokesman matt brandt 
city sanitation department spokesman vito turso suggested that 
the best stuff to shower on mandela from environmental and 
economic points of view would be shredded old telephone 
directories 
also fax paper which is not recyclable he said but 
manila stock ibm cards are worth 320 a ton from a recycler 
computer paper 220 a ton and white bond 180 a ton

the number of states with alternative routes 
for certifying teachers is growing but few focus on recruiting 
older educated adults with reallife experiences a study said 
tuesday 
emily feistritzer director of the national center for education 
information said a study found that most alternative teacher 
certification programs for people who have not completed a 
traditional college teacher education program are tied to teacher 
shortages 
since the shortages have not materialized as educators 
originally had predicted very few teachers are entering the 
profession through the alternate routes she said 
very few states in this nation have actually designed a 
certification path specifically to meet the demand created by the 
new and growing market of adults who already have at least a 
bachelors degree and want to teach said feistritzer 
connecticut new jersey texas arizona and arkansas are the 
best at opening their schools to such wouldbe teachers because 
job offers are available to people who have a bachelors degree in 
any subject according to the study 
however arizona accepts such teachers only at the secondary 
school level and arkansas uses them only when there are teacher 
shortages 
the united states has hired about 1 million new teachers in the 
last five years but only about 12000 have been certified through 
alternative teacher certification routes since 1985 
the center a private education research organization conducted 
a statebystate study from december 1989 to may 1990 thirtythree 
states report they are implementing alternative routes to the 
stateapproved college teacher education program for certifying 
teachers up from 23 less than two years ago eight states were 
implementing alternatives in 1983 
about a third of the states say they use alternative routes only 
if a traditionally certified teacher cannot be found the study 
said 
there is enormous variation in the alternative routes the study 
found however it said most states require a bachelors degree at 
least a cplus college grade average and passage of a basic skills 
test and sometimes a specialty area test 
the study said connecticut new jersey and texas have about the 
best statedesigned alternative programs available in all fields at 
all grade levels arizona idaho louisiana ohio and virginia 
offer programs only at the secondary level 
states that offer alternative programs only in areas of teacher 
shortages are alabama arkansas california georgia maine new 
york oregon and south carolina hawaii missouri and oklahoma 
offer alternative programs only in shortage areas at the high 
school level 
some states the study said favor emergency licensing 
emergency certificates usually are issued at a superintendents 
request and allow people to begin teaching fulltime while taking 
courses in traditional teacher education programs 
census bureau statistics show that in 1970 there were 4 million 
more children of school age 5 to 17 years old than there were 
adults between the ages of 25 and 44 years today there are 34 
million more adults in that age category alone than there are 
children between 5 and 17 years 
in 1970 one in 10 of the 110 million adults 25 years and older 
had a college degree the statistics show today one in five of 
the 150 million do the bureau of labor statistics says one in four 
college graduates in the work force holds a job that does not 
require a college degree 
feistritzer said the united states has an opportunity it has 
never had before to bring adults who are educated who have 
experience in the real world and who have a passion for improving 
the nations educational system into its teaching force

the us ambassador to romania will boycott 
the presidential inauguration in bucharest on wednesday to show 
concern over the governmentinspired mob violence last week 
against peaceful demonstrators a spokesman said tuesday 
deputy state department spokesman richard boucher also expressed 
distress that the romanian government had taken no action against 
coal miners and others responsible for the attacks against the 
demonstrators 
the inauguration of president ion iliescu who has headed an 
interim government in romania since last december had been 
scheduled for last week but was postponed until wednesday because 
of the turmoil 
boucher said other envoys in bucharest were planning to join 
ambassador alan green in boycotting the inauguration he was unable 
to say how many may do so 
green returned to romania on monday after consultations in 
washington he met tuesday with leaders of two opposition parties 
and with members of a nonpartisan organization one of the party 
headquarters had been ransacked during the governmentinspired 
mob violence last week boucher said 
boucher renewed the us governments call for the release of 
the more than 1000 people who he said were arrested for protesting 
peacefully 
we call on the government to ensure that fundamental human 
rights and the rule of law apply equally to all romanian 
decisions he said 
boucher also criticized a romanian parliamentary chamber for 
approving on monday a proposal to give police and soldiers the 
authority to move against antigovernment demonstrators assembled 
in a bucharest square saying that could suppress dissent 
boucher also urged that the secret police be dismantled and that 
legitimate national security concerns be subordinated to democratic 
controls 
the disturbances last week erupted less than a month after 
iliescu won election to the presidency by a wide margin his 
critics suspect him of continuing to harbor the communist 
sympathies he once espoused when he was associated with the regime 
of president nicolae ceausescu who was ousted in a bloody revolt 
last december ceausescu fired iliescu in 1984 
boucher announced last friday that all nonhumanitarian aid 
would be withheld from romania because of the actions against the 
protestors about 80 million in food aid and 1 million in medical 
aid were not affected by the decision

president petar mladenov appealed to all 
parties tuesday to leave their political differences behind but 
opposition leaders reaffirmed their refusal to join a government 
with the former communists 
the former communists who now call themselves socialists on 
monday became the only ones in eastern europe to win free elections 
after four decades of unchallenged rule 
those who seek to find winners and losers behind the figures 
would make a mistake mladenov said according to the state bta 
news agency he said he would convene the new parliament within one 
month but gave no date 
mladenov repeated his desire to see a competent government 
supported by the entire country bta reported 
but petar beron a leading member of the main opposition 
alliance the union of democratic forces udf said the socialists 
should form a government alone 
its up to the communists they have the majority so let them 
form the government beron said 
the socialists won 211 of the parliaments 400 seats in two 
rounds of balloting bulgarias first free elections in 58 years 
the udf won 144 seats or 47 percent of the vote giving it 
considerable sway in the legislature 
beron and other opposition leaders spoke to reporters during a 
break in a udf coordinating council session held to discuss future 
strategy in parliament 
while most udf leaders seemed adamant in rejecting any kind of 
cooperation with the socialists informed sources said that 
behindthescenes contacts were imminent 
socialist leaders were said to have already approached the 
social democrats one of the strongest parties in the 16member 
alliance for possible cooperation however this could not be 
independently confirmed 
another udf official suggested that after municipal elections 
scheduled for the fall the opposition might consider a coalition 
if the former communists were knocked out of power at lower levels 
but udf spokesman georgi spasov appeared to rule out any 
compromise 
if somebody as an individual is invited by the socialists 
no one will serve as a puppet in my opinion he told reporters 
a senior member of the independent trade union podkrepa 
lyubomir pavlov also ruled out opposition participation in a 
government 
they the socialists would obstruct real economic reform in 
a coalition cabinet pavlov said they are not for radical 
economic reform 
the socialists have said they favor gradual transition to a 
market economy while opposing privatization of agriculture on a 
large scale 
the udf of which podkrepa is a member favors more radical 
economic reforms including privatization 
in an interview with the associated press on monday premier 
andrei lukanov said it is an illusion to believe that 
privatization would essentially improve agricultural output 
pavlov said the possibility of a caretaker government could only 
be considered in the event of a prolonged government crisis 
meanwhile in a meeting with the press zhivko stalev head of 
the central electoral commission said the panel had received a 
series of complaints from the various parties competing in the 
elections 
stalev noted that the majority of complaints concerned problems 
with electoral lists distribution of ballots on election day 
outside the polling stations the representation of political 
parties in electoral commissions and inadmissible counting of 
invalid votes and empty envelopes 
other complaints related to political agitation on election day 
the removal of ballots from voting booths and the sometimes 
inadequate privacy of voters 
some foreign observers had pointed out that in some cases the 
canvas of makeshift booths was transparent 
stalev said all complaints would be passed on to a commission to 
be set up by the new parliament for further action

bulgaria the balkan country held its first free multiparty 
elections in 58 years on june 10 and 17 
the ruling socialist party which until april was the communist 
party clinched an absolute majority with 211 of parliaments 400 
seats 
the main opposition union of democratic forces a 16party 
alliance captured 144 seats the agrarian party a once docile 
ally of the communists won 16 seats and the rest went to small 
opposition groups and independents 
bulgaria is the first eastern european nation to freely elect a 
parliament dominated by the former communist party 
analysts say the socialists won because of bulgarias deep 
communist tradition which goes back nearly 100 years and fears 
that a rapid switch to private ownership as advocated by the 
opposition would cost jobs

an epidemic of dangerous pregnancies in which the 
fetus develops outside the womb is afflicting expectant mothers 
many of whom have had a common and often symptomfree sexual 
infection researchers say 
the number of such pregnancies called ectopic pregnancies 
increased fourfold from 1970 to 1985 hitting 78400 women that 
year researchers reported in wednesdays journal of the american 
medical association 
a womans risk of developing an ectopic pregnancy which causes 
11 percent of maternal deaths more than doubles if she has had the 
bacterial infection chlamydia trachomatis the researchers said 
they based their conclusion on tests of 306 women with ectopic 
pregnancies and 266 women with normal pregnancies 
chlamydia is an epidemic in itself infecting an estimated 4 
million people a year more than any other sexually transmitted 
disease according to the national centers for disease control in 
atlanta 
an unlookedfor finding of the study was that women who douched 
had almost as high a risk of developing ectopic pregnancies as 
women who had a history of chlamydial infection the researchers 
said 
the reasons are unclear but the findings support previous 
studies said the researchers they speculated that douching may 
propel bacteria from the lower genital tract to the normally 
sterile upper genital tract 
when bacteria invade the upper genital tract the resulting 
infection can scar the fallopian tubes blocking the normal path 
that eggs travel from the ovaries to the womb 
that is what often happens in untreated chlamydial infections 
said julius schachter a coauthor of the study and a professor of 
epidemiology and laboratory medicine at the university of 
california san francisco 
what is dangerous is that it chlamydia can cause an upper 
genital tract infection without causing symptoms schachter said 
in a telephone interview 
the first time a woman finds out shes had it is when she has 
a bad outcome either infertility or ectopic pregnancy 
in 97 percent of ectopic pregnancies the fertilized egg lodges 
in the fallopian tubes where as the fetus enlarges it can rupture 
the tubes or cause severe bleeding 
such pregnancies though dangerous can now be detected early 
and ended surgically 
you cant prevent this by treating a symptomatic woman because 
shes never had symptoms schachter said what we need is a 
chlamydia control program to reduce infection and prevent 
complications 
such a program involving routine screening of sexually active 
young people and treating those found to be infected already 
exists for gonorrhea schachter said 
that disease infects an estimated 15 million people a year and 
is another major cause of ectopic pregnancy says the cdc 
starting a control program for chlamydia would cost an estimated 
50 million he said citing a cdc figure 
that would be highly costeffective because chlamydia costs 
billions of dollars in complications said schachter who has 
previously reported that chlamydia infects up to one in 20 pregnant 
women 60 percent of whom pass it to their newborns who may get 
pneumonia or eye inflammation as a result 
schachter and his colleagues also recommended further research 
into the practice of douching changes in douching habits if they 
reduced ectopic pregnancies could have a quicker impact than a 
chlamydia control program they said 
however dr bruce b dan of the american medical association 
disagreed he called for caution in blaming douching for ectopic 
pregnancy and said physicians would do better by telling women at 
every opportunity how to protect themselves from acquiring 
chlamydial infections 
this strategy would also serve to decrease the incidence of 
gonorrhea syphilis human immunodeficiency virus infection which 
causes aids and hepatitis b infection something a change in 
douching habits is unlikely to do dan added in an editorial 
accompanying the study 
a related study in wednesdays journal found that most of 323 
pregnant women with chlamydial infections responded to antibiotic 
treatment and suffered significantly fewer pregnancy problems than 
those who didnt respond to treatment

leaders from 33 african countries many 
facing growing opposition at home gathered under tight security 
tuesday for a summit with french president francois mitterrand 
navy patrol boats 12 companies of riot police and more than 
1500 regular police officers were deployed in and around this posh 
beach resort as delegations arrived for the threeday summit 
french officials said 22 delegations would be led by a head of 
state two by prime ministers and nine by lesserranking cabinet 
ministers 
frenchafrican summits have been held every two years since the 
early 1960s this years gathering coincides with unprecedented 
political turbulence in frenchspeaking africa and unusually harsh 
domestic criticism of frances policies in its former colonies 
on tuesday prominent newspapers on the political right and left 
said france had persisted too long in supporting corrupt 
repressive african governments 
the french government speaks of democracy and continues to 
support dictatorial bloodstained regimes said lhumanite 
newspaper of frances communist party 
mitterrand in an interview with the prominent daily le monde 
accused other western countries of indifference toward africa and 
said france would never abandon the continent french aid money was 
subject to extremely rigorous review to ensure it was properly 
spent he said 
there have been antigovernment protests and demands for an end 
to oneparty rule in many african countries in recent months in 
several countries leaders have pledged to allow political 
pluralism 
two of frenchspeaking africas senior leaders felix 
houphouetboigny of ivory coast and mobutu sese seko of zaire are 
not attending the summit both recently made concessions to 
opposition groups by proposing multiparty systems mobutu has been 
beset by calls for an international inquiry into an alleged 
massacre of scores of university students by security forces 
mitterrand during a visit last week to four indian ocean 
nations that belong to the organization of african unity said 
france was committed to remaining a spokesman for underdeveloped 
counties 
there is no democracy without development he said 
during the summit ivory coast gabon cameroon and congo are 
expected to receive new concessions from france regarding their 
foreign debt because these countries are classified as 
middleincome they have not been helped by previous moves by 
france and other western countries to write off large portions of 
foreign debt for several poor countries 
after an opening banquet tuesday night the summit was to 
continue with closeddoor discussions wednesday the closing 
ceremony thursday is to be followed by a news conference featuring 
mitterrand moroccos king hassan ii who was host of the previous

consumer direct maintains that no substantial hazard existed and 
that it did not violate statutory reporting requirements 
however the company agreed in november 1988 to a repair program 
to retrofit 2 million gut busters with devices that would avoid 
the spring breakages

bridge builders east of the rockies must learn 
the lessons of last years deadly earthquake in california 
researchers said tuesday 
a major eastern earthquake will happen its just a question 
of when james cooper deputy chief structural engineer with the 
federal highway administration told about 250 bridge architects 
and state highway officials attending the international bridge 
conference in pittsburgh 
bridges are especially imperiled when built on soft soils and 
underlying hard rock a combination found in many eastern cities 
scientists say the condition amplifies tremors 
an earthquake is like an explosion sending energy in all 
directions us geological survey seismologist bob hamilton said 
in a telephone interview from reston va in the east the energy 
waves travel much further the crust is older and cooler less 
broken up by mountain building 
out west the mountain building is still going on the crust 
is busted up reducing the amplitude of an earthquake 
rocky ground covers most of the west exceptions are san 
francisco and oakland calif parts of which are built on soft 
ground known as bay mud 
the sections of the doubledecker interstate880 in oakland that 
collapsed during the oct 17 earthquake was built on bay mud 
klaus jacob a columbia university seismologist noted that 
other sections of the highway built on harder ground withstood the 
quake jacob said i880 was weakened by that extra jello pudding 
layer under the structure 
in the east major underground faults lie in the central 
mississippi river valley new england and south carolina 
the last major eastern quake in 1895 was centered near the 
junction of the ohio and mississippi rivers in charleston mo an 
1886 earthquake near charleston sc leveled most of the city and 
killed 20 people 
shock waves from an earthquake east of the rockies would travel 
30 to 40 times farther than waves from the same quake in 
california jacob said the us geological survey estimates more 
conservatively that such a quake would travel 20 times as far 
for example three thundering quakes in 181112 near the 
frontier settlement of new madrid mo were felt 850 miles away in 
washington dc 
we have the luxury in the east of having time between our 
earthquakes jacob said another new madrid earthquake may be 
around the corner tomorrow we should use the time we have to make 
repairs 
after the 1971 san fernando quake in california the state spent 
54 million to tie together sections of 1200 bridges with steel 
cables 
if a bridge isnt tied when it starts doing that wave it 
will bounce off its supports said james roberts chief bridge 
engineer for the california department of transportation 
california engineers also are experimenting with collaring 
bridge columns in steel which could have saved i880 said ian 
buckle deputy director of the national center for earthquake 
engineering research in buffalo ny 
buckle said state transportation officials should consider both 
methods when patching up aging bridges or building new ones 
the federal highway adminstration in its 1989 report to 
congress said 413 percent of the nations 577710 bridges were 
either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete

a man hijacked a soviet airliner with 
60 people aboard tuesday and then surrendered to finnish 
authorities and sought political asylum he asked to be taken to 
the united states the interior minister said 
it was the third hijacking of a soviet passenger plane in less 
than two weeks 
the 55 passengers and five crew members safely left the 
aircraft which was parked beside a runway at helsinki airport and 
surrounded by police the hijacker gave up an hour later after 
talks with finnish officials through a cabin door of the twinjet 
aeroflot tupolev 134 
the passengers all soviets were flown to the soviet city of 
murmansk later tuesday 
the soviet deputy aviation minister mikhail timofeev 
identified the hijacker as oleg kozlov timofeev said the man 
threatened to blow up the plane he said a fake hand grenade was 
seized 
finnish interior minister jarmo rantanen said no explosives were 
found on the plane but that the 20yearold hijacker had a 
bomblike object under his jacket 
his real aim was apparently the united states rantanen told 
a news conference he wants out he wants to go to the usa 
the hijacker requested asylum but processing the request could 
take weeks rantanen said 
a 1974 sovietfinnish agreement aimed at preventing hijackings 
says the suspect must be returned to the soviet union at moscows 
request some observers said however that kozlovs request for 
asylum could be granted or he could face trial in finland 
the plane was en route from the latvian capital of riga to 
murmansk on the northern kola peninsula when it was hijacked said 
irmeli paavola of the finnish aviation authority 
nothing terrible happened in the aircraft one passenger 
identified only as anatoli told finnish tv the crew announced 
that the plane had been commanded to divert its route they said we 
are flying abroad 
finnish radio said two finnish fighter jets escorted the soviet 
airliner to helsinki as a precaution 
the soviet news agency tass said a civil aviation ministry 
commission would investigate the hijacking the third since june 9 
on monday a 29yearold pilot valeri yuricevic commandeered a 
12seat antonov2 aircraft in izmail near the ukrainian port of 
odessa and flew to turkey where he asked for asylum there was no 
one else on board 
ihsan dede governor of the province of kocaeli where yuricevic 
landed said the pilot told authorities he wanted to escape the 
undemocratic regime and harsh life conditions in the soviet union 
on june 9 dimitry semionov a 17yearold soviet youth used a 
fake hand grenade to hijack a plane carrying 121 passengers during 
a flight from minsk to murmansk 
the plane was forced to fly to stockholm where semionov 
surrendered he said later through a lawyer that he had acted on 
impulse after a family quarrel and wanted to go to a free 
country 
semionov was arraigned in a stockholm court and could face up to 
four years in prison depending on results of psychiatric tests

the pentagon revised its figures tuesday on 
the number of soldiers accidentally wounded by their comrades in 
the panama invasion saying 16 of 310 servicemen wounded in action 
were hit by friendly fire 
pentagon spokesman pete williams also raised the possibility 
that another 21 us servicemen might have been wounded by an us 
air force ac130 gunship and that if the incident occurred it may 
have been captured on the planes video camera 
williams said it is presently impossible to distinguish 
whether the 21 were injured by the gunship or from mortar fire of 
panamanian defense forces during the dec 20 military operation 
he said hed asked for a review of the video to check whether 
the incident might be on tape 
in his statement williams said the pentagon stood by its 
initial count that two and perhaps three us servicemen had 
been killed by friendly fire the third case was still under study 
williams said 
the pentagon has refused to identify which of the 23 servicemen 
killed in panama died under such circumstances 
on monday the department had said 19 of some 324 soldiers 
wounded in action had been hit accidentally by their comrades the 
figures issued tuesday changed both the number hit by friendly fire 
and the total number of wounded 
williams said the department had refined the figures in an 
overnight study of the death reports 
the review was prompted by a newsweek magazine report that nine 
us soldiers had been killed by their comrades and that more than 
60 percent of the woundings had been caused by friendly fire 
williams also disputed the articles contention that there were 
more than a dozen leaks about the military operation 
i know of no socalled leaks williams said adding that 
there is no evidence that information was in the hands of the 
pdf the spokesman noted that with the massive movement of us 
troops that got under way prior to the invasion there was much 
speculation about the event but that it was not compromised 
in his first comment on the issue defense secretary dick cheney 
lamented the deaths by friendly fire saying such things occur in 
complex nighttime military operations where hightech weaponry is 
used 
i wish it had not happened on the other hand i dont think it 
detracts from the overall quality of the operation he told 
reporters after a pentagon briefing on the budget 
williams in his briefing said that of the 23 killed in action 
two rangers were killed by friendly fire at rio hato during an 
intense fire fight with the pdf panamanian defense force near 
dawn 
of the 310 wounded in action it now appears that 16 were 
wounded by friendly fire in several isolated incidents throughout 
panama williams said 
yesterdays report of 19 wounded in action included some 
accidental injuries that we have now determined were not caused by 
hostile fire the spokesman said adding that since the cases 
were being looked at very closely the numbers could change again 
williams said the pentagon has looked into every case and deeply

rival christian forces fought with 
howitzers and mortars across the christian enclave tuesday in a 
confrontation that killed four people and was the most serious 
violation of monthold ceasefire 
police said six people were injured in the battles which began 
at 945 am and subsided five hours later a french government 
envoy francois scheer met in west beirut with president elias 
hrawi in an effort to salvage a vatican plan for ending the 
christian warfare 
the new casualties raised the overall toll to 1040 killed and 
2780 wounded since the battle for control of the christian enclave 
erupted jan 30 the fighting is between troops of gen michel aoun 
and militiamen of samir geageas lebanese forces a ceasefire was 
declared may 17 
the latest battles covered most of the 310squaremile christian 
enclave the streets of east beirut and the surrounding hinterland 
were deserted as people huddled in basements and bomb shelters 
a police spokesman said it could not be determined who started 
the clashes but noted that tension had been mounting since monday 
when lebanons president rejected a vatican proposal for a 
permanent settlement to the conflict 
the vatican has suggested reconsideration of an accord designed 
to end lebanons 15yearold civil war it was that accord 
supported by the arab league that led to hrawis election as 
president 
in return for reconsidering the accord aoun would agree to 
recognize hrawis government the vatican suggested 
prime minister salim hoss and parliament speaker hussein 
husseini backed hrawi in his opposition to the idea 
the french government is helping lebanon to overcome the 
difficulties it is facing scheer told reporters after the 
90minute meeting with hrawi the dialogue led by france could 
help support the mechanism of the taif accord scheer added 
referring to the saudi arabian city in which the accord was reached 
scheer said he also planned to meet the vatican ambassador while 
in lebanon the ambassador papal nuncio pablo puente met tuesday 
with aoun at the generals headquarters outside beirut we are 
seeking peace through peace puente told reporters after the 
meeting 
france and the vatican have been the christians main backers 
since lebanons independence from france in 1943 neighboring syria 
backs the moslems 
the conservative newspaper addiyar reported tuesday that scheer 
was promoting a fivepoint compromise plan that called for 
recognition of the hrawi government by all the warring factions in 
addition to recognizing the taif accord as a frame for a national 
settlement 
the compromise also called for the formation of an expanded 
national government respresenting all the factions this echoed 
the vaticans suggestion that aoun be given a government portfolio 
the french proposal according to the report said the taif 
accord should be debated in parliament and the decision on passing 
or rejecting it should be left to the house 
it called for parliamentary elections as soon as possible 
the newspaper added 
aoun has rejected the taif agreement because it does not include 
a deadline for the withdrawal of syrian soldiers from lebanon 
syria has about 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 mandate to 
quell civil war fighting but aoun maintains they violated that 
mandate by siding with the moslems in the war

the government appealed for talks with 
the opposition tuesday but also pressed its crackdown on dissent by 
arresting two prominent critics of presidentelect ion iliescu 
the wife of an iliescu opponent detained earlier on charges of 
involvement in last weeks antigovernment violence took refuge at 
the dutch ambassadors residence 
there was no sign of organized protest at university square 
where demonstrators gathered sunday and monday in defiance of the 
violent suppression of dissent 
riot police june 13 brutally broke up a 53day antiiliescu 
demonstration on the square and rioters later attacked government 
buildings with firebombs 
thousands of coal miners summoned by iliescu to help keep order 
then poured into the capital from around the nation and roamed the 
streets for two days clubbing anyone they considered opponents of 
the president they left friday also at iliescus behest 
authorities appeared to be adopting a strategy of talking to 
opposition groups while detaining their leaders and sanctioning 
police action against any further illegal demonstrations 
a communique carried by the state rompres news agency said 
interior minister doru viorel ursu and the romanian information 
service had invited student organizations and intellectuals to 
discuss problems of common interest 
the information service is the intelligence agency that replaced 
the feared secret police of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
who was toppled and executed in the december revolution 
it was unclear whether demonstrators stayed away from the square 
because of the talks at the university of bucharest students of 
several departments began or planned strikes 
government opponents seek the ouster of iliescu and other former 
communists who hold top posts in the governing national salvation 
front it took power during the revolution and won parliamentary 
elections by a landslide last month 
iliescu was to be inaugurated wednesday and us embassy 
spokesman virgil bodeen said no american representative would 
attend because of us displeasure over how his government has 
dealth with the unrest 
parliaments lower house voted monday to give police and 
soldiers the authority to clear protesters from university square 
and urged police to take immediate action against unauthorized 
protests 
the interior ministry identified the opposition figures arrested 
tuesday as dumitru dinca and nica leon leader of the small 
national democratic party 
it said dinca was charged with larceny and instigation toward 
committing major crimes while leon was accused of destruction 
of public property 
the two were being held as part of an investigation into the 
53day antigovernment protest and subsequent unrest the 
government said 
on monday authorities detained marian munteanu a student 
leader severely beaten by miners he was moved from his hospital 
bed to an unidentified interior ministry hospital on charges of 
instigating violence 
dutch ambassador coen f stork said he offered haven to 
munteanus wife claudia after she said that she was very scared 
to move about after what happened to her husband 
stork said mrs munteanu would likely leave his home soon 
she has not asked for asylum she is just my guest said the 
diplomat a key western critic of romanias human rights record 
under ceausescu 
the government reacted sharply to the development 
munteanu is not a political prisoner but a criminal it said 
in a statement we have nothing against his wife and we are 
astounded that she chose the dutch embassy asking for refuge 
the interior ministry suggested most of the 1021 people 
detained last week had been set free it said in a statement that 
69 had been charged with major crimes and 182 with petty crimes 
state television said the violence last week caused 75 million 
in damage 
foreign governments including the united states have condemned 
the way romania has handled protests and numerous countries have 
suspended all but humanitarian aid 
stork warned against drawing parallels between the iliescu 
governments behavior and the brutal suppression of dissent under 
ceausescu 
theres a little flurry of human rights cases now he said 
its not to be confused with the previous period in those days 
people didnt dare to ask for help from western embassies 
the opposition romania libera daily published tuesday for the 
first time since miners shut the paper down thursday but copies of 
the 800000circulation daily were difficult to find 
editor mihai creanga suggested there were some hitches in 
publishing but refused to elaborate 
in an editorial the paper indirectly criticized the 
antigovernment rioting and iliescus use of miners to crush the 
opposition 
in a democratic state there is no room for instigation to 
violence because as we know violence breeds violence the 
daily said 
in paris the international federation of newspaper publishers 
protested tuesday to iliescu over attacks on members of the staff 
and offices of the newspaper

a woman who ran a boardinghouse was 
ordered tuesday to stand trial on nine murder counts for allegedly 
poisoning her mostly elderly tenants to get their pension and 
disability benefits 
dorothea puente 61 was ordered to be arraigned july 10 in 
sacramento county superior court the order by county municipal 
court judge gail ohanesian culminated a five week preliminary 
hearing 
i do find that there is ample circumstantial evidence that 
death was by criminal means the judge said adding that there 
was sufficient evidence that puente had the opportunity to kill 
for financial gain 
puente who has displayed little emotion throughout her hearing 
sat quietly at the defense table 
puente was orderd to stand trial on all the counts with which 
she had been charged she could face the death penalty if convicted 
prosecutors said her murder trial could last at least six months 
she has pleaded innocent and defense attorneys insisted she 
would be aquitted 
there is totally insufficient evidence to convict her or 
anybody else based on the quality of evidence that has been 
presented in court in this case assistant public defender kevin 
clymo said 
puente was arrested after a social worker complained that one of 
her clients a roomer in puentes downtown home had disappeared 
in november 1988 authorities dug up seven bodies from the grounds 
of the victorianstyle dwelling 
she was later implicated in two other deaths that of a woman 
who died of a drug overdose at puentes house and that of a man 
whose body was found in a wooden box in a neighboring county 
prosecutors said puente has a record of administering stupefying 
drugs to intended robbery victims they contend the matronly 
exconvict killed her victims for their social security and 
government benefit checks 
defense attorneys said the alleged victims ranging from age 52 
to 80 and mostly poor and alcoholic died either by suicide or 
natural causes among their ailments were a brain tumor lung 
disease heart disease and diabetes 
the preliminary hearing featured 17 days of testimony by nearly 
80 witnesses and more than 100 exhibits much of the testimony 
focused on the causes of death 
in only one death the first one was a cause ever listed ruth 
munroe 61 died april 28 1982 from an overdose of codeine and 
tylenol that death was considered to be either accidental or a 
suicide until investigators began digging up bodies from the yard 
a prescription tranquilizer flurazepam or dalmane was detected 
in all seven bodies that had been buried in shallow graves on the 
boardinghouse grounds 
the medications role if any in the deaths is unclear the 
bodies buried anywhere from weeks to years were too decomposed 
for autopsies to determine the cause of deaths 
a total of nine other drugs were found in the boardinghouse 
bodies all seven people had been puentes tenants and their 
doctors and fellow boarders have testified that most of them were 
heavy drinkers 
the ninth murder charge was filed in connection with the death 
of everson theodore gillmouth a 77yearold oregon man who was 
puentes fiance and roommate when he died his body was found by 
fishermen on new years day 1986 in a wooden box on a bank of the 
sacramento river in sutter county

heavy thunderstorms and tornadoes crimped cleanup efforts on 
tuesday by iowa and south dakota residents who are still reeling 
from weekend weather and nebraska reported its first fatality from 
recent floods 
after morning rains added 1 to 2 inches to watersheds of flooded 
rivers iowa gov terry branstad added 11 counties to 22 already 
declared disaster areas that brings the total to onethird of the 
states 99 counties 
the national weather service said no appreciable additional 
flooding was expected three deaths in iowa have been blamed on the 
most recent storms 
police in des moines asked employers to send workers home early 
because storm sewers had backed up clogging major streets leading 
out of downtown 
in the central iowa town of jewell about 55 miles north of des 
moines a tornado struck the center building at south hamilton high 
school where maintenance worker don strangeland recounted the 
damage i heard the roof just peeling off the school 
just a little north of there in webster city another tornado 
destroyed outbuildings and killed about 30 hogs on a 700acre farm 
two months ago we were concerned about the drought and now 
here we are faced with major flooding the governor said 
branstad said agricultural damage could be severe unless flood 
waters recede soon theres a considerable amount thats been 
flooded and its getting very late as far as replanting he said 
thunderstorms on monday night also carried heavy rain across the 
central and eastern part of south dakota where residents were 
still cleaning up from saturday nights violent weather 
cleanup efforts continued in the southeastern south dakota towns 
of beresford and alcester where a tornado swept through the area 
causing more than 1 million in damage to 24 farms 
in alcester neighbors spent sunday and monday helping each 
other out police chief kevin booker said residents with pickups 
helped haul away trees that blocked up to onethird of the streets 
in town 
in the country neighbors helped remove debris so farmers could 
get back to their fields to replant crops torn up from the tornado 
and high winds 
a 77yearold west point neb man was found drowned 
apparently the first person to die in flood waters that have 
plagued northeast nebraska for nearly a week a relative found the 
body 1 blocks from the mans home two miles south of west point 
near the elkhorn river said cuming county sheriff larry thiem 
more storms ravaged southcentral and northeastern nebraska on 
monday night causing authorities to ask residents of king lake in 
northern douglas county to evacuate as the elkhorn river reached 
flood stage 
floods also struck further east 
in pennsylvania thunderstorms moved throughout the state 
saturating farmland flooding basements and causing scattered power 
outages authorities said no injuries were reported 
the heaviest thunderstorms were reported in rosencrans clinton 
county and ohiopyle fayette county the weather service said 
about 200 mckean county residents were without power in several 
small afternoon outages caused by lightning and downed power lines 
said bill manning a foreman for pennsylvania electric co 
and in eastern ohio recovery efforts continued in the ohio 
river town of shadyside where flash floods last week killed 21 
people

a towns ordinance requiring residents 
to obtain permits before installing political signs in their yards 
is unconstitutional a superior court judge ruled tuesday 
judge melanie famiglietti threw out the conviction of james 
lemoi who had been found guilty of erecting signs in his yard in 
1984 and 1985 without a permit 
lemoi 70 had been convicted in district court of violating 
barringtons ordinance and was fined 13000 he challenged his 
conviction and the american civil liberties union picked up his 
case 
barrington allows a variety of signs to be installed without a 
permit to advertise a house for sale a professional business such 
as a law firm in a home or signs tied to seasonal decorations 
other signs require a permit before they are erected 
lemoi installed signs in his yard twice the first was an appeal 
to the public for help after his wifes death and a fire at his 
house the judge said 
the second famiglietti said was a political statement about 
town officials 
under the barrington ordinance lemoi should have obtained a 
permit both times 
but the judge ruled that the town cannot regulate signs by their 
content 
if these very same signs indicated a doctors office in 
lemois home or were a theater marquee or were holiday 
decorations mr lemoi would not be in court today and would not be 
fined 13000 the judge said 
in december 1984 lemois wife died and just a few days later 
his house caught fire causing extensive damage he wasnt home at 
the time and was unhurt 
about 10 days after the fire lemoi put a sign up in his yard 
asking for help seven months later after he was unable to obtain 
police or fire department reports about the fire investigation he 
erected another sign stating simply come clean 
it was after that sign that barrington charged him in district 
court 
lemoi described famigliettis decision as swell 
he said he pursued the case for so long because he believed 
barrington was wrong 
i dont know why they treated me this way he said i was 
born and brought up in this town 
aclu lawyer elizabeth colt who represented lemoi said 
famigliettis decision came down squarely on the side of free 
speech guaranteed by the constitution 
you cant distinguish among signs ms colt said citing the 
prohibition on political signs its sign regulations got to be 
content neutral 
a lawyer for the town michael mosco said he would leave a 
decision whether to appeal the ruling to the town council but he 
defended ordinance saying it was reasonable

several days and i end up keeping them for only so long and i have 
to put them down 
maslanka said she also hopes the census reminds owners to get 
their pets licensed she said she has licensed only nine cats in 
the past few years even though city ordinance requires all cats to 
be registered the same ordinance limits pet owners to three dogs 
or cats to a house 
maslanka said city records show there was a pet census by police 
in 1959 but there are no records of its result

conservative supporters of a proposed 
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget succeeded 
tuesday in their longrunning quest to bring the issue to the full 
house for a vote 
using a rarelysuccessful procedure supporters of the proposal 
overcame opposition by the houses democratic leadership and are 
now guaranteed a vote no later than next month 
they cant prevent this now said rep larry craig ridaho 
one of the measures sponsors 
supporters have long argued that an amendment requiring a 
balanced budget is the only way to eliminate the huge deficits of 
recent years which have been stuck in the 150 billion range 
opponents argue that such an amendment would not work because 
the real problem is the political stalemate over tax increases and 
spending cuts that might eliminate the budget gap 
for years democratic leaders have blocked balanced budget 
amendments from moving out of the house judiciary committee 
but under house procedures a measure can be taken away from a 
committee and brought to the full chamber for a vote if a majority 
of the 435 members sign a socalled discharge petition 
craig and his allies announced tuesday that they had collected 
their 218th signature the number needed 
the drive to round up those signatures recently had taken a 
controversial turn 
one supporter had threatened to release the names of cosponsors 
of the balancedbudget amendment who had refused to sign the 
petition but the supporter rep chuck douglas rnh said the 
matter was now moot 
constitutional amendments must be approved by twothirds votes 
of the house and senate and then ratified by at least 
threefourths of the states 
it is rare for discharge petitions to succeed 
since the houses current procedure was adopted in 1931 482 
such petitions have been filed according to richard beth of the 
congressional research service the research arm of congress 
just 43 of the petitions including tuesdays have succeeded 
in collecting enough signatures to force a house vote the last 
time one was successful was in 1986 when a vote was forced on a 
measure easing gun control laws

rep dan rostenkowski a veteran of chicagos 
tough ward politics was reminiscing about the old days when he 
checked in with city hall before voting in congress 
all of us in congress now are independent contractors 
rostenkowski told the nations mayors in explaining why cities have 
a hard time making their case these days 
the mayors know that all too well 
during their summer meeting this week the more than 200 mayors 
democrats and republicans from big cities and small have been 
virtually unanimous in saying cities have lost much of their clout 
in washington 
but they are deeply divided over how to get it back some 
advocate a militant approach in which mayors use their local 
organizations against members of congress who fail to help their 
cities others say the mayors are to blame for their own decline 
and must put their own houses in order 
their frustration has spilled over repeatedly these past few 
days 
they talk of losing billions when president reagan cut domestic 
programs to fund his military buildup when they try to get some of 
that back now theyre told the money is needed to reduce the 
federal deficit yet the government quickly finds 300 billion to 
bail out the savings and loan industry 
the sampl crisis new york mayor david dinkins said tuesday has 
shown us that federal money abounds 
the diversity of the mayors a strength at times can also prove 
to be a weakness at times the cities are forced to compete with 
each other for the declining share of federal aid 
it is hard for us at times to speak with one voice said 
mayor sharpe james of newark nj but the bigger problem is that 
mayors have allowed the congress to become fat cats smug secure 
assured of their positions theyre not fighting the real fights 
anymore 
james believes mayors could win back some clout by holding 
some congressmen hostage when elections roll around mayors and 
congressman have had a honeymoon for far too long 
many big city democratic mayors are apoplectic in trying to 
explain their setbacks in washington where democrats control the 
congress 
two of those mayors bostons raymond flynn and new yorks 
dinkins said the mayors need to rally more grassroots support for 
their causes they have adopted the multibillion dollar sampl bailout 
plan as the centerpiece of their populist pitch 
we the mayors of urban america must send a message to 
washington that only after we have housed our people only after we 
have educated our young people only after we have repaired our 
roads and only after we heal our sick can we commit to the 
extravagant bailout of a corrupt system dinkins said 
some mayors speak fondly of the urban heydays when a mayor 
daley of chicago curley of boston or laguardia of new york could 
strike fear in congress and at times even the white house 
now flynn said cashrich special interests have taken the 
clout once wielded by city political machines 
weve got to go to the people to get it back he said 
chicago mayor richard m daley the son of the late mayor 
richard j daley voiced the frustration of many of his colleagues 
in saying too few members of congress are in touch with residents 
of their cities 
its another world he said of washington 
but milwaukee mayor john norquist said the mayors should accept 
much of the blame for their declining clout 
we should have a concise constant message he said in an 
interview we need to be more aggressive as an organization 
when they do speak as one the mayors too often appear to be 
whining norquist said 
the message certainly needs to be more positive he said 
pity doesnt get you much pity usually leads to contempt

new yorks david dinkins led fellow mayors 
tuesday in a populist appeal for a piece of the peace dividend 
despite a warning from congress that cities likely would not share 
in any defense savings 
we are obliged by the needs of the people we represent the 
majority of americans to put our claim on the liberated resources 
of the cold war dinkins told the us conference of mayors 
the money that had once financed armament factories can now help 
rebuild our cities 
dinkins spent only the morning at the conference because of his 
role in planning for south african antiapartheid leader nelson 
mandelas visit to new york on wednesday 
but his speech was full of rhetoric welcomed by the mayors a day 
after house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski told 
the mayors they stood little chance of winning more federal aid 
soon 
dinkins made no mention of rostenkowski instead he listed a 
series of urban problems that he said threatened safety and the 
social fabric of urban america 
we do not seek every penny of the peace dividend only a fair 
share for the people of our cities a fair share that has often 
been denied dinkins told the mayors it is a challenge that we 
the mayors of america must mobilize to meet 
in a brief meeting with reporters after the speech dinkins said 
it was up to mayors to lobby rostenkowki and others in congress 
dinkins called on fellow mayors to meet with him at an urban 
summit in new york in october and urged them to bring along local 
business leaders to draft a strategy for winning more federal aid 
his address was the highlight of a day that had the mayors 
attending a variety of workshops and visiting an economic 
enterprise zone in their host city 
the meeting concludes wednesday after the mayors formally 
endorse a broad new domestic lobbying agenda that calls for major 
federal funding increases for housing education antidrug 
antipoverty and other urban programs 
the success of the plan hinges heavily on whether the mayors can 
win their uphill fight for more federal aid

abduction tracing leads to the new jersey apartment of a man who 
rented the car

friends to see more of new york city and were too embarrassed to 
reappear following the hue and cry

in china by telephone around the time of the letter 
they told their families dont worry or something like 
that he said 
meanwhile the project continues although not without a few 
hitches cui said 
the village being built by the peasants from scratch is to be a 
model for other governments of poor countries of what can be done 
mrs aitken is president of world energy foundation whose aim 
is transferring solarpower and similar technology to third world 
countries

strawberries last week and plan to donate the surplus to a food 
bank in nearby fitchburg cui said

the house judiciary committee voted narrowly 
tuesday to send a constitutional amendment protecting the flag to 
the house floor for a vote as an associated press survey showed 
the measure short of the support needed to pass congress 
the 1917 committee vote set the stage for a showdown in the 
house possibly as early as this week 
the close vote indicates that its going to be a fairly 
close vote on the floor said rep jack brooks dtexas the 
committee chairman 
the ap survey said as much and indicated that uncommitted 
democrats will play a large role in determining the fate of the 
amendment 
in the house supporters and those leaning in favor outnumbered 
opponents 255115 with 289 votes required for passage the survey 
showed of the 63 who were undecided or had no known position 53 
were democrats 
the survey found 58 senators were either committed to or leaning 
toward the amendment pushed by president bush leaving it nine 
short of the 67 needed to pass 
twentyfour democrats and four republicans were either committed 
or leaning against supporting the amendment 
the top democratic leadership in the house and senate are 
vehemently opposed to the amendment but a vote against it is seen 
by democrats and republicans alike as risky business in an election 
year 
only a week ago a judiciary subcommittee cleared the amendment 
but by an unfavorable 53 vote that carried a recommendation 
against passage the full judiciary committee voted tuesday to move 
the amendment to the house floor but took no stand for or against 
passage 
earlier tuesday democratic opponents failed to get an adverse 
recommendation and supporters failed to get a favorable 
recommendation 
at brooks urging the panel voted on sending the amendment 
forward with no recommendation that carried by a 1917 margin 
during earlier committee arguments rep henry hyde rill 
told his colleagues 
those who are shocked and revolted and frustrated by the 
excesses of the counterculture the pornography the obscenities 
that inundates or entertainment industry the drugs the aids 
explosion the high abortion rate view flag burning as one more 
slap in the face at the millions of veterans 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine stood up on the 
senate floor tuesday to declare i oppose and condemn the burning 
of the flag i find it offensive and obnoxious im proud to be an 
american proud of our flag 
but i do not support changing the constitution he said 
a vote on the amendment could come as early as thursday in the 
house and by the fourth of july in the senate 
i dont know what the vote outcome will be mitchell had 
said earlier i expect it will be close 
the democratic leadership which sees the amendment as weakening 
the first amendment is looking for votes to block the measure 
among 18 undecided senators 15 of them democrats they include 
sen joseph biden of delaware who last year wrote the law the 
supreme court struck down june 11 
the ap survey was done june 1518 some members responded 
through aides some themselves 
just four republican senators john chafee of rhode island 
john danforth of missouri gordon humphrey of new hampshire and bob 
packwood of oregon are opposed 
thirtyeight republicans said they would vote yes and three are 
undecided 
that the survey found so many democrats on the fence so close to 
a vote illustrates the political difficulty of the issue which 
sen bob dole rkan has quipped would make a good 30second 
campaign spot 
but rep richard durbin dill who was undecided last week 
said he found in a visit to his home district that the issue wasnt 
pressing with constituents he said hes now leaning against the 
amendment 
some of those who said publicly they were undecided said 
privately they were opposed to the gopbacked amendment 
biden aides said he planned to offer his own amendment that 
would bar physically defacing or burning the flag without 
addressing whether the act desecrates the flag 
meanwhile the emergency committee to defend the first 
amendment a private group that opposes the amendment said tuesday 
that retired supreme court justice lewis powell had joined in the 
call to reject the measure 
but powell told the associated press id rather you just 
state that i am a member of the committee without any further 
comment from me

the united states has not asked liberian 
president samuel doe to resign but doesnt believe he can survive 
a military battle with antigovernment rebels a top us official 
said tuesday 
herman cohen the secretary of state for african affairs told a 
house panel the united states has encouraged both doe and the 
national patriotic front rebels to end bloody fighting in their 
country and seek a political settlement including free and fair 
elections 
cohen said the us military warships stationed off the coast of 
liberia are there solely for the purpose of protecting the lives 
of us citizens should the level of violence place them in 
jeopardy at a time when they have no other means of evacuating 
the country 
there is no intention of using the us forces for any 
political end they are there to preserve american lives he said 
us forces will not intervene to stop the fighting or to 
influence the outcome of the conflict in any way he said 
the united states have not suggested to doe that he resign but 
has talked with both sides in the conflict doe has said he will 
not seek reelection but he has not quit his post the rebels say 
there can be no elections until doe is out of office 
the united states has cut off aid except for humanitarian aid 
to liberia because of human rights problems 
moreover cohen said the united states has called on doe and 
rebel leader charles taylor to end human rights abuses and 
atrocities that have left more than 1000 dead and 200000 homeless 
since december 
church groups have sponsored mediation talks between does 
forces and those rebels headed by charles taylor who is wanted by 
the state of massachusetts on a felony warrant for escaping from 
prison 
right now fighting is quiescent with rebel troops gathered 
outside the liberian capital of monrovia at the firestone 
plantation cohen said 
but he said the rebels who number more than 5000 would likely 
overpower the government forces whose strength has dwindled to 
about 1000 
the government army instead of fighting the guerrillas has 
taken out against the citizens instead he said based on the 
past performance of government troops cohen said its not 
likely they could defend monrovia should rebels attack 
he said the united states wants the liberians to avoid a 
terrible battle for monrovia 
as for taylor cohen said it is unclear whether he is truly 
committed to achieving a democratic government because he gives 
ambiguous answers to questions 
in sum cohen said the united states believes the liberians 
not outsiders should resolve the countrys problems

the revival of a small charter airline known 
for carrying celebrities but shut down nearly two years ago for 
safety violations was defended tuesday by federal authorities and 
the carriers owner 
you do not fly the class of people that we flew unless you 
have a reliable airplane earl holtz president of northeast jet 
told a congressional panel 
the house public works oversight and investigations subcommittee 
is looking into the federal aviation administrations oversight of 
small charter and air taxi services 
northeast gained the nickname celebrity airline by ferrying 
clients such as first ladies nancy reagan and barbara bush 
presidential candidates michael dukakis and sen bob dole rkan 
and pop singers billy idol barry manilow and bruce springsteen on 
domestic and international flights 
holtz said the company still will accept any paying passengers 
his lawyer mark kahan said most of the passengers are corporate 
travelers 
three of the airlines former employees told the subcommittee 
that holtz deserved to have his license pulled in september 1988 
and susan j woodward a former northeast jet vice president 
said the company should not have been allowed to resume flights 
last month as private jet services 
ms woodward said the companys management abused license 
privileges and their employees 
former northeast jet pilot thomas beamer testified that he had 
been punished for refusing to fly excessive hours or overweight 
planes and said he received inadequate training 
joan szemplenkski a former aircraft scheduler said she 
witnessed screaming matches between holtz and the companys 
chief maintenance officer over whether aircraft were airworthy 
former chief pilot william telfer said the company kept records 
that showed compliance when violations were in fact occurring on 
a daily basis 
holtz said the accusation that i skimped on safety to enrich 
myself is not and never was true he said the company had 
wellmaintained aircraft and a good training program 
it is grossly unfair for employees with no specific knowledge 
of the facts to suggest that i fixed problems illegally holtz 
said 
loretta alkalay assistant chief counsel for faas eastern 
region said the faa punished northeast jet by not allowing holtz 
to apply for a new certification for one year 
she said that was a significant sanction a significant 
deterrent 
faa regional operations branch manager frederick leonellis said 
the airline was given a new certificate only after meeting a long 
list of requirements 
the faa which oversees the safety of all aircraft checks to 
see if an airline has proper equipment qualified personnel and 
proper maintenance and training programs officials said 
an faa emergency revocation order grounded the airline the 
19page order accused northeast jet of flying unsafe planes 
overworking its pilots skimping on training and keeping two sets 
of maintenance records one for its own use and one for faa 
inspectors 
the faa cited more than 70 examples of unsafe or unauthorized 
practices 
national transportation safety board records show four crashes 
involving the airline and three fatalities since 1980

william k reilly administrator of the 
environmental protection agency said tuesday that he would 
recommend president bush veto landmark clean air legislation if the 
proposal contains a controversial jobs protection amendment when it 
reaches the white house 
i consider it bad environmental policy bad social policy and 
bad economic policy reilly said in discussing a provision that 
would assist workers who lose their jobs because of the tougher air 
pollution requirements 
both the senate and house are preparing for a conference 
committee to work out differences in largely similar bills to 
strengthen federal clean air laws for the first time in 13 years 
one of the differences involves an amendment in the house bill 
that would allow for 250 million to be spent in added unemployment 
compensation and retraining for workers if forced out of their jobs 
by the new legislation 
the administration says this could force industry spending well 
above the 21 billion or so annually called for by the senate 
version partly because it would be extremely difficult to tell if 
a job had been lost because of the provisions of the legislation 
reilly said his objections to this jobs proposal sponsored by 
rep bob wise dwva were strong enough that he would recommend 
that the president veto the entire bill if that section is not 
removed by the conference committee 
stressing that the administration is not insensitive to people 
losing their jobs reilly said that of the 17000 to 20000 jobs 
estimated to be lost by the tougher legislation only 4000 of 
those job losses would occur by 1995 
he said the major impact would not come until the next century 
giving society time to prepare through use of current job 
retraining programs 
the jobs issues is certain to be one of the main battles in the 
conference committee debate an aid package in the senate sponsored 
by sen robert byrd dwva lost by only one vote byrds 
amendment would have helped only coal miners while the less costly 
wise amendment expands the assistance to workers in all industries 
reilly briefing economics writers on the economic impacts of 
environmental legislation said the united states spends between 
80 billion to 90 billion annually on pollution control counting 
in both government enforcement efforts and cleanup costs borne by 
industry and consumers 
he said the administration projected that environmental 
spending which already amounts to 15 percent to 17 percent of 
the total us economy would rise to 25 percent of the gross 
national product by the year 2000 he said this figure would be 3 
percent if the costs of cleaning nuclear waste sites is included 
reilly said the administration understood the need to do all 
we can to protect the environment but to do it in a costeffective 
way

union to allow experts from poland to take part in exhuming the

embassy requesting polish red cross experts be allowed to join in 
the exhumation and identification work the official pap news

of some of the 6200 polish officers who were held in a prison camp 
at ostashkov 120 miles northwest of moscow 
for 47 years the soviets denied involvement in the murders of 
nearly 15000 polish officers in ostashkov and two other prison 
camps the crime became known as the katyn massacre when more than 
4200 bodies of polish officers were discovered in 1943 in the 
forest at katyn 
but the burial sites of the rest the elite of polish society 
called up from the reserves and captured after the red army invaded 
eastern poland in september 1939 remained a mystery 
soviet authorities acknowledged only in april that the officers 
had been murdered in 1940 by stalins nkvd secret police and 
intelligence agency not by the nazis as moscow had claimed since 
1943 
last week the kgb the nkvds successor identified a park 
outside the ukrainian city of kharkov as the likely burial place of 
3900 of the polish soldiers who had been held at the starobielsk 
camp 
on monday soviet officials told a polish parliament delegation 
they had located the apparent burial place of at least some of 
6200 officers held at ostashkov prison pap said 
the site is in a forest near miednoye on the moscowleningrad 
highway north of kalinin about 90 miles from moscow pap said 
mass graves of stalinist victims most of them soviets have 
been discovered at the site pap quoting sources close to the 
polish delegation said that although no polish remains have been 
identified much goes to indicate they rest there 
a parliamentary delegation planned to visit the katyn and 
kharkov graves and discuss the legal and financial consequences 
including claims by the victims families pap said

conservatives objected tuesday to a supreme 
court ruling that directed a local tax increase to correct school 
segregation but some legal scholars told a senate panel the case 
didnt warrant a constitutional amendment to reverse it 
at issue is a 54 ruling in april that a federal judge could set 
aside state tax limitations and order local officials to raise 
taxes to correct a constitutional violation such as racial 
segregation in schools the case involved public schools in kansas 
city mo 
sen john danforth rmo has proposed a constitutional 
amendment to make clear that judges have no powers of taxation 
danforth and other amendment supporters argued that the court 
ruling was a straightforward example of the judiciary exercising a 
legislative function by directing a property tax increase in kansas 
city 
the decision is the predictable result of decades of relying 
ever more heavily on judicial power to solve social and political 
problems robert f nagel of the university of colorado school of 
law told the senate judiciary subcommittee on the constitution 
it is the predictable result of power going unchecked 
but nagel and other critics of the supreme court decision said 
that if an amendment is not approved legislation proposed by sens 
gordon humphrey rnh and strom thurmond rsc would suffice 
the measure would limit the remedial powers of federal judges by 
prohibiting orders requiring the federal government or any state 
or local government to impose any new tax or to increase any 
existing tax or tax rate 
conservative legal scholar bruce fein strongly criticized the 
danforth proposal for a constitutional amendment saying it would 
have a horrendous effect on simple justice by not 
permitting courts to correct constitutional wrongs in some cases 
i believe these proposals would foster arbitrary government 
throw a dagger at private and economic liberties and subvert the 
rule of law said fein 
fein said critics misinterpreted the decision saying it did 
not endow judges with imperial power to raise taxes to any 
level 
joining fein in opposition to a constitutional amendment was 
patricia a brannan a washington attorney for the kansas city 
school district she said the ruling followed a basic legal 
principle that judges must have the power to correct constitutional 
violations 
to do less would permit the political reluctance to raise 
taxes to deprive minorities of a remedy for demonstrated 
constitutional violations brannan said in a statement 
she pointed out that the supreme court held 90 in the kansas 
city case that a judge could not directly impose taxes the 
justices allowed the federal judge to block state laws that 
prevented the board from increasing taxes enough to pay the 
districts share of the desegregation plan 
missouri law requires voter approval before property taxes can 
be increased above a certain levy and in some instances a 
twothirds majority is necessary the locally elected school board 
she said now sets the actual levy within limits allowed by the 
courts 
the school board supported several tax increases but the voters 
rejected the proposals 
sen paul simon dill chairman of the senate panel said he 
remained undecided on the proposals but was reluctant to take the 
constitutional amendment approach

a group of humanitarian religious and 
antiwar organizations claimed tuesday that the us is 
strengthening the khmer rouge a militant communist faction in 
cambodia through its dealings with that nation 
theres a great discrepancy between preachment and practice 
in the bush administrations policy of condemning the khmer rouge 
while aiding factions allied with it sidney peck cochairman of 
an effort to change the us policy said during a news conference 
public opinion is growing in the united states for blocking not 
only a return to power but also any form of cooperation with the 
khmer rouge he said peck said the group has been blamed for more 
than 1 million cambodian deaths during its 197578 rule over the 
southeast asian country 
that message was stressed by members of the coalition of 45 
organizations during a day of lobbying congress said peck who 
heads mobilization for survival a humanitarian aid group he said 
a delegation also discussed cambodia with richard solomon the 
assistant secretary of state for east asia 
coalition representatives said the agony of the cambodian people 
was being prolonged by us insistence on a comprehensive cambodian 
peace package while the country endures deepening hardship from the 
cutoff of aid from former communist countries in europe 
if we continue to say nothing is settled until everything is 
settled we may find we have lost everything the comprehensive 
approach is at odds with a peace process approach and runs the 
risk that it wont be settled at all said jeremy stone 
president of the federation of american scientists a peace 
movement group 
the campaign was triggered in part by senate democratic leader 
george mitchells recent announcement of intelligence committee 
oversight hearings to determine if the bush administrations 
cambodia policy complied with congress bar on use of us funds 
that had the effect of helping or augmenting khmer rouge operations 
mitchell charged in a june 11 floor speech that the 
administration has been slow to realize that its current policy 
in effect sanctions the return of the murderous khmer rouge 
some lawmakers have talked of stronger restrictions and a house 
subcommittee last week considered ending current nonlethal 
us aid to the noncommunist factions in cambodia 
david elder of the american friends service committee a quaker 
organization said us policy however intentioned has had the 
effect of creating a much stronger khmer rouge than before 
visible to every visitor 
the coalition said it has documents and press reports showing 
that the usaided noncommunist factions headed by prince norodom 
sinhanouk and son sann have collaborated at the highest military 
and intelligence levels with the khmer rouge in their joint fight 
against the hun sen government in phnom penh that government was 
installed by vietnamese troops who in 1979 ended khmer rouge rule 
and occupied the country for 11 years

dozens of people waited in line outside a 
newly opened federal disaster relief center tuesday to find out if 
the government would help them rebuild lives washed away by a flash 
flood 
nearly 60 flood victims gathered at the shadyside community 
center where federal and state agencies began taking applications 
for lowinterest loans grants and deposit money to help them find 
temporary lodging 
rainstorms dumped 5 inches of rain in about three hours 
thursday night swamping two small creeks and washing away homes 
cars and trees in and around this rural eastern ohio village at 
least 21 people were killed and 13 were listed as missing 
few people were insured for the damage caused by raging wegee 
and pipe creeks some who came to fill out disaster relief 
applications said they would never recover most of what they lost 
ben otto said he bought 30000 worth of flood insurance last 
september but estimated his house suffered another 70000 in 
damage that the insurance wont cover 
i got mud up to here in my house otto said holding his 
hands just below his hips i know ill never get back what its 
worth from the government i dont expect to 
ken gibbons 41 who crawled into the rafters of his attic when 
a 25floot wall of water crashed into his home said he sustained 
300000 in losses he said he had been told that he could only 
recover about 10400 in government grants 
like many of the relief applicants gibbons was bitter 
theres too much red tape with the government he said 
they send money freely overseas to other countries but dont 
want to do anything to help people here im going to move to 
florida and live with my daughter and become a beach bum let 
welfare feed me to hell with this 
in addition to his house he said the flood wiped out his 
tavern a jaguar and a red corvette convertible and two rental 
mobile homes he said the loss of the bar was the hardest blow 
i had surgery to remove a brain tumor and i wasnt able 
to hold another job other than that bar gibbons said ive had 
that 15 years and everybody in this town came down there for 
entertainment we were the only place around here that had live 
bands 
bruce connor 33 and two fellow members of the sentinels 
motorcycle club showed up in biker gear to file applications for 
money to replace harleydavidson motorcycles they lost to the flood 
i dont know if theyll accept it or not but were going to 
try just like everybody else connor said some of those bikes 
were collectors items probably worth a lot of money we had 
harleys from the 1920s and 30s bikes my father and his father 
had and tools they used to work on them 
gene neiditch of the federal emergency management agency who 
manages the local application center said the sentinels might be 
reimbursed 
if those bikes were their primary source of transportation and 
necessary to the fulfillment of their occupations then yes they 
may qualify he said 
fema on monday estimated that 700 homes in belmont jefferson 
and harrison counties in the area were damaged or destroyed by the 
flooding neiditch said the first relief checks could be in the 
hands of recipients in one to two weeks but that it may take 
longer in many cases

convicted drug dealer charles lewis 
testifying on the first day of marion barrys drug and perjury 
trial said tuesday that he and the mayor repeatedly used drugs in 
the virgin islands and smoked crack cocaine in washington 
lewis described using cocaine with barry and model rasheeda 
moore once in june 1986 in a hotel room we were all standing in 
line we were using straws lewis said 
prosecutors opened the trial charging that the threeterm mayor 
was smoking crack and using cocaine all over town for years 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy countered that barry was a 
victim of entrapment and said the trial would reveal the depths 
to which the government was willing to go and did go to bring 
down the mayor of the nations capital 
the two lawyers sparred before the jury while barry watched 
intently from the defense table he wiped his forehead when he 
heard assistant us attorney richard roberts say jurors would see 
a government videotape made the night of barrys arrest showing the 
mayor smoking crack lighting with a cigarette lighter 
just like this he added extending his arms and inhaling 
deeply 
barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three felony 
counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use 
he could face up to 26 years in prison and fines of 185 
million if convicted on all counts the trial is expected to last 
upwards of a month 
while the defendant was preaching down with dope to the 
community he was putting dope up his nose roberts told jurors 
in his opening statement this case is about the other side the 
secret side of marion barry 
mundy told the 12 jurors and six alternates this is a case 
about deals the government made with the devil approximately seven 
years ago the government made a determination that it was going to 
get mr barry and that it was prepared to go to any lengths 
lewis a former city employee who pleaded guilty to cocaine 
conspiracy charges last november portrayed the mayor as an 
experienced drug user in a dec 16 1988 visit to lewis 
washington hotel room barry shook rocks of crack cocaine out of a 
matchbox and he returned the next night with crack cocaine hidden 
in his pants leg 
the two men fashioned a homemade pipe to smoke the crack said 
lewis 
the mayor told him when he was in the virgin islands i take 
care of him when i was in dc he takes care of me lewis 
testified 
at one point said lewis the mayor sent him out to buy crack 
cocaine on the streets which lewis called a very easy task 
lewis also said the two men used drugs at two virgin islands 
hotels and aboard two boats in trips the mayor made to the islands 
in 1986 and 1988 
how many packets of crack did you and mr barry smoke during 
his trip to the virgin islands in 1988 asked assistant us 
attorney judith retchin 
i would say somewhere near two dozen packets replied lewis 
who smoked more you or mr barry 
the mayor did said lewis he smoked more than i do 
lewis told of using cocaine supplied by barry in a virgin 
islands hotel room in june 1986 and was asked whether anyone else 
used the drug 
the mayor miss moore lewis said 
lewis testified barry also smoked marijuana on a boat trip later 
that day 
lewis said he encouraged moore who cooperated in barrys jan 
18 arrest at a washington hotel and the mayor to use cocaine in 
the boats bathroom out of sight of another couple on the cruise 
they made repeated trips to the lavatory lewis testified 
he said that during a march 1988 trip the mayor gave him 300 
and asked him to buy crack cocaine 
lewis barry and several others consumed between 15 and 18 
bags of the cocaine that had been bought with the 300 lewis 
testified 
then i went and bought some more he said 
when retchin asked lewis how crack cocaine had made him feel 
lewis said you feel good you feel great as a matter of fact 
barry smiled broadly as lewis further described the cocaine high 
lewis testimony that he obtained drugs for the mayor got money 
from the mayor and used drugs with him all relate to the felony 
perjury charges against barry the mayor told a grand jury in 
january 1989 that he had never given anything of value to lewis 
used drugs with him or seen lewis use or sell drugs according to 
the indictment 
in his opening argument roberts portrayed barry as a regular 
drug user whose friends and acquaintances brought drugs to him even 
at his city hall office

defense secretary dick cheney expressed 
irritation tuesday that his monthslong review of the pentagons 
costliest aircraft programs failed to turn up problems in the 
navys planned new attack plane the a12 
i was not happy to discover that the contractors were having 
problems with the a12 i have had sessions in which ive expressed 
my views on that subject cheney told reporters following a 
budget briefing at the pentagon 
cheney was queried about the navys decision to order a special 
review of the secret program which came after the planes joint 
developers announced a delay in its progress a delay widely 
interpreted as foreshadowing extra costs 
officials at mcdonnell douglas corp and general dynamics corp 
had reported that the first flight of the plane would be delayed 
until late 1991 the problems reportedly involve the planes 
composite materials which save weight and lower radar reflections 
but are very difficult to fabricate into aircraft parts 
the plane is considered to be the navys top aircraft priority 
given that it is destined to replace the services aging fleet of 
a6 intruder allweather attack planes a point cheney stressed 
we need the a12 soon as we can get it into the force so it 
remains a priority program he said 
in a concession to congressional budget cutters cheney 
announced in april that he was sharply cutting the proposed a12 
purchase although the navy had originally planned to buy 858 of 
the longrange carrierbased aircraft the secretary said he 
envisioned buying only 620 
no cost for the supersecret program has been made public but 
it has been reported that the plane was being developed under a 
48 billion fixed price contract extended production would cost 
tens of billions more 
the secretary was asked whether he was unhappy that the problems 
with the aircraft had not surfaced during the review which 
supposedly included toptobottom looks at the b2 stealth bomber 
the c17 transport plane and other advanced tactical fighter 
programs 
were going to continue to work the problem to see if we can 
in fact get better data than weve had to date cheney replied 
one of the problems youre faced with from time to time in 
this business is the problems of cost overruns and slips in 
schedule cheney said adding but obviously i was not happy 
with the way the a12 thing was handled 
the secretary pressed why the problems didnt emerge in the 
review said thats the question ive asked and i dont have all 
the answers yet 
he said hes made his dissatisfaction known in terms of my 
personal conversations with the people who work for me but i 
prefer to keep those matters personal 
cheney met last week on the a12 with the chief executive 
officers of mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics as well as 
deputy secretary donald atwood undersecretary of defense for 
acquisition john betti and navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii

response when nujoma asked for an increase in the 10 million in 
assistance already promised by the united states 
however administration officials said no further aid was 
immediately envisioned for the southwest african nation although 
bush told nujoma that the united states wants to provide moral 
support for the emerging democracy and its move to a free market 
economy 
the us assistance is less than that promised by britain india 
and the nordic countries but neither the soviet union nor south 
africa has pledged any money yet nujoma said 
he did not say how much more money he was seeking from the us 
he will travel to the united nations later this week to seek 
support from the international community in particular the 15 
namibians need help in education housing health care and 
agricultural and rural development 
we would do whatever we could to be helpful said an 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
another official said the main purpose of bushs meeting with 
nujoma was to encourage the new presidents efforts toward a mixed 
economy and moderation of his socialist views 
the white house also announced tuesday that bush will name genta 
hawkins holmes ambassador to namibia holmes is the deputy chief of 
mission at the us embassy in pretoria south africa and 
previously served as deputy chief of mission in haiti and malawi 
namibia formally gained its independence from 75 years of south 
african rule on march 21 when power was turned over to an 
independent government headed by nujoma namibia was under south 
africas control as a trusteeship until un supervised elections 
were held last november 
the independence process occurred after a guerrilla war lasting 
nearly 30 years that was waged by black nationalists nujoma heads 
the south west africa peoples organization the rebel group that 
fought the war and won the most votes in the balloting last fall 
us officials see namibia as an example of a general trend 
toward democratic rule in africa namibia is one of the first 
african countries to gain independence with an elected government 
and independent judiciary and curbs on the power of the executive 
nujoma is focusing his attention on economic reform 
we have requested the us government to increase financial 
support the agricultural rural development education health care 
in order to uplift the standard of living for the people of 
namibia nujoma told reporters after his meeting with bush 
he said his country is grateful for the 10 million offered by 
the united states but needs more to help cope with debts left by 
the south african government 
namibias per capita income of 1000 a year is among the 
highest in africa but it is partly based on south african aid 
which is ending with independence 
the country faces a 191 million budget deficit this year on an 
overall budget of just over 766 million 
the bush administration lifted economic sanctions against 
namibia when the country became independent 
the sanctions were directed against south africa and were 
carried over to namibia because it was under south african control 
the sanctions remain in place against south africa

the fbi has documented at least 25 cases of 
harassment and intimidation of chinese students by their own 
government in the united states but the state department does not 
believe that is grounds for sanctions against beijing a department 
official said tuesday 
rep stephen solarz dny reacting to information given in a 
closeddoor fbi briefing called the administrations position 
shocking and bluntly told the official im not sure were 
living in the same universe 
solarz said the briefing clearly showed a consistent pattern of 
intimidation that requires sanctions under a law he wrote nine 
years ago 
its going on in every region of the country said solarz 
who added that he believed the evidence points to hundreds of cases 
in which chinese embassy officials have threatened students in the 
united states 
the bush administration has announced its intention to renew 
mostfavorednation trading status for china almost exactly a year 
after beijings bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in 
and around tiananmen square 
kent wiedemann director of the state departments office of 
chinese affairs said the contacts with students involved 
relatively few of the chinese embassy and consular officials in the 
united states and represented a very sporadic pattern 
they were mostly in 1989 in the summer and fall and have 
dwindled to basically nothing by the beginning of this year 
wiedemann told a joint hearing of solarzs asia subcommittee and 
the human rights subcommittee of the house foreign affairs 
committee 
the contacts usually involved threats or implied threats of 
consequences for students when they return to china or to their 
families if they continued prodemocracy activities he said 
but they were sufficiently few in number and sufficiently 
indirect as to not be a consistent pattern as the law defines it 
he said 
solarz bristled at the testimony saying the administration 
seems to be more interested in kowtowing to china than in calling 
a spade a spade 
he pointed to documents produced by lin xu a former chinese 
embassy official in washington who sought political asylum in the 
united states on may 2 the papers which wiedemann said he 
believes authentic describe a plan to pressure the most activist 
students into inaction by threatening not to renew passports or to 
deny their families in china permission to come to the united 
states for visits 
xu testifying later before the subcommittees said the 
harassment has intensified this year 
speaking through a translator he said the embassys activities 
included keeping dossiers on activist students videotaping 
protests enlisting professional students to spy on their peers 
and warning students not to lobby congress on behalf of legislation 
protecting them from deportation 
he said about 200 students were placed into category five 
the group of the most active prodemocracy leaders who were 
subjected to the greatest intimidation 
there are about 40000 chinese students in the united states

a soviet official said it could take 
more than 200 years to clean up damage from the 1986 chernobyl 
nuclear accident and asked for international aid to help 2 million 
people affected by the disaster 
the sudden plea more than four years after the accident 
comes after soviet scientists said the situation was much worse 
than moscow had portrayed 
onefifth of the republic of byelorussias more than 10 million 
people have to be moved from areas contaminated by radiation said 
victor borovikov a byelorussia diplomat he said that includes 27 
cities and more than 2600 villages 
byelorussia which has no nuclear power plants was hit by 70fallout 
from the nuclear power plant at chernobyl 
in the soviet republic of ukraine 
borovikov said 25000 people were ev 
percent of the acuated after the april 26 
1986 nuclear plant disaster but he said then moscow said 
there was no panic no danger in the past four years weve 
realized the situation was not so simple 
he said the republic had planned to spend 14 billion to move 
180000 people from the highradiation zone by the end of 1995 but 
would now try to do it by the end of 1991 
borovikov was in brussels for the departure wednesday of a truck 
convoy carrying donated childrenhe said experts now say it could take 
up to 200 years to 
totally wipe out effects of the accident so authorities are 
focusing on reducing the damage 
we have no experience in this field which is why were asking 
for international help said borovikov the republics un 
ambassador in vienna 
borovikov said immediately after the accident people were paid 
by the soviet authorities to stay in the contaminated zones but 
they now are demanding immediate relocation 
he said people in uncontaminated areas dont want to accept 
the newcomers they tell their children not to play with the 
children of the newcomers 
at least 31 people were killed after a nuclear reactor exploded 
at the chernobyl nuclear power plant it was the worst nuclear

president francois mitterrand said in an interview 
published tuesday that the european community and other wealthy 
western countries should consider extending financial aid to the 
soviet union 
mitterrand told the newspaper le monde that he hoped the ec and 
other wealthy nations would consider the possibility of 
financial commercial and technical aid to the soviets 
he said he would make a proposal to this effect at the upcoming 
ec summit meeting in dublin ireland and the subsequent summit in 
houston of leaders of the seven major western industrial 
democracies 
if soviet president mikhail gorbachev succeeds that would 
be in the interest of all mitterrand told the newspaper 
that would mean that he would have improved the quality of 
life for the soviets and had relaxed decentralized and adapted the 
soviet unions constitutional and political system i believe he is 
capable of this although it is a terribly difficult task

a group of humanitarian religious and 
antiwar organizations claimed tuesday that the us is 
strengthening the khmer rouge a militant communist faction in 
cambodia through its dealings with that nation 
theres a great discrepancy between preachment and practice 
in the bush administrations policy of condemning the khmer rouge 
while aiding factions allied with it sidney peck cochairman of 
an effort to change the us policy said during a news conference 
public opinion is growing in the united states for blocking not 
only a return to power but also any form of cooperation with the 
khmer rouge he said peck said the group has been blamed for more 
than 1 million cambodian deaths during its 197578 rule over the 
southeast asian country 
that message was stressed by members of the coalition of 45 
organizations during a day of lobbying congress said peck who 
heads mobilization for survival a humanitarian aid group he said 
a delegation also discussed cambodia with richard solomon the 
assistant secretary of state for east asia 
coalition representatives said the agony of the cambodian people 
was being prolonged by us insistence on a comprehensive cambodian 
peace package while the country endures deepening hardship from the 
cutoff of aid from former communist countries in europe 
if we continue to say nothing is settled until everything is 
settled we may find we have lost everything the comprehensive 
approach is at odds with a peace process approach and runs the 
risk that it wont be settled at all said jeremy stone 
president of the federation of american scientists a peace 
movement group 
the campaign was triggered in part by senate democratic leader 
george mitchells recent announcement of intelligence committee 
oversight hearings to determine if the bush administrations 
cambodia policy complied with congress bar on use of us funds 
that had the effect of helping or augmenting khmer rouge operations 
mitchell charged in a june 11 floor speech that the 
administration has been slow to realize that its current policy 
in effect sanctions the return of the murderous khmer rouge 
some lawmakers have talked of stronger restrictions and a house 
subcommittee last week considered ending current nonlethal 
us aid to the noncommunist factions in cambodia 
david elder of the american friends service committee a quaker 
organization said us policy however intentioned has had the 
effect of creating a much stronger khmer rouge than before 
visible to every visitor 
the coalition said it has documents and press reports showing 
that the usaided noncommunist factions headed by prince norodom 
sinhanouk and son sann have collaborated at the highest military 
and intelligence levels with the khmer rouge in their joint fight 
against the hun sen government in phnom penh that government was 
installed by vietnamese troops who in 1979 ended khmer rouge rule 
and occupied the country for 11 years

an eerie calm marked the conversations between 
the copilot and air traffic controllers before a colombian jetliner 
ran out of fuel and crashed last january in new york according to 
tapes played tuesday by federal regulators 
avianca flight 52 plowed into a hillside in suburban cove neck 
long island killing 73 of 158 aboard including the threeman 
cockpit crew the disaster occurred jan 25 after the plane missed 
its first approach to kennedy international airport and was going 
around for another attempt 
on the tapes played at federal aviation administration 
headquarters the copilot sounded almost blase as he told air 
traffic controllers the plane was running low on fuel 
climb and maintain 3000 and uh were running out of fuel 
sir the copilot told a controller after the plane missed its 
first approach to kennedy in heavy fog and wind 
asked whether the plane had enough fuel to fly 15 miles to the 
northeast and turn around for another approach the copilot said 
almost timidly i guess so thank you very much 
nor was there a trace of panic when minutes later the avianca 
copilot radioed avianca zerofivetwo we just ah lost two 
engines and we need priority please 
the controller then told the plane to turn left but avianca 52 
never replied in between giving instructions to another plane the 
controller calmly called twice again for flight 52 
no answer 
then the controller said evenly avianca zerofivetwo radar 
contact lost 
by then the plane had crashed in cove neck an affluent new 
york city suburb the flight had originated in bogota and medellin 
colombia 
the national transportation safety board scheduled hearings 
wednesday and thursday in melville ny into the cause of the 
crash 
the tapes played tuesday confirmed earlier reports that the 
copilot never used the word emergency in describing the planes 
situation according to transcripts of the cockpit conversations 
released in march the pilot told the copilot twice in spanish to 
tell air traffic controllers the plane was in emergency 
had the copilot used the word emergency the plane would 
have gotten immediate clearance to land instead it was kept in a 
holding pattern for more than an hour before starting its first 
landing approach 
the tapes also underscored how many flights were stacked up 
outside kennedy that evening another flight on american airlines 
also reported having enough fuel for the approach and landing and 
thats it 
several flights reported encountering wind shear a dangerous 
unpredictable crosswind 
at one point a controller in the kennedy tower got confused as 
to whether he was talking to an avensa flight or the doomed avianca 
jet

east german prime minister lothar de maiziere said 
tuesday that a unified germany cannot belong to nato unless the 
organizations structure and strategies are radically modified 
de maiziere said the unification of east germany and west 
germany should be seen as part of a paneuropean process and 
stressed that the future security of europe should be based on 
collective structures 
one must not displace the blocs but go beyond them he said 
but he added that intermediary structures were necessary 
a united germany belonging to nato would not be acceptable to 
our neighbors to the east unless the structures and strategies of 
nato are radically modified de maiziere said he was speaking at 
a news conference at the end of a twoday visit 
he expressed hope that at the july meeting of the north atlantic 
treaty organization progress would be made on this issue

were exporting products to east germany and not moving factories to 
produce such goods into the east

a federal appeals court panel ruled tuesday 
that the federal election commission ruled improperly that spending 
limits had not been exceeded in the 1983 senate campaign of dan 
evans in washington state 
the court reversed an earlier us district court decision 
approving of the fecs action the case was sent back to the lower 
court for reconsideration 
the citizens lobby group common cause had complained to the 
election commission that two republican political action committees 
were affiliated and had coordinated their spending on evans 
behalf together the funds exceeded the federal limit 
the groups were the republican national independent expenditure 
committee rniec and the national republican senatorial committee 
nrsc 
evans who had been appointed to fill the seat left vacant by 
the death of sen henry m jackson won a full term in a special 
election in november 1983 he has since left the senate 
we are unable to uphold the commissions decision because 
it gives no indication that the agency considered whether the nrsc 
and the rniec were affiliated said the appeals court the 
brief lacks any discussion of the affiliation issue that is 
independent of the analysis of the separate coordination issue 
under the law affiliated political action committers are those 
that are established financed maintained or controlled by the 
same person or group 
in the course of the 1983 campaign democrats had complained 
that rniec which had been set up by sen john heinz rpa spent 
185000 in electiongrams to republicans in washington state 
urging them to turn out to vote in the special election the rnsc 
already had put the maximum 260000 into evans race 
common cause claimed rodney smith served as financial director 
and treasurer of the nrsc until two months before he became a 
cofounder of the other group and that heinz continued to be a 
member of nrsc a short time after he became involved with rniec 
the appeals court said there is simply no indication that 
the fec ever considered whether smith or heinz had authority or 
influence over the two committees

federal safety investigators blamed both a 
railroad and a pipeline company tuesday for inadequate procedures 
in a may 1989 derailment and resulting pipeline explosion that 
killed six people in san bernardino calif 
the national transportation safety board said the calnev pipe 
line co gasoline pipeline was damaged by earthmoving equipment 
clearing the 69car southern pacific train that ran off the rails 
into several houses after speeding out of control down an incline 
four people were killed in the may 12 derailment and two in the 
petroleum pipeline explosion and fire nearly two weeks later 
the board said the probable cause of the train derailment was 
failure to determine the accurate weight for the train on that 
run failure to communicate to communicate to the engineer that 
fewer engines than he thought had working dynamic brakes and the 
inadequacy of southern pacific rules on allowable speed and brake 
operation down the incline 
dynamic braking is the running of the electric motors on the 
engine as generators and dissipating the electrical energy thus 
produced in a bank of resistors 
the ntsb blamed the pipeline accident on inadequate testing and 
inspection of the line following the derailment it said calnevs 
failure to inspect and test check valves on the 14inch pipe also 
contributed to the accident 
the fourmember board which investigates all major 
transportation and pipeline accidents issued 23 recommendations 
for federal and local action 
the independent board which held a hearing on the accident last 
year in san bernardino has no regulatory powers but its 
recommendations often lead to new procedures to improve safety 
the board advised southern pacific to require train dispatchers 
and train operators to improve communication on condition of the 
train the number of locomotives with functioning dynamic brakes 
the tonnage of the train and other items critical to safety 
investigators determined that only three of the six locomotives 
on the southern pacific train had functioning dynamic brakes while 
the engineer in the lead engine thought he had four 
the trains total weight was incorrectly estimated in southern 
pacifics computerized system at 6150 tons when it was actually 
9000 tons board staff investigators said and the railroads 
computers could still list the wrong weights for operating crews 
even after changes made by southern pacific following the accident 
based on actual tonnage available dynamic brakes and southern 
pacific operating rules the train should not have been permitted 
to operate down the 22 percent grade the board said in its 
conclusions 
the headend engineer may have been able to bring the train 
safely down the hill had he crested the hill at 15 mph which he 
would have been required to do if the dispatcher had informed him 
of the correct trailing tonnage 
it said the railroads operating rules provided inadequate 
guidance to the head engineer on the allowable speed and air 
brake settings down the grade 
it recommended that calnev test all mainline check valves 
annually

the bush administration responded coolly on 
tuesday to an israeli peace overture to syria and dealt cautiously 
with the new government in jerusalem 
the administration kept talking to the palestine liberation 
organization even as it withheld a judgment on the way chairman 
yasser arafat has handled an attempt by guerrillas to raid a tel 
aviv beach last month 
a state department spokesman richard boucher said he knew of 
no plans to invite the new israeli foreign minister david levy to 
washington 
the usually warm relations with israel turned chilly last week 
when secretary of state james a baker iii questioned prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs commitment to peace talks the phone 
number of the white house switchboard is 2024561414 he said 
in remarks during a house foreign affairs committee hearing when 
youre serious about peace call us 
on monday in another thrust at shamirs hardline likud 
government the white house disclosed president bush had written 
the prime minister to find out whether he supports his own plan for 
palestinian elections 
in the letter bush urged shamir to open a dialogue with 
palestinian arabs shamir who last year proposed negotiations with 
elected palestinian representatives on the west bank and in gaza 
said monday he would reply to bush 
despite the tensions in usisraeli relations a senior 
administration official said that washington is not going to turn 
its back on the middle east situation no matter what happens we 
have a lot of friends out there both in israel and in arab 
countries 
we will work every hard to stay engaged the official said 
insisting on anonymity the official added there is absolutely 
no daylight between the president and secretary baker on the 
middle east 
on tuesday the state department commented tersely on shamirs 
invitation to president hafez assad of syria to visit jerusalem for 
peace talks 
the us supports contacts between israel and its neighbors 
boucher said at the daily state department briefing 
he used the same word contacts to describe the talks 
robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia has held 
with plo officials even after the palestine liberation front 
claimed responsibility for the attempted may 30 raid on tel aviv 
there have been continuing contacts but i dont have any 
details to add boucher said 
abul abbas leader of the plf is a member of the plo executive 
committee the state department has been urging arafat to denounce 
the raid and discipline abbas 
when we have something to say well say it boucher said to 
a question about the 16month us dialogue 
shamirs invitation to assad appeared to be an attempt to show 
the bush administration the new government in jerusalem seeks peace 
with its arab neighbors 
last tuesday the israeli cabinet secretary eliakhim 
rubinstein flew to washington to inform the bush administration 
the shamir government is determined to come to peace terms with its 
neighbors 
rubinstein met with robert kimmitt the under secretary of state 
for political affairs dennis ross the head of the state 
departments policy planning staff and john kelly the assistant 
secretary of state for the near east 
meanwhile us ambassador william brown met in israel with 
shamir and with levy who is recovering from a mild heart attack 
boucher said he knew of no invitation to levy who is largely an 
unknown figure to us policymakers to visit washington nor 
boucher said did he know of any telephone contacts between baker 
and levy 
we have an embassy there and were in very close touch with 
the israeli government all the time about a variety of issues 
the spokesman said 
baker dealt closely with levys predecessor moshe arens the 
americaneducated engineer who has shifted to defense minister 
unlike arens who grew up in new york city and most prominent 
israelis levy does not speak english

government troops blasted and burned 
rebel bunkers tuesday pushing tamil tiger guerrillas into jungles 
in the east the military said 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne told parliament the 
offensive would crush the rebels there is no escape for the 
tigers they will have to die here he said 
in other eastern areas and in the north the rebel force known 
as the liberation tigers of tamil eelam launched its own 
offensive and relentlessly rained government positions with mortars 
and rockets military officials said 
the military officials who cannot be named under briefing 
rules said at least three rebels were killed and three policemen 
injured when commandos clashed with the tigers near tirrukkovil in 
eastern ampara district 
they said a rebel leader identified only as dayaparan was 
fatally shot by soldiers in northern vavuniya district where the 
guerrillas stepped up rocket and mortar attacks on a military camp 
according to reports by witnesses military sources and tiger 
officials about 1000 people have died in fighting that began june 
11 when a 13monthold ceasefire collapsed the guerrillas have 
been fighting since 1973 for a separate homeland 
the tigers apparently remained in control of the predominantly 
tamil north 
but the government attack on their bunkers drove them from 
batticoloa district in the east 
the tigers alleged tuesday that the government offensive had 
forced more than 100000 tamils and moslems to flee their homes in 
the district 
batticaloa town 136 miles from colombo on the eastern coast 
had been the flashpoint in the weeks fighting 
sri lankan military officials in colombo said dozens of armored 
personnel carriers and soldiers on foot moved out of an air base 
and a military camp tuesday and blasted their way into batticaloa 
town 
residents contacted by telephone said they heard bombs explode 
and could see columns of smoke the residents who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said civilians stayed inside when the 
soldiers moved in 
the military officials said soldiers first cordoned the town 
then destroyed rebel bunkers and cleared land mines and booby traps 
hundreds of troop reinforcements tuesday reached the besieged 
military camps at kiran and kalawanchukudi in batticaloa district 
forcing the tigers to retreat into the jungles the officials said 
in the northern jaffna peninsula soldiers used helicopters and 
armored cars to repulse a rebel attack they said 
in the indian city of madras six unidentified gunmen burst into 
a house where moderate sri lankan tamil leaders were staying and 
opened fire killing 13 people including at least seven of the 
leaders the press trust of india reported 
madras the capital of indias tamil nadu state has been used 
as a base by several sri lankan separatist groups 
most of indias 60 million tamils live in tamil nadu which is 
separated from sri lanka by a narrow sea strait 
the ceasefire was called in may 1989 after the two sides opened 
negotiations to end the tamil revolt against the 
sinhalesedominated government 
at least 11000 people have been killed in fighting since 1983 
during negotiations the government had pledged to delegate 
provincial autonomy to the tamils in the north and the east where 
the rebels control most of the major towns at the same time it 
allowed the tigers virtually a free hand in the region 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
they claim they are discriminated against by the majority sinhalese 
who make up 75 percent of the population

the 16 billion circus circus company which started with a 
single struggling strip hotelcasino 16 years ago has become the 
envy of the gaming industry with a strategy focusing on lowrollers 
rather than coveted highrollers 
chairman william bennett announced to stockholders last week 
that the company planned to reduce its 500 million debt by about 
200 million in the coming year largely on added revenue from the 
excalibur 
glenn schaeffer chief financial officer for circus circus said 
the company could probably pay off all its debt in three or four 
years from excalibur revenue but may opt to look at new projects 
schaeffer said the company which once eyed atlantic city now 
has no interest in expanding to new jersey our desire is to have 
the strongest balance sheet in the industry he said 
the excalibur is anchored by four 28story towers and covers 70 
acres it has about 500000 square feet of public entertainment 
space including a renaissance village 12 food outlets and a 
casino the size of four football fields with 2630 slot machines 
shows will feature a medieval flair with live jousting 
an arcade will feature a dozen themed game booths such as 
archery and electronic crossbows 
the hotel has 4300 workers enough wallcovering to paper an 
area 10 acres in size enough carpeting to blanket 11 football 
fields 
it will replace another las vegas property that held the title 
of the worlds largest hotel the 3530room flamingo hilton 
tuesdays opening will give circus circus a total of 11320 
rooms in nevada with hotels in las vegas reno and laughlin by 
comparison atlantic citys 12 major hotels total 8100 rooms 
with the addition of the excalibur las vegas now has 75000 
hotel rooms

a 30mile oil slick from the wrecked 
supertanker mega borg lingered 10 miles off the texas coast 
tuesday and the coast guard backed off predictions of where or 
when it might reach land 
i think predicting anything at this time is probably very 
premature said coast guard lt cmdr frank whipple coast guard 
officials had predicted that it would float ashore near galveston 
on tuesday 
i think whats very good news is the fact that its not coming 
closer to the beach right now its staying offshore whipple 
said that allows more evaporation allows the contractors more 
time to pick the oil out of the water weve been trying all along 
to remove as much of it from the water before it got to the beach 
whipple said crews have recovered 463000 gallons of an oil and 
water mixture skimmed from the gulf of mexico 
the spill of 39 million gallons of the 38 million gallons of 
oil aboard the mega borg followed a june 8 explosion aboard the 
supertanker about 57 miles from galveston 
most of the oil spilled has burned off evaporated or been 
collected coast guard officials have been hesitant to say just how 
much oil remains in the slick and sheen 
were kind of staying away from those figures chief warrant 
office rick meidt said weve already picked up something like 
five times more oil than we thought was in the water but i should 
point out what were picking up is an oily water mixture that is 
about 20 percent oil and 80 percent water 
coast guard officials said the slick could come ashore closer to 
high island 30 miles northeast of galveston rather than sea rim 
park which is further to the northeast 
thats good news said petty officer mark sedwick that 
means it will be away from the marsh areas where we were concerned 
about the wildlife 
about 1200 volunteers from five counties were on alert to clean 
up beaches should the tar balls arrive 
state officials also wrapped up tests on oileating bacteria 
that was poured into the oil during the weekend 
weve got some good samples said blanton moore of the texas 
general land office we know some change occurred but what that 
change is we dont really know until we run some lab samples 
the mexican skimmer ecopemex and 10 other skimmers continued to 
skim oil off the water booms and other deflector devices have been 
deployed to protect the shoreline 
two crew members died in the explosion and two others are 
missing and presumed dead

the leader of the rebel delegation 
to liberian peace talks has denied accepting a ceasefire and said 
the insurgents continue to demand the exile of president samuel doe 
thomas woewiyu interviewed monday night also spurned does 
offer of a general amnesty that would permit the insurgents in 
liberia to set up their own political party 
doe on monday legalized several opposition political parties and 
said the national patriotic front could set up a party without fear 
of reprisals 
doe has no authority to grant anybody amnesty he is not in a 
position to grant amnesty he can only grant himself amnesty 
said woewiyu 
he added our ultimate leader charles taylor controls the 
military machine and whatever doe says will not stop our military 
leaders military planning 
the rebel delegation signed an agreement calling for both sides 
to exercise restraint during the recess in the talks 
fighting had virtually ceased before the talks began after 
government forces inflicted their first major defeat on the rebels 
since taylors forces invaded from neighboring ivory coast on dec 
24 
the rebels were driven from the firestone rubber plantation and 
neighboring international airport 35 miles from monrovia after 
their chief military commander elmer johnson a former boston area 
resident was killed in a skirmish 
woewiyu said the agreement applies more to does extramilitary 
activities his death squads chopping off peoples heads and 
throwing away their bodies that has nothing to do with a 
ceasefire 
survivors who have fled rebelcontrolled territory say the 
insurgents also committed atrocities reporters who have visited 
them saw the skulls of dead liberian soldiers stuck on stakes along 
the roadside 
the reason for the recess is for further consultation we have 
an unnegotiable precondition to be met and does people at the 
peace talks were not in a position to discuss the subject of does 
departure from government 
it is doe who needs an amnesty and he better take it now 
before it is too late 
woewiyu said the rebels accepted the recess to give doe time to 
flee 
the talks mediated by the liberian council of churches are 
scheduled to resume june 25

the employer of a young american kidnapped 
in the ecuadoran jungle said tuesday he believed the abductors were 
guerrillas from neighboring colombia 
jeffrey fino general manager of iminco the small gold mining 
enterprise that employed scott heimdal said a peoria ill 
television station was mistaken in reporting a former contractor 
had orchestrated heimdals kidnapping 
fino said a legal complaint filed by the company against the 
contractor has been misinterpreted by the news media 
this is an old document and an old action that the company 
filed against a contractor fino said 
he supplied us with information that there may be a 
kidnapping we dont know where that information came from thats 
the only thing that ties him to the kidnapping i cant say he 
collaborated with the kidnappers he said 
fino described the contractor as an ecuadoran who had become a 
naturalized us citizen 
the man mentioned in the civil and criminal complaint filed by 
iminco on may 1 had a contract with the company to transport mining 
equipment to the jungle area where iminco was searching for gold 
fino said 
the associated press obtained a copy of the document tuesday 
the complaint accuses the man of attempting to extort 48000 
from fino in return for not harassing him with legal actions 
against the mining enterprise 
the document also says he told the company he had information 
that fino might be kidnapped or killed 
the complaint asks the police to investigate the contractors 
possible complicity or coverup of the crimes of kidnapping 
assassination and attempted extortion 
but fino said tuesday he believed heimdals kidnappers were 
colombian guerrillas 
according to communications from scott and other evidence we 
feel the kidnappers are colombian guerrillas he said 
the armed men who seized heimdal april 28 as he traveled along 
the bermeja river near the colombian border identified themselves 
as members of the peoples liberation army a communist guerrilla 
group in colombia the kidnappers killed the boats driver in the 
attack 
in an interview last week with the ap fino showed photos taken 
of heimdal in the guerrilla camp the rebels wore camouflage 
uniforms and had automatic weapons 
fino who has been closely involved in negotiations to win 
heimdals freedom said the kidnappers have behaved erratically in 
their meetings with his gobetween 
heimdals parents roy and marge heimdal of peoria arrived in 
quito monday night to try to win their sons release they refused 
to talk to reporters 
the heimdals a workingclass family gathered 60000 in 
community donations to pay ransom for their sons release but they 
learned last week they had been mistaken and the kidnappers had all 
along demanded 612000 that the 60000 was only to 
guarantee they wouldnt kill heimdal 
it looks like im going to have to go and get him out mrs 
heimdal told the peoria journal star this weekend im tired of 
just sitting and doing nothing about all this 
us embassy officials have said they are concerned that the 
wide publicity the kidnapping has received may complicate 
negotiations to win heimdals release and could endanger his life

an army of police 100 tow trucks 150 miles of 
ticker tape hawkers of 15 tshirts and every last dog in the bomb 
squad all were ready for nelson mandelas arrival wednesday in 
the united states 
no one seemed readier than the man who will put mandela up for 
three nights mayor david dinkins 
speaking tuesday at a national mayors meeting in chicago new 
yorks first black mayor said that mandela comes to america as a 
transcendent symbol of freedom and as a solitary person who is 
altering world history 
he also promised to alter life in new york accustomed though 
the city is to gridlockwreaking visitors 
a security effort code named operation topaz enlisted 
thousands of city police officers and federal and state agents in 
an attempt to make sure the first visit to an american city by the 
leader of the african national congress is a safe one 
a key weapon was what police call the mandelamobile a 
flatbed truck outfitted with a bulletproof glass bubble large 
enough for mandela and several others 
there are concerns about the health of the 71yearold mandela 
whose 27 years in a south african prison included stretches of hard 
labor ambulances will be stationed at cross streets along the 
route and the citys emergency medical service has been given a 
detailed medical history 
given the geographic breadth of his schedule and the polices 
determination to keep his travel route clear mandelas visit was 
expected to cause particular difficulties for motorists during the 
next three days this is more of a headache than when the 
president comes said stephanie pinto a spokeswoman for the 
traffic department 
city workers had painted new yorks official colors blue and 
orange in a line down the middle of broadway filled potholes 
along the route of mandelas motorcade and in a move that one 
observer described as unprecedented washed the windows on city 
hall 
mandela whose stop in new york is the first on a 12day tour of 
eight us cities will sleep at gracie mansion the mayors 
residence the place has only three bedrooms which meant the 
mayors son david was evicted or as his father put it hes 
been kind enough to relocate 
but is the maple imitationbamboo bed in the state bedroom big 
enough for the 6foot4 mandela our measurements say it will 
work insisted deputy mayor bill lynch 
mandela arrives wednesday morning at kennedy international 
airport and stops in brooklyn to speak to a group of young people 
before proceeding to manhattan for a tickertape parade up lower 
broadways concrete canyon of heros 
for an oldtime flavor the city imported genuine ticker tape 
about 150 miles of inchwide paper ribbon was provided by a 
connecticut company that claims to be the nations last tickertape 
supplier computers have almost completely replaced tickers 
the rest of mandelas new york city visit has plenty of 
contrast ranging as it does from a street rally in harlem on 
thursday to a 2500aperson reception on friday night catered by 
actor robert de niros new tribeca grill 
the latter is part of an effort to raise funds for mandelas 
african national congress and the battle against apartheid in south 
africa the tours organizers also have licensed the sale of 
various items including a mandela tour poster 5 a ceramic cup 
with mandelas picture 8 and a tshirt bearing amandla the 
zulu word for power and mandalas name 15 
this being new york there were several developing controversies 
amid the preparations 
at gracie mansion on tuesday evening about 100 jewish 
protesters condemned mandelas support for the palestine liberation 
organization while supporting his cause in south africa 
we ask our black brothers and sisters to understand our pain 
in being here said rabbi avi weiss nelson mandela is a hero 
in the antiapartheid struggle we join as one in this struggle 
weiss group planned another demonstration for wednesday near 
city hall where mandela is to receive the key to the city 
rock promoter bill graham pulled out as organizer of a concert 
and rally scheduled for thursday night at yankee stadium citing 
disagreements with city officials they in turn blamed grahams 
failure to promote the event for poor ticket sales 
about 20000 of 45000 tickets have been sold and graham has 
been replaced by another wellknown producer ron delsener

a federal grand jury on tuesday indicted the 
retired head of the us food and drug administrations generic 
drug division on two counts of perjury in a corruption scandal 
involving the division 
the indictment accuses marvin seife of lying to government 
investigators about meetings with genericdrug company executives 
and about whether he let them buy him meals said us attorney 
breckinridge willcox 
seife who prosecutors said lives in san antonio did not have a 
telephone listing in that area his lawyers name was not available 
fda spokeswoman faye peterson said the agency had not seen the 
indictment and declined to comment 
the indictment was the latest development in the investigation 
into corruption in the genericdrug industry and among its 
regulators which began in the summer of 1988 
so far four of seifes former subordinates have been convicted 
on corruption and racketeering charges five genericdrug company 
executives three pharmaceutical companies and one industry 
consultant have been convicted on similar charges 
seife 66 retired dec 31 after 17 years as director of the 
genericdrug division where he was responsible for reviewing 
manufacturers applications to market generic drugs to the public 
according to the indictment seife gave a sworn statement oct 
25 to an fda investigator in which he falsely denied meeting with 
two genericdrug company executives on dec 11 1987 to discuss 
fda matters 
the indictment alleges that seife made a similar false statement 
july 11 to the house of representatives subcommittee on oversight 
and investigations 
the second count of the indictment charges that siefe also lied 
in the statement to fda investigators when he said i have made 
it a practice never to have meals with the regulated industry 
the indictment alleges seife accepted numerous lunches dinners and 
drinks paid for by genericdrug companies 
if convicted on both counts seife faces a maximum of 10 years 
in prison and a 500000 fine 
the case has been handled by federal prosecutors in baltimore 
because the fdas headquarters are in rockville

nelson mandela appealed to canadian students 
tuesday to raise funds to help black youth in his south african 
homeland who must deal with harsh police repression and an inferior 
educational system 
a reign of terror is being launched by the police 
specifically against students the black nationalist leader told 
about 1000 teenagers at a toronto high school before flying to 
montreal the last stop on his threeday canadian visit 
on wednesday morning he is to travel to new york to begin an 
eightcity us tour 
i ask you as students to raise funds for the black students 
in south africa who are facing such enormous difficulty said 
mandela the deputy president of the african national congress 
concluding his visit to toronto at central technical school 
mandela 71 was flanked by his wife winnie and external affairs 
minister joe clark 
his speech began more than an hour late because mandela who was 
released in february after spending 27 years in prison for his 
antiapartheid activities needed a little rest a member of 
his entourage told the crowd 
the racially mixed audience at the innercity school remained 
upbeat as they waited chanting freedom power and viva 
mandela 
mandela beamed and waved as the students gave him a standing 
ovation 
during his 20minute speech mandela asked for the creation of 
a special fund to help black students in south africa 
they receive an education far inferior to whites he said 
and those who have spoken out against the system have been 
crushed with force by the whiteminority government 
they have arrested students who have protested others have 
been crippled for life they have confiscated their books its an 
intolerable brutal reign of terror 
many black students have fled the country to seek an education 
depriving the black majority of future leaders he said 
tony silipo chairman of the toronto board of education later 
told the audience a nearby high school had already pledged some 
money 
while the students remained hushed during mandelas appeal they 
cheered wildly when he grinned and joked with them 
he mockingly worried that his many years in prison may have left 
him old and ugly 
now i want you to tell me if that is true 
no no came the response 
students leaving the schools auditorium said they were inspired 
by mandelas message many referred to racial tension in the city 
following recent police shootings of blacks 
he speaks for everyone not just black people said 
katherine duncan a black 12th grader 
in montreal 20000 people jammed into a square behind city hall 
to listen to the south african leader who appealed to canadians to 
maintain economic sanctions against south africa 
prior to the address mandela visited quebecs premier robert 
bourassa who called mandela a living symbol of freedom 
mandela described as absolutely fantastic the reception hes 
been given during his canadian tour which began sunday in the 
canadian capital of ottawa 
it is for that reason that we admire you that we respect you 
and that we love you he said 
mandela is in the midst of a sixweek tour of 14 nations in 
africa europe and north america that began june 6 
mandelas release from prison was part of a program of social 
reforms by the government of president fw de klerk that included 
legalizing the anc and other antiapartheid groups

political voice to the countrys 28 million blacks south africas

florida needs more regulatory 
powers to control outlaws and pirates who provide 
abortions a prosecutor argued tuesday as the state tested the 
limits of a federal injunction 
the state department of health and rehabilitative services has 
proposed new rules to regulate abortion clinics 
but any change would have to be approved by us district judge 
jose gonzalez who rejected similar efforts with the injunction in 
1982 
state assistant attorney general james peters argued tuesday 
that new rules are warranted citing a us supreme court decision 
last summer and the potential for aids transmission in unsanitary 
clinics 
but charlene carres representing florida clinics which filed a 
classaction lawsuit opposing the states effort to revise the 
injunction said existing regulations are sufficient and that 
attempts to go further would violate a patients right to privacy 
and drive up the average 300 cost of an abortion 
it is the exceptions in the industry outlaws pirates or 
whatever who need this type of protection peters said what 
happens here judge is that we are frozen we are standing on our 
own tail 
carres an american civil liberties union lawyer countered that 
no new rules are justified and noted that the states own 
statistics show firsttrimester abortions to be much safer than 
childbirth 
gonzalez promised to rule within a month 
in 1982 gonzalez ruled the state could check on licenses 
records and disposal of fetal remains and make sure only physicians 
perform abortions 
placed off limits to government regulators were staffing 
equipment medicalcare standards and transportation of patients 
during emergencies 
the state claims it is entitled to reenter those areas in part 
because of the us supreme court ruling in july that upheld a 
missouri law requiring viability tests for fetuses after 20 weeks 
that decision was the first limit backed by the nations high 
court since abortion was legalized in 1973 
floridas latest move asks gonzalez to revise his injunction so 
clinics can be further regulated 
the state cited intolerable conditions found at south 
florida clinics last fall after the miami herald detailed 
bloodstained wrappings and leaking oxygen tanks at one clinic 
gov bob martinez a vocal opponent of abortion has repeatedly 
tried unsuccessfully to control abortions in florida through 
legislative administrative and judicial means 
the state supreme court threw out a parental consent law in 
october days later the legislature adjourned a special session on 
abortion regulations without passing a single bill and state 
regulators say snap inspections of abortion clinics last fall 
failed to correct problems 
the attorney generals office says it is trying to guarantee 
abortions under safe medical conditions 
but abortion rights advocates claim the state is trying to 
impose harsher rules than are required for comparable procedures 
like vasectomies

five ec nations on tuesday signed an 
accord under which they will end border checks for their nationals 
apply a joint visa and asylum policy and share data on illegal 
aliens suspected criminals and missing persons 
the longawaited accord between belgium luxembourg the 
netherlands france and west germany was hailed as an example for a 
noborders pact among all 12 european community nations 
our agreement is a model for the free movement of people 
in the community dutch deputy foreign minister piet dankert told 
reporters on behalf of the signatory nations 
yet he doubted all 12 ec nations were ready to remove their 
borders after dec 31 1992 under the ecs singlemarket scheme 
the 12 ec states have not even found unanimity for an accord on 
handling of asylumseekers in the ec 
the fivenation pact will be extended to include east germany 
after its expected merger this year with the federal republic 
making it the first international treaty viewing east and west 
germany as a single entity 
negotiations are to open this week with italy which wants to 
join the schengen accord named for this village on the 
luxembourggermanfrench border where it was signed 
the accord in the works since 1985 must be ratified by the 
national parliaments to take effect ratification may take two 
years 
under the accord the five signatory nations will 
remove internal border checks for their citizens and legal 
residents and let legally admitted people from outside the five 
nations move within their boundaries for three months without a 
visa 
apply a joint policy to prevent asylum shopping whereby 
refugees go from one nation to the next to get residency visas 
intensify cooperation between police and justice officials and 
allow police to chase suspected criminals across national 
boundaries 
simplify extradition procedures and harmonize guncontrol 
legislation 
share information on people wanted or missing or who are 
considered dangerous such a databank will also keep tabs on such 
items as stolen cars and passports 
the schenger agreement primarily benefits passenger traffic on 
road transport the five ec nations pledged to keep border checks 
at the lowest possible level by removing some of the red tape 
that hampers road transporters 
the agreement allows any state to revert to fullfledged border 
checks on national security grounds 
reflecting the sensitive nature of dropping border controls 
tuesdays signing ceremony was three years behind schedule 
in past negotiations the issue has encountered several hurdles 
ranging from luxembourgs refusal to waterdown its bank secrecy 
laws to concerns elsewhere that the computer databank may lead to 
an invasion of privacy

police released dramatic tapes on 
tuesday of terrified office workers pleading for help from police 
as a gunman roamed through the building and shots rang out in the 
background 
were being killed whispered a general motors acceptance 
corp employee as james edward pop pough methodically made his 
way through the auto loan office send the send the swat team 
now 
hes killing everyone another panicked caller 
whispered as the workers waited for police to arrive 
in the tape recordings of calls to the police 911 hot line the 
callers voices reflected the terror of the situation as the gunman 
fired under desks killing eight and wounding five others before 
turning the gun on himself 
hes still in there shooting shooting everybody come 
on implored barry kimbal an employee who ran to a neighboring 
business to call for help 
as police were dispatched emergency operators asked workers for 
a description of the gunman his shirt color and what kind of car 
he was driving as rapid firing could be heard over the phone 
all i know is he came in and starting shooting said another 
panicky voice 
authorities said the 42yearold pough who had a violent past 
a failing marriage and an arsenal of deadly weapons entered the 
office monday morning and blazed away with a cliploaded 
30caliber carbine 
in just a few minutes seven employees and a customer died five 
other people were critically wounded 
the gunman then killed himself with a 38caliber revolver 
authorities could suggest no motive other than that pough had a 
1988 grand am repossessed by gmac the last time gmac had contact 
with pough was in march when they mailed him a letter telling him 
he still owed money gmac president william lovejoy said 
the families of the eight dead still in shock were planning 
funerals and mourning the loss of their loved ones 
what a waste what a damned waste said victim janice 
davids husband ray david tears on his cheeks and the couples 
son in his lap 
i feel depressed i feel cheated said victim cynthia 
perrys mother gail perry she was a joy to everyone 
mayor tommy hazouri called the shootings the darkest moment in 
jacksonville history 
police said pough had shot and killed a man and a woman sunday 
morning in a prostitutionrelated dispute police confirmed tuesday 
that he shot and wounded two teenagers about 10 minutes later 
ballistics tests completed tuesday confirmed that the rifle used 
in the gmac killings was the same gun used in the sunday shootings 
sheriff jim mcmillan said pough also had a 9mm machine pistol 
which authorities found in his car 
we will be following up today and talking to his relatives to 
see if anything happened that might have caused this or if he gave 
any kind of indication police spokesman asa higgs said tuesday 
questions surfaced about poughs background and how he could buy 
a handgun after pleading guilty to an aggravated assault charge in 
which he shot and killed another man in 1971 
duval county circuit judge warren jones withheld a guilty 
verdict pending completion of five years probation with the 
condition that pough not own a weapon 
when pough completed his probation that condition was lifted 
chief assistant state attorney john delaney said tuesday 
he was not technically a convicted felon delaney said 
that made it legal to own a gun under florida law 
but mcmillan said it was illegal for him to own a gun under 
federal law its a loophole we need to plug up the sheriff 
said 
the prosecutor couldnt give the details on the 1971 crime or 
why the charge was reduced from manslaughter because the file has 
been destroyed 
in 1968 pough was fined 75 for displaying a knife in a 
threatening manner and an arrest warrant was outstanding in a 1982 
unemployment compensation fraud case according to court records 
pough who was separated from his wife lived in a rundown 
duplex in jacksonvilles predominantly black northwest quadrant 
neighbors described him as quiet pleasant and helpful but in 
march a circuit judge granted poughs wife theresa an injunction 
to keep him away the protective order prohibited pough from 
communicating with her and meant he had to stay away from where 
she worked and lived 
for the last year pough had been doing maintenance work for the 
w w gay construction co at the anheuserbusch brewery 
a team of gmac officials led by lovejoy flew into jacksonville 
to counsel victims and their families and to set up a temporary

three irish politicians returned home 
tuesday from hostage talks in iran and said conciliatory gestures 
by the united states and israel could help win the release of 
western hostages in lebanon 
the three said they discussed the fate of irish teacher brian 
keenan and the other 15 western hostages believed held by 
proiranian shiite extremists in lebanon 
we discussed all the hostages both those westerners being 
held in lebanon and the islamic hostages held by the israelis 
niall andrews a representative of irish prime minister charles 
haugheys fianna fail party in the european parliament told 
reporters at dublin airport 
the iranians are not looking for ransom or for money they 
are looking for peace and a proper humanitarian settlement to the 
hostage problem he said 
the iranians seemed to have the impression that if there was 
reciprocation on the side of the israelis and the americans they 
could bring about very easily and very quickly a resolution to the 
hostage situation on all sides 
andrews brother david andrews a fianna fail representative in 
the irish parliament said iranian officials wanted the united 
states to reciprocate for irans role in helping obtain the release 
in april of two american hostages robert polhill and frank reed 
the andrews brothers said their visit to tehran with irish 
senator eoin ryan was privately organized and not sponsored by the 
government or any other organization 
the three said they planned to brief haughey on their talks and 
report to keenans family on the latest moves to obtain his release 
david andrews said he suggested to iranian officials that 
members of the keenan family might meet in tehran or dublin with 
families of iranians held in the middle east he said the iranian 
officials promised to consider the proposal 
the three politicians did not name the iranian officials with 
whom they met 
keenan 39 from belfast in northern ireland holds dual irish 
and british citizenship he was working as an english language 
teacher at the american university of beirut when he disappeared 
while walking to work april 11 1986 
the longest held hostage is american terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press seized by 
gunmen near his home in west beirut on march 16 1985 
the most prominent prisoner israel holds is sheikh abdulkarim 
obeid a lebanese shiite moslem cleric captured in july 1989 
israel holds more than 5000 palestinians detained during the 
2yearold arab uprising against israeli occupation of the gaza 
strip and west bank 
in addition more than 300 arab prisoners mostly shiite 
moslems are held by the israelibacked south lebanon army at 
alkhiam just north of the israelilebanese border 
israel has said it would free some of its arab prisoners in 
exchange for the release of three israelis held by shiites in 
lebanon

a judge ruled tuesday that an art gallery and 
its director must stand trial on at least one charge stemming from 
an exhibit of sexually graphic photos by robert mapplethorpe 
this court will try to make a decision of what in ohio 
constitutes the definition of obscenity hamilton county 
municipal judge david albanese said it has been an awesome 
judicial effort in the past and will continue to be so 
obscene material is not protected by the first amendment this 
case is not about the rights of the curious to view an exhibition 
albanese rejected several defense motions to dismiss two 
misdemeanor charges against the contemporary arts center and its 
director dennis barrie 
the first charge set for trial sept 24 involves photographs 
of two children in one a boys genitals are exposed in the 
other a girls genitals are exposed the arts center and barrie 
were charged with illegal use of a minor in nudityoriented 
material or performance 
the second charge pandering obscenity involves five photos 
showing homosexual acts albanese said he wanted an evidentiary 
hearing on that charge before ruling whether it should go to trial 
he scheduled the hearing for aug 20 
the exhibit robert mapplethorpe a perfect moment included 
175 photographs the defense contends all of them should be 
considered in determining whether the entire exhibit is obscene 
prosecutors want the judge to consider only the five photos 
this court is not presumptuous enough to believe that it has 
the background and information necessary to try to rationalize 
whether these pictures can be taken as a whole or independently 
albanese said 
according to court records the photos cited in the indictment 
included pictures showing a hand and other objects inserted into 
anuses 
if convicted barrie could be sentenced to six months in jail 
and be fined 1000 on each charge the arts center could be fined 
5000 on each charge 
in his ruling albanese said he considered the arts center to be 
a gallery rather than a museum and noted that a museum is 
permitted more latitude in displaying art 
a county grand jury indicted the art gallery and barrie on april 
7 after secretly attending the public opening of the exhibit that 
day according to art gallery figures the exhibit drew 80000 
people during its sevenweek run 
one of the defense motions rejected by albanese alleged that 
prosecutors improperly sought a biased judge to issue a search 
warrant allowing them to enter the art gallery to videotape the 
exhibit 
this court believes that any judge on the hamilton county 
municipal court at any time under the proper procedures can and 
should authorize the issuance of a search warrant judge shopping 
simply does not exist in this cause albanese wrote 
he noted that the indictments were returned before the search 
warrant was obtained

nbcs president assailed federal syndication 
and financial interest rules tuesday as reverse protectionism 
that favors foreignowned media conglomerates and hurts the three 
major us networks 
the assertion by robert c wright made at a speech at the 
center for national policy came less than a week after nbc cbs 
and abc urged the federal communications commission to drop its 
20yearold rules 
their action came after they and hollywood producers and studios 
failed to reach a compromise last week on ways to alter the rules 
which the fcc originally adopted as a means of curbing network 
power 
wright said the rules are outdated due to changes in television 
including the growth of cable the establishment of 300 new 
independent stations the 4yearold fox network and home 
videocassette recorders 
the rules have fostered concentration and inhibited 
competition in the 20 years since they were adopted he said 
adding that they constitute nothing less than reverse 
protectionism 
they are domestic trade barriers aimed only at three us 
companies but which leave our foreign competitors alone even more 
absurd the rules restrict us from competing against the foreign 
studios in the foreign markets 
can anyone imagine japan giving nbc or time warner access to 
its markets while at the same time restricting sony 
the fcc rules bar the networks from a financial interest in 
shows they dont wholly own and prohibit them from doing business 
in the lucrative program syndication market in the us 
the producers and the studio have asked the fcc to strengthen 
the rules and investigate the networks for possible violations of 
them the justice department has sided with the networks position 
the center for national policy is a policy institute involved in 
trade and related issues according to a corporate press release 
from nbc

former dictator anastasio somozas 
family will be allowed to return to nicaragua under a recent 
amnesty declared by president violeta barrios de chamorros new 
government a presidential spokesman said tuesday 
a niece and nephew of somoza exiled since his overthrow by the 
leftist sandinistas in july 1979 said they were flying to managua 
the capital saturday to become the first members of the old ruling 
family to return to nicaragua 
presidential spokesman antonio lacayo said the government knew 
absolutely nothing about the planned arrival of luis and julia 
sevilla somoza 
but he said all nicaraguans can come back and begin a new 
life if they want to under the new law 
mrs chamorros usbacked administration which took power 
after defeating the sandinistas in februarys elections decreed an 
unconditional amnesty on may 10 for all the political and related 
common crimes committed by nicaraguan citizens up to the date of 
publication of the current law 
a previous amnesty for political offenders declared by the 
sandinistas only covered crimes committed after the fall of somoza 
leaving his family unprotected 
luis sevilla somoza one of about 100 somoza family members 
living in exile in the united states and europe said he and his 
sister julia planned to spend a week in managua meeting with 
ministers of chamorros government and cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo 
sevilla somoza said he wanted to explore ways to help rebuild 
the country and investment opportunities during his upcoming trip 
basically its a trip to see whats going on and find out how 
we can help the government and the church he said 
lacayo was cautious in commenting about the intentions of the 
sevilla somozas 
although they are covered by the broad amnesty declared their 
coming to work with the government or recover property is another 
thing lacayo said the sandinistas confiscated somoza family 
holdings after the revolution that brought the guerrilla movement 
to power 
about a halfmillion nicaraguans or 17 percent of the countrys 
citizens are living abroad 
thousands fled immediately following somozas ouster and many 
more abandoned their homeland during the sandinistas rule to 
escape hard times caused by usbacked economic sanctions and the 
civil war with contra rebels 
since mrs chamorros election visit the united states has 
restored normal economic relations with nicaragua and the contras 
have mostly demobilized as part of a peace plan but the economy 
has continued to worsen with the new administration devaluing the 
currency 11 times in less than two months 
despite the amnesty few nicaraguans have returned home from 
abroad 
the 1978 assassination of mrs chamorros husband la prensa 
newspaper publisher pedro joaquin chamorro was one of the events 
that sparked the overthrow of anastasio somoza by the sandinistas 
mrs chamorro later broke with the sandinistas over their leftist 
policies 
anastasio somoza fled to paraguay where he was assassinated on 
an asuncion street by bazookawielding assailants in 1980 
sevilla somoza said his family believes that the sore feelings 
have subsided and it is safe for them to return to nicaragua 
we were never in the government in politics or the army he 
said we are good people with much to offer

a second group of amateur astronomers will be 
given a chance to use the hubble space telescope the telescopes 
operators announced tuesday 
they said an earlier offer to amateurs was such a success that 
they decided to do it again 
i think it shows we were so pleased with the types of 
proposals the imagination creativity and thought that went into 
the first ones that it justified doing it again said ray 
villard a spokesman for the space telescope science institute at 
johns hopkins university 
the hubble space telescope was launched into orbit april 25 
aboard the space shuttle discovery free from the distorting 
effects of earths atmosphere the 15 billion telescope is 
designed to study the furthest reaches of the universe 
five amateur astronomers were chosen from hundreds of 
applications the first time they have been allocated 17 hours of 
telescope time about 1 percent of the time granted to 
professionals villard said 
the number of applicants in the second group and the amount of 
time they will be given has not been decided he said 
i would expect it would be comparable villard said it 
might not sound like a lot but considering the competition there 
really is a lot of science that could be done with that much time 
the group of five astronomers chosen the first time will be 
allowed to use the hubble telescope in 1991 the next group will be 
given access in 1992 villard said 
its the opportunity of a lifetime not for professionals but 
for the average person said john hewitt one of the first five 
amateurs selected the program is very unique as far as i know 
no other observatory director has in a sense opened the door like 
this 
after a rigorous selection process the finalists are flown to 
baltimore to work with institute scientists and technicians to 
refine their observing requirements and are then scheduled along 
with professional programs the amateurs are invited back to the 
institute to observe the incoming data and use the institutes 
computers to analyze it 
frankly astronomy is one of the areas where an everyday 
person can do some exploration and discover something and make a 
meaningful contribution villard said 
several of the proposals made by the original five astronomers 
are unique applications of the telescope that had not been proposed 
by professional astronomers he said 
ana larson of seattle plans to look for planets being formed 
around stars by using the telescopes infrared capabilities 
planets being formed known as protoplanets are brighter than 
normal planets in the infrared range while condensing villard said 
hewitt a science museum educator in berkeley calif has 
access to the telescope as soon as the next star is observed going 
nova hewitt plans to use the light generated by the nova to 
discover literally billions of comets that astronomers believe may 
surround stars 
the whole idea is an amateur at home might just come up with 
something creative and different yet scientifically feasible 
villard said they might approach a scientific question from a 
different angle

a federal judge on tuesday ordered the smalltown 
bank that has been holding a cache of stolen medieval art to open 
its vault for inventory by the east german cathedral that claims 
the treasure 
us district judge sidney a fitzwater also ordered that the 
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the 
inspectors and the objects 
the art is believed to have been stolen from a german mine shaft 
at the end of world war ii by a us soldier from texas german art 
experts have said the treasures are worth millions of dollars but 
no specific estimate is available 
the president of a first national bank branch in the town of 
whitewright said he never knew the art had been stolen and has been 
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership 
we wanted to do what was right branch president john farley 
said in an interview published tuesday in the denison herald 
the lutheran cathedral in quedlinburg east germany is suing to 
recover the artwork from first national and the family of joe t 
meador a former army first lieutenant who is believed to have 
stolen the objects and stashed them in his hometown of whitewright 
about 60 miles north of dallas 
the treasure disappeared in 1945 from a mine shaft in 
quedlinburg a castle town occupied by us troops at the end of 
world war ii 
meador died of cancer in 1980 and his family put the objects in 
the bank for safekeeping farley said he oversees the whitewright 
branch but is based at denison about 70 miles north of dallas 
farley told the associated press the bank will ask to be dropped 
from the lawsuit because first national never claimed to own the 
relics he declined to answer further questions about the case 
a church representative met with farley on may 7 to demand 
return of the treasures the lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects 
were taken by meador including a silver ivory and gold reliquary 
from the 9th or 10th century a 10th century byzantine rockcrystal 
flask with sides shaped like birds and an ivory comb inlaid with 
precious stones 
farley and his attorney timothy powers told the denison herald 
the bank had been negotiating with the church and the meador family 
the talks broke down last week when the story broke and 
international attention focused on the bank and whitewright 
population 1760 farley said 
he said keeping the treasures did not affect the banks daily 
business or financial status 
were on the sidelines he said im sorry that we were 
not able to get the parties to agree its not in anyones best 
interest to incur litigation costs 
fitzwater revised his inventory order tuesday after conference 
calls with attorneys on both sides of the dispute 
he also ruled on a defense request that had been informally made 
tuesday but his office declined to reveal the nature of the 
decision or the request until the request is formally filed with 
the court wednesday 
fitzwater dictated the circumstances of the inventory down to 
the placement of cameras and a requirement that all inspectors wear 
cotton gloves 
attorneys for the defendants did not return phone calls seeking 
comment 
meadors brother and sister jack meador of whitewright and jane 
meador cook of mesquite have declined to comment 
government officials have said it is unclear whether criminal 
charges could be brought in the case because of statutes of 
limitations on thefts of art and antiquities 
ely maurer a state department assistant legal adviser for 
cultural property said criminal charges might be pursued under the 
national stolen property act the law prohibits interstate or 
international transport of stolen art or artifacts 
the law might be extended to heirs if they knew the art was 
stolen and transferred it across state lines maurer said

the largest carnivore ever to roam the 
earth is emerging from the badlands of eastern montana after 
being buried for 65 million years 
a museum crews careful digging has uncovered most of an intact 
skeleton of a tyrannosaurus rex only the eighth ever found the 
remains exposed so far include the skull tail pelvis area arm 
and back 
the lower arm bones are the first ever found for any trex 
the tyrannosaurus is perhaps the most fabled of all dinosaurs 
because of its size nearly 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet 
high and its meateating diet 
if you like ferocity ferocious things the trex has got 
to be at the top of the list said jack horner of the museum of 
the rockies in bozeman mont it has a whole mouth full of steak 
knives which it almost exclusively used to eat meat 
tyrannosaurus rex teeth were up to 6 inches long the skull 
being unearthed is 4 feet long with eye sockets 4 to 5 inches in 
diameter the socket hole in the pelvis where the leg attached is 
10 inches across 
horner head of paleontology at the museum said the scientific 
value of the trex skeleton is limited but it will be a big 
drawing card for the museum 
its a real showy thing he said monday then well show 
them things they might not have driven so far to see but i think 
are better 
horner is known internationally for his discoveries of dinosaur 
fossils in the northern plains and the rocky mountain foothills as 
well as his theories on dinosaur behavior 
his work has shown that dinosaurs tended to care for their 
young more like birds than modernday reptiles among the museum 
displays is a dinosaur nest with fossilized baby dinosaurs just 
emerging from their fossilized eggs 
horner said the tyrannosaurus rex will be studied and a 
scientific description written 
nicholas hotton a curator of paleontology at the smithsonian 
institution in washington dc said any new knowledge about the 
giant carnivore would help 
tyrannosaurus rex was discovered early this century 
it was described in a paper three pages long and thats all 
there is nobody has ever described it in detail hotton said 
the newly discovered skeleton still has all the vertebrae from 
the back and tail fused together the skull broke off at the neck 
but is only several feet away from the neck and back leg bones 
have been found near the skull and more are thought to be buried 
beneath the other bones 
it will take a dozen people several more weeks to finish the 
painstaking task of exposing the bones which will then be put in 
plaster casts and loaded on trucks to be hauled to the museum

as thousands of scientists gather at an 
international conference on aids a matching army will fill the 
streets with demonstrations to protest how the us government is 
dealing with the lethal illness 
protesters from around the country have arrived along with the 
estimated 10000 researchers attending the sixth international 
conference on aids which runs from wednesday through sunday 
the protesters are led by the aids coalition to unleash power 
act up a militant group founded three years ago in new york the 
demonstrations are designed to call attention to what act up member 
arawn eibhlyn calls the complete lack of government response to 
the epidemic 
the protests began tuesday afternoon when more than 1000 people 
marched 10 blocks through downtown to demonstrate at the offices of 
the us immigration and naturalization service protesting the 
1987 law barring people with the human immunodeficiency virus from 
entering the country 
the march was orderly eight people were arrested after going 
through a police barrier in front of the building 
one marcher was arrested by city police and seven by federal 
police all on misdemeanor charges said san francisco police 
spokesman david ambrose 
as the arrests were made the crowd chanted the eyes of the 
world are watching 
about halfway along the marchers route a huge cloth banner 
reading stop aids stop ins terror was unfurled from 
scaffolding on a building 
later about 100 people demonstrated inside the marriott hotel 
where part of the conference is being held chanting its our 
conference too 
conference cochairman paul volberding warned earlier tuesday 
that the 1992 conference is scheduled for boston but may have to be 
held outside the united states if the immigration restrictions are 
not lifted 
the policy has people riled up and angry act up member 
jorge cortinas said the pressure is really on 
these policies have nothing to do with stopping aids san 
francisco aids foundation member rene durazzo said of the 
immigration law they are to punish and abuse its that simple 
the ins in april agreed to grant 10day visas to people with the 
virus so that they could attend this and other professional 
conferences 
the grassroots act up known for its noisy demonstrations has a 
hightech plan to coordinate the week of protests computers 
cellular phones beepers and fax machines fill a sophisticated 
media center and the group plans to spend at least 40000 during 
the week according to new york act up member cindy acosta 
funds have been raised by a variety of means from tshirt sales 
to auctions a new york art auction raised 250000 she said 
act up is among more than 100 international groups officially 
boycotting the conference because of the immigration laws however 
40 members of the new york act up chapter will be attending anyway 
act up member peter staley a former wall street bond trader is 
one of the conference speakers 
i think its really important for the scientific community to 
realize that we are not against them acosta said were here 
protesting the fact that the conference is being held in this 
country 
on wednesday act up members plan to protest the exclusion of 
people with aids from research and treatment plans and the limited 
seating available at the conference for those with the disease 
fewer than 400 seats have been reserved for patients costa 
said compared with over 2000 seats for the media protesters are 
expected to try to enter the conference 
outside the moscone center protesters will hold a mock trial 
focusing on what they see as the exclusion of patients from the 
research process 
on thursday activists plan to protest the socalled san 
francisco model of care for aids patients which is heavily 
dependent on volunteers protesters will march from city hall to 
the nearby federal and state buildings then symbolically crumple 
in exhaustion to symbolize the fatigued san francisco aids network 
although the network has been recognized as one of the finest 
examples of aids care in the world increased caseloads and funding 
conflicts have caused the organization to deteriorate 
on friday activists will protest the exclusion of women 
children and minorities from research treatment and services 
on saturday the protests will focus on all people affected by 
hiv and aids 
we expect it to be one of the largest aids marches ever act 
up member josh gameson said more than 10000 people including 
many conference participants are expected to march he said 
on sunday the final day of the conference demonstrators will 
protest a speech by us health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan the annual lesbian and gay freedom day parade which 
draws thousands of marchers and spectators is also scheduled that 
day

a flower grower pleaded innocent tuesday to 
charges of enslaving more than 100 illegal aliens at a ranch where 
the laborers suffered beatings and were cheated the us 
attorneys office said 
innocent pleas also were entered in us district court for six 
other defendants and the corporation that owns the ranch near 
somis about 50 miles northwest of los angeles 
a federal grand jury indicted rancher edwin m ives 54 and the 
six others on 15 counts including violating labor and civil rights 
laws and a federal antislavery statute assistant us attorney 
gregory jessner said 
if convicted on all counts each defendant could face 52 years 
in prison and up to 2 million in fines 
prosecutors allege smugglers lured mexican workers promising 
good pay at the ranch ives then kept the illegal aliens corralled 
behind a 7foot fence to harvest flowers until they could each pay 
435 in smuggling fees prosecutors contend 
the workers toiled 16 hours a day for a fraction of the 
425perhour minimum wage and had to buy necessities from a 
company store at inflated prices prosecutors said 
the indictment alleges the flower farm operators beat the aliens 
and threatened to alert immigration authorities if the workers 
tried to leave 
one worker apparently suffered permanent head and back injuries 
during a beating ives refused to pay for treatment in the united 
states and instead gave the worker 100 toward payment for 
treatment in mexico the indictment says 
defense attorney robert m talcott said the case has been blown 
completely out of proportion 
anyone who has had the opportunity to visit the ranch can see 
with their own senses it is absolutely impossible to confine 
someone against their will on those premises he said 
the ranch is 50 acres it is accessible to a main highway 
within walking distance to a small town we know that people 
desirous of working in the united states from latin america walk 
hundreds of miles swim streams crawl under fences and over fences 
to get here talcott said to say that they could not walk away 
from this facility is ludicrous 
named in the indictment in addition to ives were griffithives 
company foremen pedro pinzonjuarez 30 rony havive 30 alvaro 
ruizsantiago 39 josue david pinzonjuarez 23 paringer singh 
age unknown and an alleged alien smuggler mauro casarespadilla 
64 
authorities arrested the defendants on april 27 they were 
released on 150000 bond apiece at earlier court appearances the 
bond for ruizsantiago was reduced to 50000 and for david

the air force and northrop corp lifted 
the b2 stealth bomber secrecy curtain another notch tuesday 
allowing reporters a peek at the sprawling factory where the 
radardodging planes are built 
the 800000squarefoot plant where northrop performs final 
assembly from parts provided by itself boeing ltv and other 
subcontractors was far quieter than a normal aerospace plant 
part of the technology that hides the b2 from radar is the 
planes smooth surface which is achieved by using a minimum of 
rivets nuts and bolts that in turn makes for an eerily quiet 
manufacturing process 
the second through fifth of the flying wings their graphite 
skins covering a honeycomb composite structure could be seen on 
their assembly lines in the plant in the desert city north of los 
angeles 
flanking them were terminals to a computer system whose 
sophistication northrop says far exceeds any ever used to build a 
plane company officials predicted it will find wide use in 
civilian manufacturing 
the first b2 is performing beyond expectations in initial 
flight testing completing stability control inflight refueling 
landings and other tests with few problems said bruce hinds 
northrops chief test pilot 
the airplane is maturing and were able to operate efficiently 
much earlier than we thought he said 
the plane which hinds said can turn sharply more like a 
fighter than a bomber has been taken up to 35000 feet and flown 
at 373 mph it has won praise from all the pilots who have flown 
it hinds said 
the tour came amid continuing efforts in congress to kill the 
b2 which critics contend is far too expensive especially as the 
cold war is ending 
if the program were stopped with the construction of 15 planes 
as some favor construction costs would be 354 billion 
air force maj gen richard m scofield the b2 program 
director said 15 planes would not be enough to provide a 
significant military deterrent 
defense secretary dick cheney has suggested building 75 b2s 
which would bring the total cost of the bombers to 624 billion 
ron fraser an analyst for the dovish center for defense 
information in washington said the real cost of building 75 planes 
would be more than 110 billion including 48 billion to operate 
and support the bombers 
so cutting it off now the savings are huge fraser said 
its a bomber we dont need at any price and the price is pretty 
darn stiff 
northrop chief executive kent kresa and scofield said such 
concerns were shortsighted and that the united states should not 
give up on a plane that will be useful decades into the 21st 
century they also argued that the manned bomber provides a needed 
complement to a us defense system that includes nuclear armed 
submarines and landbased nuclear missiles 
kresa and scofield disputed reports that stealth technology 
could be counteracted by some radar systems 
one of those systems reportedly in australia was among 40 
supposed stealthbusting techniques that the bomber was tested 
against scofield said 
he said the test showed the system had as much chance of 
locating a stealth bomber as an individual equipped with a 
flashlight would have of finding one person among a crowd of 
thousands in the rose bowl at night 
marion mchugh vice president of operations for northrops b2 
division said 11 of the bombers are now 50 percent or more 
complete 
the 10th and 11th will take about 12 million worker hours to 
construct thats compared to 35 million for the first bomber 
which mchugh acknowledged took substantially longer to build than 
anticipated but he said officials are happy with the progress 
being made

the speaker of the arizona house stripped two 
committee chairmen of their posts and threatened to resign tuesday 
as she struggled for control of her rebellious republican caucus 
speaker jane hull stripped reps don aldridge and jim skelly of 
their chairmanships of the public institutions and rural 
development and house judiciary committees respectively for 
voting against her 
mrs hull has clashed with conservative republicans over a 
proposal to freeze the states property tax rate and to pass along 
an income tax windfall to taxpayers 
the proposal was offered by fellow republican margaret updike 
who said she wanted to ensure the legislature didnt use the 170 
million windfall or a property tax hike to balance a deficit budget 
majority whip chris herstam tried to kill the proposal on a 
procedural motion ten republicans joined democrats in voting 
against him 
but after mrs hull threatened to replace any chairman who voted 
against herstam all republicans except aldridge and skelly fell 
into line giving herstam a 3225 margin 
rep brenda burns sent mrs hull a note during the debate 
saying the conservatives would back down if she promised to allow a 
vote on ms updikes proposal later 
but mrs hull refused to promise and tore up the note on the 
floor she challenged the conservatives to try to remove her as 
speaker and said she might resign 
later after a threehour closed caucus mrs hull said she had 
come pretty darned close to resigning but decided against it 
because we were able to sit and rationally discuss the budget 
house and senate leaders have been trying for two weeks to drum 
up votes for a bipartisan budget and tax package but conservative 
republicans and a few democrats in each chamber have balked 
there has been talk of passing the 35 billion budget which 
includes a deficit of about 400 million without a tax package to 
fund it 
without specific legislation to the contrary the windfall 
which has been passed on to taxpayers in past years would revert 
to the state and the propertytax rate would be increased from its 
current 47 centsper100 assessed valuation to whatever level 
would cover the deficit 
skelly a 20year veteran of the legislature is not seeking 
reelection and said losing his committee chairmanship was not 
significant because the session is almost over and no more 
committee meetings were scheduled 
aldridge said he was unwilling to give in to save his 
chairmanship 
house ways and means committee chairman mark killian a leader 
of the conservative faction said the conservatives still opposed 
the budget but recognized they could not block its passage 
some of us went and talked to the speaker and kind of put up 
the white flag he said theres another day and another war 
maybe we can do better next year

the united states has agreed to return to japan 
2500 acres of land used by the us military on the southern 
japanese island of okinawa officials said tuesday 
the timetable for the return of the land is subject to 
negotiations and further discussions by the two governments the 
japanese foreign ministry announced 
an interim report from the usjapan joint committee on 
realignment and consolidation of us forces facilities on okinawa 
said the land is in 23 sites 
the land being returned makes up 25 percent of the 62000 acres 
used by us military bases on okinawa a us territory from 1945 
until its reversion to japan in 1972 
american bases take up 20 percent of okinawa prefectures or 
states main island and until the mid1970s was okinawas main 
source of income 
of 50000 us troops in japan about 35000 mostly marines and 
air force personnel are stationed on okinawa which has a 
population of 12 million 
the ministry listed part of a practice area at the northern end 
of the island part of camp hansen in central okinawa and part of 
the kadena ammunition storage area and yaedake communications 
facility in northeastern okinawa among the sites to be returned 
i see the agreement as a success to some extent but it is not 
enough for people of the prefecture okinawa governor junji 
nishime said i strongly request the early return of the sites 
excluded from the list this time and further effort by both the 
japanese and the us governments 
japan and the united states have been conducting studies on the 
possible realignment and consolidation of the us bases since a 
request to return more land was made by nishime in april 1988

government troops recaptured a 
stateowned aluminum plant tuesday in a mining town after rebels 
blew up an office building and a harbor dock the army said 
army spokesman bradressein sital said initial reports indicated 
there were a few wounded but he had no further details on 
casualties 
government forces have been battling jungle commando rebels for 
three days for control of the suriname aluminum co plant near 
moengo about 50 miles east of the capital paramaribo 
after the plants recapture fighting continued late tuesday in 
the moengo region where the rebels have set up a temporary base 
sital said he added that troops were advancing slowly on other 
rebel positions because of roads boobytrapped with mines 
earlier the army reported that the ethnic bush negro rebels had 
blown up the aluminum plants administrative building and its 
harbor facilities on the cottica river 
after setting off the explosions the jungle commando rebels 
demanded to speak by radio telephone with president ramsewak 
shankar but the president refused the army said 
communications between moengo and paramaribo have been 
disrupted and there was no immediate word from the jungle commando 
on tuesdays action 
on monday the army said soldiers had surrounded moengo and 
warned its 8000 residents to stay indoors the warning came after 
rebels threatened to blow up the aluminum companys smelter they 
seized two weeks ago 
government forces supported by two aircraft and a helicopter 
launched an offensive against the jungle commando rebels on sunday 
the army would not discuss troop movements but reporters saw 
200 to 300 soldiers with personnel carriers boarding a commercial 
ferry early tuesday to cross the suriname river the army 
reportedly requisitioned the ferry to reinforce the troops already 
in the mining district 
the army has not disclosed how many troops are involved the 
countrys armed forces have a strength of about 3000 
in paris meanwhile french officials said jungle commando 
leader ronnie brunswijk was arrested monday night at the airport in 
neighboring french guiana the officials said he was headed for the 
netherlands surinames former colonial ruler with false identity 
papers 
french guiana television quoted brunswijk as saying he was tired 
of fighting and wanted to give up his campaign 
the government here declined comment on the report 
brunswijks jungle commando thought to number no more than 300 
guerrillas has been waging a hitandrun war against the army the 
past four years the group seeks an improvement in conditions for 
the south american nations bush negro minority 
rebels seized the aluminum plant in an apparent attempt to 
pressure president ramsewak shankar to implement a tentative peace 
plan reached last summer with the jungle commando 
lt col desi bouterse the army chief and surinames former 
military ruler opposes the accord on the grounds it fails to 
disarm the rebels and gives them effective control of the jungle 
interior 
suriname with 415000 residents is on the northeast coast of 
south america

nearly three weeks ago has surfaced but two others remain missing 
a relative of one of the men said tuesday

news conference to issue an open letter to chinese leaders calling 
for the release of political prisoners

the korean war sometimes called the forgotten 
war began june 25 1950 more than 5 million american men and 
women served in korea and more than 54000 died after 40 years 
no peace treaty has been signed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on a sunday morning 40 years ago 
north korea sent thousands of troops across the 38th parallel into 
south korea starting a war that killed more than a million people 
including 54000 american soldiers 
it is the only war the united states has entered in this century 
that remains unresolved the korean peninsula divided after world 
war ii still is split between the communist north and the 
capitalist south 
the invasion stunned and enraged the west the north koreans 
occupied seoul the south korean capital in three days and overran 
most of the southern half of the peninsula in six weeks 
fifteen nations sent soldiers to fight for south korea under the 
usled united nations command twentyfive others provided 
medical aid food and weapons 
china with war just across its border sent hundreds of 
thousands of soldiers to help the north 
when a ceasefire took effect 37 months later the losses were 
staggering an estimated 24 million soldiers and 44 million 
civilians killed or wounded military dead totaled more than 
800000 a land of remarkable beauty lay ravaged treeless burned 
and barren 
the korean war was a traumatic chapter in american history and 
its impact on succeeding generations has been profound 
it was an inglorious war without victory often nearly 
forgotten patched into history between world war ii and vietnam 
no peace treaty has been signed 
it was a war in which we turned the tide against communism for 
the first time in a victory regrettably sometimes ignored by 
history president bush said at a dinner for veterans of the war 
korea was the first confrontation of the big powers in the 
nuclear age it intensified hostilities between east and west and 
spurred a ussoviet arms race that only now is ending 
from it grew the notion that communism in east asia could be 
contained with help from the us military that led to american 
intervention in vietnam a decade later 
forty years after the battle north and south korea watch one 
another from behind barbed wire and concrete bunkers on either side 
of a demilitarized zone 2 miles wide and 155 miles long 
the single telephone line between them is in red cross offices 
there is no mail radio or television communication no direct 
travel without the permission of both governments which is hardly 
ever given 
nearly 9000 american military personnel still are unaccounted 
for or listed as prisoners 
last month in a gesture seen as a political overture to 
washington north korea returned what it said were the remains of 
five american soldiers it was the first such action since 1954 
the american korean war veterans association says it has reports 
from witnesses indicating some americans still may be alive in 
north korea or other communist countries 
sporadic dialogue has occurred between the koreas over the 
years but little progress has been made in lessening tension 
mutual suspicion and distrust they have accused each other of more 
than 1 million violations of the armistice agreement an average of 
75 a day since the war ended 
reunification of the peninsula long a dream of koreans on both 
sides remains elusive 
the united states keeps 43000 soldiers in south korea to deter 
another invasion there are plans to reduce the number but some 
us forces are expected to remain indefinitely 
for washington the conflict of 195053 was a war in which the 
politicians wrenched control from the generals it is remembered as 
much for president harry trumans firing of douglas macarthur as 
for the generals bold strategy of pushing the enemy back with an 
amphibious landing at inchon a western port 
historians divide the korean war into the first year of 
dramatic farreaching maneuvers and the next two years of static 
positional battle 
americans were not prepared mentally or physically for a war 
fought in foxholes and trenches on rugged mountainous terrain that 
was freezing in winter and scorching in summer 
no place was so cold so dirty grease from a hundred c rations 
was frozen to parkas and gloves underwear wasnt changed for 
months perspiration in boots turned to ice in winter blood froze 
on wounds before it could coagulate 
men fought handtohand for small pieces of territory called 
punchbowl hamburger hill heartbreak ridge bunker hill each 
changed hands many times 
more than 5 million men and women served in the american forces 
their casualties were 103284 wounded and 54246 dead including 
33629 killed in combat the infantry bore the brunt of the 
fighting 
what began as a crusade to save south korea from communism 
enjoyed only brief public popularity soldiers returned home not to 
a heros welcome but to a public dissatisfied with an unpopular 
unsatisfactory war 
weary soldiers disheartened and dispirited faded into the 
placid properous american society of the 1950s keeping their pain 
to themselves 
not until vietnam veterans received public attention did the 
korean vets begin to organize they formed an association five 
years ago and are trying to raise 105 million for a memorial 
korea is the only war without a memorial in washington 
in south korea the war is called the 625 incident reflecting 
the date it began and the korean preference for numbering rather 
than naming events 
some south koreans feel shame that the country needed help to 
defend itself and the anniversary is not a cause for celebration 
many people who remember those days remain deeply grateful to 
the americans monuments have been built in rice paddies and town 
squares to all nations that sent soldiers and aid 
the relationship between south korea and the united states has 
changed dramatically in the past 40 years south koreas booming 
economy and growing pride in its own accomplishments make it less 
tolerant of pressure from washington on economic trade and 
political issues 
antiamerican sentiment continues to grow visiting 
koreanamericans say relatives and others scold them for wearing 
americanstyle haircuts and clothes and for speaking korean with 
american accents 
most koreans disapprove of militants who burn us flags and 
shout yankee go home however and polls indicate they want 
american troops to remain

baik sunghak was a 12yearold orphan 
and felt lucky to be taken on by a us artillery unit as a 
washywashy boy 
he was not paid in money but in food candy gum and the 
friendship of a gi he called billy who also had been an orphan 
thousands of children were orphaned or separated from their 
families in the three years of the korean war which began in 1950 
american soldiers often gave the children food candy and coins 
but the gis always moved on 
billy stayed in my heart said baik now a wealthy 
50yearold hat manufacturer 
an enemy shell landed beside baik on a riverbank one day he was 
enveloped in burning gasoline and jumped into the river screaming 
billy jumped in after me got me out rushed me to the 
hospital he said when i woke up after 18 hours billy was 
there billy was kind to all the orphans but especially to me we 
orphans usually ate the leftovers but billy would always save a 
plate of food for me 
baik was sent to an orphanage after the war he ran away worked 
at odd jobs and began what would be a 30year search for billy 
through newspapers veterans organizations and military listings on 
two continents 
eventually he became a successful businessman and established 
billy house a home for orphans and the handicapped northeast of 
seoul 
in 1986 he was invited to a reunion in kansas city of 14 men 
from billys old unit 
at the reunion i went through files and files of pictures 
he said i remember screaming thats billy and the others 
just stared at me 
thats not billy thats david beattie someone said no one 
knew where beattie lived billy was what beattie had 
sounded like to a 12yearold korean orphan 
in september 1989 a friend telephoned baik and told him beattie 
had been located in philadelphia that was where they met later 
that month for the first time in nearly 40 years 
the minute i saw him i knew he was billy he said 
a few weeks ago beattie 59 returned to korea for the first 
time since the war as baiks guest 
hak was a strong boy and he was always willing to help me 
he said referring to baik by one of his given names i never 
thought of looking for him after the war was over i went back 
home and that was it 
i recognized hak as soon as i saw him i didnt know what to 
say when we first met we just stared at each other for a few 
minutes 
baik says he wants their children to meet he has two and 
beattie has four

hewlettpackard co unveiled a line of 
products that for the first time blends its workstation technology 
with that of apollo computer which hewlettpackard bought for 500 
million last year 
the success of the new series 400 computer workstations will 
help determine whether hewlettpackads biggest acquisition will 
give the palo altobased company a competitive edge in the 58 
billion worldwide workstation market 
so far competitors say the acquisition of apollo which is 
based in chelmsford mass has caused hewlettpackard to lose 
market share 
hp has gone awol since the apollo acquisition said scott 
mcnealey president and ceo of sun microsystems inc of mountain 
view calif hewlettpackards leading rival in the workstation 
market 
hewlettpackard on monday introduced a set of workstations based 
on motorola incs 68030 microprocessor the company also planned 
more advanced workstations but delays in production of a computer 
chip will keep it from shipping those systems until later in 1990 
the workstations will cost 500014000 and they will offer 
performance levels that match suns marketleading sparcstation 
according to bill kay general manager of hewlett packards 
workstation group 
the introduction comes as hewlett packard restructures in an 
effort to reverse a fourquarter trend of falling profits despite 
rising revenues 
the companys earnings fell 8 percent to 186 million or 78 
cents a share in its second quarter ending april 30 while sales 
rose 16 percent to 33 billion 
the industry of the 1990s requires a strong position in 
workstations systems that are more powerful than personal 
computers but less powerful than minicomputers 
minicomputers fast becoming an industry dinosaur are the core 
of hewlettpackards business and yield the highest profits of its 
product lines 
although the apollo acquisition briefly vaulted hewlettpackard 
to no 1 in workstations sun quickly regained the lead with 
faster cheaper and more advanced products others also are 
fighting for a piece of the market 
since the apollo acquisition hewlettpackards share of the 
workstation market slipped to 26 percent last year from 30 percent 
in 1988 sun controlled 30 percent of the market at the end of last 
year 
everybody says that because of the merger we lost the lead 
said lew platt executive vice president for hewlettpackards 
computer products but that lead has been handed off a number of 
times in the last few years nobodys had it consistently 
hewlettpackards new workstations arent expected to close the 
gap according to analysts and competitors 
the companys competitors have been selling workstations based 
on a more advanced technology called reduced instruction set 
computing or risc in the same price range for more than a year 
risc speeds up computers by cutting the number of instructions they 
have to complete to perform a task hewlettpackard is the only 
major workstation vendor that hasnt come out with a lowcost 
riscbased workstation 
kay countered that the companys new workstations will match the 
performance of riscbased machines he also said the company will 
have its own competitive risc workstations on the market at the end 
of this year

the head of first executive corp told 
congress that former junk bond chief michael milken did not dictate 
investment strategy to the california insurance concern a big junk 
bond buyer 
fred carr also told a house subcommittee monday that while a 
milkencontrolled company had a major stake in a first executive 
subsidiary neither carr nor first executive invested in any 
partnerships run by the former drexel burnham lambert inc banker 
this is a chance for me to clear the record carr told the 
investigations subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee in a statement 
the panel has been investigating some 400 limited partnerships 
controlled largely by drexel employees that bought significant 
stakes in hot junk bond issues underwritten by drexel before they 
were made available to the public 
critics have said the activity drove up the price of those 
issues at the expense of drexel customers but the transactions 
legality has never been resolved 
under questioning by the subcommittee chairman rep john 
dingell dmich carr denied milken had authority to trade on 
behalf of any first executive accounts 
dingell said the subcommittee had information that milken used 
to dictate trades on friday afternoons to an assistant who would 
pass them on to first executive 
but carr said i have no knowledege of what he dictated to 
anybody 
the subscommittee also plans to call milken and disgraced stock 
speculator ivan f boesky as witnesses 
the subcommittee authorized a subpoena for boesky last year and 
the panel voted unanimously last month to subpoena milken who 
pleaded guilty in april to six felonies and agreed to pay 600 
million in penalties 
but the justice department is concerned about milkens 
testifying under immunity before he is sentenced oct 1 
dingell the subcommittee chairman has said he wants to hear 
from milken before congress adjourns aug 3 for a monthlong summer 
break 
william mclucas head of enforcement for the securities and 
exchange commission and alan cohen chief of the securities fraud 
unit of the us attorneys office in manhattan declined to 
discuss the issue 
but sources close to the case have said the justice department 
is concerned that if milken testifies under immunity before 
congress and then withdraws his guilty plea it could make it 
difficult to prosecute him 
carr testified without immunity monday 
dingell said the purpose of the hearing was to determine 
whether the regulatory system is properly addressing the increasing 
use of junk bonds as security for insurance policies that people 
depend upon to be safe and sound 
junk bonds are highyielding corporate bonds with low investment 
ratings meaning they carry a high risk of not being paid junk 
bonds were used to finance many mergers takeovers and leveraged 
buyouts in the 1980s 
dingell noted that insurance companies account for about 30 
percent of the junk bond market and junk bonds constitute between 
45 percent and 60 percent of first executives holdings 
first executive suffered a 836 million net loss in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 because of a writedown in the value of its junk 
bond portfolio the company rebounded to post a profit of 455 
million in this years first quarter 
a proper regulatory system should assure that insurance 
companies do not face insolvency because they overdose on junk 
bonds said dingell the collapse of drexel burnham lambert and 
defaults by some issuers have forced first executive to writedown 
its portfolio by more than 1 billion during the past several 
months dingell added 
but carr insisted in his opening statement that executive life 
is an example of a life insurance company that has managed to 
remain sound and solvent despite the recent massive turmoil in the 
socalled junk market despite extreme adverse publicity

the move toward offhours trading to compete 
with foreign exchanges got another boost as three exchanges agreed 
to cooperate on a computerized system to trade stock and stock 
options through the night 
the american stock exchange the chicago board options exchange 
and the cincinnati stock exchange on monday announced plans to 
implement an automated nighttime system in two to three years 
the new york stock exchange announced a different afterhours 
plan last week london and tokyo have been getting more of the 
business in uslisted issues while markets in this country are 
closed 
this agreement is a milestone in the internationalization of 
securities markets and we welcome other securities exchanges to 
join us in this endeavor said duke chapman chairman and chief 
executive of the cboe 
officials of the exchanges speaking at simultaneous news 
conferences in new york and chicago linked by television said they 
had asked the nyse and tokyo exchanges to join them but the big 
board indicated it didnt want to give up its leading role in us 
stocks 
the new york stock exchange today has the largest most cost 
efficient computer system in the world and we would like to invite 
the cboe and amex into our system which was announced last 
week said nyse spokesman richard torrenzano 
the amex cboe and cincinnati exchange plan to operate their 
electronic trading system between 6 pm and 6 am eastern time 
stocks now trade from 930 am to 4 pm and options from 930 
am until 410 pm or 415 pm 
the cboe would build and maintain the electronic exchanges main 
computer while reuters holdings plc would provide the network to 
link dealers with the computer 
reuters currently provides electronic dealing networks for 
foreiggn exchange and bond dealers and also is a leading supplier 
of financial market news 
the cboe and amex would provide a market in their stock options 
while the cincinnati exchange would offer stocks listed on that 
regional exchange 
the new york stock exchange last week revealed plans to begin 
limited afterhours trading this year with an eye to 24hour 
trading by the end of the decade the plan calls for thricenightly 
auctions of big boardlisted stocks at 8 pm midnight and 5 am 
beginning next year 
the deal announced monday represents a major cooperative effort 
at a time when competition is heating up among exchanges that 
handle stock options a new federal rule allows for multiple 
listings of stock options which now are assigned to particular 
exchanges 
under the computerized nighttime system the marketplace that 
establishes itself as the primary exchange for a particular issue 
will handle the stock option in the afterhours session 
the american stock exchange and the chicago board options 
exchange will still compete jones said but he conceded in 
the newly carvedout trading hours we will put aside some of 
todays competitive battles 
the precise number of issues that will be traded have yet to be 
determined the cincinnati exchange trades about 500 issues while 
the american exchange and cboe account for about 80 percent of the 
nations options trading 
the exchange executives said it was possible that other 
products such as stock index options could be traded through the 
system 
the cboe and amex would have to agree to make their products 
available said richard dufour the executive vice president for 
product development at the cboe well choose products that are 
most attractive to overseas customers 
options are financial instruments that give holders that right 
to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a designated price for a 
certain amount of time the three exchanges and reuters announced 
their intention to work on a common system in march 1989 they said 
they reached a definitive agreement about a month ago and the 
boards of the companies finished approving the plan late last week

ltv corp says it cannot afford to resume 
responsibility for 23 billion in pension liabilities despite a 
us supreme court decision upholding a government agencys effort 
to force the company to fund the plans 
ltv senior vice president julian scheer said the decision monday 
in favor of the pension benefit guaranty corp will delay the 
companys efforts to emerge from bankruptcy court protection 
ltv filed for chapter 11 protection four years ago because 
among other things we could not afford to make payments into these 
three pension plans the company said in a statement that 
situation has not changed we still cannot afford the plans it 
will be the companys objective to continue to seek a resolution 
which recognizes the fact 
ltv which has sold off much of its steel operations plans to 
reorganize as a streamlined company 
chriss street a bankruptcy expert at seidler amdec securities 
inc in chicago who has dealt with many of ltvs creditors said 
the company probably has enough cash to pay the claims but in 
paying the pension claim they would have to turn the keys to the 
company over to the pbgc and all the other creditors would 
essentially be left holding the bag 
the supreme court ruling assures that ltv will be mired in 
further litigation street said 
gary heinz an analyst at delaware bay co in new york said he 
would expect creditors to push the bankruptcy judge to end the 
companys exclusive right to come up with a reorganization plan 
by an 81 vote the supreme court said the pbgc acted within its 
authority when it ordered ltv and its subsidiary ltv steel co to 
restore the pension plans with unfunded liabilities of 23 billion 
labor secretary elizabeth dole who chairs the pbgcs board of 
directors said the ruling would help the agency protect the 
pensions of 40 million american workers and retirees 
while pensions as a whole are healthier than ever some 
companies in certain industries have seriously underfunded 
pensions mrs dole said pbgcs victory in this case will help 
discourage unwarranted termination of pension plans and encourage 
better funding of pensions 
after filing for bankruptcy reorganization in 1986 dallasbased 
ltv and its clevelandbased ltv steel subsidiary advised the pbgc 
that they could not fund their pension plans the plans were ended 
in 1987 
but in a later deal with the united steelworkers union ltv 
steel agreed to make up any benefits promised under the old plan 
but not covered by the federal pension insurance program 
the pbgc a government agency that takes over pension plans that 
end with insufficient money to fund benefits objected and ordered 
ltv to reassume responsibility for the pension plans mondays 
court ruling backed the agency 
were not happy with the decision but its certainly is not 
considered a backbreaker ltvs scheer said the question is 
how do we handle this tremendous obligation we dont have an 
answer 
retermination certainly is something well have to look at 
he said we hope and we believe that there is room for 
negotiations with the pbgc taking into consideration the fact that 
they understand our economic realities 
michael s gordon a washington pensions lawyer said the 
rulings impact may be limited 
while companies might be tempted to rid themselves of pension 
liabilities through the bankruptcy code i think thats a pretty 
harried course for most major corporations i dont know that its 
impact is as cosmic as some would have you believe gordon said 
nonetheless it was a loophole that could be exploited its 
closed now and its a good thing he said 
ltv has returned to profitability after posting billions in 
losses much of it tied to its bankruptcy costs and accounting for 
pension funds in 1988 alone the company lost 315 billion on 
sales of 73 billion 
last year ltv earned 2649 million on sales of 636 billion 
earnings in the first three months of 1990 slipped to 442 million 
from 766 million a year earlier sales dropped to 149 billion 
from 161 billion

pollution damage claims against ashland 
oil co soared to 2725 billion as hundreds of people joined a 
lawsuit against the company over alleged refinery discharges 
ashland however asked a judge monday to overturn a 103 jury 
award that forms a basis for the other claims the company said the 
trial was riddled with errors and added that the judge and jury 
foreman did not disclose past relationships with the plaintiffs 
attorneys 
in the collective experience of ashlands counsel they have 
never encountered a trial afflicted by errors as numerous or as 
grievous as those committed in the trial of this matter the 
companys motion said 
rod jackson the plaintiffs lead attorney dismissed ashlands 
motion as desperation 
kanawha county circuit court judge tod kaufman who presided 
over the trial is to hear the appeal june 29 he is out of the 
country on vacation and was unavailable for comment monday his 
office said 
late last month a jury awarded 103 million to four residents 
living near ashlands refinery in catlettsburg ky 
the residents alleged that a caustic white substance emitted 
from the refinery had damaged their property and affected their 
health the exact nature of the substance was not established at 
the trial and ashland argued that residents presented no evidence 
of illness or property damage 
on monday 681 more current and past area residents filed suit 
in kanawha circuit court against ashland bringing the total number 
of suits pending to more than 1100 jackson said he is 
representing 912 residents in one suit he said 
the new claims raise the total compensation sought to 2725 
billion from 840 million previously jackson said most of the 
plaintiffs live in western west virginia across the ohio river 
from the refinery 
ashland reported profits of 85 million last year on sales of 
85 billion 
ashland spokesman roger schrum said the allegations in the 
latest suits are without merit 
the company has requested affidavits from each person filing a 
suit because mr jackson has gotten carried away with his numbers 
in the past schrum said 
in their motion to overturn the may verdict ashlands lawyers 
said charleston lawyer rudy ditrapano a partner of jacksons in 
the law firm that represented the plaintiffs once represented 
kaufmans family 
the judges parents and brother were killed in a 1980 car 
accident ditrapano filed two lawsuits on behalf of their estates 
later settling them for 40000 
ditrapano and jackson each made contributions to kaufmans 
general and primary election campaigns in 1988 according to the 
companys motion 
jackson partner in the firm ditrapano amp jackson said a law 
firm is under no obligation to reveal past legal relationships with 
a judge 
this is just another red herring across the judicial path it 
has nothing to do with the case jackson said 
ashland oil also said jury foreman lou henri hunt in 1987 was 
represented in two different cases by jackson and by a law firm run 
by the father of plaintiffs attorney dl hamilton 
hunt should have disclosed her relationship with the lawyers and 
should have been dismissed from jury duty the company said but 
jackson said hunts relationship with the hamilton firm came up 
during jury selection 
hunt declined comment monday 
the trial is over im just tired of this she said

pageantry at the 4032room property 
isnt this the most sensational thing youve ever seen 
actor ernest borgnine enthused as he watched a knight on a white 
horse prance across a lobby area of the excalibur hotel and casino 
in a preopening vip party monday night just look at this what 
can you possibly say 
hundreds of the las vegas business political and social elite 
milled about the 290 million property minstrels jugglers and 
harpists entertained guests a 10foot dragon cavorted and a man in 
a suit of armor walked stiffly amid the guests 
the entertainers will be standard fare in what promises to be 
one of the countrys more unique properties 
tuesdays formal opening will mark a milestone for circus circus 
enterprises inc the gaminghotel operation that has carved a 
niche in las vegas and nevada for middle america 
chairman william bennett said he was pleased with monday nights 
turnout and with his latest property 
everything seems to be going just fine he said 
glenn schaeffer chief financial officer for the company said 
the excalibur was getting 4000 reservation calls a day people 
think we have a hit he said 
the 16 billion circus circus company which started with a 
struggling strip hotelcasino 16 years ago has become the envy of 
the gaming industry with a unique strategy focusing on smalltime 
players rather than coveted highrollers 
bennett announced to stockholders last week that the company 
planned to reduce its 500 million debt by about 200 million in 
the coming year largely on added revenue from the excalibur 
schaeffer said monday the company could probably pay off all its 
debt in three or four years from excalibur revenue but may opt to 
look at new projects

for the mcmahon family in aliquippa pa a 
supreme court ruling on retired steelworkers pensions means an 
extra 120 a month 
for the federal agency that insures the pensions of 30 million 
american workers the ruling means a savings of up to 8 billion in 
potential pension liabilities 
the court on monday broadened the authority of the pension 
benefit guaranty corp to order employers to restore terminated 
pension plans in a case involving ltv corp and its subsidiary ltv 
steel co 
we feel like justice was done we werent asking for miracles 
we only want what were owed and to keep other retirees from having 
this happen to them said carole mcmahon who said her husbands 
950 monthly pension was shortchanged 120 a month after ltv filed 
for bankruptcy protection in 1986 and its pension plans were 
terminated 
federal officials called the ruling a victory that benefits all 
americans because it helps keep solvent the nations system of 
insuring pensions 
not only will the ruling keep the pbgc from having to pay ltvs 
unfunded liabilities of 23 billion it also might save another 8 
billion because companies will be discouraged from following ltvs 
lead said james b lockhart exeutive director of the agency 
it removes a major cloud that has been overhanging the agency 
for 2 years lockhart said he added the agency knew of a 
handful of companies that were considering terminating their 
pension plans through bankruptcy proceedings 
however michael s gordon a washington pension lawyer said 
the ltv case was a relatively isolated example 
while companies might be tempted to rid themselves of pension 
liabilities through the bankruptcy code i think thats a pretty 
harried course for most major corporations i dont know that its 
impact is as cosmic as some would have you believe gordon said 
nonetheless it was a loophole that could be exploited its 
closed now and its a good thing gordon said 
the pbgc takes over a pension plans assets and liabilities when 
a company ends the plan with insufficient money to satisfy promised 
benefits the agency then pays the pensions but sets limits on 
some types of benefits 
ultimately taxpayers shoulder the burden of pbgc liabilities 
mrs mcmahon who is part of a union retirees activist group 
said the ruling would protect other retirees across the country 
if this had not happened all of these other companies would 
have seen ltv escaping and taking these losses from their 
retirees she said 
though retirees are pleased to have their pensions fully funded 
they are worried ltv might make up the difference with decreased 
health care benefits mrs mcmahon said 
people are scared right now because we dont know whats going 
to happen she said 
alice lynd a youngstown ohio lawyer representing ltv 
retirees said the average ltv pensioner received 40 a month less 
after ltv terminated its pension plan 
the pbgc has money problems of its own a 1 billion deficit 
it currently lists assets of about 32 billion and liabilities of 
about 42 billion 
the dallasbased ltv and its clevelandbased ltv steel 
subsidiary after filing for reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy law in 1986 advised the pbgc that they could not fund 
the pension plans they sponsored the plans were ended in 1987 
in a deal with the united steelworkers union however ltv steel 
agreed to what government lawyers called a followon 
arrangement under it ltv agreed to make up any benefits lost to 
retirees that are not covered by the federal pension insurance 
program 
the pbgc contended such arrangements are abusive and the agency 
ordered ltv to reassume responsibility for the pension plans when 
ltv refused the agency sought to enforce its order in federal 
court

history the company based in dearborn said monday 
paul knopick a cms spokesman said 65 percent of the plant 
built as a nuclear facility but later converted to a gasfired

the original partnership included cms and dow chemical co 
michigans largest utility consumers power co a cms subsidiary 
the partnership halted construction of the plant in 1984 after 
spending 42 billion it was 85 percent complete when the facility 
became mired in financing and regulatory wrangles 
the midland cogeneration venture partnership spent 600 million

nations largest the plant now makes steam for industrial use and 
also produces electricity it began producing power for dow in 
march 
about 380 million of the 23 billion deal was in cash knopick 
said 
the partners also agreed to form a second partnership to 
investigate expanding the midland plant he said 
we know the midwest canada and michigan are going to need 
more electricity in the 1990s and we see the midland cogeneration 
venture as being a key provider of that power he said

megawatts of electricity and 135 million pounds per hour of steam 
could be doubled

the newspaper industry is witnessing new 
technologies that will turn problems into opportunities but those 
new systems are only as good as the people who run them according 
to industry executives 
without the right welltrained people all the technology in 
the world wont do us much good lloyd g schermer told delegates 
to the 62nd annual technical exposition of the american newspaper 
publishers association on monday thats why in this decade as 
never before we must develop our people 
schermer chief executive officer of lee enterprises inc 
davenport iowa said newspapers will need technology training and 
teamwork to meet the competitive challenges of the 1990s 
schermer also warned that proposed new postal rates pose a 
threat for publishers first second and third class mailers face 
double digit postal rate increases while the rate would drop 10 
percent for third class mailers who can demonstrate 75 percent or 
more saturation coverage he said 
only one or two third class mailers that specialize in direct 
mail advertising would be able to take advantage of the lower rate 
schermer said 
the monopoly postal service clearly sees its future as a 
distributor of advertising hard copy rather than first class 
letters schermer said 
madelyn p jennings senior vice president of personnel for 
gannett co inc said people are a critical commodity for 
newspapers wishing to realize the most from new technologies 
if we leave out the people quotient we cant possibly get the 
return on the investment promised she said we are pioneers in 
a new territory our success depends on a skilled and motivated 
workforce 
you wouldnt put up with a press operating at 75 percent of 
capacity she said you shouldnt put up with employees working 
at 75 percent of capacity people and presses dont work very well 
unless theyre cared for 
in the decade ahead the quality of people will make the 
difference in americas newspapers 
developing our people isnt a cost its a blue chip 
investment she said

a federal judge today ordered motorola inc to 
pull a key computer chip off the market dealing a setback to the 
company in a legal battle over trade secrets with former partner 
hitachi ltd 
the order also will prevent hitachi from selling its own 
microprocessor in the united states 
motorola said it would immediately appeal the decision by us 
district judge lucius bunton of midland buntons order was 
released in austin where the motorolas mc68030 microprocessor is 
made 
a microprocessor is a computer chip that handles the processing 
functions in a computer 
in a statement from its schaumburg ill headquarters motorola 
said it expected a patent appeals court to stay buntons order the 
company said it is confident it would continue to provide an 
uninterrupted supply of its marketleading microprocessor to 
customers 
bunton banned the sale of the chips on march 29 and fined both 
companies saying they violated each others patents 
but he stayed the order a day later after motorola argued that 
the chip ban could devastate outside computer makers that depend on 
motorola microprocessors to run their machines 
todays order lifts the stay the judge said the companies had 
been given enough time to settle on their own 
the parties have chosen not to forge a settlement in the 
interim and this court is not inclined to continue its 
indulgence bunton said 
motorola contends that buntons order gives hitachi unequal 
bargaining power in any settlement negotiations because as bunton 
said in his order motorolas processor is more commercially 
viable than hitachis 
hitachi said it needed the injunction because motorola could 
continue to design around the mc68030 which would eliminate any 
incentive for motorola to settle the patent infringement dispute 
tim kellogg spokesman for motorola said the company would file 
its appeal with the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the court is a special appeals court for patents and customs in 
washington 
we are confident that the cafc will promptly stay the lower 
courts decision pending appeal motorola said in a statement 
we are dismayed that judge bunton made this decision knowing 
full well that the two parties have been engaged in earnest 
attempts to settle this matter the company said 
the companies received word of the order monday but it was not 
released until today

japans economy grew 5 percent in the past fiscal 
year boosted by brisk fourth quarter activity the economic 
planning agency announced tuesday 
it was the third straight year in which japans gross national 
product the countrys total output of goods and services expanded 
5 percent or more the government had forecast a 46 percent rate 
for the year 
in the fourth quarter which ended march 31 the agency said the 
gnp grew an inflationadjusted 25 percent for the first time in 
five years exports contributed slightly more to economic growth 
during the quarter than did domestic demand 
but increased domestic demand rather than exports accounted 
for most of the years economic expansion domestic demand 
contributed 57 percent to total growth compared to a negative 07 
percent for exports 
an agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the results showed that japans economic expansion now in its 43rd 
month continues to be led by domestic demand as japans economy 
shifts away from its past dependency on exports 
the official said the healthy growth rate in the januarymarch 
quarter showed that the sharp instability in japans stock and 
currency markets during the period had little impact on the economy 
from january through march japanese stock and bond prices 
plunged sharply and the yen weakened to 15765 yen to a dollar from 
14340 yen 
however personal consumption and private capital expenditures 
the main pillars of japans current economic expansion continued 
to grow although at a less rapid rate than during the previous two 
quarters 
gnp growth fluctuated sharply in fiscal 1989 and averaged 
slightly lower than the 53 percent registered in fiscal 1988 and 
the 54 percent in fiscal 1987 
analysts disagreed about the significance of the 85 percent 
surge in exports during the fourth quarter which overwhelmed a 21 
percent rise in imports 
the government official said temporary factors such as a sharp 
jump in auto exports to the united states in march to fill the 
unused portion of japans quota under its voluntary export 
restraint agreement were mainly responsible for the increase in the 
contribution of exports to growth 
toshiaki kakimoto chief economist with sumitomo bank said 
statistics from april should show a return to strong domestic 
demand the external sector should become negative again he 
said 
but kenneth courtis strategist and chief economist with 
deutsche bank in tokyo said temporary factors cannot explain all 
of the external sectors rebound from a negative 10 percent 
contribution in the octoberdecember quarter to a positive 13 
percent in the last quarter 
courtis said the yens weakness together with strong economic 
growth in asia and europe are more fundamental reasons behind the 
surge in exports 
now that japans markets have calmed down the japanese consumer 
is back on the street spending at a strong clip courtis said 
japans economic expansion has been running on two motors 
capital spending and consumer spending now exports are starting to 
kick into gear he said

charles h keating jr used his lincoln 
savings and loan association as a tool to funnel federally insured 
deposits into his speculative real estate ventures government 
attorneys argued today 
it was not a true savings and loan association attorney 
james murphy representing the office of thrift supervision said 
in final arguments to us district judge stanley sporkin 
the office of thrift supervision wants the judge to dismiss 
keatings suit which seeks to revoke the april 1989 seizure of his 
irvine califbased sampl 
in its essence it was a real estate investment and 
development company and it was being operated in a very high risk 
strategy and what was being used were federally insured deposits 
murphy said 
in advance of the closing arguments keating said he was 
extraordinarily optimistic based on the evidence regulators 
presented 
the government took their best shots and there werent any 
shots there was no powder in their barrel no bullets in their 
gun he said 
murphy said the april 1989 seizure of the thrift was neither 
arbitrary nor capricious as lincoln claims nor was the government 
out to get keating who has an almost palpable antipathy to 
federal regulations and regulators he said 
in fact the thrift offices predecessor the federal home loan 
bank board went out of its way to ensure its examiners were 
unbiased in 1988 switching jurisdiction over lincoln from its san 
francisco office to washington 
in retrospect i think its fair to say the bank board got 
taken in he said 
closing arguments from keatings lawyers were scheduled for 
later today capping 30 days of hearings spread over six months on 
the eve of the session keating said in a telephone interview he 
believes he has received a fair hearing 
we sure feel weve had our day in court he said i cant 
think of anything that to me would have been more fulfilling 
separately keating is the target of a federal grand jury probe 
in los angeles and a defendant in a 13 billion civil fraud suit 
filed by federal regulators in arizona headquarters of his 
american continental corp holding company 
the proceedings before sporkin former enforcement director of 
the securities and exchange commission have become keatings first 
chance to present the facts of the case as he sees them keating 
himself took the stand for eight days 
the house banking committee heard lengthy testimony on the case 
last fall but keating denounced the hearings as onesided and 
refused to participate 
the sporkin hearings began on dec 7 less than a month after 
the congressional sessions ended and were originally scheduled for 
only two days but each witness offered and each of the nearly 
1000 documents introduced seemed to raise more questions than they 
answered and the court proceedings dragged on 
in ruling on the governments motion for dismissal the judge 
could uphold the seizure find it invalid or order a full trial on 
the matter which could take several years 
although they were held to help decide a preliminary motion the 
proceedings have in effect become a minitrial for keatings 
claims that he was the target of vindictive regulators who ran his 
business into the ground 
the testimony has focused on four transactions that regulators 
said will prove their april 1989 takeover of lincoln was justified 
in essence the government contends that keating arranged for 
lincoln subsidiaries to earn phony profits from fake land and stock 
deals in order to funnel the money to his arizona holding company 
via a taxsharing agreement 
the four transactions examined at the hearings include the 
taxsharing agreement between lincoln and american continental two 
land transactions in arizona and a stock sale 
lincolns failure will cost taxpayers about 2 billion 
regulators estimate making it the nations costliest thrift 
collapse 
the senate ethics committee is examining allegations that five 
legislators sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz donald w riegle dmich john glenn dohio and john 
mccain rariz improperly intervened with federal regulators 
after accepting political contributions from keating

news combined with the royal ascot horse race meeting kept

outright selling and the lower levels inspired some genuine 
institutional interest

general motors corp plans to become the first 
major automaker to produce a fleet of natural gaspowered vehicles 
the houston chronicle reported tuesday 
a consortium of pipeline companies and producers will help pay 
for and purchase the 1000 light trucks the chronicle said 
the halfton trucks will be built at gms plant in troy mich 
and converted to natural gas by pas inc a detroitarea supplier 
the newspaper said 
quoting industry and state sources the newspaper said the 
announcement had been planned for wednesday but would come instead 
at julys economic summit in houston 
gm officials did not immediately return telephone calls this 
morning to the associated press the newspaper said gm would not 
comment 
this is a way to speed up gms research said vicki cho a 
spokeswoman for southern california gas co the nations largest 
gas distribution company we need to be involved in making this 
happen 
the chronicle said the consortium has agreed to provide as much 
as 1 million in funding for the final researching and testing of 
the vehicles 
the consortium also expected to purchase many of the gm trucks 
is composed of about 10 companies in texas california and 
colorado 
besides southern california gas it includes entex and enron 
corp of houston southern union gas co lone star gas co 
pacific gas and electric and san diego gas and electric 
executives representing the companies say the auto giant has 
reached a preliminary agreement to produce about 1000 natural 
gasburning trucks in 1991 
david polletta general manager of pas inc said the vehicles 
will be sold under the gm name and guaranteed by a gm warranty 
program 
industry officials say the gm move is the biggest boost yet for 
a natural gas vehicle movement that has been slow to materialize 
from the industrys standpoint this is something weve been 
trying to do for a long time said susan syler a spokeswoman for 
entex a houston natural gas distribution company we think that 
if we can get one of the big three out with these vehicles the 
others will follow 
officials with the texas general land office have been 
coordinating the project and had scheduled a briefing for wednesday 
to discuss the gm project however spokesman mark glick said 
monday that the announcement will be made in july during the 
economic summit in houston 
officials say an announcement on the project has been delayed 
because gm is considering expanding the venture beyond light 
trucks they say gm is may produce a wide range of natural 
gaspowered vehicles something that gas producers have urged for 
years 
thats where the discussions are going said jack smith 
natural gas vehicle marketing development manager for southern 
california gas this could be part of a much larger effort 
because of its environmental advantages over oilbased fuels 
natural gas has in the past year won the favor of congress and 
several state legislatures which have passed laws requiring use of 
the fuel in some of the nations most polluted cities 
in many states lawmakers have instructed public transit systems 
and utility companies to begin converting to natural gas 
last fall gm ford motor co and chrysler corp announced a 
plan to work with the nations major oil companies in investigating 
the cost of using alternative fuels the automakers along with 14 
us oil companies agreed to spend 113 million on the research 
effort

world trade negotiators on tuesday tentatively 
agreed that countries should list all charges in addition to fixed 
tariffs that importers must pay 
a spokesman for the 96nation general agreement on tariffs and 
trade said the proposed measure would help importers and exporters 
by increasing the clarity of import duties 
implementation of the accord is dependent on a successful 
conclusion to the gattsponsored uruguay round of trade 
negotiations the talks are scheduled to end in december with a 
package of new rules to liberalize trade in 15 sectors including 
an agreement to cut tariffs 
according to the text of tuesdays agreement governments would 
have to list all other duties and charges in their schedules of 
bound tariff items a tariff is bound under gatt rules once a 
government gives a commitment not to increase it 
gatt members would also have to freeze these other duties and 
charges at the rates existing when negotiators reach agreement on 
a uruguay round tariff accord 
examples of such charges include fiscal taxes stamp taxes port 
improvement taxes import surcharges and landing taxes according 
to a gatt statement 
currently governments are under no obligation to publish such 
charges as a result many traders are unaware of their existence 
until they import a product bound tariffs by contrast have to be 
listed 
gatt spokesman david woods said the proposed measure would yield 
worthwhile practical results for traders 
the gatt statement said the text of the decision was based on a 
proposal submitted last year by new zealand

ames department stores inc struggling 
under the weight of bankruptcy proceedings reported firstquarter 
losses of more than 430 million tuesday due mainly to its plans 
to close nearly onethird of its 679 stores 
the nations fourthlargest retailer based in rocky hill said 
it lost 4309 million or 1156 per share in the quarter ending 
april 28 in the first quarter last year ames lost 165 million 
or 52 cents per share 
the loss includes a 225 million charge to cover expected costs 
of closing the stores a 1045 million charge to cover additional 
anticipated markdowns and an 18 million writeoff for deferring 
financing costs 
net sales for the first quarter were 9348 million compared to 
1 billion for the period last year 
the results are not surprising given the companys struggle to 
stay afloat through bankruptcy proceedings a retail analyst said 
clearly this is a gigantic number but it is typical of the 
process said howard davidowitz chairman of howard davidowitz 
and associates a retail consulting firm in new york you try to 
identify unprofitable operations and wipe them out that 
doesnt come free 
ames filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of 
the us bankruptcy code on april 25 
a hearing is scheduled thursday in us bankruptcy court in new 
york on ames plan to close the stores which employ about 17500 
full and parttime employees most of the stores being closed are 
former zayre stores which ames acquired in 1988 
the company employed about 55000 people at the time of the 
bankruptcy filing 
if the court approves ames plans to conduct inventory 
liquidation sales and close the stores in august or september 
the majority of our loss in the first quarter reflects actions 
which are absolutely necessary to stabilize our business and reduce 
losses stephen l pistner chief executive officer of the 
department store chain said in a prepared statement the store 
closings and writedown of inventory represent an important first 
step toward our objective of emerging from chapter 11 
the stores being closed are in 16 states connecticut florida 
illinois indiana kentucky maryland massachusetts michigan new 
hampshire new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania rhode 
island virginia and west virginia 
ames also plans to close distribution centers in plant city 
fla and worcester mass a center under construction in leesport 
pa will be completed if the court approves 
davidowitz said it will take another six months to determine 
whether the steps ames has taken will save the company 
the big question is can ames really go forward is there a 
viable company left the books out nobody knows he said 
it really is a new ames davidowitz said theyve 
addressed all their problems now were going to see how they go 
forward

soybean futures prices fell modestly tuesday on 
the chicago board of trade after the government reported generally 
favorable crop conditions 
corn and wheat futures ended mixed though with selling 
interest offset by news of a wheat sale to china and reports of 
further rain damage to newly planted corn in soggy central iowa

showed corn planting 97 percent complete as of sunday and soybean 
planting 79 percent finished about the same as a year earlier 
conditions of those crops generally were rated fair to good 
corn futures rallied late in the session amid reports that 
overnight showers had washed away more young corn in central iowa 
but traders did not consider the reported losses to be critical 
if there has been some corn acreage in iowa flooded out they 
may come back if they get a week of dry weather and plant soybeans 
on that acreage said joel karlin an analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
wheat futures were supported by the usdas announcement tuesday 
morning that it had accepted exporters bids to sell nearly 360000 
metric tons of us wheat to china at subsidized prices 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in july at 331 a bushel corn was

speculators continued to sell heavily into the orange juice

analysts attribute almost entirely to bearish chart patterns 
on other commodity markets oil and pork futures extended recent 
losses cattle futures advanced grains and soybeans were mixed 
and precious metals retreated

1667 a pound the lowest close since dec 29 the last trading 
day of last year

christmastime freeze destroyed about onethird of the florida 
orange crop 
analysts said the collapse was triggered friday when the july 
price slipped below 1885 breaking a major trend line and

thomas commodity specialist with merrill lynch consumer markets in

numbers tuesday perhaps indicating they either cannot or will not 
pay the increases in margin required to maintain bullish futures 
positions 
theres not a lot of confidence that prices will be able to 
recover said ms eskanasy

predicted a levelingoff at around 160 a pound followed by a 
rebound

bond prices slipped tuesday in light trading as 
the market shrugged off news that growth in the nations housing 
market dropped to its slowest pace since the last recession 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond lost 732 point or 219 
per 1000 in face amount its yield which rises when prices fall 
climbed to 847 percent from 846 percent late monday 
the market did not have the expected reaction to the commerce 
department report that housing starts fell 14 percent in may to 
the lowest level since october 1982 
usually signs of economic weakness lead to an upturn in bond 
prices on the belief that the news will prompt the federal reserve 
to lower interest rates falling rates can boost the value of 
fixedreturn investments such as bonds 
but the bond market acted perversely said robert brusca 
chief economist at nikko securities co in new york bond prices 
fell on the news 
brusca said the markets reaction may be explained by the fact 
that it already was well known that the housing market is weak 
the reaction also shows the market is more concerned with other 
factors such as upcoming economic reports that include the revised 
firstquarter gross national product thursday and durable goods and 
personal income friday and upcoming government bond auctions 
brusca said 
william sullivan director of money market research at dean 
witter reynolds inc agreed there was concern among traders about 
a possible oversupply of treasury securities the government on 
wednesday was expected to announce details of its upcoming auction 
of twoyear and fouryear notes 
the markets downward path began friday when the government 
issued a report showing industrial production rose at a 
greaterthanexpected pace in may the market interpreted the 
report to mean it was unlikely the fed would ease interest rates 
soon since the report indicated inflation may be rising 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds tuesday prices of 
shortterm governments fell from 132 point to 116 point 
intermediate maturities fell from 332 point to lsqb point and 
longterm issues fell as much as point according to telerate 
inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 098 to 115729 
yields on threemonth treasury bills auctioned monday traded at

773 percent yields on sixmonth bills auctioned monday remained 
at 806 percent as the discount held at 764 percent yields on 
oneyear bills rose to 812 percent as the discount rose 4 basis 
points to 757 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8lsqb percent down from 8 
percent late monday

federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp lost 995 million during the quarter ending may 5 
but the loss was less than expected the retailers said tuesday 
federated and allieds first quarter results were surprising 
only in that they exceeded our expectations for how the business 
would perform in the period immediately following the chapter 11 
filings said chairman allen questrom 
the companies strengthening performance during the quarter 
indicates that we clearly are moving in the right direction 
questrom said 
federated lost 576 million on sales of 101 billion in the 
quarter compared with a loss of 622 million on sales of 102 
billion during the comparable period a year ago the company said 
allied lost 419 million on sales of 5814 million compared 
with a loss of 403 million on sales of 5725 million during the 
same quarter last year 
federateds chains include abraham and straus and bloomingdales 
of new york burdines of miami lazarus of cincinnati richs of 
atlanta and goldsmiths of memphis 
allieds chains include the bon marche of seattle jordan marsh 
of boston jordan marsh of tampa maas brothers of tampa and 
sterns of paramus nj 
the two divisions which cited 77 billion in debts in filing 
for us bankruptcy court protection in january operate 260 stores 
in 28 states 
spokeswoman carol sanger said that more important than the 995 
million loss was the 419 million cash federated had on hand on 
june 6 and the 189 million allied had on hand that date at the 
same time last year federated had 188 million in cash and 
allied had no cash she said 
although federated received a bankruptcy judges permission to 
obtain up to 400 million and allied up to 300 million in 
debtorinpossession financing neither company has used any of 
that credit sanger said

lawyers for amoco corp and french plaintiffs 
both are unhappy with a judges ruling that amoco should pay nearly 
160 million in damages for a 1978 oil spill off northern france 
indicating a final settlement is still far away 
us district judge charles norgle on monday issued a sevenpage 
order in the case spelling out recommended damages for the massive 
spill from the amoco cadiz tanker he set july 24 as the date he 
would specify final judgments and instructed parties to the lawsuit 
to calculate interest owed them 
norgles order says he is in basic agreement with damage 
recommendations made last year by former us district judge frank 
mcgarr who was appointed a special master in the case 
we dont expect to have to pay it frank cicero a lawyer 
representing chicagobased amoco said of the expected judgment 
we think judge mcgarr erred on both his legal rulings and his 
evidentiary rulings we believe well get it reversed 
cicero said the company believes the shipbuilder not amoco was 
at fault in the spill he said the company will appeal to the 7th 
us circuit court of appeals after the july 24 hearing the 
appeals process could take two years cicero said 
warren marwedel a lawyer for the french plaintiffs said his 
clients will appeal because they believe amoco is liable and that 
the award was too little 
the order specifies amounts in french francs and british pounds 
which come to about 1235 million to be paid to the french 
national government local governments and businesses about 359 
million would go to the royal dutchshell group the company that 
paid for the supertankers cargo

on colorado boulevard where the little 
old lady from pasadena terrorized other drivers motorists no 
longer have to leave their cars to grocery shop 
they can cruise instead to a driveup window for the eggs 
detergent or some of the other 1400 grocery items fast food or 
household goods at the drivethru express store opened by the 
supermarket chain vons cos 
the window isnt just another carcrazy california trend its 
more an example of how supermarkets are trying to compete with 
convenience stores fastfood restaurants and vast hypermarkets 
we think that somebody whos tired today can swing by the 
store and pick up dinner for tonight they can pick up their 
detergent to do the laundry and even pick up a fresh fruit tray 
for their breakfast tomorrow said phil hawkins vons vice 
president of sales and its all at a good price 
similar setups have been tested at convenience stores in such 
cities as edgeworth pa and springville utah 
theres even a drivethrough newsstand in lancaster 
pennsylvania said sheri aguirre a spokeswoman for the national 
association of convenience stores 
markets across the country now include everything from post 
offices to bank branches to cafes vons southern californias 
largest retail supermarket chain with 328 stores is a regional 
leader in such experiments 
in its hispanicangled tianguis markets for example mariachis 
play on weekends and shoppers can purchase pigs heads handrolled 
tortillas cactus and mexican sweetbreads 
at its upscale pavilions stores you can buy a 50 bottle of 
opus one the napa valley red wine produced in collaboration by 
californias robert mondavi and bordeauxs late baron philippe de 
rothschild or some fresh sushi chocolate amaretto mousse or tiny 
red teardrop tomatoes 
three vons stores have convenience stores built into the 
supermarket and more of them are planned according to spokeswoman 
mary m mcaboy 
its one of those express stores that has been expanded with the 
driveup window experiment ms mcaboy said windows likely will be 
tried at other locations although no final decision has been made 
hawkins the vice president of sales said that when the 
drivethrough opened in march vons officials estimated 
conservatively that 100 drivers per day would use it the number as 
of may was about 200 per day mostly at mealtimes 
express store items range from corn flakes cat food and condoms 
to specialty pizzas the santa fe version is topped with blue corn 
tortillas and peppers and bean sprouts and ginger top the chicken 
oriental type 
on one recent morning there was no waiting in line at the 
unostentatious window it took 55 seconds for a clerks voice to 
come over the speaker then 95 seconds to fill the simple order 
some antifreeze motor oil and mints the store was out of one 
item a barrons weekly business newspaper 
its not that busy during the day said mieko becker an 
employee theres a lot more at night when the moms line up for 
milk things like that 
no alcoholic beverages are sold through the window and for now 
theres no fresh meat or produce available we think people want 
to touch smell and look at the fresh products hawkins says

in yet another move to give northwest 
airlines consumeroriented leadership from outside the industry 
the company tuesday named frederick b rentschler president and 
chief executive officer 
rentschler president and chief executive officer at food giant 
beatrice co will join northwest chairman alfred checchi and three 
other airline novices in top management at the nations 
fourthlargest carrier 
hopefully one of the strengths that we will bring is that we 
will crossfertilize the company with the expertise derived from 
many industries and we feel that that will be our strength 
ultimately checchi said 
rentschler 50 replaces president frederic malek a coowner 
who will play a smaller role as vice chairman 
checchi malek and gary wilson all former marriott corp 
executives took control of northwest last august in a 365 
billion buyout since then eight of the top 11 posts at northwest 
have been filled by checchi members of the buyout group or 
outsiders hired by checchi 
three of the outsiders had no airline management experience 
including chief financial officer john dasburg another former 
marriott executive 
mark daugherty an airline analyst with the securities firm dean 
witter reynolds said northwest could be making a mistake 
i think its important to try to get people within the 
industry daugherty said its a very competitive cutthroat 
lowmargin business i dont think the companies have the liberty 
or luxury of breaking new people in 
checchi said he doesnt have an ounce of reservation about 
rentschlers lack of airline experience checchi said rentschler 
will be backed up by 4000 experienced middle and upper managers 
including two top executives from the regime of former chairman 
steven rothmeier 
rentschler said the job of every chief executive officer 
includes strategic direction setting objectives communicating 
clearly selecting good employees and motivating them 
those are leadership qualities which are essential i would say 
in any chief executive position be they packaged goods marketing 
driven organizations or be it an airline he said 
wilson said british airways plc chief executive sir colin 
marshall a former avis rentacar executive has proven that an 
outsider can run an airline wilson said that not having 
preconceived notions about the industry can give birth to 
refreshing ideas 
candace browning an analyst with wertheim schroder amp co inc 
in new york said the hiring of rentschler fits with northwests 
emphasis on service 
i think strategically that was the right thing to do she 
said 
checchi said rentschler was primarily hired for his strong 
consumer marketing experience in an attempt to improve 
northwests poor service image rentschler is available because 
beatrice has agreed to be acquired by conagra inc for 134 
billion the buyout was announced june 7 
rentschler is credited with turning around the swift huntwesson 
foods division of esmark inc before beatrice acquired that 
company he was forced out in 1984 but returned in 1986 when 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co acquired beatrice in a 61 billion 
leveraged buyout 
in the past three years rentschler has overseen numerous 
divestitures that included the sale of avis a cocacola bottler 
tropicana products inc and other brands before working at 
beatrice rentschler was president and chief executive of 
armourdial inc 
beatrice ranked 25th in the forbes magazine list of the 400 
biggest privately held us companies had 43 billion in sales in 
its most recent year northwest ranks 11th on the same list with 
annual revenue of 56 billion beatrice had 16400 workers while 
northwest has 37000 
malek said he is stepping aside to devote more time to outside 
commitments he has been busy assembling a sevennation economic 
summit in texas next month for president george bush he also is 
cochairman of coldwell banker commercial group and an investor in 
caterair international an airline catering business

governors of the six new england states and 
the premiers of five eastern canadian provinces have agreed to form 
a crossborder partnership to promote the regions goods 
especially in europe 
the mystic covenant as it is dubbed pledges the governors and 
premiers to work together to market the region its companies and 
its products overseas through joint trade missions and trade shows 
its clear that increasingly our fates and our destinies are 
going to be intertwined said vermont gov madeleine m kunin 
weve got a head start at being global players by our association 
with the canadian premiers this lesson can now be applied on a 
global scale 
the agreement was signed tuesday at the end of the 18th annual 
conference between the governors and premiers 
the twoday meeting was dominated by discussions about 
opportunities in europe particularly the plan of the 12nation 
european community to form a single market in 1992 and the budding 
free markets of eastern europe 
also at the meeting the six governors reached a separate 
agreement to develop a regional strategy on international trade for 
new england 
neither trade agreement will diminish competition between the 
states or between the united states and canada for foreign capital 
the officials said 
when it comes to attracting foreign investment were going to 
be competitors and were going to be healthy competitors against 
each other said william herman an economic development official 
for new hampshire 
but for the export promotion it makes sense that we try to do 
it as a region herman said 
the meeting gathered the executives of massachusetts vermont 
connecticut rhode island new hampshire maine quebec nova 
scotia prince edward island new brunswick and newfoundland 
the governors also accepted a bleak economic forecast from 
nicholas s perna chief economist for connecticut national bank 
perna predicted the region will create few new jobs over the next 
30 months and forecast that housing starts will not rebound at all 
during the period 
there is light at the end of the tunnel but its flatness 
he said its not a traditional rebound 
the governors also urged congress to extend funding of the 
federal clean water act which is scheduled to be phased out by 
1994 they asked for grants of 24 billion a year to build modern 
wastewater treatment plants

goodyear tire amp rubber co said it will 
eliminate 1100 jobs and take a charge of 35 million against 
second quarter pretax profits as part of a restructuring of its 
us tire sales and support staff 
the job cuts will come over the next several months mainly 
through layoffs but also through some early retirements spokesman 
walter c mcclenny said 
gene culler executive vice president of north american tire 
operations said the reductions would result from the realigning of 
operations into 28 sales regions that will report directly to the 
companys akron headquarters 
currently the company has 43 sales districts reporting to five 
regional offices 
culler said hightech improvements in goodyears tire ordering 
and distribution system make many of our traditional operations 
obsolete in a new era of quality and cost consciousness 
goodyears earnings have been under pressure recently with the 
company blaming pricing competition sluggish north american 
vehicle production and difficulty containing its own costs its 
earnings plunged 78 percent in the first three months of this year 
to 209 million despite a 2 percent gain in sales to 269 billion

donald trump and his bank lenders reached a 
tentative agreement tuesday to restructure the 3 billion debt load 
the developer ran up in assembling his real estate empire a 
newspaper reported 
the new york times reported in an early edition of wednesdays 
paper that trumps four lead banks agreed to lend him 65 million 
and defer interest and principal payments on about 850 million of 
the developers nearly 2 billion in bank debt 
the agreement hinges on the four banks getting other lenders 
particularly japanese banks that are involved in loan syndicates 
for trump to agree to the deal the newspaper said the new loan 
package will be secured by nearly every asset in trumps real 
estate and gambling empire it said 
the times cited unidentified people involved in the talks 
the banks and trumps spokesman dan klores refused to comment 
on the status of the talks the four banks are citicorp 
manufacturers hanover corp chase manhattan corp and bankers 
trust co 
last week the parties reportedly were close to agreement on a 
plan under which trump would receive a 60 million loan that would 
enable him to keep making debt payments but over this past 
weekend the deal began falling apart as bankers argued over the 
contribution each would make and the collateral each would receive 
trump has yet to make a roughly 43 million payment due last 
friday on junk bonds used to finance the purchase of trump castle 
one of the developers three atlantic city hotelcasinos 
trump is in technical default on the bonds but is within a 
grace period during which he can still make the payment 
the developer also has not yet made a 30 million debt payment 
due manufacturers hanover corp 
trump has about 1 billion in junk bond debt outstanding in 
addition to roughly 2 billion in bank debt 
trump who has tried to downplay his problems as they became 
public in recent weeks continued that campaign tuesday he put out 
a statement announcing the trump shuttle the northeastern air 
service he bought last year from eastern airlines had made its 
monthly interest payment on time 
investors meanwhile showed some optimism that trump would be 
able to iron out his difficulties and meet his debt payment 
obligations 
traders reported that trump casino bonds which have fallen 
sharply recently recovered some ground tuesday the trump castle 
bonds were trading at about 58 per 100 face amount up about 2 
from monday in late afternoon transactions 
bonds used to back the taj mahal casino were up more than 1 to 
5250 and trump plaza bonds were trading at about 82 unchanged 
from monday 
the debt restructuring plan is aimed at helping trump to keep 
making his debt payments while waiting for his assets to rise in 
value so some eventually could be sold 
the assets which include hotels and office and apartment 
buildings in new york have fallen in value due to the slumping new 
york real estate and atlantic city casino markets trump shuttle 
also has posted disappointing results 
the four major banks last week reportedly agreed to provide an 
additional 60 million in loans and to temporarily suspend interest 
payments in exchange the banks would have gotten equity in some 
of his properties 
bank creditors also reportedly were seeking to force trump to 
give up some of his authority over the daytoday operations of 
trump organization 
if trump is unable to make the payment on the trump castle 
bonds bondholders could claim the property or the casino could be 
forced into bankruptcy 
if trump went into full default he could lose his licenses to 
operate the casinos
