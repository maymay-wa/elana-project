the boeing co and machinists are returning to 
the bargaining table saturday the 46th day of a strike thats 
idled production lines at the worlds biggest commercial airplane 
builder 
i just felt it is time to get them back to the bargaining 
table federal mediator doug hammond said of his call for the 
meeting 
the facetoface talks which broke off nov 4 were set for 
130 pm at hammonds offices

dec 1 expiration dates while negotiations continue 
the contracts cover nearly 28000 workers who are represented 
by the seattle professional engineering employees association 
agreement on the engineers and professional workers pacts 
however is not expected until there is a settlement in the 
machinists strike 
while both boeing and the machinists welcomed new talks the 
union warned continued stonewalling by the company would lead to 
a continuation of the sevenweekold strike

boeing offer that had a new look but the company conceded included 
no new money the union accused boeing of trying to build up 
workers hopes then forcing a membership vote 
boeing spokesman harold carr declined to say whether there was 
any change in either sides position 
our objective all along has been to get the 57000 boeing 
employees back to work and the fact the meeting is called is 
hopefully a sign that we can get them back to work he said

secondlongest strike in boeings history surpassing a 1977 work 
action that lasted 45 days the longest in 1948 lasted 140 days

the seattle area 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore 
and a few hundred others at scattered sites in other states

interior department officials say they realize 
the federal government has mishandled indian affairs and welcome a 
senate report that recommends allowing tribes to govern themselves 
quite clearly the federal government in the past has not been 
as efficient as careful or as caring as it should have been in a 
number of instances frank bracken interior undersecretary said 
friday 
but he said the department already has begun to correct problems 
identified in a 238page report released by a special investigating 
panel of the senate select committee on indian affairs 
the report summarizes a twoyear investigation into government 
corruption relating to indians 
it recommends that the federal bureaucracy be broken apart to 
allow tribes interested in selfdetermination to negotiate for 
grants from the federal government much the same way as do states 
and local governments 
fraud mismanagement and corruption pervade virtually all 
federal indian programs sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman 
of the special committee 
he said the committees work showed that many tribes are capable 
of managing their own affairs 
he said federal indian agencies should continue to exist for 
tribes that want the services but in time all tribes would see the 
benefits of selfgovernment assuring that the billions now 
wasted on selfperpetuating federal bureaucracies will belong to 
tribes themselves to determine their own destiny 
in all the federal budget for indian programs equals 33 
billion annually yet surprisingly little of these funds reach the 
indian people deconcini said 
under the committees proposal the federal government would 
provide an annual grant to each tribe equal to the tribes 
proportional share of the current federal indian budget it would 
be a permanent entitlement in lieu of federal services from the 
bureau of indian affairs or other agencies 
the tribes would have to be accountable for the funds and tribal 
officials negotiating the agreements would have to be proven 
representatives of their tribes 
i have not yet consulted with indian tribes about the 
recommendations contained in this report and will withhold any 
final comment pending consultation said eddie brown head of the 
bia 
but he said he agreed with the reports finding that we must 
take real actions and not merely offer bandaid solutions 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo the only native american 
in congress joined deconcini and sens john mccain rariz tom 
daschle dsd and daniel inouye dhawaii in announcing the 
proposals 
two hundred years of mistakes in dealing with the american 
indian can only lead to more of the same without drastic reform 
campbell said 
the lawmakers said it would take a long time to put the 
proposals into action but that they would draw up legislation soon 
and that inouye chairman of the select committee on indian 
affairs would hold extensive hearings 
rep morris udall dariz who chairs the house interior 
committee said he had reviewed the senate report and would work 
with inouye on legislation 
the special committee appointed by inouye held more than four 
weeks of hearings last winter and spring 
the committee staff visited more than 70 indian tribes in 16 
states conducted about 2000 interviews and analyzed more than 1 
million documents 
the panel examined contracting fraud gaming operations on 
reservations child sexual abuse in federal schools protection of 
natural resources belonging to the indians housing the indian 
health service and corruption among tribal officials

abortionrights supporters say they are 
setting the stage for next years congressional battle with a bill 
that would write into law the 1973 roe vs wade supreme court 
ruling that legalized abortion 
this bill is going to be the rallying point said rep 
claudine schneider rri 
bills were introduced in the house and senate on friday that 
would effectively overcome the supreme court decision last summer 
in the socalled webster case that gave states greater authority to 
restrict abortions supporters said 
just a few lines long the bill would forbid states from 
restricting a womans right to have an abortion before the time her 
fetus becomes viable for life outside the womb or at any time when 
necessary to protect the life of the mother 
a leader of the abortion opponents rep christopher smith 
rnj said he welcomed the bill because it would bring a full 
debate on abortion he said he was confident the house would defeat 
it 
i hope they bring the bill to the floor very quickly he 
said the question will then be very squarely will we permit 
abortion on demand for the whole nine months of pregnancy 
although no action was expected until next year abortionrights 
backers said the bill would become the central focus of future 
congressional and political debate on the abortion issue 
the house bill had 88 sponsors and a version introduced in the 
senate carried 19 sponsors 
the bill was aimed at writing into law the landmark 1973 roe vs 
wade decision establishing a womans right to an abortion and at 
reversing the webster ruling abortionrights supporters contend 
the webster decision eroded rights established 16 years earlier and 
signaled a possible further erosion in future high court decisions 
the webster decision however has energized abortionrights 
leaders and raised the temperature of the abortion debate in many 
states 
sen robert packwood rore an abortionrights supporter 
predicted passage by both the house and senate but acknowledged 
backers probably would not be able to override a presidential veto 
president bush is appearing in rhode island on monday at an 
event for schneider despite their differences on abortion

when christian fuehrer started 
regular monday prayers for peace at his church nikolaikirche back 
in 1982 he never dreamed they would one day be the kernel of a 
revolution 
fuehrer vicar of one of central leipzigs most historic 
churches was one of the thousands of east germans and millions of 
west germans who believed mediumrange missiles should not be 
stationed in western europe to counter soviet ss20s 
the small peace movement in east germany then centered largely 
on its protestant church the only institution in the country 
independent of the communist authorities 
fuehrer a quietly determined 46yearold father of four 
started peace prayers every monday 
dozens even hundreds came but once nato missiles were 
stationed fuehrer recalls disillusioned east germans stopped 
coming to the monday prayers and attendance sank to just ten 
things changed early in 1988 when east german police arrested 
dozens of youths bold enough to celebrate in their own way at an 
official ceremony honoring rosa luxembourg and karl liebknecht 
heroes of germanys failed communist revolution in 1918 
many people came asking to pray for those who were 
arrested fuehrer said in an interview 
and it was there that i first heard from people with problems 
who were waiting to leave the country 
then the wait could take two or three years people who had 
applied to emigrate west faced obstacles at work in schools even 
at home they needed counseling and they found it in fuehrers 
nikolaikirche where the motto is that the church is offen fuer 
alle open for all 
really we were a substitute for the state fuehrer said 
but the state was not ready for or capable of any dialogue 
despite harassment from the authorities fuehrer kept counseling 
the wouldbe emigres and providing shelter for small alternative 
groups such as those concerned with cleaning up leipzigs heavy 
polluted environment 
now ive taken down the posters for new forum east 
germanys largest opposition movement fuehrer noted they have a 
place of their own now my philosophy is political parties have no 
place in church but if they have no other place to go then the 
church will offer them protection 
by may 7 of this year leipzigs authorities had enough of the 
monday prayers police cordons were thrown up around the church and 
everyone who attended was registered 
in a sign of mounting popular discontent however the 
repression backfired curious passersby stood behind the police 
cordons and gradually became interested in the monday service 
forcing fuehrer to ask other leipzig churches to arrange similar 
sessions to get people off the street 
but the crowds kept growing irritating the communist 
authorities under pressure from a mass exodus of tens of thousands 
of young people through eastern europe the government started to 
crack down hard on dissent 
on oct 7 the nations 40th anniversary police in leipzig and 
other cities beat hundreds of prodemocracy demonstrators in what 
fuehrer saw as a dress rehearsal for a move against his monday 
service and spontaneous marches afterwards 
two days later the attempt was made after fuehrer refused to 
bow to threats of prosecution the local communist party sent about 
a thousand of its members to church 
the communists intended to fill most of the 2000 seats hours 
before the service began 
again the tactic backfired fuehrer hurriedly asked two other 
churches to open for prayer then went ahead and held his own 
regular session 
what fuehrer calls the next miracle of that day occurred 
during the service a message arrived from three communist 
functionaries and kurt mazur conductor of leipzigs famed 
gewandhaus orchestra saying they supported peaceful demostrations 
this encouraged the congregation to join a crowd of tens of 
thousands outside in a peaceful march despite a strong presence of 
police and special antiriot forces 
you had the impression that a world war or at the very least 
a civil war was on its way fuehrer said of the security forces 
but in the end there was no violence and east germanys 
peaceful revolution was born 
now hundreds of thousands of people seeking free elections 
march through leipzigs streets every monday after the peace 
prayers 
without the church the demonstrations would not have been 
possible fuehrer noted but we didnt organize them i never 
imagined of course where the peace prayers might lead

president bush steering clear of the 
controversial subject of german reunification is making a 
concerted show of consulting with western leaders before his 
shipboard summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the white house issued a statement friday saying bush had called 
french president francois mitterrand and canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney on friday and had received a call from west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
another statement was issued later to report bush had called 
british prime minister margaret thatcher and to say they will 
continue their talks when they meet next friday at camp david the 
presidential retreat in marylands catoctin mountains 
the leaders talked about the meeting this weekend of european 
leaders on the fastmoving developments in eastern europe and 
bushs summit with gorbachev dec 2 and 3 on ships off the coast of 
malta the white house said 
the calls seemed designed to ease european concerns that bush 
was going to meet gorbachev without the benefit of advice from nato 
allies 
preparing for the summit bush was to meet at camp david today 
with two groups of academic and thinktank experts on soviet 
politics and eastwest relations 
bush also held a round of presummit talks friday meeting at 
the white house with four former us ambassadors to the soviet 
union george kennan malcolm toon thomas watson and arthur 
hartman 
in a radio interview aired today by mutual and nbc bush brushed 
aside fears about the possibility of german reunification saying 
i dont think history need repeat itself if there evolves a 
single german state 
bush said reunification is a matter for the people of the 
germanies to determine and it is a very its a highly sensitive 
matter as far as the soviet union is concerned and its better to 
leave it right there 
the opening of the berlin wall has prompted talk about a 
reunified germany which has been divided into east and west since 
the end of world war ii gorbachev has said that talk about 
reunification would mean interference in the affairs of the two 
germanies 
moreover there is nervousness in western europe about restoring 
germany to full strength since a militarily strong germany was at 
the center of two world wars in europe this century 
in another development bush sent a cable to gorbachev 
expressing hopes for a calm and peaceful period of change in 
eastern europe 
bush responding to a virtually identical message from gorbachev 
a week earlier indicated his support for the dramatic changes in 
eastern europe and reforms under way in the soviet union said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
a senior administration official said bush would not agree at 
the summit to look the other way in case the kremlin deems it 
necessary to crack down against labor unrest and citizens 
unhappiness over expected food shortages this winter 
this american president like his predecessors will have no 
understanding for the violent suppression of mans desire for 
freedom period the official said insisting on anonymity 
the state department meanwhile welcomed recent political 
changes in east germany and bulgaria 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the formation of a 
new cabinet containing 11 noncommunist members could be a first 
step toward meeting the east german peoples demands for 
democratic reform she said those demands could not be met fully 
without free elections 
ms tutwiler also applauded the dismissal thursday of three 
hardline politburo members in bulgaria and the installation of four 
officials who are likely to support new communist party leader 
peter mladenov she called it an encouraging sign that mladenov 
has the will and the ability to carry out needed reforms

cable television companies enjoy an 
unrestricted monopoly that lets them overcharge customers and 
seize control of sports programs broadcast competitors contend 
the criticism came friday from independent and network 
broadcasters at a hearing of the senate commerce science and 
transportations communications subcommittee on the regulation of 
the cable tv industry 
the broadcasters say cable television operators pay nothing for 
72 percent of the programming viewed by their customers because it 
is supplied by networks and independent stations 
at the same time the broadcasters contend the cable industry 
programmers favorably treat the local cable outlets while charging 
excessive rates to others 
five companies serve 42 percent of cable households in the 
country and rates rose 29 percent in the first two years of 
deregulation starting in 1987 according to the critics 
in addition they say the same companies that produce cable 
programs also have the cable systems giving them control of 
conduit and content 
cables unrestricted monopoly operations its nearly free use 
of the compulsory license and its use of a triple revenue stream 
of subscription rates advertising and payperview has led to a 
completely distorted marketplace said edward o fritts of the 
national association of broadcasters which represents the networks 
the cable industry disputed those contentions saying rates 
jumped after being kept artificially low by local regulation it 
said rates are now rising at a lower rate than inflation 
the industry through the national cable television association 
also claims that cable helps networks by extending their reach and 
improving their signals the cable industry also says it has 
increased the amount of sports programming available and blames the 
team owners for jacking up the bids 
fritts group supports legislation proposed by sen john 
danforth rmo that would reregulate the cable industry which 
was basically deregulated by the 1984 cable act 
danforths bill would allow cities to regulate cable rates 
unless cable companies had effective local competition and would 
make it easier for cities to revoke the franchises of cable 
operators who do not serve the community well 
preston r padden president of the association of independent 
television stations claimed that cable is monopolizing sports 
television he showed the subcommittee a los angeles billboard 
warning no cable no gretzky no cable no magic a reference 
to stars wayne gretzky of the los angeles kings hockey team and 
magic johnson of the lakers basketball team 
he also complained that such sports siphoning was occurring in 
college conference sports 
lynn mcreynolds a spokeswoman for the cable industry group 
acknowledged that there have been a few instances where sports 
events have been moved to cable

peace talks between the nicaraguan government 
and the contra rebels resume on monday with the two sides at an 
apparent impasse over terms for reviving a ceasefire 
during the seventh day of discussions on friday the sandinista 
government remained adamant in its insistence on a full withdrawal 
of contra forces from nicaragua to base camps in honduras 
for its part the nicaraguan resistance stood firm in refusing 
to consider even a partial withdrawal of the estimated 5000 
contras deployed in nicaragua 
united nations and organization of american states mediators 
were spending the weekend drafting a revised working document for 
presentation to the negotiators when they resume their discussions 
here on monday at the oas 
president daniel ortega suspended the ceasefire on nov 1 
citing what he described as contra terrorist activities he has 
said the feb 25 national elections will go ahead as planned even 
if no truce agreement is reached 
after a twohour negotiating session friday sandinista vice 
foreign minister victor hugo tinoco warned that a ceasefire in 
place as proposed by the contras would create in nicaragua a 
situation similar to that in el salvador where truces have never 
taken hold 
we consider that an effective ceasefire in nicaragua means a 
separation of forces and a separation of forces means all the 
contras to withdraw with their arms to their camps in honduras 
tinoco said otherwise there will be no ceasefire 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros said such a retreat would leave 
the rebels at a disadvantage 
once our forces have withdrawn from certain areas the 
government forces have taken advantage to move there in force 
deploy huge amounts of weapons huge amounts of forces to repress 
our civilian supporters he said 
after two days of talks at the united nations and five more 
here matamoros said there are substantial differences but 
noted that both sides are willing to continue the negotiations 
tinoco also ruled out the possibility of reaching a compromise 
by allowing the contras to redeploy in designated enclaves inside 
nicaragua subject to international inspection 
he said the nicaraguan terrain doesnt lend itself to such a 
solution because much of the country is heavily wooded and the 
rebels would have the ability to move in and out of the enclaves 
undetected 
the enclave concept he said has never functioned in human 
history 
oas mediator hugo de zela of peru resorted to understatement in 
characterizing the status of the talks 
he said there are some discrepancies between the two sides 
but he added the fact that we are continuing signifies 
progress

a un report says el salvadors 
government presided over a resurgence of torture this year that 
included sexual abuse and beatings of prisoners and summary 
executions of political opponents 
the annual report was released friday a day after eight people 
six of them jesuit priests were slain in san salvador 
jose antonio pastor ridruejo special representative of the un 
human rights committee said in the report he is again extremely 
disturbed by the number and seriousness of the human rights 
violations committed thus far in 1989 particularly by the 
resurgence of torture 
members of the state apparatus particularly of the armed 
forces have carried out politically motivated summary executions 
whose exact numbers cannot be determined but are generally 
comparable to those for last year 
pastor also castigated leftist rebels for kidnappings and 
assassinations 
president alfredo cristiani who took office june 1 said his 
rightist government was not involved in the jesuit slayings which 
took place amid the biggest rebel offensive in the 10yearold war 
the killings fit a pattern of rising repression torture and 
political violence perpetrated by uniformed soldiers as documented 
in pastors report 
the roman catholic churchs archdiocesan legal protection office 
said 50 people were killed through august and the governments 
salvadoran human rights commission said 68 people have been killed 
however hundreds of others have been slain by unidentified 
assassins or have disappeared 
about 250 people were detained for political offenses as of oct 
14 pastor said a much higher figure than the previous year 
nongovernmental organizations that contacted pastor in el 
salvador during his visit oct 814 complained about a marked 
increase in the torture of political prisoners by their 
interrogators he said 
witnesses belonging to organizations invariably made roughly 
the same statement 
long periods of interrogation while blindfolded and without 
being able to sit down or rest extensive beatings continuous use 
of a hood which impedes breathing and causes fainting electric 
shocks in water tanks use of drugs and acids and on many 
occasions rape and sexual abuse of both women and men as well as 
threat to family members pastor said 
witnesses who did not belong to organizations complained of 
psychological illtreatment and sometimes of beatings and death 
threats to themselves or to members of their families he said 
the government told him detainees were blindfolded to prevent 
them from recognizing their interrogators but denied there was 
systematic use of torture 
salvadoran authorities said the claims of torture were 
orchestrated by the rebels of the farabundo marti national 
liberation movement 
pastor found that thus far in 1989 government action against 
trade unions and peasant and other organizations has increased the 
government claims that some of these organizations answer to fmln 
the organizations concerned deny this although independent 
salvadoran sources have indicated that in some cases the 
activities of some organizations are not entirely independent of 
fmln he said 
pastor blamed the rebels for assassinating alleged collaborators 
with the armed forces soldiers officials and ideological 
opponents 
he said individuals have been abducted by the guerrillas and 
probably by governmentsanctioned death squads and are still 
missing 
el salvador only recently emerged from a period of repression 
during which death squads and rightist elements of the military 
were accused of killing thousands of people the salvadoran right 
considers church activists and church intellectuals to be 
subversives

legislation extending the life of the troubled 
us civil rights commission for almost two years is headed for 
president bushs desk after winning final approval from the house 
theyre on probation over there for the next 22 months rep 
don edwards dcalif said friday as the house approved the 
measure 3890 
the measure a compromise reached thursday night between the 
senate and the white house would prevent the commission from going 
out of business on nov 30 when its charter runs out 
the bush administration had sought to put the panel out of 
business for one day only allowing bush to dump the members and 
engage in what rep james sensenbrenner rwis called a 
complete housecleaning 
the commission then would have been reauthorized for six years 
a democratic version passed by the house on wednesday would have 
kept the commission in business for only six more months buying 
time for an overhaul by congress designed to end the panels 
infighting and other problems 
the compromise provides for no housecleaning but bush will have 
a chance to appoint two new commissioners including the chairman 
and a staff director by the end of the year 
sensenbrenner noted however that the rest of the panel would 
remain intact including two commissioners who have been at the 
center of the personality disputes that have dragged the commission 
into disrepute 
he did not specify which commissioners he had in mind although 
former chairman william b allen still a member of the panel has 
been under fire for delivering before a conservative group a speech 
titled blacks animals homosexuals what is a minority 
allen who is black says that he is the only conservative on 
the commission and that he does not believe in coddling people 
at a recent house judiciary committee meeting sensenbrenner 
complained that commission member mary frances berry has been 
making bizarre remarks 
in the 1960s the commission was lauded by civil rights forces 
for its hearings across the south its ringing reports on racial 
injustice and its bold legislative proposals over the last six 
years however that atmosphere on the panel has soured according 
to lawmakers of both parties 
a report from the general accounting office in 1986 found 
political financial and other problems on the panel but they 
have never been addressed by the commission edwards told the 
house 
a statement issued friday by the office of sen paul simon 
dill said the commission had been mired in controversy for 
much of the last nine years leading many in congress to question 
whether it should be kept alive when its charter expires 
this is a new lease on life for the commission and i hope 
its put to good use simon said its a long enough lease to 
give the president the chance he deserves to steer a new course for 
the commission and its a short enough lease to give congress a 
chance to take another look later

the solar maximum satellite with most of its 
instruments shut down is expected to fall to earth by the end of 
the month 
the satellite which has been sending back information about the 
sun for nearly 10 years was repaired by a visiting space shuttle 
crew in 1984 but now it has run out of fuel to power the rockets 
that have kept it out of the grip of earths atmosphere 
they are projecting nov 29 give or take a few days said 
randee exler spokeswoman for nasas goddard space flight center 
a few weeks ago nasa said three big chunks of the satellite 
might survive the fiery trip through the atmosphere and crash to 
earth but ms exler said there are estimates that as many as 11 
pieces might survive 
there will be debris but we feel confident that most will be 
small pieces she said the satellites path is 70 percent over 
water 
solar max flies over much of south america africa india 
australia and the southernmost tip of china the only portions of 
the united states under its track are south florida the extreme 
southern part of texas and hawaii 
for weeks the satellites altitude has been dropping steadily 
on friday solar maxs orbit was 177 miles high a 257 mile drop 
since oct 31 it fell 26 miles since thursday 
engineers turned off finepointing instruments and the 
spacecraft went into a safe hold scientific operations didnt 
cease completely three instruments still were taking and sending 
data 
even at the end the satellite will perform useful service 
engineers will try to blow off its solar panels an exercise that 
would be required if such a satellite were to be put into a space 
shuttle cargo bay for return to earth 
once the panels are gone all work will cease 
solar max cost 77 million to build and launch in february 1980 
at a time of maximum activity in the suns 11year sunspot cycle 
its mission was to study solar flares 
but after 10 months of service three fuses blew in the 
satellites attitude control box and it was unable to point itself 
accurately that in turn caused four onboard instruments to fail 
in 1984 the shuttle challenger pulled alongside solar max and 
astronaut terry hart reached out and grabbed it with the ships 
robot arm the next day two astronauts working in the open cargo 
bay replaced the control system module and an electronics box 
the satellite has been working well since then for a time there 
were plans to reboost it to a higher orbit but that would have set 
back other missions and the idea was abandoned

democratic senators are threatening to slash 
us aid to el salvador unless president alfredo cristiani can end 
violence in the wartorn central american nation 
as an americantrained team of salvadoran forensic experts began 
an investigation of the slayings of six jesuit priests and two 
others leftist protesters disrupted a capitol hill hearing 
demanding a halt to us aid to cristianis government 
during fridays rancorous hearing sen christopher dodd 
declared the time has come for president cristiani to evidence 
his commitment to controlling those officials within his own 
government and within his own party who are in very large part 
responsible for the civil conflict 
president cristiani is either in control or he is not 
president cristiani either deserves our support or he does not 
said dodd dconn chairman of a foreign relations subcommittee on 
the western hemisphere 
said sen john kerry dmass in an era of scarce foreign 
assistance we need to be asking what we are achieving for the 
dollars sent 
in a statement late friday house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash and senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
called for a return to negotiations and for an investigation of the 
killings 
this outrage must be investigated thoroughly those 
responsible apprehended and promptly brought to justice they 
said any other result would be unacceptable to the community of 
nations and in particular to the american people 
bernard aronson the state departments senior official for 
latin american policy agreed that without improvements the 
policy wont go on but he blamed the current conflict and human 
rights abuses that have accompanied it on rebel provocations 
implicit in our support is a demand that they make real 
progress in human rights he said things have to change in 
salvador 
the farabundo marti national liberation front which has been 
fighting el salvadors government in a bloody civil war for the 
past decade has undertaken assassinations designed to lure 
rightwing death squads out of the closet aronson said 
their strategy is to polarize the country and cripple the 
new government of cristiani the rightist president aronson said 
and he said the purpose of the current fmln offensive in the 
capital of san salvador has been not to strengthen the rebels 
negotiating position as the fmln contends but to take total 
power 
had they succeeded another ally of cuba and nicaragua 
holding power with soviet bloc weaponry would have been firmly 
entrenched in central america aronson said 
he said the murders early thursday likely were the work of 
violent rightwing death squads blamed for most of the 70000 
deaths that have occurred during the countrys civil war but 
aronson cautioned against leaping to conclusions before the outcome 
of the ussupported criminal investigation 
we want this crime investigated fully swiftly and those 
responsible punished with the full force of the law he said 
promises will not satisfy the high standards that president 
cristiani proclaimed in his inaugural address they will not 
satisfy the salvadoran people and they will not satisfy the united 
states 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler noted that 
cristiani had assured us ambassador william walker that even if 
members of the salvadoran armed forces were involved they will 
feel the full weight of the law 
the united states expects him to meet that commitment she 
said 
in another development a us general who drafted a classified 
military strategy for el salvador said the guerrillas cannot be 
defeated on the battlefield and said the war drags on because of 
corruption within the usbacked government 
gen fred woerner who until recently headed the us southern 
command in panama also said the murder of six roman catholic 
priests most likely was the work of the radical right wing acting 
without the support or tacit consent of the conservative government

a program of instant background checks for 
gunbuyers intended to prevent sales to convicted felons would 
be so expensive the justice department isnt expected to recommend 
immediate implementation congressional sources say 
such instant background checks could cost up to 27 billion to 
begin sources said friday 
the justice department recommendation due to be released 
monday suggests such a program but does not call for immediate 
implementation because of lack of funds and lack of 
computerization of all the criminal records one source said 
the computerization of complete information including final 
dispensation of charges that often are not included in law 
enforcement computer systems now used will cost tens of millions 
of dollars and will delay this for several years said that 
source who said he was informed of the report by justice 
department officials 
justice department spokesman david runkel declined to comment on 
the reports contents saying its still in the process of being 
reviewed until the reviews been completed theres no final 
decision 
the report was required by an antidrug abuse act amendment that 
had been approved as an alternative to another measure that would 
have required a sevenday waiting period while authorities 
conducted background checks if they wished before a person could 
buy a gun 
the justice department was required to provide a report to 
congress by nov 18 on its recommendations for preventing sales of 
guns to felons implementation was to begin dec 1 
rep edward feighan dohio who introduced the waitingperiod 
measure dubbed the brady amendment in reference to former 
presidential press secretary james brady who was wounded by an 
assailant trying to shoot thenpresident reagan said friday 
the report is a compelling argument for immediate enactment of 
the brady bill 
the report acknowledges that a pointofsale check will be 
enormously expensive and cannot be implemented in the relatively 
near future he said i appreciate the attorney generals 
effort but i am bitterly disappointed that we have lost a years 
time in saving the lives of americans 
selecting the option of instantaneous checks at the point of 
sale would be a move toward one of the most expensive undertakings 
possible at a time when the federal government is strapped for 
funds he said 
startup costs for an immediate live scan of fingerprints by 
gun dealers would be 96 billion to 27 billion according to the 
report by the task force on felon identification in firearm sales 
published in the federal register on oct 25 
also being recommended according to the sources are 
pointofsale telephone checks by gun dealers to authorities with 
access to computerized information and similar telephone checks to 
an intermediate computer with the same access to information 
those would have startup costs of 36 million to 44 million 
according to the task force 
runkel said in june that attorney general dick thornburgh had 
rejected another option the issuance of firearm owners 
identification cards following background checks that would have 
had startup costs of 148 million to 153 million 
these costs do not include the original computerization of 
information which the task force said will involve substantial 
resources it did not give a precise figure 
gwen fitzgerald of handgun control inc criticized the 
recommendations because they call for no immediate action 
this removes every obstacle for not passing the brady bill as 
soon as possible fitzgerald said last september during the 
vote on the brady amendment and for an entire year congress 
didnt have to deal with this because they had the mccollum 
amendment the one enacted to hide behind they were waiting for 
this announcement 
its now clear that nothing is going to happen anytime soon 
under this directive which means that convicted felons are still 
buying guns over the counter in 28 states she said adding that 
the rest of the states have some kind of background check or 
waiting period before an individual can buy a gun 
the mccollum amendment is named for rep bill mccollum rfla

the federal government is calling for a 
voluntary nationwide recall of ltryptophan a dietary supplement 
linked to a potentially fatal rare blood disorder 
the food and drug administration said friday its offices around 
the country will start contacting manufacturers on monday and ask 
them to recall their products 
a week ago the fda issued a warning telling consumers to stop 
using the supplement 
at least 287 potential cases of the rare disorder 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome have been reported in 37 states and 
the district of columbia at least one death is believed to have 
been caused by taking ltryptophan according to the centers for 
disease control 
the new york state health department on friday banned the 
distribution of ltryptophan department spokeswoman vicki zeldin 
said the ban is effective immediately all of the products 
should be off the shelves this weekend 
two trade associations earlier this week encouraged 
manufacturers to pull the product off retail shelves 
an fda statement announcing the recall effort said there is a 
strong virtually unequivocal link between consumption of 
ltryptophan tablets or capsules and the syndrome 
however the fda said scientists investigating ltryptophan do 
not know why this is happening 
symptoms of the disorder include an abnormally high number of 
white blood cells called eosinophils along with severe muscle 
pain 
the agency said the condition posed a moderate to severe and 
perhaps lifethreatening hazard to certain individuals 
ltryptophan is used by some people for insomnia depression 
premenstrual syndrome or appetite control 
the fda said all cases involved people who took tablets 
capsules or caplets in which ltryptophan was the main ingredient 
no cases have been reported among people who consumed diet 
supplements in which it was a minor ingredient 
jeff nesbitt a spokesman for the fda said the agency decided 
to take the action because of the preponderance of the 
epidemiological evidence that has been obtained this week 
nesbitt said the recall action is voluntary but the fda believes 
it has the evidence to obtain a court order if needed to remove the 
product from the shelves

the senate early saturday gave final 
congressional approval to legislation that would create an 
independent inspector general to monitor the central intellingence 
agency answerable to congress as well as the cia director 
the provision was in a compromise bill authorizing the 
governments intelligence activities for the coming year both the 
house and senate passed the legislation by voice vote 
while president bush a former cia director is said to object 
to establishing a tighter oversight office within the agency 
members of the congressional intelligence committees have said they 
do not believe he will veto the measure because of the new 
requirement 
in addition to setting up a new inspector general appointed by 
the president and confirmed by the senate the bill would guarantee 
the congressional oversight committees access in most cases to the 
igs audit and investigation reports 
cia director william webster has fought the committees over that 
access in the past and some republicans complained that webster 
had mishandled the matter 
cia recalcitrance was its own undoing said rep bob 
livingston rla during house floor debate on the measure 
the new oversight provisions grew out of the irancontra 
scandal when the nations intelligence apparatus skirted the law 
to sell arms to iran and send money to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
despite bans on such activity 
but the bill omitted a series of other steps that grew out of 
the irancontra affair including codification of requirements that 
covert operations be brought to the attention of the intelligence 
committees promptly and in written form and that any third parties 
involved be disclosed 
those provisions were dropped because the house committee wants 
to try again next year to negotiate stricter controls with the 
administration and to write anything into the law now would 
preempt such discussions said committee chairman rep anthony c 
beilenson dcalif 
the new inspector general position would be like other 
government agency igs who conduct audits review the way programs 
are run and generally try to ferret out abuses fraud or waste in 
federal programs 
congressional investigators who probed the irancontra scandal 
said the cia inspector general lacked independence and didnt have 
the manpower resources or tenacity to uncover 
armsforhostages transactions or the diversion of profits to 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
currently the inspector general is appointed by the cia 
director and reports only to him 
opponents of the change including the white house had argued 
that it would create an impression that the cia would be unable to 
protect sensitive information particularly about intelligence 
sources and methods and valuable information might dry up 
money to carry out the governments intelligence operations is 
hidden in the pentagon budget and is secret but reports put the 
overall spending level at upwards of 25 billion 
sources said the bill keeps on track a fiveyear 
multibilliondollar program to upgrade the nations intelligence 
collection through socalled national technical means or 
satellites and other electronic spying 
impetus for the buildup began with us ratification of the 
intermediaterange nuclear arms control treaty with the soviet 
union which brought new requirements for verification 
it has been given additional urgency by developments in the 
soviet union and eastern europe that enhance the prospects for new 
strategic and conventional arms control treaties with the soviets 
in the coming months

the senate ethics committee investigation of 
five senators is gathering steam with the hiring of a prominent 
lawyer who will gather evidence to help the panel decide its next 
move 
robert s bennett of washington dc was retained friday to 
assist in obtaining and analyzing additional information on the 
five senators who met with federal regulators on behalf of the 
failing lincoln savings and loan after receiving campaign 
contributions from the head of the thrift 
the committee said bennett also will work on the case of sen 
alfonse m damato rny accused in a complaint by a former 
election opponent of violating rules in the federal housing scandal 
and other matters 
committee chairman howell heflin dala and vice chairman 
warren rudman rnh said bennett will assist the committee in 
determining whether to proceed to a preliminary inquiry in both 
matters 
the preliminary proceeding is the first of three stages of a 
formal committee investigation and rudman said it could take 
several months to decide whether this stage will be approved 
the hiring of bennett does not suggest in any way that the 
committee has found any indication of wrongdoing or that a 
violation of any rule or law has occurred the two senators said 
in a statement 
all five in the savings and loan case have denied wrongdoing 
sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini dariz john 
glenn dohio john mccain rariz and donald w riegle jr 
dmich so has damato 
after the announcement glenn said it was expected and 
damato commented sure let them do it im not concerned 
cranston said the outside counsel was not necessary but pledged 
his utmost cooperation i am confident the outside counsel 
will concur with our view that my conduct was entirely proper 
cranston added 
the five senators who met with regulators did so while banking 
investigators were examining the collapsing irvine calif savings 
institution in 1987 the chairman of the thrift charles h keating 
jr gave 13 million to the senators campaigns or their 
political causes in the mid1980s 
riegle deconcini and glenn also issued fresh declarations of 
innocence during the day 
the five men are among the most powerful in the senate with 
cranston the no 2 democrat and riegle and glenn holding committee 
chairmanships 
glenn told reporters he never discussed any deals for keating 
when participating in discussions with the federal home loan bank 
board about lincoln 
i do not recall that there was any deal whatsoever that was 
ever made i was not party to any deal did not agree to any 
deal said glenn chairman of the senate governmental affairs 
committee 
deconcini said im prepared and well cooperate with the 
independent counsel if thats the decision of the committee it 
would be very positive to bring out all the facts related to the 
charge 
i hope the independent counsel will expedite it or rapidly 
bring it to conclusion deconcini said 
riegle the senate banking committee chairman commented i 
strongly support whatever level of inquiry the senate ethics 
committee feels is appropriate their review will show my conduct 
in this matter to have been ethical and proper at all times

the senate late friday got cold feet and 
backed away from a congressional pay raise of more than 30000 
passing instead an increase of only 8900 for itself 
the house which would still get the bigger pay boost then 
shipped the bill approved by voice vote early today to president 
bush for his expected signature 
the senate approved its plan 5643 only hours after it seemed to 
be ready to accept the housepassed package the senate left in 
place the raises of more than 35 percent for the house federal 
judges and top government executives 
i believe it to be an unwise decision for the senate said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine not o adopt the 
full pay raise and accompanying ban on speech honoraria in the 
house plan 
when it became apparent he didnt have the votes mitchell 
proposed as a fallback that the senate take a raise of only 99 
percent or about 8900 for itself billed as a costofliving 
adjustment both chambers now make 89500 a year 
with the smaller raise the house bills key ethics provision 
elimination of speech honoraria in 1991 would take place more 
slowly for the senate 
the senate decision would mean different salaries for the senate 
and house with the senate earning more at first and the house 
passing it later 
that would be unusual but not unprecedented from dec 21 1982 
to july 1 1983 the senate was paid 60662 and the house 69800 
the final senate action came only short while after the senate 
by a vote of 6534 had killed a move by sen jesse helms rnc 
strip the pay raise provisions from the bill as passed by the house 
the house approved a bill thursday under which congressional pay 
should soar from the current 89500 to at least 120800 and 
probably closer to 125000 by jan 1 1991 an initial 
costofliving raise of only 79 percent was in that version 
mitchell and republican leader bob dole of kansas argued through 
the day for the senate to take the full raise 
if the voters in our states look at what we do if we work 
hard have a complete disclosure of our assets our speaking fees 
then they can make the final judgment dole said 
the need for congress to come to grips with the ethics issue 
is evident public opinion demands it said mitchell 
helms argued that the bill was being rammed through the 
public wont accept the argument that ethics can be reformed only 
if members get more pay he said 
mr joe lunchbucket is going to stand there and thumb his nose 
at any congressman who says that he said 
even as they were announcing their intentions on friday 
afternoon to follow the house example senate leaders were still 
drafting their version of the legislation 
with president bushs support the house voted 252174 on 
thursday to raise its pay and that of other top government 
officials for the first time since early 1987 
their pay would increase at least 35 percent in less than 14 
months if rankandfile civil servants receive a costofliving 
adjustment for fiscal 1991 as they usually do that would be added 
and the total raise would be more like 40 percent 
with the higher pay lawmakers would be barred beginning in 
1991 from earning extra income by making speeches before interest 
groups other outside earned income generally would be limited to 
15 percent of their salaries and public disclosure would be 
increased 
the senate amended the ethics portion of the house plan to 
restrict postemployment lobbying by lawmakers and the presidents 
top aides 
no lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch would be allowed 
for one year cabinetlevel officials at the white house would also 
face a similar ban on lobbying in their branch of government 
according to the provisions drafted by sens carl levin dmich 
and warren rudman rnh 
dole said the revolving door provision was especially 
important and that senators should accept the plan even though the 
ban on speech fees would for many make a cut in their income 
senators are now allowed to add to their earnings by 40 percent 
with speaking fees 
this isnt really a pay raise its sort of a transfer 
he said instead of coming from the private sector from 
honoraria its going to be coming from the treasury 
sen gordon humphrey rnh a leader of the successful fight 
against a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise early this 
year said eliminating the tawdry system of interestgroup 
honoraria won his support for the new plan 
in addition to banning honoraria the legislation would put new 
restrictions on gifts and free travel lawmakers can accept from 
people outside of family 
the legislation also would end in 1993 the ability of house 
members elected before 1980 to upon retirement transfer for 
personal use the balance of their campaign treasuries

a 31000plus pay raise for the house but 
only 8900 for the senate is on its way to president bushs desk 
after careening through congress in just two days 
the senate voted 5643 friday night to approve the bill but 
only after deciding at the last minute that it couldnt take the 
poltical risk of the bigger housepassed pay raise instead 
senators would keep taking honoraria from interest groups a 
muchcriticized practice eliminated by the house 
we have done exactly the wrong thing tonight we have 
failed said sen tim wirth dcolo 
but the senate didnt cut back the raise that applies to the 
house federal judges and top government executives and the house 
early today gave the measure final approval and shipped the package 
to the president the house gave its approval in a voice vote at 
nearly 130 am with whistling and cheers in the chamber 
bush has said he would sign the bill which includes a series of 
reforms of congressional and governmentwide ethics rules 
for the house and the other top officials salaries would rise 
from the current 89500 to 96600 by jan 1 and to at least 
120800 and probably closer to 125000 a year later depending on 
governmentwide cost of living adjustments at that time 
in 1991 when a 25 percent pay boost making up the bulk of the 
increase takes effect the practice of house members accepting 
speaking fees for appearances before interest groups will end and 
congress other outside earnings will be limited 
the senate opted for taking a 99 percent raise on jan 1 to 
98400 and gradually reducing the amount of honoraria its members 
can keep currently they can keep speaking fees up to 40 percent 
of their salaries 
the senate decision meant different salary scales for the senate 
and house with the senate earning more at first and the house 
passing it later 
that would be unusual but not unprecedented from dec 21 1982 
to july 1 1983 the senate was paid 60662 and the house 69800 
besides the payhonoraria issue the legislation contains a 
broad range of changes in ethics rules 
no lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch would be allowed 
for one year cabinetlevel officials at the white house also would 
face a similar ban on lobbying in their branch of government 
in addition to banning honoraria the legislation would put new 
restrictions on gifts and free travel lawmakers and other 
government officials can accept from people outside their immediate 
family 
the legislation also would end in 1993 the ability of house 
members elected before 1980 to upon retirement transfer the 
balance of their campaign treasuries for personal use

the senate early saturday gave final approval 
to a threeyear authorization bill calling for up to 938 million 
in us aid to poland and hungary 
actual aid to poland and hungary still faces hurdles however 
an appropriations measure providing 533 million in hard cash 
for the two east european nations this year is awaiting action on 
the senate floor 
but the bill faces a veto threat from president bush because of 
unrelated provisions dealing with abortion 
the authorization bill which sets spending ceilings and policy 
guidelines for the aid program hit a snag thursday night when 
republican senators complained that democratic staff members had 
removed provisions intended to provide safeguards that the aid 
program not benefit communist causes and client states 
on friday a formal conference of house and senate members dealt 
with the problem dropping some proposals and accepting or 
modifying others the house approved the revised version friday 
night 
the senate approved the legislation by voice vote early saturday 
morning 
quick action on the aid authorization to help poland deal with 
its serious economic problems was urgently requested wednesday by 
solidarity union leader lech walesa as he addressed a joint meeting 
of congress 
the assistance includes programs for poland with a value of 
8465 million hungary would receive benefits with a total value 
of 915 million 
during the conference negotiators refused to accept an 
amendment offered by sen john danforth rmo extending the 
efective life of 12 unrelated domestic tax credits including the 
lowincome housing tax credit 
the conference also softened the impact of amendments offered by 
gop senators some of which sought the outright termination of the 
aid program if funds were diverted 
it accepted language stating that the program could be ended if 
the country involved was found to be engaged in international 
activities directly and fundamentally contrary to us national 
security interests 
but it rejected an attempt to cut off aid if poland or hungary 
were found to be providing weapons or military training or other 
military aid to cuba or nicaragua instead it required the bush 
administration to report in six months on the extent if any of 
such activities 
house democrats contended that the provision was too extreme 
and subject to exploitation by enemies of reform 
they said it would require ending all us aid if cuba received 
just one rifle or if just one nicaraguan policeman were trained 
the conference dropped entirely an unrelated amendment by sen 
jesse helms rnc dealing with the potential sale of chinese 
missiles to middle eastern nations 
in its current form the bill includes a 200 million standby 
trade credit insurance program for poland added earlier by the 
house 
the centerpiece of the bill is the authorization of a 240 
million free enterprise fund to bolster freemarket reform in 
poland and a 200 million fund to help poland stabilize its 
inflationbattered economy

the director of a new museum hopes to 
preserve traces of jewish culture in the south which bloomed in 
the 19th century but has been slowly diminished by emigration to 
northern cities and assimilation 
hundreds of thousands of german and other european jews arrived 
in the rural south in the mid to late19th century and even after 
world war ii but these small jewish populations never had the 
resilience of northern communities 
throughout the development of the south there was definitely a 
jewish presence and that jewish presence faded and settled into the 
big cities our story is the same as the rest of rural america 
this is the story of smalltown america said macy hart director 
of the museum of the southern jewish experience 
exact figures are difficult to come by but in 1987 28 of the 
42 jewish congregations in four deep south states had fewer than 
100 families hart said twentythree had no permanent rabbi many 
of them relied on rabbisintraining sent by jewish congregations 
from the north 
the museum dedicated oct 15 on the site of a former summer 
camp about 35 miles southwest of jackson will be key in linking 
21st century jews to the first years of their ancestors in america 
said jacob rader marcus the 94yearold director of the american 
jewish archives in cincinnati 
marcus a professor of american jewish history at hebrew union 
college said he doesnt know of any other museum focusing on the 
history of jewish people in a particular region 
this will encourage jews to continue their faith jews are 
very much concerned about that because theyre assimilating and the 
culture is disappearing said marcus 
jews were a major presence in the south in the 19th century 
many jews fought in the confederate army but they never amounted 
to more than 1 percent of the population in the south and their 
numbers have shrunk this century hart said 
when the children of southern jews left for jobs in the cities 
the older generation became caretakers of priceless religious as 
well as family keepsakes 
as congregations dwindled and synagogues closed they lacked 
heirs for the handcopied torahs the delicately carved arks which 
held the written law the oil lamps of eternal light and the 
historyengraved cornerstones of the synagogues themselves 
many items were discarded but the devout continued to cling to 
their heritage though the artifacts were often hidden in trunks 
or boxes stashed in attics or under beds hart said 
its pretty heavy to have a whole culture on your shoulders 
and you dont know what to do with it he said 
eventually the various artifacts were being donated to the 
henry s jacobs camp for living judaism a summer camp near utica 
established in 1970 for jews from louisiana alabama mississippi 
tennessee georgia and arkansas 
camp directors didnt know what to do with the old pieces and 
originally thought of them only as a means of furnishing a 
synagogue at the camp hart said 
later they decided that only a fullfledged museum would be 
worthy of the artifacts many predating the civil war in 1986 the 
plough foundation established by a wealthy jewish family in 
memphis tenn gave the camp 500000 to build the museum 
along with the religious items the museum has three historical 
photographic exhibits including one that portrays past and present 
jewish life in the south 
hart said he is trying to raise 5 million within five years to 
prepare further museum displays and aid southern jewish 
genealogical efforts restore cemeteries and provide educational 
programs on jewish culture 
planning for the museum has spurred a movement nationwide hart 
said the union of american hebrew congregations recently formed a 
committee to look into means of preserving rural jewish history 
were all racing against the clock he said but this will 
be a model for others

defense secretary richard cheney aiming to 
take advantage of developments in the eastern bloc says hell 
propose cutting defense budgets over the next six years the 
washington post reports today 
cheney was quoted as saying the cuts will be significant 
although he did not say how much money would be trimmed 
the defense secretary has previously warned against overreacting 
to changes in the soviet union and its eastern european allies 
but in the post interview he said while you need to be 
concerned about possible reversal of trends in the soviet union 
theres a real sense that you want to take advantage of these 
developments 
unidentified officials were quoted as saying the reduction for 
the 1991 fiscal year beginning next oct 1 would be about 10 
billion close to a cut of 35 percent from the 286 billion in 
spending expected in the current fiscal year 
the state department has said it believes the soviet union is 
reducing its military expenditures 
the new york times said in todays editions that the pentagons 
comptroller had instructed the armed services to slice 180 billion 
out of their fiveyear spending plans the cuts to come from the 
19921994 fiscal years 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said he could not confirm that 
figure 
cheney said he will agree to trimming military expenses to meet 
requirements for reducing the federal budget deficit and that some 
pentagon programs will feel the knife in the years to come 
there is no way im going to do what i have to do without 
force structure reductions weapons cancellations contract 
terminations and base closings cheney said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee questioned about the reports early today said he was 
aware cheneys order was out to the services to find ways to 
cut back over a fiveyear period 
nunn said he could not confirm the 180 billion figure but 
noted that in comments he has made recently zero percent growth 
would amount to about 140 billion

a wave of executions of drug dealers and 
traffickers in iran may be a cover for political killings a un 
human rights investigator reported 
his report released friday indicates iranian authorities have 
not eased the crackdown on dissent or improved the human rights 
picture since the death in june of supreme leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
the report by reynaldo galindo pohl a special representative of 
the un commission on human rights said iran was violating human 
rights accords in carrying out the executions 
from various sources it has been possible to draw up a list 
of some 1700 individuals possibly executed either for ordinary 
offenses or for political offenses said galindo pohl a 
salvadoran 
the iranian press has reported few political executions so far 
in 1989 however many allegations have been received that the 
large number of executions for drug trafficking masks political 
executions he wrote 
he also cited reports that some political executions have taken 
place in secret 
he said political executions have occurred in recent months 
according to his information 
illtreatment and torture both physical and psychological 
were continuing in iranian prisons he said in the report 
according to the reports it would seem that during the 
months of the current year psychological torture has been 
prevailing over physical torture with the aim of avoiding visible 
marks he said 
galindo pohl was not allowed into iran he based his report on 
official iranian statements news reports and testimony from 
refugees and opposition activists 
he asked iran to consider suppressing ill treatment and 
torture during both investigation and imprisonment 
according to galindo pohl punishments included whipping the 
soles of the feet with cables or barbed wire sexual abuse mock 
executions burning with cigarettes or hot metal rods and 
confinement en masse in small closed rooms with high temperatures 
and insufficient oxygen 
iran contends that claims of executions stem from opposition 
groups such as the peoples mujahedeen of iran which it calls a 
terrorist organization that assassinates people within iran 
the peoples mujahedeen of iran based in baghdad and with an 
office in washington has a military operation that attacks the 
iranian army it also admits assassinating iranian officials 
members of the bahai faith who testified before galindo pohl 
described persecution and harassment to themselves and their 
families such as denial of jobs and professional education and 
confiscation of property solely on religious grounds said his 
report 
irans religious leaders contend the bahai faith a modern faith 
originating in iran is a heretic cult

gov robert p casey signed the nations 
toughest abortion controls into law despite warnings from 
abortionrights advocates that it could cost him reelection 
when the bill signed friday takes effect in 60 days women in 
the state will be banned from obtaining abortions after the 24th 
week of pregnancy in most cases and will have to inform their 
husbands if they plan an abortion 
pennsylvania is the first state to take advantage of a us 
supreme court ruling in july that gave states more leeway to make 
their own abortion laws 
casey a democrat said he was aware abortionrights activists 
would campaign heavily on the issue next year when he is expected 
to seek reelection and could face a republican who supports a 
womans right to have an abortion 
i hope that no one makes it a singleissue campaign i 
certainly dont plan to run a singleissue campaign casey said 
he said the provisions of the law are appropriate and 
reasonable given the enormity of the decision any woman faces when 
she considers having an abortion the overwhelming votes in the 
state house and senate convince me that the vast majority of our 
people will agree 
the abortion measure passed the house 14358 last month the 
senate approved the bill 3317 on tuesday 
it gives a tremendous shot in the arm to the national prolife 
movement said state rep stephen freind the republican who led 
the antiabortion fight in the legislature 
jenny daughtry executive director of the national abortion 
rights league chapter in pennsylvania said the bill was cruel 
and demeaning and a direct attack on womens constitutional 
rights 
governor caseys signature on this bill is an affront to the 
health welfare and interest of all pennsylvanians pennsylvanians 
will express their outrage over this attack on their rights at the 
voting booth next november she said 
in a statement auditor general barbara hafer the frontrunner 
for the republican nomination said she would have vetoed the bill 
i believe that the bill does not reflect the will of the 
majority of pennsylvanians or in fact of americans hafer said 
howard fetterhoff executive director of the pennsylvania 
catholic conference said caseys action demonstrated his 
lifelong commitment to what he believes that innocent human life 
and in this case the unborn are worthy of protection 
the new law also prohibits abortions based on the fetus sex 
regulates the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses and 
mandates women wait 24 hours to get an abortion doctors will have 
to inform women about the procedure before performing an abortion 
and explain risks and alternatives 
the law also carries stiff penalties for doctors that violate 
the regulations a conviction under the sexselection ban or 
24week provision could result in up to seven years in prison and 
15000 in fines

negotiators from the house and senate are 
calling for repeal of catastrophic health coverage for retirees and 
nearing agreement on a compromise deficitreduction package 
final action on those two bills which could come sunday would 
free congress to adjourn for the year 
senior taxwriters in both houses agreed early today to kill the 
catastrophic program which was enacted with great fanfare less 
than 18 months ago in an effort to protect retirees from being 
bankrupted by costs of a major illness 
but two republican senators who had wanted to scale back the 
program said they will work to defeat the repeal agreement sen 
john mccain rariz promised to use every parliamentary tactic 
available in an effort to prevent repeal which he said would be an 
incredible injustice 
republican leader bob dole of kansas agreed with mccain that 
repeal should be blocked that means the senate could be facing a 
filibuster against repeal just as it tries to shut down for the 
year 
repeal would leave many of the 32 million retirees with no 
protection against catastrophic bills for hospital stays skilled 
nursing care prescription drugs and doctors fees 
the senate finance committee approved a compromise 
deficitreduction plan worked out on friday by its chairman sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas and the chairman of the house ways and 
means committee rep dan rostenkowski dill the plan still was 
subject to final approval by the ways and means committee before 
being put to a vote in the house and senate on sunday 
the committees were unable to estimate immediately how much the 
package would reduce the deficit the tax committees portion of 
the plan includes several minor tax increases and targeted cuts in 
medicare reimbursements to doctors and hospitals 
the tax increase affecting the greatest number of people would 
extend permanently the 3 percent tax on local and longdistance 
telephone service which is due to expire at the end of 1990 
even while democratic leaders were working out a package of 
deficit cuts gop lawmakers pronounced the democratic effort 
inadequate 
they appear to be short of the savings president bush is 
insisting on sen bob packwood of oregon ranking republican on 
the senate finance committee said of the democratic package bush 
has threatened to veto any bill that falls short of cutting 14 
billion from this years government shortfall 
the democratic leaders were aiming to slice at least 12 billion 
from the federal budget deficit 
it seemed all but certain that in addition to the 
deficitreduction bill additional savings would come from allowing 
the grammrudman laws constraints on federal spending to remain in 
effect for at least two months 
because congress and president bush have been unable to agree to 
a budgetcutting package the grammrudman law since oct 1 has 
trimmed about 5 percent from most domestic programs and about 4 
percent from defense spending 
lawmakers are virtually certain to allow the grammrudman cuts 
that have already been made to stand and perhaps to extend them to 
about jan 1 but legislators planned to halt any further 
reductions under the law 
leaving the cuts in effect saves the government roughly 1 
billion per month 
the senate passed a bill claiming 14 billion in savings on oct 
13 eight days after the house approved an 11 billion version of 
the measure but the house bill was loaded with unrelated 
provisions such as changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
a large portion of the negotiations between the two houses have 
been over how to deal with the extraneous house provisions 
bush has threatened to veto any deficitcutting bill that relies 
on phony savings gimmicks although lawmakers say they believe they 
can fashion a bill he would sign 
some artifices are expected to remain in the measure anyway 
such as a claimed savings of 17 billion by not counting money 
lost by the postal service in the governments budget calculations 
the bush administration says it expects the deficit for the 1990 
fiscal year which began oct 1 to reach 116 billion 
congressional experts have put the figure closer to 141 billion

the san franciscooakland bay bridge its 
earthquake ruptured section repaired and sporting new silver 
paint was reopened friday night in a din of blaring horns and 
cheers 
six california highway patrol cruisers sirens whining and 13 
private tow trucks yellow lights flashing led a parade on a 35 
mph 10minute trip across the upper deck to san francisco 
five american red cross vehicles followed the tow trucks across 
the bridge westbound motorists were kept a mile back from the 
bridge on nearby freeways until after the official opening it was 
the first traffic on the span since 71magnitude quake struck 
northern california on oct 17 killing 66 people most of them on 
a freeway that collapsed in oakland 
but the true test for the 85mile bay bridge the longest 
highlevel span in the world will come monday when thousands of 
commuters are expected to return to the vital artery the bridge 
carried more than 260000 vehicles every weekday before the quake 
sent a 250ton piece of the upper deck smashing onto the lower 
deck killing one driver 
transportation officials warned that gridlock will result if too 
many commuters abandon mass transit on monday because several key 
approaches to the bridge remain closed on either side of the bay 
we had a traffic problem here even before the quake said 
bob halligan spokesman for the state department of transportation 
now people will have to decide if they want to sit in their cars 
for hours on the bay bridge or do they want to get to work 
halligan said highway patrol vehicles would lead motorists 
across at the reopening to restrain any drivers who might be 
tempted to set a speed record over the empty bridge 
the quake forced thousands of commuters to switch to alternative 
means of transit or take a longer route across the bay by using 
four other main toll bridges in the area 
a fleet of 20 ferry boats was amassed during the crisis 
recalling the days when even bigger ferries were common sights on 
the bay 
terry koenig marketing manager of red amp white fleet said his 
company and blue amp gold the other ferry operator have been 
averaging about 15000 riders a day the operators have enough 
money from a 2 million emergency grant from the state to maintain 
increased service through jan 15 
ridership also skyrocketed on the bay area rapid transit system 
which has a line running under the bay on wednesday bart carried 
355131 people besting the previous record of 352696 set nov 3 
one motorist who opted for bart bob eberle of emeryville said 
he plans to go back to his car 
there was too much wait he said as he emerged from a subway 
station in san francisco on friday with my car i can get right 
on the bridge eberle also complained there wasnt enough parking 
space at the bart station in his neighborhood 
but the transit system was a winner as far as stanley collis was 
concerned im going to stick with bart said collis who works 
at the state building in san francisco its cheaper than finding 
a parking space and i get a chance to read or sleep 
the gridlock warnings werent the first since the quake 
san francisco mayor art agnos warned the largest traffic jams 
in the history of the area would develop on oct 23 the first 
fullblown rush hour to follow the devastating earthquake 
the traffic jams didnt happen despite heavy rain and wind 
gusts over 50 mph officials said many people got up early for work 
and helped spread out the rush hour

vietnam says it may hold up settlement of 
vietnam warrelated humanitarian issues if us property claims are 
paid from frozen assets of the fallen saigon government members of 
congress are being told 
the main humanitarian issues involve efforts to account for us 
servicemen still missing after the war and emigration permission 
for tens of thousands of people stranded after the fall of saigon 
in 1975 they include vietnamese people who worked for americans 
during the war or their close relatives and amerasian children 
fathered by american servicemen 
hanoi authorities have given very clear indication that it 
would impede progress on such humanitarian matters if the united 
states settled citizen claims against vietnam using more than 200 
million in blocked us accounts of the former south vietnam 
government deputy assistant secretary of state david f lambertson 
told a house panel on friday 
state and treasury department officials strongly opposed pending 
legislation to seize the frozen funds to pay 192 american 
claimants the us foreign claims settlement commission ruled in 
1986 that they were entitled to eventual reimbursement for 99 
million worth of property lost during the fall of saigon plus 6 
percent annual interest 
the claims include corporate assets personal effects and unsold 
farmland left behind by us government employees and civilians who 
heeded superiors pleas to stay on until it was too late for 
orderly departure said the claimants lawyer roderick m hills 
rr newcomb treasury director of foreign assets control said 
seizing the blocked assets unilaterally was a drastic step that 
would undermine the us position that foreign property whether 
us property abroad or foreign property in the us cannot be 
taken without compensation 
paying the private claims now could also jeopardize future 
settlement of us government claims against the saigon accounts 
he added 
hanois position is that claims are matters for negotiation not 
unilateral decision lambertson told the asian and pacific affairs 
subcommittee hearing 
but the us cannot now negotiate he explained under its 
policy of holding up normalization with vietnam until hanoi 
cooperates in a comprehensive solution of the cambodian question 
american interests are strongly involved in the pending 
humanitarian issues said the state departments chief of refugee 
programs assistant secretary robert l funseth

two new accidents including a fire aboard a 
nuclearpowered submarine were reported on the last day of the 
navys servicewide safety review that was ordered after a rash of 
mishaps 
the fire aboard the submarine uss finback broke out in 
insulation around an engine on the attack submarine forcing the 
vessel to cut short sea trials lt cmdr bill sonntag of the 
submarine atlantic forces said friday 
the fire which broke out wednesday was quickly extinguished 
without danger of a nuclear accident and without injuries he said 
the norfolkbased finback returned to port thursday to repair 
the insulation and the submarines crew participated in the safety 
review sonntag said 
in the second accident which occurred friday mechanical 
problems forced a ta4j training jet to ditch in the gulf of mexico 
south of pensacola fla a navy spokesman said the two pilots 
ejected safely 
the standdown halting all normal operations and training was 
ordered tuesday by navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii and adm 
carlisle ah trost chief of naval operations after a threeweek 
string of accidents 
never in the history of the modern navy have so many mishaps 
happened at one time said capt ferguson norton commander of 
the naval safety center at the norfolk naval station and the navys 
top safety officer 
but norton said the accidents werent related 
since oct 29 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at 
least 71 injured in accidents ranging from men washed overboard to 
plane crashes ship fires and the accidental bombing of a cruiser 
trost ordered all navy units to hold the 48 hours of safety 
review sometime over a 72hour period beginning tuesday the last 
reviews concluded friday 
trost ordered commanders to report findings from the safety 
review to him navy spokesmen had no details on what the reports 
contained 
navy officials said the standdown wasnt ordered because the 
service was operating in an unsafe manner but because garrett and 
trost wanted to ensure that everything that could be done was being 
done to protect servicemen 
despite the recent crop of mishaps 1989 is the services safest 
year on record so far with 69 major accidents reported according 
to the navy in 1984 118 major accidents were reported every year 
since then the numbers have declined 
the navy defines a major accident as one that causes a fatality 
or 1 million or more in damage 
where 1989 varies from the previous five years is in fatalities 
there have been 102 this year including the 47 sailors killed in 
the april 19 gun turret explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa 
in 1984 64 people died in accidents

senate leaders are sending the nomination of 
james cason for a top natural resources job back to president bush 
and asking him to select someone else 
the action taken friday marked the first time since the vote 
against john tower for defense secretary earlier this year that a 
nomination was turned back when it reached the senate floor 
it will mark the first time that any assistant secretary 
nominee would be defeated after being reported out of committee 
with a favorable recommendation said republican leader bob dole 
of kansas 
cason a highranking official at the interior department since 
1982 was nominated to be assistant secretary of agriculture for 
natural resources and soil conservation 
after two days of hearings the agriculture committee voted 127 
to send the nomination to the senate floor despite vocal 
opposition from committee chairman sen patrick leahy dvt and 
some other committee members 
environmentalists opposed cason because they said he showed a 
preference at interior for private development over environmental 
concerns 
dole called the mounting opposition a campaign of distortion 
has successfully poisoned the debate but after conferring with 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and the white house he 
requested that the senate not act on the nomination 
leahy said friday that if a vote had been taken cason would 
have been rejected by a 20vote margin

a federal appeals court has cleared the way 
for restoration of rules designed to prevent cable tv systems from 
showing syndicated programs that local tv stations also might be 
showing 
the unanimous ruling friday by a threejudge panel of the us 
circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia could mean 
that tv viewers will get fewer chances to view some of their 
favorite syndicated shows starting jan 1 
syndicated shows are those not controlled by a network but made 
available by their producers to stations independently frequently 
they are reruns of previous network hits 
the court upheld a 1988 decision by the federal communications 
commission to reinstate its socalled syndicated exclusivity rules 
that the agency had lifted in 1980 to help boost the cable tv 
industry 
the rules allow local overtheair stations to contract with 
program suppliers for the exclusive rights in their broadcast areas 
broadcasters claim program duplication reduces their audiences 
and their advertising revenues while giving broadcasters less 
incentive to develop syndicated programming 
the appeals court denied challenges to the rules from cable 
companies and industry organizations that claimed they were 
arbitrary and violated federal law and cable operators first 
amendment rights

the air force is defending its purchase of 173 
custommade facsimile machines under contracts that amount to 73 
million contending they are designed to withstand conditions of 
battlefield duty 
this isnt just a normal fax that sits in your office and does 
its thing air force spokesman maj lou figueroa said friday 
these are not machines made to sit in a wing commanders office 
they are designed to be deployed off a dirt runway 
the service was inundated with queries about the machines after 
a published report said they cost 421000 apiece a figure 
computed by dividing the 73 million cost by 173 
figueroa disputed the figure however saying the service was 
paying 76000 for each unit 
he said the machines were being purchased from litton industries 
under a contract for 33 million and that an additional contract 
for some 40 million covers a very extensive list of diagnostic 
equipment laser assemblies and other items such as power 
supplies training for use of the units and the paper which 
costs 100 a roll

gunmen today massacred a moslem 
militiaman and four relatives a day before southern filipinos vote 
on a regional autonomy plan offered in response to moslem demands 
police said 
elsewhere on southern mindanao island two bombs exploded there 
were no reports of injury 
voters in 13 southern provinces and nine cities decide sunday 
whether to join a regional autonomous government for the southern 
philippines 
president corazon aquino had made the offer to placate demands 
for selfrule by an estimated 4 million moslems 
moslems who have waged a nearly 20yearold insurgency have 
rejected the plan as inadequate 
col jesus almadin police area commander said the massacre 
took place shortly after midnight in a village on the outskirts of 
zamboanga a port city about 540 miles south of manila 
almadin said 15 unidentified men sprayed automatic weapon fire 
and exploded several grenades in the house of a moslem militiaman 
killing him his wife two sons and a daughterinlaw 
the militiamans 9yearold son was critically wounded and two 
other relatives escaped unhurt almadin added 
the assailants set the house on fire before escaping he said 
i think this massacre may aggravate the situation almadin 
said the christians could be blamed and the moslems could 
retaliate 
ustadz jain jali spokesman of the moslem moro national 
liberation front said the incident was perpetrated by christian 
militiamen who killed the moslem militiaman because of an old 
family feud 
it seems that they the killers were taking advantage of the 
tension in the area jali said referring to violent incidents 
linked to the plebiscite 
almadin also said a small incendiary bomb exploded just outside 
zamboangas airport in lanao del sur province a bomb exploded in 
the provincial capitol building in marawi city destroying election 
materials there were no reports of casualties police said 
marawi is about 175 miles northeast of zamboanga and 510 miles 
southeast of manila the nations capital 
on friday 50000 military and police were placed on full alert 
in wide areas of mindanao because of fear the rebels might escalate 
attacks as the plebiscite nears 
many christian voters are expected to reject the autonomy plan 
and moslems form a majority in only five impoverished and 
geographically separated provinces only 28 percent of the 39 
million registered voters are moslem election records show 
on thursday mrs aquino urged people to take part in the 
referendum but did not specifically ask them to endorse her plan 
mrs aquino forged a ceasefire with the moslem rebels in 1986 
peace talks collapsed in may 1987 but the ceasefire generally has 
held 
before the moslem rebellion peaked in the mid1970s an 
estimated 50000 people were killed and thousands more fled to the 
nearby malaysian state of sabah

hopes for an end to a bitter 14weekold phone 
strike were dashed today when nynex corp broke off negotiations 
with one of two striking unions saying the workers had reneged on 
an earlier agreement 
no further talks were scheduled with the communications workers 
of america said john bonomo spokesman for nynex which serves 
105 million customers in new york and new england 
the cwa represents 40000 workers at new york telephone the 
subsidiary of nynex that serves new york state another 20000 
workers represented by the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers work for new england telephone the other nynex subsidiary 
in boston negotiators for ibew and new england telephone said 
they had reached tentative agreement on local issues just before a 
midnight deadline friday night officials of both sides said ibew 
members would vote sunday on that proposed agreement 
it was unclear if the cwa and ibew could settle independently of 
each other 
bonomo said one of the stumbling blocks in reaching a settlement 
with the cwa was health care for retired workers an issue nynex 
said had been resolved in a tentative settlement reached monday at 
that time the company said it would pay all health benefits if the 
unions gave up annual lumpsum bonuses and a profitsharing plan 
cwa spokesman bob masters said the talks broke down friday 
because of the companys insistence that the tentative agreement be

ethiopia will provide israel with naval 
facilities in the red sea as part of the deal that led to 
diplomatic relations between the two nations a sudanese government 
newspaper reported 
the newspaper alengaz alwatani also said friday the deal 
allows 22000 ethiopian jews to leave for israel and pledges 
israeli military experts to help ethiopias marxist government put 
down secession movements in the north 
however other reports say there are no more than 18000 jews 
left in ethiopia 
ethiopia two weeks ago restored diplomatic relations with israel 
after severing them over the 1973 middle east war 
the khartoum daily quoted diplomatic sources for its report but 
gave no names ethiopia supports rebels in southern sudan and has 
been on bad terms with the sudanese government for years 
there was no immediate comment from the israeli government 
the new york times has reported that israeli military advisers 
are at an ethiopian air force base it said ethiopia turned to the 
israelis for help against rebels in eritrea and tigre provinces 
after its main supplier the soviet union demanded national 
reconciliation 
alengaz alwatani said its diplomatic sources reported that the 
soviet government gave ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam 
the goahead to resume relations with israel 
the paper said resumption of relations amounted to an exchange 
of israeli military help for the jews called falashas and naval 
facilities but it gave no specifics of military help israel will 
give under the purported deal 
it said the military and maritime facilities are to be on 
the islands of sali and khaja in the bab almandab the southern 
mouth of the red sea the report did not say what sort of 
facilities would be included or whether they would constitute 
fullscale bases 
in the 1973 war egypt and south yemen sealed the area to 
israeli ships in an attempt to neutralize israels control of the 
strait of tiran at the tip of the sinai peninsula 
the figure of 22000 ethiopian jews to go to israel clashes with 
other estimates of the number left after a controversial 
ussponsored airlift spirited out around 8000 falashas in 
november 1984january 1985 
israels public council for ethiopian jews estimates that only 
18000 remain and the ethiopian government sets the figure at 
16000 
the mid1980s operation which incensed arab governments who 
charged that it helped their enemy israel went via airstrips in 
sudan 
the day after israeliethiopian ties were restored israels 
foreign minister moshe arens said the move would facilitate the 
ability to deal directly with the government of ethiopia to bring 
out the remainder of ethiopian jewry to israel

a third of this capitals 1 
million people were reportedly trapped without food and water after 
a week of fighting between leftist rebels and government troops 
journalists in the eastern provincial capital of san miguel 
reported heavy fighting in that city and on a nearby bridge friday 
night they had no estimates of deaths or injuries in the city 85 
miles east of the capital 
hospital and military sources say more than 800 people have been 
killed and and 2000 wounded since the marxistled rebels launched 
the offensive against the rightist government on nov 11 
there was a lull in the fighting in san salvador on friday night 
and early today with only occasional bursts of gunfire however 
the capital has suffered the worst fighting of the 10yearold 
civil war over the past week 
chavez mena of the centerleft christian democratic party said 
300000 people nearly a third of the capitals population have 
been cut off from food and water and were pinned down in homes or 
shelters by the fierce fighting 
six jesuit priests and two others killed along with them at a 
roman catholic university were to be buried today after 
international forensic experts examine the bodies 
university officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms 
enter the slain priests residence just before the shooting began 
thursday however the usbacked rightwing government denounced 
the killings and said it would investigate 
the murders were widely condemned in el salvador and abroad and 
the us ambassador offered protection to witnesses who come 
forward 
dozens of religious workers labor activists academics and 
political figures went into hiding after the slaughter of the 
priests and the arrests thursday of 12 lutheran missionary workers 
the lutherans including four americans were released unharmed 
friday the us embassy said 
union halls and a human rights office were broken into and 
rightwing graffiti scrawled on the walls friday and a roman 
catholic official said a rightwing supporter with a loudspeaker 
yelled threats outside the residence of monsignor arturo rivera 
damas the archbishop of san salvador 
we have the justified fear that the assassinations are the 
beginning of a series of actions against unions labor groups and 
politicians said fidel chavez mena secretarygeneral of the 
opposition christian democratic party 
mena whose centrist party governed the nation until its defeat 
by president alfredo cristiani this year blamed the ultraright 
for the killings 
whether they were part of the military or not we dont 
know he said 
rivera damas said at a friday news conference that the farabundo 
marti national liberation front rebels accepted his call for a 
ceasefire but that the government has only said it would study the 
proposal 
cristiani said in a television broadcast friday night that the 
fighting has been totally controlled in northern parts of the 
capital and that only a few small centers of conflict remained 
in san salvadors eastern neighborhoods 
the northern meijicanos neighborhood was the scene of the only 
heavy fighting in the capital area friday during that battle a 
british journalist 44yearold david blundy of the newspaper the 
sunday correspondent was fatally shot by a sniper 
the shootings thursday of ignacio ellacuria rector of jose 
simeon canas central american university near the capital 
vicerector ignacio martin baro four other jesuit priests their 
housekeeper and her 15yearold daughter drew international 
condemnation 
us ambassador william walker on friday pressured the 
salvadoran government to quickly conduct an investigation and 
launched an inquiry of his own promising protection to witnesses 
he said the killings were a blot on the image of el 
salvadors government that could only be erased by a full 
investigation and punishment of the guilty 
us religious leaders blamed the slayings on rightwing forces 
and called for a cutoff of us aid to the cristiani government 
democratic senators threatened to slash the aid unless cristiani 
ends the violence the government has received 35 billion in aid 
this decade 
in an era of scarce foreign assistance we need to be asking 
what we are achieving for the dollars sent sen john kerry 
dmass told a capitol hill hearing friday 
also friday sen bill bradley dnj said salvadoran national 
guardsmen had detained a new jersey teacher and peace activist in a 
church along with other church workers since thursday night 
in his statement bradley said 53yearold teresa fitzgibbon of 
trenton is part of a lutheran church group providing medical care 
to refugees from the fighting 
jose maria tojeira the head of the jesuit order for central 
america on friday held a memorial mass for the slain priests 
history repeats itself they have not died they are alive 
among the salvadoran people he said 
after the killings most of the faculty at the university of san 
salvador heavily dominated by leftists had withdrawn said 
vicerector herbert barillas without elaboration 
an annual report presented friday at the united nations accused 
el salvadors government of presiding over a resurgence of 
torture this year and a crackdown on labor groups 
cristiani took office june 1 as the winning candidate of the 
rightist republican nationalist alliance founded by roberto 
daubuisson who has been linked to death squads blamed for killing 
tens of thousands in the last decade

the vital san franciscooakland bay 
bridge whose ruptured span symbolized the power of the oct 17 
earthquake reopened to traffic exactly one month after the temblor 
six california highway patrol cruisers sirens whining and 13 
private tow trucks yellow lights flashing led a parade on a 35 
mph 10minute trip across the upper deck to san francisco just 
before midnight friday 
westbound motorists who were kept a mile back from the bridge 
until after it was officially reopened began driving across the 
53yearold structure for the first time since the 71magnitude 
quake struck northern california 
the temblor killed 66 people including one motorist on the 
bridge and caused 7 billion in damages it shook loose a 50foot 
section of the bridge the loss of the bay bridge disrupted the 
lives of residents who had to seek alternative routes to work but 
transportation officials warned the traffic nightmare would 
continue monday because of damaged bridge approaches and other 
highway damage 
commuters who have been using mass transit including crossbay 
ferries and the underground bay area rapid transit system were 
urged to continue to do so 
we had a traffic problem here even before the quake said 
bob halligan a spokesman for the state department of 
transportation now people will have to decide if they want to sit 
in their cars for hours on the bay bridge or do they want to get 
to work 
chp officers led the way during the bridge opening to discourage 
motorists from trying to set speed records on the empty span said 
halligan 
drivers from two san francisco towing companies were invited to 
cross behind the highway patrol as thanks for having towed for free 
dozens of cars that were abandoned on the bridge on the evening of 
the quake

in a bid to ease conflict among 
presbyterians on one of the countrys most divisive issues 
advocates for and against legalized abortion vented their views at 
a national conference 
church members must learn to listen to all perspectives or 
were poorer as a community said carl batzel a pastor from 
susquehanna pa in our denomination there are too many times we 
associate with only those of a like mind 
about 225 representatives from the presbyterian church usa 
gathered friday for the national dialogue on abortion perspectives 
the church officially adopted a stand approving legalized abortion 
in 1983 but each year since then its governing body has been asked 
to reverse the policy 
the church began setting up the conferences in 1987 
during the opening session louise lawson associate pastor of a 
presbyterian church in memphis tenn said while she supports a 
womans right to an abortion it should be used as a last 
resort 
antiabortion advocates say pregnancy and childbearing always 
represent gods will but such a viewpoint does not consider the 
free will of humans lawson said 
dr carolyn gerster of scottsdale ariz who is active in the 
national right to life committee said no issue since slavery has 
divided the nation like abortion 
im a feminist but abortion involves the death of a 
developing human she said abortion is the death of a person 
and thats not a matter of personal morality but of public 
morality 
the conference participants were chosen from regional governing 
bodies of the church called synods from across the country the 
synods were asked to choose a delegation with a diversity of ideas 
about abortion 
the 3 millionmember denomination created a task force on 
problem pregnancies and abortion in 1988 and is working on a policy 
statement on abortion

boeings government liaison office outside 
washington dc has been suspended from signing new contracts 
with the pentagon because employees there obtained secret military 
documents boeing said 
the temporary suspension will last until authorities decide on 
an air force recommendation to ban the office from doing business 
with the military for up to three years boeing said friday 
also friday a federal mediator scheduled negotiations in a 
46day strike by 57000 machinists that has virtually shut down 
production lines at the aerospace giant 
the air force suspension follows boeings guilty plea monday in 
us district court in alexandria va to two felony charges of 
obtaining classified military budget documents the company agreed 
to pay 52 million in fines and restitution 
boeing will argue against the proposed threeyear suspension of 
its 100person office in rosslyn va saying it strengthened 
internal controls after a federal investigation in 1986 according 
to spokesman paul binder 
the case against boeing involved classified documents obtained 
between 1979 and 1985 by richard lee fowler a senior marketing 
analyst who was fired in 1986 fowler is awaiting trial next month 
on 39 counts of conspiracy and unauthorized conveyance 
some of the documents involved studies of the strategic defense 
initiative the proposed missile defense system known popularly as 
star wars 
the suspension of just one boeing office may mean the air force 
doesnt want to seriously impair boeings military business said 
retired rear adm eugene j carroll of the center for defense 
information in washington dc a military watchdog group 
ive never heard of debarring just one office carroll said 
theyve found a way to sound as if theyre taking serious action 
knowing there will be ways around the barrier 
boeing did 42 billion of business with the government during 
the first nine months of 1989 but reported it is losing money on 
its defenserelated contracts 
the strike talks called for this afternoon by federal mediator 
doug hammond are the third round since the walkout by members of 
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
began oct 4 
union negotiators rejected boeings last threeyear offer which 
included annual wage increases of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 
percent plus bonuses cuts in mandatory overtime and increases in 
retirement benefits 
the union represents about 57800 boeing workers including 
43000 in the seattle area 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in 
portland ore and a few hundred others at scattered sites in 
california hawaii utah wyoming montana north dakota and

an 83yearold man sued a hospital for saving 
his life saying its refusal to let him die led to a crippling 
stroke and paralysis 
before edward h winter entered the st francisst george 
hospital with chest pains in may 1988 he and his family decided 
they didnt want extraordinary measures taken to preserve his life 
to comply with those wishes his doctor signed a nocode 
order telling hospital personnel not to perform any lifesaving 
methods 
but when winter suffered an attack hospital workers ignored the 
order and used electric shock to restart his heart winters 
attorney says 
that effort was successful but two days later winter had a 
severe stroke leaving him paralyzed on the right side of his body 
and dependent on others 
in a lawsuit friday in hamilton county common pleas court 
winters attorney william c knapp asked that the hospital 
compensate winter for damages and pay for his care at a nursing 
home 
everyone had decided that if this was his time this was his 
time said knapp they didnt let him die when they should 
have 
the lawsuit charges hospital personnel with negligence for 
ignoring the doctors orders and battery for using the efforts 
they did to revive him

troops have been told to shoot to kill 
members of a new tamil militia after it attacked four eastern 
police stations in battles that reportedly left 43 people dead the 
government said today 
eighteen guards were killed in the simultaneous attacks early 
friday in ampara district about 125 miles east of colombo the 
staterun news agency lankapuvath reported twentyfive members of 
the militia were also reported killed 
a government statement said the militia known as the tamil 
national army has been declared an enemy of the country and 
shootatsight orders have been issued against its members 
the militia is believed to have been set up by three former 
rebel groups that now control the northeastern provincial council 
the local government in the district 
although the militia was declared illegal the government had 
tolerated it it was apparently set up to defend the provincial 
council from attacks by rival tamil groups mainly the dominant 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
fears of internecine fighting have been increasing with the 
departure of indian peacekeeping troops who are to complete their 
withdrawal from sri lanka by dec 31 indian troops pulled out of 
ampara last month 
in the first direct denouncement of the tamil national army and 
its creators foreign minister ranjan wijeratne on friday accused 
the provincial councils chief minister vartharaja perumal of 
creating the present situation 
we have information 13 unauthorized militia camps have been 
set up in ampara trained by the indian peacekeeping force and 
armed by the chief minister he told parliament 
perumal has either gone mad or is being motivated to do 
this the minister said 
if he cannot enforce law and order in the north and east we 
have people who can do this job wijeratne said 
indian officials in colombo denied indian troops had helped set 
up the camps 
perumal who heads the proindian eelam peoples revolutionary 
liberation front opposes withdrawal of indian troops deployed in 
northeastern sri lanka since july 30 1987 
the troops were dispatched under an indiansri lanka accord to 
end a tamil insurgency for a separate homeland the agreement 
provided limited autonomy to the tamil minority 
the provincial council also was set up under the accord and 
perumals group renounced separatism and joined mainstream 
politics the tamil tigers however reneged on the accord and 
began attacking indian soldiers 
days after the indian troops withdrew from ampara the tamil 
tigers attacked two tamil national army camps at least 33 people 
were killed 
at least 10000 sri lankans have been killed in the sixyearold 
tamil insurgency that stemmed from complaints of discrimination in 
jobs and education by the sinhalese majority 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent and control the government and the 
military

a fire raged out of control today 
in a coal mine one day after a gas explosion and fire killed 92 
miners authorities arrested four workers who may have sparked the 
blast

mourning

extinguished before rescue teams can begin recovering the bodies

improper welding job 
the fire at the aleksinacki rudnici brown coal mine 125 miles 
south of belgrade the capital was the worst mining disaster in 
serbia said the rescue coordinator an engineer who requested 
anonymity the mine is the most inflammable in yugoslavia due to 
high concentrations of methane gas he said 
he said that five years ago a commission of experts recommended 
the mine be closed after a string of fatal accidents that 
culminated in the death of 38 miners in june 1983 
the blaze friday broke out at noon as coal transport equipment 
was being welded in a shaft about 2100 feet deep mandusic told 
the official tanjug news agency the blaze cut off the main access 
shaft of the mine 
the government of serbia met today to set up a commission to 
investigate the cause of the disaster belgrade radio indicated an 
initial finding suggests that safety regulations were violated 
during the welding operations 
on friday white smoke rising from the mine was visible from at 
least 1 mile away only authorized personnel were allowed to 
approach the mine while police kept relatives newsmen and 
photographers well away from the pit 
relatives some sobbing softly huddled nearby in the subzero 
temperatures 
rescuers told the associated press during the night that with 
the fire still burning temperatures were too high for them to get 
all the way through to the trapped men 
coal dust and methane gas are still burning fiercely and it 
could take a long time to put it out said slobodan stefanovic 
he was carrying breathing equipment 
the radio broadcast said all but 20 of the victims had families 
and that the government will provide 333 in financial assitance to 
each family the radio gave the number of a bank account for 
voluntary contributions to the families of the dead miners 
the worst mining accidents in yugoslavia were both at the 
bosnian coal mine at kakanj and both involved methane gas 
explosions in 1934 a total of 127 people were killed and 128

presented his credentials to an aide to president rene mouawad 
underscoring washingtons backing for the new head of state 
also today a small bomb exploded outside the home of parliament 
member khatchig babikian causing damage but no casualties police 
said 
it was the seventh attack on the property of a christian 
parliamentarian since the legislators defied christian army gen 
michel aoun and elected mouawad this month as part of an arab 
leaguesponsored peace plan for the civil war none of the previous 
blasts caused casualties 
sources close to mouawad reported earlier today that mccarthy 
drove to syrianpoliced north lebanon and presented his credentials 
to the new leader at his home in ehden a mountain resort in the 
cedars mountains 
however it was later learned that mccarthy gave his credentials 
to a foreign ministry official salah staitiyeh at mouawads home 
protocol dictates that the ministry receive ambassadors 
credentials first officials said that on sunday morning mccarthy 
will present his credentials to mouawad in a formal ceremony 
mouawad was elected nov 5 
in washington a state department official confirmed that 
mccarthy had presented his credentials in ehden but gave no further 
details 
mccarthy whose embassy in beirut closed last month after aoun 
supporters surrounded it drove in a fivecar convoy to ehden from 
damascus the syrian capital according to mouawad aides who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
one source said prime ministerdesignate salim hoss a sunni 
moslem and parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem 
will attend the ceremony sunday highlighting the three top 
leaders effort to work together 
the united states has supported mouawads election on nov 5 in 
a special parliament session held in north lebanon after aouns 
threats to shell the chamber in beirut it also has welcomed 
parliaments approval of an arab leaguebrokered plan for 
christianmoslem coexistence after 14 years of civil war the 
accord shifts political power to the moslem majority 
aoun has rejected mouawads election and the peace plan mainly 
because it did not include a fixed timetable for the evacuation of 
40000 syrian troops from lebanon aoun fought the syrians the 
moslems main backers for six months this year in battles that 
killed thousands of people he says the syrians who entered 
lebanon in 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate are an 
occupying force 
washington a traditional backer of the christians has accused 
aoun a maronite catholic of complicating the peace march and 
urged him to recognize mouawad 
mouawads election ended a political vacuum that prevailed after 
president amin gemayels term expired sept 22 1988 with 
parliament unable to elect a successor 
aoun emerged as head of a christian cabinet while hoss who 
served under gemayel led a moslem government during that period 
mouawad asked hoss this week to form a government of national 
reconciliation 
mccarthy was assigned to lebanon after gemayels term ended he 
refused to present his credentials to either cabinet to avoid 
consolidating the partition at least five other ambassadors 
accredited to lebanon after september 1988 have not yet presented 
their credentials 
washington withdrew mccarthy and all american personnel from the 
embassy in aukar a christian suburb on sept 6 after supporters 
of aoun demonstrated at the compound to protest against us policy

more than 50000 people chanting we 
want democracy today staged the largest protest rally in the 
history of communist bulgaria one day after parliament scrapped a 
law forbidding dissent 
the crowd carried hundreds of banners and sketches some showing 
longtime communist leader todor zhivkov behind bars and with an 
adolf hitler mustache painted over his face the hardline zhivkov 
was forced out last week 
at the end of the threehour demonstration the crowd adopted 
with a show of hands a declaration calling for an end to corruption 
and police repression the abandoning of censorship the release of 
political prisoners and guarantees for freedom of religion 
the emotional gathering organized by unofficial human rights 
and ecological groups was held on a vast downtown square in front 
of the aleksander nevski orthodox cathedral in cold but sunny 
weather 
this is the return of democracy in bulgaria and a miracle we 
have not seen for 45 years hristofor sebec a priest and a 
member of the independent ecological group ecoglasnost said in an 
interview 
bulgaria is going toward democracy maybe even a multiparty 
system it will not be easy to reach that goal but we will 
manage petar beron a senior leader of ecoglasnost said in an 
interview 
hundreds of uniformed policemen some sitting in buses at a 
distance watched the crowd and listened to the fiery speeches 
without intervening 
the 78yearold zhivkov who resigned nov 10 as communist party 
chief was replaced by former foreign minister petar mladenov 
the 400member parliament on friday voted unanimously by a show 
of hands for mladenov 53 to replace zhivkov as head of state also 
the election and the prodemocracy demonstrations in bulgaria 
indicate the hardline communist state may be ready to embrace the 
reform movement that has led to dramatic changes in the soviet 
union poland hungary and east germany 
mladenov said in a french television interview broadcast friday 
that he supports holding free elections 
government approval of todays rally was a gesture by the 
mladenov government to show his leadership is committed to some 
change 
under zhivkovs rule only official rallies were allowed on 
friday the national assembly eliminated a paragraph article 273 
from the penal code that had been used to suppress dissent that 
article provided punishment for anyone deemed to have slandered the 
government or party 
during parliaments session friday the firstever broadcast 
live in postwar bulgaria deputies leveled harsh criticism at 
zhivkov 
one legislator slavcho trnski said zhivkov led a flamboyant 
lifestyle owning more than 30 residences 
an officially organized rally friday in support of mladenov drew 
10000 people after which about 500 people demonstrated 
independently with many chanting for democracy and shouting down 
with the murderers 
in todays demonstration independent and police estimates put 
the crowd at more than 50000 some of the banners read we are 
the victims of repression christ is our savior my family 
has nothing to eat and freedom and democracy now 
the crowd shouted we want free elections we want a new 
constitution and down with the red bourgeoisie it called 
out the name of mikhail s gorbachev popular in bulgaria for his 
economic and political reform program mladenovs name was also 
occasionally heard 
the singleparty system is the symbol of totalitarian rule 
said radoy ralin bulgarias best known writer of satire and other 
prose and one of 15 speakers who addressed the crowd from the 
churchs steps 
for such public comments bulgarians would almost certainly have 
ended up in jail only a few weeks ago said one of the activists 
todor zhivkov has left us with empty shops corruption 
bureaucracy and despair said petko simeonov a prominent 
sociologist and a leading member of ecoglasnost 
he demanded criminal investigation and court action against 
zhivkov echoing demands already heard during fridays official 
rally in downtown sofia 
the crowd responded by shouting zhivkov to court and down 
with zhivkov and his aides 
simeonov also called for immediate free election and freedom 
of speech to the cheers of the crowd who chanted izbori 
izbori elections elections 
on friday mladenov vowed to implement reforms he told 
parliament that the command and bureaucratic system are beginning 
to shake and fresh air of changes has entered the political 
atmosphere 
the national assembly adopted several government changes that 
cleared out some hardline zhivkov supporters and restructured some 
ministries to focus greater attention on the flagging economy and 
the environment an issue of considerable popular concern

east germanys parliament today approved a 
reformminded cabinet launched an inquiry into official 
corruption and named a panel to study constitutional changes that 
could end the communist monopoly on power 
in leipzig thousands of activists held a peaceful rally 
demanding free elections now that would give voters a chance to 
remove the communists from power east german staterun television 
said up to 50000 people attended but an associated press reporter 
on the scene estimated the crowd at 10000 
the turnout was lower than expected in the southern industrial 
city where crowds of 300000 and more have been protesting for 
weeks many residents apparently decided they would rather shop or 
sightsee in west germany than attend todays rally organized by 
the new forum opposition group 
elsewhere more than a million east germans poured into west 
berlin and west germany windowshopping or snacking on bratwurst 
to celebrate the second weekend of their newfound freedom to 
travel 
the endorsement of the 28member cabinet gave new premier hans 
modrow the goahead to embark on a reform course that embraces many 
principles of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs perestroika 
reform program 
the cabinet gives 11 seats to noncommunist allies but retains 
the key posts in foreign affairs defense and economic matters for 
the communists 
there were five no votes and six abstentions in the 
500member peoples chamber in the cabinet vote broadcast live on 
television 
the committee set up by parliament will study possible 
constitutional changes manfred gerlach president of the liberal 
democratic party has said he will ask for a change that would 
remove article 1 that guarantees the communists leading role 
another panel was set up to prepare an election law the communist 
leadership has promised free balloting but has not set a date 
parliament also formed a committee to investigate cases of 
corruption personal enrichment and abuse of power 
the moves were the latest in a series of recent momentous 
changes that have rewritten the politics of east germany 
they include massive prodemocracy protests the replacement of 
hardline communist party leader erich honecker with egon krenz 
the opening of the berlin wall and parliaments election of the 
reformminded modrow 
almost half of the 12 million east germans who came west late 
friday were in west berlin city officials said 
although the city was busier than usual there was little of the 
tumultuous street party atmosphere that engulfed the western sector 
a week ago 
wed like to stay all night and make a party said east 
berliner ellen eversberg 18 but already we can see a party here 
costs a lot of money 
the official adn news agency reported that some trains carrying 
passengers from east to west berlin were recklessly stormed by 
impatient travelers who filled the cars two or three times over 
capacity 
adn said the moving trains had to be slowed for safety reasons 
and 72 additional trains were put into service to ease the crush 
markeddown merchandise and makeshift stands hawking cheap 
leather handcrafts cluttered the normally stylish kurfuerstendamm 
boulevard today as businesses changed gears to meet demands from 
visiting east germans 
the citys main shopping boulevard is usually the scene of posh 
promenades with deckedout couples poring over designer window 
displays and walking wellgroomed pets 
portable toilets were set out at main intersections for the 
throngs of shoppers who combed stores and sidewalk booths for 
bargains that could pay for at least in part with their 55 
handouts from bonn 
the west german government gives the welcome money to each 
east german visitor once a year as a gift that gives them a chance 
to sample western wares 
tables and sales bins bearing barettes pins bracelets and 
plastic watches crowded the broad sidewalks that were teeming with 
shoppers 
after east germanys abrupt decision on nov 9 to let its 
citizens travel freely 13 million east germans rushed to west 
berlin a city already crowded with 2 million residents east 
german officials punched new crossings in the berlin wall to 
accommodate the crunch 
american troops at the us army base at mariendorf in west 
berlin set up a soup kitchen at the request of the west german 
authorities to feed 1400 east german families who want to stay in 
the west 
most of the east germans who visit over the weekend will return 
home but government reception centers were prepared for those who 
will not go back 
in his first speech to parliament since becoming premier monday 
modrow on friday outlined a mix of free enterprise and socialist 
planning to rescue east germany from its economic morass modrow 
called for more formal relations with west germany which has 
offered aid to east germany in return for its conversion to a more 
marketoriented economy 
we are waiting now for the other side to respond modrow 
told the legislators in his twohours speech 
west german officials were cautious saying the proposal for 
greater cooperation lacked details 
in his call for improving relations with west germany the 
premier said the two countries could act on security environmental 
protection and other matters of common interest but he drew a long 
round of applause when he denounced reunification of the two 
germanies 
modrows recovery plan appears to follow the course taken by the 
soviets over the past four years which allows only limited private 
enterprise his address was approved unanimously by parliament

there are plenty of want ads for plumbers in 
the west berlin papers but being on the maintenance crew at the 
house of ministries in east berlin is still the best guarantee of 
the good life for uwe doering 
when we saw all the beautiful things in the west they were 
very alluring his girlfriend gabi lamper said thursday but 
that doesnt mean we should leave home 
the couple and their 13monthold son tom were among the 99 
percent of east german visitors to the west who have gawked at the 
west german economic miracle in the past week and then returned 
home 
while the new travel freedom and political reforms in east 
germany dazzle the couple their priorities are home family and 
the security of staying put 
for the 26yearold plumber who joined the communist party as 
an idealistic teenager politics have taken a back seat to 
economic considerations 
despite the cascade of changes in their country and their visit 
to west berlin one week ago the big event in their lives is next 
weeks move into a new threebedroom apartment 
for both of them the new apartment is a symbol of what is right 
with east germany a social system that doering trusts to take 
care of him and his family with guaranteed jobs and housing 
people in west berlin are jobless on the dole said 
doering sprawled on a sofa and sipping a beer 
even though they get money i wouldnt want my family to live 
in a hotel or a hole in the wall if i can have a threebedroom 
apartment here and a job 
the couple spoke through an intepreter to the associated press 
at their onebedroom apartment in prenzlauerberg a workingclass 
section of east berlin 
doering saved all his pay from three years army service which 
enabled them to buy the television stereo and the furniture that 
fills half their 12by12 foot living room 
i could afford the television because i sold my motorcycle 
doering joked three people dont fit on a motorbike 
last year doering bought a 1968 east germanmade trabant which 
both he and ms lamper drive 
now the house is too small with toms playpen and toys the 
baby sleeps in a crib at the foot of his parents bed in their 
cramped 5by12 foot bedroom 
other signs of prosperity jammed into their thirdfloor walkup 
apartment include a washing machine oversized refrigerator food 
processer and electric bread slicer 
they count themselves lucky that they were able to get a new 
apartment allocation from the government in just a year doering 
remembers when life was different 
i came to berlin in 1970 with my family he said with a 
grimace at that time we were four people living in a oneroom 
apartment it was a terrible time 
he and ms lamper openly admit to playing along with the 
communist system for their benefit 
for example the new apartment might have taken three years to 
get if doering had not kept his own onebedroom apartment when he 
moved into what was his girlfriends place three years ago 
the combination of two oneperson apartments to trade and their 
new child to consider was enough to swing the odds in their favor 
now ms lamper is looking for a daycare center or a creche 
for tom until she finds one i get 700 marks 35 a month for 
doing nothing she said 
its easier to get a creche when youre an unmarried mother 
she said in that way the gdr german democratic republic is 
really a socialist state they take care of unmarried mothers 
ms lamper banks her money each month and the family lives on 
doerings pay which comes to about 1100 marks a month worth 
about 60 at the unofficial exchange rate 
their apartment costs 47 marks a month the equivalent of about 
250 and utilities run 20 marks a month 
they spend about 20 marks a day on food and rarely see shortages 
of meat and vegetables anymore 
doering said he joined the communist party at 18 out of a sense 
of duty after being impressed by a rehabilitation plan for criminal 
offenders in a factory where he worked 
my mind has changed completely over the past years he said 
the confidence they have broken has to be rebuilt the economy 
has to be right and it doesnt matter under which party 
freedom to travel was the first step in the right direction 
doering said now if a few more things change life could be 
really fine

as political upheavals in eastern europe 
continue china is stepping up calls to preserve its own 
conservative brand of socialism 
prominent editorials in newspapers have urged the perfection 
of socialism by rejecting political pluralism and denouncing the 
most salient principle of capitalism private ownership 
hungary has disbanded its communist party east germany poland 
and bulgaria have installed new reformminded leaderships 
czechoslovakia has replaced hardliners in the politburo with 
moderates but china is proving to be doctrinaire stressing that 
the conservative socialist path is best 
economic reform must on no account take the road of private 
ownership and the political reform must on no account take the 
road leading to a multiparty or diversified political system 
said the peoples daily the main publication of chinas communist 
party 
the ongoing policies of reform and opening further to the 
outside world must stick to the socialist orientation said the 
commentary written by beijing universitys president wu shuqing 
and printed friday 
if the reform deviates from the socialist orientation and 
follows the mode set by foreign hostile forces and those engaged in 
advocating bourgeois liberalism western ideals the socialist 
cause and the great achievements china has obtained over the past 
40 years will be destroyed in a moment wu wrote 
wu was installed as head of chinas most prestigious university 
in august following a prodemocracy movement led by students many 
from beijing university 
chinas brush with the call for democratic reforms was brutally 
put down by the chinese army in june in a crackdown which left 
hundreds and possibly thousands of civilians dead 
since then the government has intensified its criticism of the 
wests liberal influences and exhorted chinese to unite under the 
party 
dengs early reforms included reviving the family farm and 
allowing farmers to sell crops above state quotas for a profit and 
to sometimes branch into private business 
but at a time when democratic and capitalistic principles are 
gaining the upper hand in traditionally hardline eastern europe 
private ownership has come under fire in china as undermining the 
socialist state 
privatization of stateowned assets under chinas current 
circumstances will inevitably create bureaucratic capitalism in the 
country a commentary in the journal economic research said 
instead of saving the country bureaucratic capitalism can 
only drive the masses of the chinese people into an abyss of 
misery said the commentary reprinted saturday in the official 
china daily 
in all human history there has been only one case in which a 
society of public ownership changed into a private one and that 
happened when the primitive communist society evolved into a slave 
society the economic research commentary said 
if the public assets of todays china were privatized in a 
short period of time as hoped for by advocates power could mean 
greater opportunities for plundering public assets it said 
wu in his commentary noted that proponents maintain that 
private ownership fosters efficiency while under public ownership 
few concern themselves with economic development 
but he said china and many other countries which have taken 
the road of public ownership have developed their economies much 
more quickly than many of the countries which have private 
ownership systems since the second world war 
all shortcomings of public ownership system can be rectified 
through reform he said

bush and us business leaders want to be convinced of the 
stability of soviet society and on the basis of such a 
conviction of such a conception to build largescale economic 
cooperation shevardnadze said 
the dec 23 shipboard summit has no set agenda and 
shevardnadze said no proposed treaties were being prepared for the 
summit and no signing of agreements was expected but there could 
definitely be major agreements i dont rule that out 
shevardnadze said 
along with giving bush his views on the soviet economy 
gorbachev also wants to discuss some of the shortcomings of the 
us economy particularly the question of massive loans it is owed 
by third world countries 
that is question no 1 i would say both for the united 
states and for the third world shevardnadze said this is one 
of the questions which demand serious attention 
soviet and us officials have ruled out the idea of the united 
states offering aid to the soviet union as it has to eastern 
european countries to encourage reforms however soviets have 
complained that america could offer more incentive to its 
businessmen to invest in the soviet economy 
in an example of the kind of breaks the soviets are looking for 
us commerce secretary robert mosbacher said thursday the expected 
quick easing of soviet emigration restrictions will open up the 
soviet union for mostfavorednation trade status with the united 
states 
shevardnadze said the two leaders would also discuss a wide 
range of issues including recent changes in eastern europe

pennsylvanias new abortion law the most 
restrictive in the nation will most heavily affect poor or 
otherwise disadvantaged women and those living in rural areas 
clinic directors say 
it will have an intimidating and chilling effect on those 
women who are most vulnerable it will impact on the least 
intelligent the least financially well off and the least stable 
relationships the most severely said sylvia stengle of the 
allentown womens center 
supporters of the bill signed friday by gov robert p casey 
counter that discouraging abortion is exactly what they want the 
bill to do since in their view it is the taking of human life 
clinic directors predict that teenagers and poor women already 
confused by the abortion controversy and affected by a lack of 
state funds for abortions will suffer by being forced to obtain 
abortions in neighboring states or illegally after the law goes 
into effect in midjanuary 
were going to be seeing teenagers already having trouble 
finding abortions saying goodbye to pennsylvania said shawn 
murphy regional director of planned parenthood of northeast 
pennsylvania 
carol wall of planned parenthood southeastern in philadelphia 
said the law would result in fewer people in our clinics and more 
people would be forced through the concern for all this to go to 
illegal abortion 
pennsylvania is the first state to enter a gateway opened by the 
us supreme court in july when it upheld certain restrictions in 
missouri abortion law including a ban on the use of public 
facilities for abortion 
the pennsylvania law goes further and could be subject to more 
court battles 
it requires a woman wait 24 hours and notify her husband before 
getting an abortion bans abortions based on a fetus sex and bans 
abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except to save the life 
of the mother or prevent substantial and irreversible harm 
the law also carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate the 
regulations a conviction under the sexselection ban or 24week 
provision could result in up to seven years in prison and 15000 
in fines 
state rep stephen freind a republican who sponsored the law 
said if doctors are less prone to kill unborn children that 
would be a wonderful offshoot of the bill 
freind has said provisions of the law were designed to directly 
challenge roe vs wade the supreme court decision that established 
abortion as a constitutional right in 1973 
among the other provisions the law requires physicians to 
discuss risks of abortion and alternatives with women as well as 
provide information on the abortion directors say such discussions 
have typically been handled by counselors 
doctors arent trained to do that they are medical 
personnel said elizabeth hrendaroberts of planned parenthood 
pennsylvania affiliates its expensive for us and a waste for 
us to use doctors to do counseling 
the concerns about rural and poor women involve the 24hour 
waiting period clinic directors said rural women often must drive 
50 miles or more and the waiting provision will add an extra trip 
or lodging expenses to the cost of abortions which run between 
250 and 300 
critics of spousal notification say it is unfair and 
unenforceable clinics are not required to verify a married womans 
statement that her husband was informed 
the 24week restriction requires a woman to carry a fetus to 
term unless it endangers her life or could cause irreversible 
harm those affected directors said will be women who discover 
birth defects or potentially fatal abnormalities in their fetuses 
late in term 
according to the state health department there were about 
50000 abortions in pennsylvania last year one abortion was 
performed after 27 weeks and 127 were performed between 23 and 27 
weeks according to the records 
abortions have gradually declined in the state since the early 
1980s and clinic officials say the new law will further discourage 
doctors from performing them

romania has begun severely restricting 
travel in both directions across its border with hungary and has 
removed its own citizens from trains a senior official of the 
hungarian border guards said today 
it was not known whether the romanian move was linked to a 
congress of the ruling communist party starting in bucharest on 
monday the congress is expected to reconfirm in office hardline 
communist party chief and president nicolae ceausescu 
for some reason starting friday afternoon the romanian 
border guards have been turning back at the border people trying to 
enter romania said lt col laszlo fenyoe 
asked whether those denied entry were given any reasons by the 
romanians fenyoe said they are being told that the hotels are 
full 
those being turned away include not only hungarians but also 
czechoslovaks turks dutch west germans poles you name it 
fenyoe said 
between 6 am and noon today 873 people were planning to enter 
romania but only 515 of them were allowed in he said more than 
200 cars also were involved 
at least 70 people were taken off a train leaving romania for 
the west and several were subjected to body searches according to 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity it was not known how 
many were allowed to proceed 
relations between hungary and romania two warsaw pact allies 
have greatly deteriorated this year chiefly because the hungarian 
government has accused romania of discriminating against the 17 
million ethnic hungarians who claim that they are denied essential 
rights as a minority 
ceausescu who rejects all political and economic reform also 
has expressed disdain for the fastmoving changes under way in 
neighboring hungary and other east european countries 
at the romanian embassy in budapest a duty officer said the 
embassy has not been notified about any problems involving border 
crossings

in the 1930s swedens mix of 
capitalism and socialism became a model for reformers seeking to 
protect the worker in the profithungry industrial west 
now eastern europeans breaking free of marxist economics and 
stifling central planning are studying the scandinavian way of 
doing things 
a parade of visitors has marched through scandinavia from 
hungary poland the baltic republics and the soviet union itself 
and the questions they ask highlight how difficult their transition 
will be to economic freedom 
the swedish model has interested us for a long time now more 
than ever both on a practical and theoretical level said 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze of the soviet union in a 
written reply to questions from a swedish newspaper last week 
reszo nyers hungarian socialist party leader and architect of 
hungarys economic reforms said in stockholm there is a lot for 
us to pay attention to concerning the swedish model such as how 
sweden combines a market economy and the state at the same time 
takes responsibility for social solutions 
bankers company managers government leaders and economic 
planners are among those coming here often they seek investment 
and joint ventures more often they just want advice on how to 
cope and compete in a free market 
the swedish model or what was called 50 years ago the middle 
way refers to the merging of a vigorous capitalistbased private 
industry with allembracing egalitarian welfare programs financed 
by taxes designed to reduce the gap between rich and poor 
in the drive to strip the communist party of total power east 
bloc visitors show interest in swedens muscular labor unions and 
its strong municipalities which take the bulk of tax revenues and 
handle most public services 
swedens governmentrun retraining program is being keenly 
studied by poland which faces a grim prospect of massive 
unemployment according to a swedish government official involved 
in the contacts he was interviewed on condition he was not 
identified 
poland has been warned by the international monetary fund that 
economic revitalization could initially mean one of every three 
polish workers without a job they know this is not a good way to 
start on the road to democracy this official said 
sweden restructured its economy in the 1970s phasing out 
unprofitable shipbuilding and other heavy industries while giving 
top priority to retraining workers and keeping employment levels 
high 
today the swedish inflation rate is higher than in most of 
europe above 6 percent but unemployment is an enviable 15 
percent 
though swedens social democrats are credited with creating the 
model welfare state all postwar scandinavian countries embrace it 
finland and sweden admired as prosperous and efficient have 
the additional appeal of being neutral while norway and denmark 
belong to the nato military alliance 
east bloc economic leaders have been traveling elsewhere in 
western europe seeking capitalistic wisdom and an infusion of aid 
its not only us said the swedish official but its hard 
for a pole to turn to west germany for political and historical 
reasons he said 
traffic has been heaviest to finland which has one of the 
fastest growing economies in europe this decade helsinki has a 
friendship treaty with the soviet union and a long history of 
economic links the finns also are culturally and linguistically 
related to estonians 
the other scandinavian countries have large east european 
refugee populations 
on a visit to finland last month president mikhail s gorbachev 
of the soviet union suggested to finnish industrialists that they 
set up a management training program for soviet factory directors 
similar projects are being arranged privately the danish 
chamber of commerce has invited 30 company directors from estonia 
latvia and lithuania to attend management courses in copenhagen 
next spring 
they are well educated people as engineers and technicians 
but they dont know anything about consumer or industrial 
marketing exhibiting transportation appointing agents said 
vagn jensen deputy director of the chamber of commerce 
the baltic states also want to step up business contacts in 
scandinavia for hardcash reasons under soviet law they are 
allowed to use export income in the currencies of neighboring 
countries to buy imports 
so far the scandinavians have been wary of investing in the 
shaky eastern economies businessmen demand guarantees that their 
governments have been unwilling to give 
but attitudes are changing says tor oestboe senior vice 
president of the export finance as in oslo which is owned by 
norways commercial banks 
we are working on a new finance agreement with the eastern 
bloc countries that would be a big step forward first we are 
working it out with the soviet union and the other east bloc 
countries will come later he said

a lowlevel mobster suspected of killing a 
federal drug agent in february was shot to death probably on 
orders from mob bosses angry about the scrutiny the agents murder 
brought them authorities said today 
constabile gus farace was shot friday night as he sat in a 
car the same manner in which he allegedly killed everett hatcher 
a special agent with the drug enforcement administration who was 
posing as a drug buyer 
hatchers death feb 28 sparked a nationwide manhunt that 
involved up to 100 federal agents working seven days a week said 
us attorney andrew maloney farace was also to be featured sunday 
as the countrys no 1 fugitive on the fox network television 
show americas most wanted 
its reasonable to assume all of that pressure could have 
resulted in last nights shooting maloney said 
a rational and prudent person would obviously believe that 
this is probably a mob hit said robert stutman head of the 
deas new york office the investigation is continuing i cant 
say that for sure 
hatcher 46 was shot to death in february on staten island 
after he went to meet farace to set up a cocaine deal police said 
he was shot four times in the head and upper body as he sat behind 
the wheel of his car 
hatcher had been trying to infiltrate a cocaine ring run by the 
mob authorities said 
on friday farace 29 was sitting in the front passenger seat 
of a car parked on a brooklyn street when a blue van pulled up 
alongside him about 11 pm seven to nine shots were fired into the 
car maloney said at a news conference this morning 
farace was found dead slumped in his seat 
the driver joseph sclafani who had been hit in the chest 
managed to get out of the car and fire a few shots from his 
38caliber handgun at the fleeing van he said 
sclafani in his 20s was found a few feet from the car and 
taken to coney island hospital where he was in critical condition 
maloney described farace as a young punk associated with the 
bonanno and colombo crime families 
i think its reasonable to assume organized crime figures were 
aware of the intensity of the investigation maloney said i 
assume that people higher up in the mafia were as interested in 
finding him as we were 
mob justice isnt always swift but its always deadly and 
this may be an example of deadly mob justice james fox head of 
the new york fbi office said at the news conference 
hatcher was a 12year veteran of the dea in new york and its 
first agent killed here since 1972 
his death prompted one of the largest manhunts in recent years 
and rewards totaling 270000 were offered including 250000 from 
the federal government 
i have never been involved with anything as intense or 
emotional as this stutman said today there were times we were 
within two hours of him and he disappeared 
farace was paroled in june 1988 after serving eight years for a 
kidnapmurder

when mother teresa visited the united states 
it was charles h keating jr who lent his helicopter to her to 
visit remote indian reservations in the southwest 
now this former olympic swimmer and fighter pilot a benefactor 
of charities and politicians a battler of pornographers and 
bureaucrats is the lead character in the costliest savings and 
loan failure in the nations history and a capitol hill drama 
threatening the political lives of five senators 
whether bestowing his largess on church charities civic 
causes business associates or politicians whose help he might want 
some day charlie keating has always done it with a touch of 
flash 
typifying his desire for the spotlight keating insisted on 
being the final witness in the final episode of six weeks of house 
banking committee hearings into the growth and collapse of his 
lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
he got his wish and is scheduled to testify tuesday 
originally orchestrated as a forum for building a case to oust 
m danny wall as the nations top thrift regulator the hearings 
instead have evolved into a near inquisition for the senators to 
whom keating and his associates gave 13 million in his highly 
public war with lincolns regulators 
although he was formally subpoenaed by the committee keatings 
associates say he welcomes an opportunity to tell his side of the 
lincoln story that it was regulators who created the sampl 
nightmare not him 
but just how forthcoming the phoenix millionaire will be before 
congressional inquisitors was unclear as of late last week the 
target of a criminal grand jury in los angeles various 
racketeering and fraud suits and ongoing investigations by three 
federal agencies keating is being advised by some to keep his 
silence 
for keating thats a tall order from his initial entry onto 
the public stage as an antismut crusader he has been anything but 
silent 
when the home loan bank board seized lincoln last april two 
years after the federal agencys examiners recommended keating 
bluntly asserted to reporters the purpose of his largesse to 
elected officeholders 
one question among the many raised in recent weeks had to do 
with whether my financial support in any way influenced several 
political figures to take up my cause he said i want to say 
in the most forceful way i can i certainly hope so 
four of five keating says he meant to influence john glenn 
dohio alan cranston dcalif donald riegle dmich and dennis 
deconcini dariz have told the senate ethics committee in 
formal responses that they did no wrong the fifth john mccain 
rariz will submit his response to the formal committee inquiry 
before congress adjourns for thanksgiving according to a spokesman 
but regulators have told the house panel they never had seen 
such bold political interference as keating engineered 
weve never experienced a guy who had so much juice said 
william crawford californias savings and loan commissioner 
altogether regulators expect lincolns failure will cost 
taxpayers up to 2 billion they contend in a suit against keating 
that the losses stemmed from fraud insider abuse and racketeering 
if our recommendations had been followed the taxpayers would 
have suffered dramatically smaller losses said william black 
one of the four bank board officials summoned to meet with the five 
senators 
born into a prominent cincinnati family with strong republican 
connections keating now 65 began a threedecadelong crusade 
against pornography in the late 1950s 
in 1970 he won an appointment from president nixon to the 
federal commission on obscenity and pornography as a selfdescribed 
book burner he promptly sued the commission to block 
publication of its report until he could write a dissent to its 
conclusion that pornography posed no threat 
a lawyer by training keating turns to suits frequently in 
waging his campaigns hes filed several against the government 
since buying lincoln for 51 million in 1984 and converting it from 
a traditional home mortgage lender into what critics say was the 
epitome of the kind of highflier thrifts that were at the root of 
industry problems that required a 157 billion taxpayer bailout 
other tactics include hiring away at large salaries the state 
and federal regulators and private auditors charged with overseeing 
his empire on behalf of the public 
the phoenix managing partner of lincolns auditor the big eight 
accounting firm of arthur young amp co helped set up the meetings 
between the regulators and the senators with a report affirming 
lincolns soundness a year later he joined keatings payroll with 
an annual salary of 950000 
glenn who accepted 200000 in campaign donations from keating 
recalled feeling livid when he learned that 
i couldnt believe it he said absolutely i felt i was 
led down the primrose path nonetheless glenn said he has no 
intention of returning the 200000 contribution 
those keating didnt hire he retained such as alan greenspan 
formerly the presidents chief economic adviser and now chairman of 
the federal reserve board then working as a private consultant 
greenspan wrote a study in 1986 defending keatings practices 
keatings business instincts and proclivity to spend whatever is 
necessary to get what he wants were developed at the knee of carl 
h lindner a reclusive cincinnati billionaire who through 
takeovers built american financial corp into a banking insurance 
real estate and meatpacking empire 
it was as a vice president and director there that keating had 
his first runin with financial regulators after a threeyear 
investigation the sec accused the two of fraudulently diverting 
company assets for their personal use 
they eventually signed a consent decree in 1979 admitting no 
wrong but promising never to do it again keating later said 
signing the decree was a mistake claiming it cost him an 
appointment from president reagan to be us ambassador to the 
bahamas 
about the time the sec was launching its first investigation of 
keating he moved to phoenix to head continental homes inc a 
troubled homebuilding subsidiary of american financial 
two years later in 1978 keating bought out continental homes 
and changed its name to american continental corp and began doling 
out large contributions to candidates for every office from city 
council to the presidency 
in 1980 he was the west coast finance chairman in nowbankrupt 
former texas gov john b connallys shortlived campaign for the 
republican presidential nomination 
there he met lee henkel jr an atlanta tax lawyer and former 
chief counsel at the irs during part of the nixon administration 
who was carrying out the same task for connally on the east coast 
six years later when home loan bank board chairman edwin gray 
and his staff began reigning in the way some thrifts were 
operating keating helped win reagans appointment of henkel to the 
bank board 
henkel resigned from the board four months later after it was 
disclosed he had loans or shared in partnerships with loans from 
lincoln totaling 60 million but first he proposed changing the 
boards regulations to exempt much of lincolns investments from 
the newly imposed restrictions the changes were rejected by the 
boards other members 
i have taken every action appropriate to rectify the 
unwarranted bureaucratic assault waged against me and my 
company keating said last april in the contract between the 
voter and the politician we have the right to seek their help when 
needed and demand it when justified this i have done

who has his heart in his job late night television personality 
leno quipped now if he can just get his mind in the job 
eleven months after the former indiana senator survived a 
difficult political campaign and became vice president he has 
bushs support for another fouryear term 
at the same time though he remains a popular target for the 
likes of leno and a worrisome factor for republicans watching 
public opinion polls giving quayle consistently low ratings 
im not going to do anything differently no matter what the 
polls say quayle recently told reporters im going to work as 
i believe a vice president should work that is first and foremost 
with complete loyalty to the president for the advancement of his 
agenda in his interests and thats what im doing 
the most recent surveys a wall street journalnbc news sampling 
taken early this month reported more than half of the voters said 
bush should choose a different running mate in 1992 quayle could 
not even claim support from the republicans polled by a 40 to 39 
percent margin they said he should be dumped 
you cant argue with those polls its unfortunate that people 
havent recognized his contributions to the administration and the 
party said quayles press secretary david beckwith 
he said quayle has accomplished his firstyear goals of 
solidifying his position within the white house and with bush and 
of working with republican party officials around the country 
as people begin to recognize his contributions in those areas 
the polls will take care of themselves beckwith said 
the vice president also has emerged as a link with the white 
house for conservatives some of whom are distrustful of bush and 
quayle is credited with raising 5 million in campaign 
contributions for gop candidates and causes 
expectations were low when quayle took office in part because 
of a presidential campaign in which his selection became an issue 
even now praise for the vice president from republicans often 
begins with a sigh of relief that quayle has avoided serious gaffes 
and avoided embarrassing the president 
hes fulfilling the functions for which he was selected 
said political analyst william schneider of the american enterprise 
institute he does not challenge he does not question the 
president he doesnt make any trouble 
his standing wasnt helped by a new book on the 1988 campaign 
whose broad stripes and bright stars by reporters jack germond 
and jules witcover republican consultants who worked with quayle 
in the campaign were quoted as offering unflattering descriptions 
of the vice presidential nominee 
he was like a kid the book quoted joseph canzeri as saying 
ask him to turn off a light and by the time he gets to the 
switch hes forgotten what he went for 
when asked by dallas morning news reporters this month whether 
he would keep quayle on the ticket bush seized the chance to say 
he absolutely would 
that word from bush a vice president himself for eight years 
was widely regarded as a move to head off rumors that were 
beginning to surface regarding quayles future 
bush knew better than anyone else how frustrating such rumors 
are and wanted to put them to rest said an administration 
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
given bushs support for his vice president republicans were 
insistent that they not be linked by name to any critical 
statements one party official said gop stalwarts are trying to 
make the best of what might otherwise be a bad situation 
in speeches quayle often puts his own stamp on administration 
policy careful to follow bushs lead but adding a conservative 
edge 
quayle is a passionate defender of the strategic defense 
initiative the spacebased missile defense system and he takes 
a consistently skeptical view of the soviet unions reform moves 
recently he took a harder line on ussoviet relations than the 
more optimistic view articulated just a day earlier in a major 
speech by secretary of state james a baker iii the white house 
hastened to insist that the two speeches were not inconsistent 
despite private grumbling within the gop there is no shortage 
of republicans willing to praise quayle publicly 
dan is personally well liked he is eager to help everyone on 
both a partisan and nonpartisan level and he has the support of 
the president said rep lynn martin rill a close ally of 
bush 
on the fundraising circuit the republican national committee 
touts quayle as one of its principle assets with some 5 million 
to his credit so far rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman said quayle 
has been adept at building support among party regulars at the 
state and local level 
new jersey gov thomas kean said bush is absolutely convinced 
that dan quayle is a good public servant and that he is growing and 
that he is learning on the job 
he needed that kind of reassurance from the president said 
kean rumors that some factions wanted to dump quayle from the 
ticket in 1992 were very very destructive when the vice 
president travels as a representative of the administration kean 
said

the pay raise awaiting president bushs 
signature would stop ablebodied semiretired federal judges from 
collecting pay raises while doing no judicial work 
but an exception would be granted for former chief justice 
warren burger and any others who like him work fulltime on a 
federal or state entity outside the judicial system 
the pay package for members of congress judges and senior 
executives approved by congress early saturday sent to bush 
contains a bipartisan proposal to alter the pay provisions for 
senior judges those who opt for a reduced workload after they 
reach age 65 with 15 years experience 
to get full raises senior judges would have to do the 
equivalent of three months of judicial work a year or be disabled 
healthy senior judges who did not work that minimum would continue 
to receive the full pay they got before they stopped working plus 
any subsequent costofliving increases 
the proposal to restrict pay raises for nonworking senior 
judges was introduced by reps robert kastenmeier dwis and 
carlos moorhead rcalif chairman and ranking republican on the 
house courts subcommittee last april after the associated press 
found that nearly 20 percent of the 277 senior judges did no 
judicial work 
since then drafters added one provision which kastenmeier 
conceded would have the effect of preserving the pay raise for 
former chief justice warren burger who has not heard a case since 
stepping down in 1986 since then he has been chairman of the 
bicentennial of the constitution and bill of rights the panel 
continues through 1991 
the provision allows full pay raises for senior judges like 
burger who work fulltime for a federal or state governmental 
entity one source who declined to be named said burgers views 
that senior judges ought to get full pay raises for such work had 
been made known to the congress 
as a result burgers pay and that of current chief justice 
william rehnquist would rise from 115000 now to 124000 in 
january and at least 155000 on jan 1991 
the bill would boost the salaries of federal district judges 
from 89500 to 120800 in january and at least 124400 in 
january 1991 appeals courts salaries would rise from 95000 to 
102500 and then at least to 128100 supreme court justices 
would go from 110000 to 118700 and at least to 148400 
the final figures in all four categories are contingent on 
inflation and are likely to be increased as a result of a 
costofliving increase in january 1991 currently expected to be 
around 3 percent 
kastenmeier said last week that the only judges who will not 
receive the raise are those who should not receive it the ones in 
good health who affirmatively opt not to work 
nevertheless spokesmen for the federal judiciary have bitterly 
opposed any curtailment in raises for any category of senior judge 
as the bill neared passage sources said representatives of the 
judiciary tried without success to find support for an amendment 
that would exempt all current judges from the restrictions and 
apply them only to future appointees 
members of kastenmeiers subcommittee told judicial leaders at a 
hearing last april that the associated press stories about the pay 
of senior judges had prompted a torrent of constituent complaints 
and introduction of the legislation 
the ap reported previously unpublished federal figures from 1987 
that showed that 20 percent of the 306 senior judges that year did 
no judicial work 
an associated press survey of all senior judges in february and 
march of this year found that 17 percent of 277 senior judges did 
no judicial work the ap survey credited judges for dormant cases 
still on their dockets which the earlier government data had not 
under the new rules senior judges could fulfill their work 
requirement by hearing cases in court or by writing opinions and 
handling settlements and motions in either case the chief judge 
of their circuit would have to certify that they had done during 
the year an amount of work equal to that which an active judge 
would complete in three months 
they also could complete the requirement for full raises by 
working fulltime on administrative duties directly related to the 
operation of the courts such as at the federal judicial center 
senior judges who fail to meet the work requirement as a result 
of either temporary or permanent disability would continue to 
receive all raises given fulltime judges

us ambassador john mccarthy pulled from 
lebanon 73 days ago under pressure from supporters of christian 
gen michel aoun returned saturday and urged the rebellious aoun 
to fall in line behind civilian authority 
mccarthy drove to ehden in syriancontrolled north lebanon to 
present his credentials to a foreign ministry official at the home 
of president rene mouawad a beirut newspaper reported that the 
united states is considering reopening its mission in lebanon but 
moving it out of the region controlled by aoun 
the presenting of credentials underscored us backing for the 
new head of state whom aoun opposes and intensified the generals 
political isolation 
earlier a small bomb exploded outside the home of armenian 
parliamentary deputy khatchig babikian in christian east beirut 
causing damage but no casualties police reported 
it was the seventh attack on a christian parliamentarian since 
legislators defied aoun and elected mouawad president on nov 5 to 
oversee implementation of an arab leaguesponsored peace plan to 
end 14 years of civil war 
the accord was reached by the legislators in 23 days of talks in 
the saudi arabian resort of taif 
mccarthy and his bodyguards arrived in ehden in a fivecar 
convoy security around mouawads twostory stone mansion was tight 
i wanted to bring the greetings of president bush to president 
mouawad mccarthy told reporters 
my country was very very pleased to see the developments that 
took place in taif to see the election of a new president here to 
see that the situation that had been ambigious in terms of 
legality has now totally cleared he added you have a 
president thats a wonderful thing 
in remarks aimed at aoun mccarthy said lebanon has a long 
tradition of constitutional democracy in that tradition as far as 
i know military officers have always followed the civilian 
authority 
the envoy said he assumed that aoun like the good soldier he 
is will very soon fall in line behind civilian authority i 
certainly hope so 
mccarthy said the bush administration has a good deal of 
respect for gen aoun and agreed with his goals it was really 
the means he was using that we quarreled with 
aoun who seeks to force the 40000 syrian soldiers out of 
lebanon fought them for six months in fierce artillery battles 
that killed more than 900 people and wounded nearly 3000 the 
fighting ended sept 22 with an arab leaguebrokered ceasefire 
the general opposed the taif accord because it did not include a 
guarantee for the withdrawal of the syrians who were deployed in 
1976 under an arab league mandate to quell civil war fighting aoun 
said they defied that mandate by siding with the moslems 
salah staitiyeh head of the foreign ministrys political 
affairs department said mccarthy presented a copy of his 
credentials to him at 145 pm 
the ambassador will formally present his credentials to mouawad 
on sunday officials reported 
mccarthy held a 30minute meeting with mouawad reporters were 
not allowed in but photographers were given 10 minutes to take 
pictures 
the two men later drove together in mouawads bulletproof 
mercedes to the neighboring town of zghorta away for a lunch given 
by former president suleiman franjieh 
lebanese soldiers in armored personnel carriers guarded the 
mountain road between ehden and zghorta mouawad and mccarthy 
returned to ehden several hours later and talked for 90 minutes no 
statement was issued 
beiruts leftist assafir newspaper reported from washington 
that the united states was seriously considering reopening its 
embassy in lebanon but outside the christian enclave controlled 
by aoun 
the daily quoted unnamed american sources as saying mccarthy 
would discuss with mouawad the idea of moving the embassy to the 
syrianpoliced north 
mccarthy and other us diplomats evacuated the embassy in 
christian east beirut on sept 6 after aoun loyalists besieged it 
asked whether the embassy would reopen mccarthy said well 
return as soon as our security can be guaranteed and as soon as 
were certain we can have contacts with all the different political 
leaders in lebanon

nancy reagan may have settled a lot of old 
scores in her memoir my turn but the critics panned it when 
they got their turn 
with only a few exceptions the book has been reviewed as 
shallow and mean the philadelphia inquirers critic susan page 
suggested the former first lady could have called it take that 
the los angeles times david lauter called it a selfindictment 
the new republics barbara ehrenreich commented on its 
whining quality 
said critic richard dyer in the boston globe nancy reagan has 
written a book she shouldnt have instead of changing a 
hoitytoity image she is unhappy with she has reinforced it if 
you thought she cared too much about clothes and furniture and 
china and decoration and every form of appearance this book proves 
you are right 
smugness infects these memoirs said rw apple jr in the 
new york times mrs reagans selfsatisfaction and 
selfrighteousness shine out from page afer page 
on the other hand some critics found an unexpected side to mrs 
reagan warm humor 
in the chicago tribune dorothy collin called the book as much 
fun as a long gossipy lunch and predicted history may be 
pretty kind to nancy reagan 
san jose calif mercury news critic florence king said mrs 
reagan had produced a blunt very funny memoir 
whatever the critics verdict of course mrs reagan can laugh 
all the way to the bank she has produced a hit 
her book leaped to firstplace on most best seller compilations 
it took the no 2 spot on the new york times widelywatched best 
seller list for nov 19 and her agent mort janklow says it will 
reign as no 1 in the list the times will print nov 26 
random house the publisher denies reports that mrs reagan was 
paid 2 million in advance royalties but wont disclose the actual 
figure industry scuttlebutt is that it may have been more 
as for the reviews random house publicist carol schneider calls 
them political saying people seem to be reviewing nancy 
reagan rather than the book 
agent janklow says the reviews have been negative because people 
expect a first lady to write a sweet andthenientertained sort of 
book which mrs reagans isnt 
she unburdens herself of her pentup anger and i think thats 
what makes it a wonderful book says janklow 
in the washington post reviewer sally quinn wrote that she was 
struck by how much anger mrs reagan displayed she said she turned 
back the corners of pages on which mrs reagan mentioned being 
angry furious outraged irritated or annoyed and counted 42 
turned corners in 370 pages 
among the people mrs reagan was angry about were ms quinn 
author of what she called a very negative article about me and 
ms quinns husband post executive editor benjamin c bradlee 
university of texas historian lewis gould who specializes in 
first ladies says he suspects mrs reagan comes across as more 
bitter than she intended that happens he says when people 
write their books like she did by speaking into a tape 
recorder allowing a ghostwriter to polish their words 
by not having to put pen to paper the author does not have to 
think about what he is saying and the result gould says can be 
like a heated letter you read the next morning and throw away 
well mrs reagan sent out the heated letter 
among mrs reagans targets people she said have made her 
angry noted ms quinn were don regan al haig jimmy carter 
jerry ford john sears mike deaver ed meese david stockman bill 
safire raisa gorbachev stuart spencer nelson rockefeller barry 
goldwater joan didion walter mondale geraldine ferraro john 
poindexter oliver north george bush doctors who appear on 
television the press her stephicldren maureen and michael and 
especially her daugher patti 
the attack on patti she says is so hurtful so painful so 
embarrassing so pathetic that it takes your breath away

this is the wall everyone watches 
the german question is open so long as the brandenburg gate is 
closed says west german president richard von weizsaecker that 
too is painted on the wall 
farther south at potsdamer platz is the new opening where 
photographers and gawkers jostle with berliners exercising their 
new mobility a billboard records that this barren ground was in 
1932 jammed with autos and electric trolley cars on june 16 
1953 three years before the hungarian uprising rockthrowing 
germans in the eastern sector took on soviet tanks 
wallbangers have been most active where the barrier takes a big 
turn to the east one hole along the base was large enough for a 
head to poke through but most were no more than five inches wide 
even though several feet long 
bad concrete its obvious was not one of the failures of east 
german socialism 
two young americans tried their luck with a piece of angleiron 
and waved a little us flag through the opening 
get your flag out of here a german woman shouted in 
english show your flag in your own country not here 
but this is the american sector one of the americans 
explained 
american sector the german snorted do you think this is 
some kind of colony 
the wall here is at its rudest it swallows streets blocks 
trolley tracks crowds front porches along niederkirchener strasse 
proximity breeds creativity one artist glued shards of mirrors 
on the wall creating an illusion of transparency 
another covered five concrete panels with a huge blue question 
mark on an aquamarine background over a tormented caption 
humanity is steering toward a black hole were gaining speed 
but the narrowest passage is ahead 
a misshapen cross says erich honnecker rip the misspelling 
of his last name a final insult to the hardline east german leader 
who was ousted oct 18 
beyond checkpoint charlie and the checkpoint charlie museum 
fresh mums were tangled in the barbed wire entwined on a wooden 
cross it tells of the agonizing death of peter fechter who was 
shot and lay by the wall for 50 minutes in 1962 bleeding and 
calling for help 
west german police could only throw firstaid packs over the 
wall finally east german guards carried fechter away 
west berlin changes from park to slum to suburb to woodland to 
lakeshore but the wall hardly changes for miles 
there are places of rustling leaves and birdsong and little 
desolation rows where the sidewalk is squeezed between the wall and 
the various high walls and barbed wire of private property 
in the rundown kreuzberg area berlins ultraleft 
autonomen have parked their wooden caravans and shacks in the 
shelter of the wall a couple of goats were tethered across the

another banner referring to the countrys biggest bank 
way out in suburbia one of the newest crossings is a bridge 
leading into potsdam the east germans have long called it the 
unity bridge 
such communist irony inspired some professionally painted 
official graffiti on the western shore those who gave it the 
name of the bridge of unity also built the wall strung the barbed 
wire and made the death strip and so hindered unity

next months superpower summit conceived as a 
casual getacquainted session is being swamped by the upheaval in 
eastern europe and reshaped into a politically charged meeting with 
an uncertain outcome 
while struggling to keep expectations modest white house 
officials acknowledge that the dizzying events in east germany and 
elsewhere have infused more drama into the meeting between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
we are aware of these expectations a senior administration 
official said i think its human nature that when an american 
and soviet president get together naturally the world is glued to 
the television screens 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the opening of 
the berlin wall and the surge of east germans to the west add a 
new sense of urgency and a new dimension to the talks 
moving beyond the concept of a lowstakes gettogether bush now 
says he will use the summit to advance the process of reform and 
democracy 
the soviets say the meeting could produce a timetable for 
resolving key issues facing the two superpowers 
along those lines the united states says the summit will give 
a push to all of the ussoviet arms negotiations but will not 
produce actual formulas for reductions 
whereas bush originally described the meeting merely as an 
opportunity to put his feet up and chat with gorbachev the 
president says he will explore opportunities to move beyond 
containment in ussoviet relations to find areas of mutual 
advance in our relationship 
on the other hand the rising public expectations have prompted 
words of caution from both sides 
both bush and gorbachev have begun talking publicly about what 
they will not do as well as what they will do 
both sides say they do not expect to sign any new agreements 
were not meeting to negotiate the future of europe bush 
said last week the peoples of eastern europe are speaking their 
own minds about that future 
gorbachev staking out similar ground said any talk about 
german reunification would be viewed as outside interference and 
that any gloating that socialism had failed would be wishful 
thinking 
bush said reunification is a matter for the people of the 
germanys to determine 
both leaders have expressed hopes for a calm and peaceful period 
of change in eastern europe bush and gorbachev may codify that 
sentiment by making a joint pledge at the summit not to interfere 
in the events of eastern and central europe 
bush and gorbachev are to hold more than eight hours of talks 
aside from meals together over two days dec 2 and 3 
they will meet in the mediterranean on warships the us guided 
missile cruiser belknap flagship of the 6th fleet and the soviet 
missile cruiser slava which has been specially outfitted for the 
meeting 
the ships will be anchored about 1000 feet off the coast of 
malta 
in line with the official strategy of keeping expectations low 
the senior administration official said i dont think the 
character of the meeting or the presidents objectives have changed 
what has changed is the profundity of the events that have 
been occurring these last two months in the center of europe 
said the official insisting on anonymity 
fitzwater said the soviets traditionally play up expectations 
for summits while the united states tries to keep them low i 
suspect the reality is somewhere in the middle he said 
raymond seitz assistant secretary of state for european 
affairs said bush wants to get a firsthand sense of what the 
limits are what is perestroika the soviet program of economic 
reform where is it heading what are the goals what are the 
pitfalls 
to allay fears that the united states was adopting a goitalone 
approach bush talked by telephone friday with the leaders of 
britain france west germany and canada and promised more 
discussions before the summit 
seitz said bush doesnt want to get into the trap of two 
emperors deciding the future of europe 
there are intense preparations in washington for the summit 
including a concerted effort to prepare bush for any surprises 
gorbachev may spring as he has done at previous summits 
its like a debate you always have to gameplan every major 
argument on every important issue that your opponent could use 
said william j taylor a specialist on ussoviet relations at 
the center for strategic and international studies 
the president will be ready the senior administration 
official said he said the administration was anticipating all 
the issues that may come up 
fitzwater said obviously if president gorbachev makes a 
proposal the president will say well thats very interesting 
why do you feel that way and whats your reasoning and hell give 
him his points of view and his ideas and say well take these 
matters up with the allies and well talk about them again at our 
next summit

the space shuttle launch team was 
about 12 hours behind schedule saturday as it worked toward 
starting the countdown for the thanksgiving eve liftoff of shuttle 
discovery nasa said 
its a very tight schedule but were still targeting the 
launch for wednesday the 22nd said space agency spokeswoman lisa 
malone who blamed the delay on a bunch of little things 
the secret military mission which sources said will include the 
deployment of a spy satellite is expected to last four days 
malone said launch officials were assessing where the lost time 
could be made up before the scheduled 4 pm sunday countdown 
start and well regroup tomorrow morning and see where we 
stand 
launch crews might be able pick up some time by speeding up the 
engine closeout sunday she said some time also might be made up 
by reducing the number of hours of contingency hold time included 
in the countdown 
time was lost during the week when engineers had to replace an 
electronic control box on one of discoverys two solid fuel booster 
rockets and a bunch of other little things also put us behind 
malone said 
she said that if officials decide sunday that they cant make a 
wednesday launch they could delay the liftoff until thursday or 
put it off two days until friday to allow most workers to spend 
thanksgiving at home 
well look at the weather forecast for friday and the weekend 
and if it looks good we might reschedule for friday she said 
but we have not ruled out a thanksgiving liftoff 
because the flight is classified nasa and the pentagon have 
said only that the launch will occur between 630 pm and 1030 
pm they will not make the exact time public until just nine 
minutes before the planned liftoff 
except for brief announcements on the shuttle reaching orbit and 
on the landing time there will be a news blackout during the 
mission unless something major goes wrong 
the flight is expected to last four days 
sources close to the project said discoverys payload is an 
intelligence satellite that will be able to listen in on 
communications networks of the soviet union and other countries

in the first frenzied hours after 
michaela joy garecht was kidnapped a year ago sunday volunteers 
and parents of other missing children printed and distributed 
42000 fliers bearing her image 
millions of fliers later michaela is still missing but efforts 
by the volunteers childrens groups police and fbi continue 
strong 
more than ever parents of kidnapped children nationwide are 
turning to each other for help in mobilizing community support and 
publicity 
brought together by one of the cruelest of crimes they also are 
comforting each other when the waiting becomes too much and dark 
thoughts swirl through their minds 
a long table in the garecht home is filled with newspaper 
clippings and fliers of michaela and others who have disappeared 
and are feared to be victims of molesters and psychopaths 
sharon garecht chainsmokes in the dining room near a portrait 
of her daughter whos 10 now if she lives 
as more time goes on it becomes harder to believe that we can 
find her mrs garecht said the one good thing about the 
oneyear anniversary is its putting her and her abductor back in 
the news were hopeful that will have some effect toward solving 
the case 
im kind of dreading next week though between having passed 
the oneyear mark and thanksgiving coming im kind of planning in 
advance to be depressed 
the telephone rings its linda borer in willow alaska whose 
son david vanished last april 
the women linked by tragedies 2000 miles apart speak briefly 
and agree to talk again later mrs garecht also keeps in touch 
with the families of michael paul henley an 11yearold missing 
from new mexico and amber swartzgarcia 9 and ilene misheloff 
14 two other missing california girls 
i have found that to be able to help somebody else with this 
kind of situation has been very helpful for me says mrs 
garecht who founded the michaela joy garecht center to coordinate 
the search for her daughter and assist other parents of missing 
children 
the national center for missing and exploited children based in 
arlington va has recorded 511 abductions by strangers since it 
opened in june 1984 of those 158 children were found alive 112 
dead most were sexually abused authorities say 
the nonprofit center says its figures do not represent the 
scope of the problem of missing children in the united states it 
contends many more cases exist than are reported to the group 
stranger abductions are a small percentage of the 23899 
children who have been reported missing over the past five years 
according to the national center nearly half are believed to be 
runaways and throwaways 
david collins of san francisco who led the original flier 
effort for michaela is one of the parents of kidnap victims who 
have been involved in other childrens cases too his son kevin was 
believed kidnapped nearly six years ago and has never been found 
last week he was in radcliff ky in response to a request 
from police looking for another missing child 5yearold 
alexandria suleski 
collins who heads the kevin collins foundation for missing 
children along with his wife ann also visited st joseph minn 
earlier this month helping organize the search for jacob 
wetterling an 11yearold reported abducted at gunpoint near his 
rural home oct 22 
we have an abduction response team that helps families and 
communities to distribute fliers and bring a central place and some 
sanity to the situation said collins people rush out to help 
and often dont know whats happening and theres often a lot of 
cross efforts 
michaela whose name is pronounced mikayla and who was called 
kayla for short had gone with a girlfriend on their scooters to a 
neighborhood market after coming out of the store michaela 
noticed one of the scooters had been moved she went to get it and 
a man jumped out from a dented beige car next to it threw her into 
the car and sped away 
the girlfriend said michaela a tall slender blonde with blue 
eyes was grabbed by an acnescarred longhaired blond man believed

a few blocks from the kremlin shoppers push

array of food from powdered soup mixes to dried seaweed for sushi 
sugar rationed throughout the country was marked down last

a civil defense commander says he 
has room at his training center for at least 200 east germans 
returning to their communist homeland but no one is banging down 
the door 
we expect more to come as christmas and new year approach 
lt col horst romeis said friday over a camp lunch of soup a roll 
and east german beer it needs some time to develop the weather 
is getting colder 
as of friday only 14 people had turned up at the reception 
center normally used to train civil defense recruits in this drab 
industrial city 25 miles east of the west german border town of 
helmstedt 
more than 200000 east germans have arrived in west germany this 
year in the new reform mood of the past two weeks the government 
has urged the refugees and emigres to come home 
nationwide figures are sketchy but they suggest that perhaps 
several hundred former refugees or emigres have taken advantage of 
the invitation to return 
the east german government hastily set up centers to welcome 
back up to 10000 returnees but of the 18 reception centers opened 
monday in magdeburg district all but two had closed by friday for 
lack of business 
a returnee arriving thursday evening by train in magdeburg 
about an hours ride from the west german border would have been 
directed to an apprentices residence a brisk 15minute walk from 
the train station 
but the home had gone back to its original purpose earlier in 
the day after only seven returnees showed up 
our 350 apprentices were angry that they had to interrupt 
their training for people who had turned their backs on us said 
residence supervisor hansgeorg friedebold 32 thats 
understandable 
romeis predicts a bigger inflow of disoriented needy returnees 
in the coming weeks as east germans find a new life is not so easy 
to build in capitalist west germany 
the few east germans who had turned up to enjoy romeis 
hospitality included a family of six who ran out of money and were 
unwelcome with their west german relations and two teenagers who 
were obeying parents orders to end their twoweek adventure in the 
west 
klausdieter krueger 16 and matthias langner 15 fled on a 
motorcycle via czechoslovakia on nov 4 just five days before east 
germanys surprise decision to open its borders 
in a refugee camp near cologne they received clothes and about 
100 from the government 
we just stayed lazy and rode around the country krueger 
said 
matthias parents taking advantage of the new travel freedom 
crossed the border found the boys in the refugee camp on thursday 
and told them to come home 
matthias paessler made his own decision to return after a year 
and a half in west germany 
its not bad over there but you dream too much about making a 
career and all that said paessler back here its more 
secure 
living in a small bavarian village with his family proved 
frustrating 
the young people were cold he said they gave you strange 
looks if you didnt smoke hash with them the girls had this 
attitude of im so rich 
he worked odd jobs and made enough money to visit london 
belgium and canada but couldnt afford his own apartment in west 
germanys extremely tight housing market

washington the pay raise and ethics bill congress sent 
president bush early saturday has less pay and ethics for the 
senate than the house and many senators say their decision to 
take less of both will haunt them 
we have done exactly the wrong thing said sen tim wirth 
dcolo we have failed 
senate leaders spent friday imploring their colleagues to accept 
the plan passed by the house thursday to push 89500 
congressional salaries to at least 120800 in the next 13 months 
and then bar members from padding their income with speeches 
the house of representatives demonstrated courage said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
but a majority of senators didnt buy it privately it was said 
mitchell was three votes short 
so he and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas regrouped 
and pushed through a compromise to increase senators salaries only 
8900 and gradually over many years phase out the 
muchcriticized honoraria system 
sen alan simpson rwyo called it a safe chicken dance 
and predicted a new senate salaryhonoraria fight next year 
sen robert c byrd dwva said the senate demonstrated 
cowardice and made itself an even more elite institution for 
the wealthy than it already is we have failed the country we 
have failed the institution and we have failed its future he 
said 
the house which stayed in session past 1 am saturday awaiting 
senate action took about 30 seconds to send the bill to the 
president who is expected to sign it the bill gives bushs 
cabinetlevel aides and federal judges the same percentage raises 
as the house 
house and senate leaders waited until only a few days before the 
planned adjournment of congress for the year to push the package 
through compared to a failed attempt at a 51 percent pay hike 
early this year their strategy gave opponents little time to mount 
a campaign against it 
but consumer advocate ralph nader a critic of any congressional 
salary boost said that when the senate blinked at the house 
package it opened the door for opponents to win repeal later 
the disparity now between the house and the senate versions 
will further encourage next year a major repeal drive of the entire 
package and will probably affect the next election he predicted 
by careful design the biggest part of the house pay raise 25 
percent on jan 1 1991 is delayed until after next years 
elections that way members cannot be accused of voting themselves 
a whopping pay increase at least not one that takes effect before 
their constituents have a chance to express their displeasure at 
the voting booth next fall 
house members seemed comfortable with that delay and with 
getting rid of honoraria it was james madison who more than 200 
years ago suggested that congress approve pay raises for itself 
only to take effect in the next congress 
somehow i just have this visceral feeling we look better than 
the other body said house minority leader bob michel rill 
id be willing to bet a good deal that theyll be adjusting their 
own scenario within a year 
seven years ago in a similar situation the senate earned less 
than the house for about six months before passing a catchup raise 
the pay package finished saturday is quirky and complex and the 
senate will actually earn more than the house in 1990 before 
falling behind in 1991 
for the house the federal judges and government executives a 
41 percent raise will take effect as soon as bush signs a 
deficitreduction bill that congress hopes to send him by monday 
then on jan 1 the senate will take a 99 percent raise and 
the house and the others a 36 percent raise that would bring 
senate salaries to 98400 and house salaries to 96600 for 1990 
on jan 1 1991 the house will get a 25 percent raise to 
120800 both chambers also get whatever governmentwide cost of 
living adjustment is given at that time 
the house bans its members from pocketing honoraria checks in 
1991 but the senate which now allows its members to take more 
than the house decided to start now reducing honoraria 
dollarfordollar as its salary goes up over the years 
in 1990 house members can keep 26850 in honoraria the same 
as in 1989 the senate reduces its limit of 35800 to 26568 
for both chambers the legislation caps other outside earned 
income at 15 percent of salary and restricts lawmakers from being 
paid members of boards of directors or performing other 
professional services book royalties from legitimate publishers 
are exempted 
rules on accepting gifts and free travel from other than family 
are tightened 
in addition lawmakers and cabinetlevel administration 
officials are barred from lobbying in their old branches of 
government for a year after leaving office government employees 
who get special knowledge from working on treaties or trade 
agreements are barred from turning around and hiring out to private 
interests who need that knowledge 
however in a compromise with the bush administration the bill 
also softens recentlyenacted laws on government procurement that 
the administration contends are too burdensome

congress is a step away from abolishing the 
yearold medicare program designed to protect retirees against 
being bankrupted by the costs of a catastrophic illness 
senate negotiators reluctantly agreed saturday morning to a 
house demand that catastrophic coverage be repealed however a 
republican senator who led the battle to scale back the program 
vowed to use whatever tactic is available in the closing days of 
this years session to prevent repeal 
every elderly group in america has come out loud and clear 
that they do not want repeal sen john mccain rariz said 
after hearing of the negotiators action he indicated he will 
filibuster in an effort to keep part of the program alive 
repeal he said would be an incredible injustice starting in 
january people now in nursing facilities will be ejected after 
20 days mccain said as an example of what many of the nations 
32 million retirees will be losing by repeal 
republican leader bob dole of kansas also urged the senate to 
fight repeal 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee and a vocal opponent of repeal said there was a lot of 
deep disappointment in his committee starting with me because 
of the house negotiators refusal to back away from their 
insistence on repeal 
despite mccains filibuster threat repeal is considered nearly 
certain that is because if the repeal bill is rejected it is 
quite likely this late in the congressional year that the existing 
law would remain on the books few members of either house want 
that 
the house already has voted once for repeal by a lopsided 
margin although the bush administration has said it would prefer 
to keep the program intact congressional say they would expect 
president bush to sign a repeal bill 
the catastrophic health coverage was enacted with heavy 
bipartisan support last year as the largest expansion ever of the 
medicare program 
but catastrophic protection quickly ran into a barrage of 
complaints from some retirees many complained that they didnt 
need the new federal protection because they already have 
catastrophic coverage through a private plan or a retirement plan 
many higherincome retirees were outspoken against the program 
because they were hit with having to pay an income surtax of up to 
800 a year to finance most of the program they argued that such a 
health benefit should be paid for by all taxpayers not just 
middle and upperincome retirees 
the mail was so heavy against the program that the house had no 
trouble voting to repeal over objections of its democratic 
leadership the senate thwarted the repeal effort at first 
accepting instead a scaling back sponsored by mccain 
the mccain amendment would repeal the surtax and coverage for 
drugs and doctors fees but retain coverage for hospital bills 
those benefits and some relatively minor ones including hospice 
care and onceayear mammograms would be financed by continuing 
and increasing the flat 4 monthly premium paid by most retirees 
even if the law is wiped off the books catastrophic protection 
for many of the nations poorest retirees would continue being 
provided through the federalstate medicaid program 
the catastrophic program began providing coverage for hospital 
bills late jan 1 in the absence of repeal protection for 
doctors fees and some prescription drugs would begin next jan 1 
under the program a retiree could have an unlimited hospital 
stay and pay no more than 560 a year next year a persons 
outofpocket payments for doctors bills would be limited to 
1370 a year

a crowd estimated at 50000 shouted 
anticommunist slogans and burned portraits of the nations ousted 
leader saturday at the biggest independent protest rally in 
communist bulgarias history 
the magnitude of the rally the fact that it was officially 
sanctioned and the police indifference toward it underscored the 
fast speed of political change that has gripped this balkan nation 
since todor zhivkov was removed from power nov 10 
one participant called it a miracle 
the crowd in downtown sofia the capital cheered as sociologist 
petko simeonov called for free elections and freedom of speech 
at the end of the threehour demonstration they adopted by show 
of hands a declaration calling for an end to corruption the 
abolition of censorship release of political prisoners guarantees 
for freedom of religion and an end to police repression 
todor zhivkov has left us with empty shops corruption 
bureaucracy and despair said simeonov who is also a leading 
member of ecoglasnost an independent environmental group 
he demanded a criminal investigation and court action against 
zhivkov similar demands were heard during an official rally in 
sofia on friday 
the crowd reported by organizers to total some 50000 
responded by shouting zhivkov to court and down with zhivkov 
and his aides 
zhivkov was removed as communist party chief nov 10 and as head 
of state friday and several of his associates were removed from 
positions of power they included zhivkovs son vladimir who was 
kicked out as the head of the culture department in the central 
committee 
at a parliament session friday deputy slavcho trnski launched 
an unprecedented attack on zhivkov accusing him of indulging in a 
flamboyant lifestyle while bulgaria fell into economic crisis 
he said zhivkov owned 30 homes was hungry for fame and 
retained power for 35 years through a policy of divide and rule 
zhivkov 78 was replaced by petar mladenov 53 the former 
foreign minister who said in a french television interview 
broadcast friday that he supports free elections 
the sudden downfall of the hardline zhivkov was yet another 
major change to hit eastern europe in recent months it followed 
east germanys decision to open the berlin wall hungarys move 
toward democracy and the installment of a government in poland not 
led by communists 
the crowd carried hundreds of banners and sketches some showing 
zhivkov behind bars and with an adolf hitler mustache painted over 
his face some burned portraits of zhivkov and chanted 
anticommunist slogans 
the emotional gathering in sofia organized by bulgarias 
unofficial human rights and ecological groups was held on a vast 
square in front of the aleksander nevski orthodox cathedral 
this is the return of democracy in bulgaria and a miracle we 
have not seen for 45 years hristofor sebec a priest and 
ecoglasnost member told the associated press 
bulgaria is going toward democracy maybe even a multiparty 
system it will not be easy to reach that goal but we will 
manage said another bulgarian peter beron 
some banners read we are the victims of repression 
christ is our savior my family has nothing to eat and 
freedom and democracy now 
the crowd shouted we want a new constitution they also 
called out the name of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the 
architect of east bloc reforms mladenovs name was also heard but 
not so often 
the oneparty system is the symbol of totalitarian rule 
said radoy ralin bulgarias bestknown writer of satire and other 
prose and one of 15 speakers at the demonstration 
ralin and other speakers criticized what they called 
repression of ethnic turks under the zhivkov regime 
about 320000 bulgarian ethnic turks have fled ethnic and 
religious persecution here and settled in turkey 
hundreds of uniformed policemen some sitting in buses at a 
distance watched the crowd and listened to the fiery speeches 
without intervening 
indirect criticism of mladenov was heard as some speakers 
denounced newly elected politburo members handpicked by the new 
leader

ethiopian rebels say they have captured a 
small town 85 miles north of the capital of addis ababa and halted 
a government counterattack 
in a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in nairobi late 
friday the tigre peoples liberation front said its fighters took 
the town of meranya thursday and repulsed troops counterattacking 
southward from desse the capital of wollo province 
the rebel claims could not be independently verified the 
government in its own communique friday made no mention of 
fighting around meranya 
however the official ethiopian news agency said government 
forces repulsed recently an offensive by the tplf against desse 
from all fronts 
the government has rarely commented on the tigrean offensive 
which began in late august when the insurgents pushed southward out 
of tigre into wollo and neighboring gonder provinces 
if true the fronts claim means its forces have moved southward 
past desse a heavily armed government garrison that they were 
unable to capture in heavy fighting last month desse controls a 
vital junction on the road from addis ababa to assab one of only 
two ethiopian ports on the red sea 
the government and the rebel front met in rome last week for the 
first time in their 14yearold conflict but neither side has 
commented on what were described as preliminary peace talks 
the government is scheduled to meet in nairobi on monday with 
representatives of another major insurgency the eritrean peoples 
liberation front 
the eritreans have been fighting since 1961 for secession 
the tigreans say they want to replace ethiopias marxist regime 
with a democratic government although the tigrean rebel leadership 
itself is considered marxist

reestablish whitesonly admission policies at boksburgs main

nasa launched its last 
unmanned rocket saturday to sent a satellite on a mission to study 
how stars and galaxies evolved from the big bang that created 
the universe 15 billion years ago 
it was a joyful ride dennis mccarthy deputy project 
manager said after the 150 million cosmic background explorer 
spacecraft was placed in a orbit by a 116foot twostage delta 
rocket 
excessive wind between 17000 and 20000 feet delayed the 
blastoff for 10 minutes but at 634 am the 70 million rocket 
lifted off from space launch complex 2 and thundered into clear 
skies above this coastal military base 
it was magnificent nasa spokesman cj fenrick said the 
rocket as it was rising appeared like a bright fluorescent light 
and about seven seconds later we heard the sound of the rockets and 
saw a spiraling contrail of smoke 
the rockets nine strapon boosters fell into the pacific ocean 
west of the channel islands 
about an hour later the explorer was safely in a 559milehigh 
orbit after it was released by the deltas second stage seconds 
later the explorer deployed its antennas and large solar power 
panels to reach its full 16by28foot size 
the rocket is the last expendable unmanned rocket that nasa 
plans to launch except for space shuttles all future nasa 
payloads will be launched by either air force or privately owned 
rockets 
after a 30day shakedown the 4850pound explorer will start 
measuring microwaves heat and other cosmic background 
radiation left over from the big bang the explosion scientists 
say created the universe about 15 billion years ago 
it is the first space mission ever launched to probe the 
earliest stages of the universe said deputy project scientist 
nancy boggess well reach back further than any telescope or 
space mission has done before back to the time before there were 
stars before there were galaxies a time when the universe was 
very young 
the national aeronautics and space administration hopes explorer 
will produce the most comprehensive observations ever of the early 
universe and the processes that shaped it to form stars and 
galaxies 
it really is a search for our ultimate roots boggess said 
our planet is only 4 billion years old the universe is much 
older it would be nice to know when did stars and galaxies form 
from which our own planet and solar system formed 
nasa once planned to launch the explorer from a space shuttle 
but diverted it to the delta after the 1986 challenger explosion 
nasa stopped buying rockets in the early 1980s and decided to 
launch payloads from shuttles after its booster inventory was 
exhausted after the challenger explosion the space agency 
admitted it was wrong to rely on the shuttle but thenpresident 
reagan ordered the agency to stop launching commercial payloads and 
give such business to private industry 
launch commentator george diller said the rocket that carried 
the explorer was the 183rd delta launched by nasa the 189th delta 
ever launched including those sent into space by the air force 
and private companies and the 339th expendable rocket of any type 
launched by nasa 
to measure cosmic background radiation during its one to 
twoyear mission the explorer will use the most sensitive 
detectors of their types 
scientists believe that at the instant of creation a single 
point of matter exploded into a hot dense and extraordinarily 
uniform sphere of gas containing electrically charged particles 
that sphere eventually developed lumpiness that spawned the 
galaxies and stars 
the sphere still is expanding by measuring radiation from the 
distant sphere the explorer will actually look back in time 
in addition to the satellite and rocket explorer project costs 
include 160 million for personnel at nasas goddard space flight 
center in maryland and about 20 million for operations and data 
analysis through the end of the mission agency officials said

government troops backed by cannons 
and shoottokill orders claimed saturday to have defeated a new 
tamil militia accused of killing 38 moslem policemen in the eastern 
ampara district 
fighting that broke out early thursday tapered off saturday in a 
power struggle that followed last months departure of 4000 indian 
peacekeeping soldiers 
according to reports from the area the tamil militia initially 
attacked moslem policemen and civilians then the predominantly 
sinhalese sri lankan army backed by helicopter gunships swept in 
to rout the tamil militiamen 
about 70 people may have been killed in the two days of 
fighting according to reports from government officials and local 
residents 
on saturday hundreds of sri lankan soldiers moved into six 
camps used by the militia which calls itself the tamil national 
army freelance photojournalist jake gavin said from ampara 
gavin quoted an army brigadier as saying the situation in ampara 
was under control but at least 50 people had died 
the socalled tamil national army has been neutralized in 
ampara we have taken over their camps and we figure at least 500 
members of this illegal army were in existence in ampara and are 
now on the run the brigadier was quoted as saying he refused to 
give his name 
the government said earlier the tamil militiamen attacked four 
police stations within a 15mile radius of ampara early friday it 
said at least 18 policemen and soldiers and 25 militiamen died in 
the fighting in nearby kalmunai sammanturai akkaripattu and 
chavalakady 
gavin said residents reported at least 38 unarmed policemen were 
massacred in karativu alone early friday he said ampara residents 
adding up various reports believed at least 72 people died in 
fighting throughout the district 
the ampara district in on sri lankas east coast where the 
population is about equally divided among tamils sinhalese and 
moslems ampara is part of the area where tamil separatists tried 
to set up an independent homeland by massacring or driving out 
sinhalese in the mid1980s 
india has agreed to withdraw all its 40000 troops from sri 
lanka by dec 31 they were deployed in 1987 to help enforce a plan 
to grant tamils limited autonomy in the north and east the mainly 
hindu tamils say the predominantly buddhist sinhalese majority 
descriminates against them 
india was drawn into the internal affairs of its small island 
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own politically powerful 
tamil minority 
india was to supervise a surrender of arms by tamil guerrillas 
but the largest tamil militia the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam reneged on the deal indian soon found itself bogged down in 
a jungle war with the tamil tigers the same group that once found 
sanctuary on indian soil for its battle against sri lankas 
sinhalese majority 
sinhhalese make up 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
and tamils comprise 18 percent seven percent of the population is 
moslem a group largely immune from the ethnic violence until the 
last two years when they started coming under attack from tamil 
militants 
at least 11000 people including 1100 indian soldiers have 
died in the tamil separatist war since 1983

the voice of america the governmentoperated 
radio station has praised dramatic reforms under way in the 
eastern bloc but says they havent gone far enough according 
several recent editorials 
the us government welcomes the east german governments 
decision to open its borders to those wishing to emigrate or 
travel said one editorial written on nov 14 it is a step in 
the direction of a europe which is whole and free 
the voa part of the us information agency broadcasts in 43 
languages to countries abroad its charter forbids it from 
broadcasting in the united states 
voa allows outsiders to review its editorials take notes on 
them and print material from them but they cant be photocopied 
michael g gartner the president of nbc news says voas 
decision to grant anyone access to the editorials and to print from 
them stems from a policy change that resulted from a federal 
lawsuit he filed in des moines last year the suit was later 
dismissed 
voa officials contend their policies remain unchanged but they 
acknowledge theyve taken step to make sure open procedures are 
followed 
several recent editorials which are identified as reflecting 
the views of the us government underscore other statements from 
some us officials that they were taken by surprise by the pace of 
the rapidfire changes such as the opening of the berlin wall last 
weekend 
for instance on oct 28 the voa said the east german 
government had made only vague promises in response to its 
citizens demands for freedom and democracy 
it praised hungarys reforms and added there is a profound 
lesson for the east german government in the hungarian example 
on nov 5 a week before the east germans opened the 28yearold 
berlin wall a voa editorial said the east german leadership has 
far to go in establishing freedom of travel to all countries as a 
fundamental right protected by law 
many of the recent refugees chose to flee chose to flee their 
homeland because they have no faith in communist party leader egon 
krenz promise to carry out reforms the editorial said 
it continued as one refugee said krenz is making a lot of 
promises but we do not believe him we do not see any future and 
certainly not for our children 
while thousands of east germans who fled the country primarily 
though czechoslovakia before the dismantling of the berlin wall 
have remained in the west millions of east berliners simply 
crossed over the border for a visit before returning home 
the nov 14 editorial pushed for further reforms in east 
germany including free elections a free press independent trade 
unions marketoriented changes and parliamentary control of the 
countrys security police 
reports from east germany on nov 15 indicated leaders had 
agreed on some reforms like liberal foreign trade rules more 
private enterprise reduced central planning and a greater role for 
women 
often the editorials stress the evils of communism 
in discussing the opening of the wall the voa said the 
structure has been a monument to the failure of communism for 28 
years and last weekends events are now confirming that failure 
another editorial oct 7 said october 7 is the 40th 
anniversary of the establishment of east germany but for the 
government of erich honecker there is little cause for celebration 
forty years after its creation communist east germany has 
clearly failed to establish itself as an acceptable alternative to 
democratic west germany 
quoting president bush the editorial said the united states 
looks forward to the day that germans will not have to climb 
fences freeze in embassy courtyards or dodge bullets in order to 
enjoy the fruits of a free society

providing special prosecutors in the investigation into the fatal 
shootings of two 13yearold immigrant boys by a police officer 
after a stolencar chase 
prosecutors robert stanich and mary theisen of the attorney 
generals criminal division will present the case to a dakota 
county grand jury as early as dec 4 officials said 
the grand jury will be asked whether police officer kenneth e 
murphy 54 was justified in firing the shotgun blast that killed 
thai yang and basee lor both of st paul on wednesday 
the boys were shot in the back from about 30 yards away while 
fleeing through a field in suburban inver grove heights after 
abandoning a stolen car that had been chased there investigators

the united states since then primarily to california and 
minnesota and some have suffered joblessness and adjustment 
problems since being resettled 
two community meetings have been scheduled to deal with anger 
among asianamericans in the twin cities following the shooting 
deaths 
murphy told investigators he fired after yang turned toward him 
and held up what murphy thought was a gun it was a screwdriver 
investigators said 
if the shooting is deemed unjustified the grand jury could 
indict murphy on criminal charges deputy attorney general steve 
kilgriff said kilgriff would not be more specific 
murphys lawyer paul rogosheske said if theyre saying the 
shooting is unjustified he could be convicted of murder 
state law forbids officers from using deadly force unless it is 
necessary to protect themselves or others from death or great harm 
or to arrest or capture a felon who has killed or greatly harmed 
someone

departments internal affairs file for the past five years contains 
no complaints against murphy

a roadside blast killed three 
british soldiers on patrol in northern ireland on saturday hours 
after a car bomb at an english garrison town injured an army 
sergeant and his wife 
the sergeant lost both legs in the explosion essex county 
police said 
no one immediately claimed responsibility but police and the 
home office suspected the irish republican army which has targeted 
army installations in england and continental europe as well as 
northern ireland in its bloody campaign to drive the british out of 
the province 
the british army patrol was in two armored landrovers in the 
foothills of the mourne mountains about six miles from the irish 
republic when an explosive device was detonated apparently from 
beside the road the royal ulster constabulary said 
the blast hurled the first vehicle off the road all the 
casualties were in that vehicle police said the men in the second 
vehicle ecaped injury 
helicopters flew into the area to help the injured soldiers but 
three died before they could be treated police said a fourth was 
seriously injured and hospitalized in belfast 
at the british army headquarters for eastern england in 
colchester 50 miles northeast of london a car bomb exploded as 
offduty staff sgt andrew mudd and his wife were setting out from 
the parking area at the married quarters police said the two were 
dragged from the burning wreckage of their car by a lieutenant who 
was driving past witnesses said 
one neighbor said the car was a mass of flames 
ronald tuckwell who lives nearby said he saw the car on fire 
from his bedroom window people had pulled the occupants out when 
there was a sudden burst of flames and the whole car was 
engulfed he said 
his neighbor john clouting said the front of the car was 
blown apart i could not see very much because of the smoke 
i knew people had been injured because someone was carrying a 
white quilt to put over them i could hear screams it sounded like 
a child but it could have been a woman 
army spokesman gordon williams said the soldier involved was 
off duty i suppose he would be going shopping with his wife doing 
the normal saturday things 
the couple were taken to colchester general hospital where 
general manager mark shackell said mudd had lost both legs and was 
in serious condition in the intensive therapy unit after 4 hours 
of surgery he said mudds wife whose name was not released 
suffered relatively minor injuries 
david waddington the home office secretary blamed the outlawed 
ira which is trying to end british rule in the predominantly 
protestant province and unite it with the roman catholic irish 
republic 
they will never be allowed to achieve by the bomb and the 
bullet what they cannot achieve through the ballot box 
waddington said 
authorities sealed off part of colchester the thirdlargest 
garrison town in britain houses near the scene of the blast were 
evacuated as bomb squad officers conducted an investigation 
about 4500 troops are based at colchester which is army 
headquarters for the 11county eastern district 
the ministry of defense stepped up security at military 
establishments across britain after the sept 22 ira bombing at the 
royal marines music school in deal southeast england that killed 
11 men 
the ira has also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks 
on british servicemen and their families in west germany a 
soldiers wife was killed this summer and a 6monthold girl died 
last month with her father a royal air force corporal in an ira 
attack 
since the provinces sectarian fighting began in 1969 266 
police 601 army personnel and 1902 civilians have been killed

the american labor movement staged an 
impressive show of solidarity last week but such a celebration 
might prove difficult to arrange again unless the mounting 
complaints of minorities are addressed 
blacks and hispanics are a vital constituency if unions hope to 
grow yet they still are largely excluded from labors leadership 
women too have had their share of disputes with the 
federation but won a partial victory last week in moving the 
federation closer to taking a position in the volatile debate over 
abortion 
black and hispanics labor activists however left the aflcios 
biennial convention emptyhanded and frustrated by what they deem 
the hypocrisy of federation leaders who denounce supreme court 
decisions seen as setbacks to affirmative action but refuse to 
broaden minority representation in their ranks 
i leave this convention a disillusioned delegate but not a 
defeated trade unionist oscar sanchez of the united steelworkers 
union said after hispanics failed again to win a seat on 
federations governing executive council despite constituting 10 
percent of the aflcios 141 million members we will return 
black labor leaders who saw their representation on the 
33member board fall by one seat expressed similar frustration 
saying recruitment of minorities for unions could suffer unless 
blacks and hispanics are welcomed into the council which consists 
of two black men three white women and 28 white men 
the complaints come at a time of clear evidence that the 
hispanic work force is expanding rapidly an estimated 8 million 
hispanics are working but not members of unions and that blacks 
are more likely to join unions than whites labor department 
figures for 1988 show that 23 percent of employed blacks were union 
members compared to 16 percent for both whites and hispanics the 
modest 90000 growth of union membership last year was entirely 
attributable to blacks whose membership in unions rose by 114000 
to offset declines among both whites and hispanics 
it is very difficult for us to understand why hispanics are 
not represented on the highest council said jack otero vice 
president of the transportation and communications union 
that exclusion makes it difficult to convince unorganized 
hispanics that joining unions is in their best interests sanchez 
otero and other hispanic labor leaders said in an unusual public 
criticism of the federations leadership during the convention 
aflcio president lane kirkland said he and other members of the 
council were deeply cognizant of the contributions of hispanics 
and hoped to soon add one to the council privately some of the 
hispanic leaders said they were growing tired of such vague 
commitments 
it is a question of credibility said william lucy 
secretary treasurer of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees and president of the coalition of black trade 
unionists its difficult for me to say we in the labor movement 
are sensitive to the needs of black workers when we do not have 
fair representation at the highest level 
lucy said hispanics deserve the next vacancy on the council but 
that blacks should not have to wait for at least one and preferably 
two or more slots the coalition last week demanded a meeting with 
kirkland who is expected to agree to the request soon 
it has to come from him in a determined way lucy said 
if lane said we must do this i want it done and done now then 
it would happen 
kirkland in a recent interview said i hope in time we can 
deal with that when asked about demands for expanded minority 
representation on the council 
he said he hoped the progress would come naturally through 
election of minorities to presidencies of affiliated unions 
positions from which virtually all of the council members are drawn 
both of the blacks who serve on the council gene upshaw and 
john sturdivant are presidents of their unions but prospects for 
more blacks rising to such posts with major unions in the near 
future appear dim 
in the meantime lucy says kirkland must back up his stated 
commitment with action suggesting the council be expanded by 
several seats to allow for addition of an hispanic and at least one 
more black 
kirkland added seats in the past to appoint a black women and to 
allow the teamsters a seat when they rejoined the federation but 
this year allowed a death and retirements to bring the number back 
down to 33 
i see no magic to the number 33 lucy said its not that 
lane is antiblack or antihispanic what he is is protradition 
but these are not traditional times 
lucy avoids talk of racism but when asked whether he thought a 
majority of council members shared his goals he laughed and said 
no im sure most of them like things just the way they are 
lucy blames the lack of progress on a system that allows the 
executive council in closed sessions to handpick candidates for 
rare vacancies 
we are not fairly represented in the room to begin with and 
then the dealing starts he said things just arent going to 
change with the current process and things have to change

communist party leader egon krenz was too 
busy to receive him but otherwise all went well for a swami who 
returned to east berlin on saturday to retrace a bizarre flight 
over the berlin wall six years ago 
officials at east berlins government headquarters on the 
neardeserted marx engels platz were nonplussed but welcoming when 
swami vishnu devananda showed up in his flowing pink and orange 
peace robes to present a thankyou message to krenz for opening the 
berlin wall 
theyre swearing in the new government right now times are 
changing and mr krenz is a bit busy an official at the 
headquarters explained but well see he gets the letter 
swami devananda later said he received a personal welcome from 
krenz as the party leader left the building but there was no 
official confirmation 
the swami head of the svinanda yoga vendata sect based in 
canada was arrested last time he dropped by in 1983 
on that visit he flew over the wall from west berlin in a 
motorized kite with a bunch of flowers landed in a field outside 
the eastern sector and after six hours under arrest was sent back 
over the wall 
on saturday the 62yearold swami drove through the checkpoint 
charlie border post offering a homemade peace passport the 
border guard turned that down examined the real one and then waved 
the silverhaired swami and three followers through 
at the government building guards smiled cheerfully when the 
swami settled down on the sidewalk for a yoga session 
youre very happy now last time everyone was uptight he 
said 
in his letter to krenz the swami asked for the motorized kite 
back but officials told his followers earlier in the week that it 
had been destroyed 
on friday the swami released peace balloons and pigeons at the 
wall in a day of commemoration that went wrong 
the balloons and most of the pigeons flew west and a model plane 
built to commemorate the original flight crashed twice before 
buzzing round the west berlin airstrip from where he took off 
secretly in 1983

congress is eyeing several measures to provide 
more protection for americans pension plans but it faces warnings 
that employers will start bailing out if confronted with 
increased regulation 
there are already some laws with a level of complexity that 
the experts cant even figure out said paula calimafde a tax 
lawyer and president of the small business council of america 
congress in 1974 enacted the historic employee retirement income 
security act to protect retirees from abuses in their pension 
plans already complex at its birth the law has remained fluid and 
further changes are proposed 
in moving to reshape the system lawmakers must walk a fine line 
between strengthening protection for workers and retirees and 
creating even more complicated laws that could cause some employers 
to terminate plans 
increasing regulations make it more difficult said kathy 
utgoff the former head of the pension benefit guaranty 
corporation which is the federal insurer of pension funds 
people will start bailing out she warns 
the nations private pension system is huge with assests of 2 
trillion in plans that cover 76 million americans 
the measures before congress cover a host of pension issues 
some would limit employers ability to drain surpluses from pension 
funds one would increase the premium companies pay to the pension 
benefit guaranty corporation which is 15 billion in the red 
still others would increase penalties for violations and require 
more thorough auditing 
one of the most pressing issues is regulation of surplus money 
in pension plans many programs grew during the years of a rising 
bull stock market now the excess dollars are an inviting target 
for corporate raiders or managements seeking to pay off debts 
rep tom lantos dcalif refers to the pension surpluses as 
an almost irresistable unguarded bank vault 
since 1980 about 20 billion in these overfunded pension 
assets have been taken out of funds by employers in pension 
parlance this is called reversion 
current law says a surplus can be taken only if a plan is 
terminated and has enough money to pay off its obligations to 
retirees 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio has proposed legislation that 
would require employers to establish a new pension plan before 
withdrawing money from the old one 
rep augustus f hawkins has introduced a bill that would allow 
the excess money to be transferred into health programs 
last week rep bill hughes dnj held a oneday hearing in 
his select committee on aging to look into charges of possible 
fraud and abuse in the system those warnings have been coming from 
the labor departments own inspector generals office 
the acting inspector general raymond maria told the hearing 
there is a window of opportunity for fraud because of lax 
enforcement of existing laws dependance on civil rather than 
criminal remedies and inadequate audits of plan reports 
an assistant labor secretary george david ball said he would 
look into marias recommendations but testified that the pension 
system has never been healthier 
hughes dismissed such assurances saying i heard the same 
sectors saying the savings and loan situation wasnt serious five 
years ago he called the amount of money in the system an 
invitation to disaster 
hughes said stricter enforcement is needed to identify 
violators unless we have criminal penalties severe criminal 
penalties for those who commit egregious offenses youre not going 
to deter he said 
he is asking the general accounting office to examine some 1600 
pension plan investigations handled by the labor department in 
1988 only 23 of those were classified as criminal cases 
hughes said he doesnt believe increased legislation would cause 
employers any undue hardships you hear the same argument any 
time you tighten laws 
but dallas l salisbury president of the employee benefit 
research institute a trade group said in an interview there 
must be a balance between enough regulation and enough reporting 
to not have fraud and not make it so overwhelming in your effort to 
do so 
there appear to be no definitive figures on how many small 
businesses opt out of pension plans because of regulation the 
federal insurer received notificaion of 10790 terminations in 
plans of all sizes in 1988 
hazel witte of the us small business administration said it is 
completing a study on the subject 
lisa phillips an aide to lantos said congress must not push 
too hard employers already are burdened with paperwork and 
auditing expenses she said 
there is no law requiring a pension fund when you regulate 
it you get withdrawals she said

until recently kids at the crook manor 
housing project fed their drug habits there 
teenagers hawked cocaine on the street and in the back 
hallways toddlers played on patchy lawns that were nothing but 
needles and weeds mothers tapped the grapevine to find out when 
someone was carrying a gun in the project so they could haul their 
children indoors 
eight murders in eight years was the unofficial slogan 
but three years ago crook manor began its own cinderella story 
with a 6 million grant from the us department of housing and 
urban development 
today the big drug deals are history the place has new sod new 
paint and a new name galego court the 450 tenants can join 
tutoring and antidrug programs field trips to baseball games and 
a youth group that holds dances theres also a guardhouse at the 
entrance manned by an offduty policemen to keep out unwanted 
visitors and strict rules on who may live there 
as a result small children play outside in safety and while 
the stain of the projects bad reputation means 12yearold monique 
bentil still cant persuade fearful school friends to sleep over 
residents say they wouldnt live anywhere else 
they got new people and the place is unbelievable said 
angel roman a disabled truck driver who is president of the galego 
court tenants association the groups members meet once a month 
learning grassroots democracy and selfesteem as they go along 
there are people here that are poor people said roman 45 
but they are decent people now they have a nice home 
the change is so stunning the project has won national public 
housing awards including one from hud this month some have 
suggested its too good to be true and it wont last 
its a very fragile success story acknowledges john 
burgess who as head of the pawtucket housing authority has 
orchestrated crook manors makeover 
the most important word in this fight is attitudes when you 
convert tenants to your way of thinking burgess said its a 
long process but the tenants became believers 
burgess knows that chasing out the drug dealers only moved the 
problem up the road that doesnt solve the national drug 
problem but i cant do that 
galego court the name like the unfortunate crook label is 
that of a local dignitary has 15 brick and clapboard buildings 
opened in 1953 on a former dump in this industrial city of 70000 
north of providence 
for urban public housing it is a small complex a key to its 
upgrading was making it even smaller the original 228 one to 
fivebedroom units were reduced to 164 mostly by closing off 
thirdstory units the remodeling also included replacing 
troublesome hallways with outside entrances for each apartment 
during the remodeling troublesome tenants were evicted now 
prospective tenants must pass a strict background check and for the 
first six months submit to monthly inspections which their children 
must attend 
those who lived here during the worst troubles in 198385 
describe a place where teenagers paced the road that snakes around 
the project pressing drugs on everyone who dared to enter the 
property dealers fought over customers and over prices car 
windshields got smashed when a seller was turned down one man was 
shot in the back for turning a peddler down 
crook manor was a major transfer point for cocaine shipments 
between new york providence and boston said police cmdr richard 
delyon the place was rocking and rolling delyon said and 
youngsters used drugs like candy it would be like popsicle 
land 
during the renovation many guns were found hidden behind 
kitchen appliances he added 
cynthia clayton grew up in crook manor and got tangled in the 
wildness 
childhood was people hanging out drugs guns and shooting 
said ms clayton now 20 it was hard because i got in with it 
im always one of those people that follow 
at 14 she had a cocaine habit at 15 she was punching her 
mother they fought and filed charges against each other at 16 she 
quit drugs but a year later she quit school now she is expecting a 
baby and unemployed but cynthia has joined her mother shirley 49 
in studying for a high school diploma through classes at the 
project 
mrs clayton calls her daughter my mouthpiece but urged to 
speak up the resident of 20 years said the improvements please 
her too 
all in all mrs clayton said its a lot better will it 
last god only knows that she said

a super saturday for woolworths was a lost 
weekend for its snootier neighbors on west berlins elegant 
kurfuerstendamm shopping strip 
for the second straight weekend east berliners jammed the 
sidewalks around the kudamm as the street is known until 
police blocked off streets to handle the overflow 
were the ones who feel walled in complained a manager at 
leiser a store with little choice but to push cheap sneakers 
instead of expensive footware on the street named after ranking 
german princes of the holy roman empire 
east germans with their 54 of welcome money from the west 
german government couldnt afford the more expensive fare 
trash bins were full to the brim with beer bottles pop cans and 
banana skins a reminder that east berliners call west germany a 
banana republic and mean it as a compliment because the 
tropical fruit is so rare back home 
there were no free bottles of champagne this weekend but there 
was the same feeling of good cheer and even a little nostalgia for 
the giddy days just after the opening of the berlin wall on nov 9 
sidewalk merchants hawked tshirts and buttons bearing the magic 
nov 9 date and the boast ich war dabei i was there 
katrin kupfer 16 and three companions from dresden said they 
had each spent all of their 54 of welcome money from the west 
german government buying clothes and a walkman and saving money by 
sleeping all night in a shopping center 
when i got here i thought i was hallucinating there were so 
many lights she said at 3 am people are still coming and 
going here at home forget it

the silent majority of 
salvadorans who never have taken sides with the rightist 
government or the leftist guerrillas are damning them both for 
turning their neighborhoods into battlegrounds 
fear and desperation have the run of bloody streets barely 
traveled by city dwellers who live day in and day out through 
combat and curfew the massacre and mutilation of six priests all 
prominent educators added to the terror 
speaking with a reporter friday in the capitals battleravaged 
soyapango district the father of a family of five criticized both 
the government for sending warplanes to rocket and strafe his block 
and the dugin guerrillas who converted the neighborhood into a 
military objective 
asked his name he provided it and the reporter wrote it down 
in his notebook 
wait a minute the man said and calmly took pen and pad 
from the journalists hand and blacked out his name 
theyll come and get me and ill end up like her he 
explained nodding toward a girl about 13 years old lying dead six 
feet away 
the girl had ventured out in search of food during a lull in 
combat and was felled apparently by a stray bullet 
it has been battle after battle since some 2000 farabundo marti 
national liberation front rebels descended on san salvador and its 
1 million people on the evening of nov 11 and turned it into a war 
zone 
about 2000 more attacked dozens of targets in other parts of 
the country the fighting here and elsewhere continued throughout 
the week and relief workers have been unable to evacuate the 
wounded or remove bodies 
the fighting slackened saturday allowing thousands of exhausted 
residents to evacuate with their children and whatever possessions 
they could carry 
casualty figures are sketchy hospital and military sources 
estimate that more than 800 people have been killed and 2000 
wounded 
in the combat zones decomposing bodies lie here and there 
shiny bloated semblances of human bodies a nauseating odor filling 
the air 
were not with one side or the other thank god marta 
rodriguez said as she and her family closed their house in the 
devastated soyapango section of conacaste scene of some of the 
fiercest alleytoalley and housetohouse fighting and fled the 
area 
each of her family of five had eaten one tortilla with a few 
sips of coffee thursday when they ran out of everything except a 
gallon of water 
the facade of their humble cinderblock home was cratered with 
bullet and shrapnel holes the yellow metal door sporting seven 
bullet holes and part of the roof blown off 
the two sides must join in a heartfelt dialogue they must 
abandon the idea of dialogue as something strategic said carlos 
her husband 
it is a call echoed by many here and in the rest of central 
america to end the 10yearold civil war that has killed more than 
70000 people most of them civilians 
in one of the wars most barbaric acts a death squad entered 
the jesuitrun central american university on the citys southern 
edge before dawn thursday and broke into the residence where the 
rector the vicerector and four other educators were sleeping 
the victims all members of the society of jesus were awakened 
slaughtered and their brains removed 
it was a pointed message to other intellectuals who like the 
progressive priests sought to elaborate on the need for change in 
a society that has benefited few while condemning the great 
majority to ignorance misery and early death 
university officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms 
enter the priests residence just before the shooting however the 
usbacked rightwing government denounced the killings and said 
it would investigate 
a state of siege suspending most individual liberties and 
guarantees has been in effect a week in many regards the measure 
does not affect the lives of the poor whose right to life and 
liberty much less the pursuit of happiness has never been paid 
more than lip service 
the measure imposes censorship and voids freedom of expression 
it also has drastically altered radio programming and the 
radio is in most cases the poor salvadorans only link to the world 
beyond his adobe house cornfield or slum 
the government has obliged all stations to plug into an official 
network on which enthusiastic announcers describe a capital 
rapidly returning to normal of stoic and smiling workers and 
homemakers resuming their routines 
the government says its got everything under control that 
everything is fine said another man in soyapango who like 
hundreds of desperate residents was out looking for some place to 
buy some beans or bread 
but were being badly informed as you can see for yourself 
he said pointing two blocks down the road where guerrillas with 
assault rifles and a grenadelauncher manned a barricade that 
isolated the district

the only gynecologist 
serving an area of 110000 people has left without warning just 
one indication of how the exodus of east germans to the west has 
caused a health care crisis 
this is dramatic of course dr hanns wohlfarth the acting 
chief district physician said of the gynecologists departure to 
the west from karl marx stadt 
by the end of september before the government suddenly dropped 
travel barriers 100 doctors and 500 other medical staff had left 
the karl marx stadt district wohlfarth said friday in an interview 
with the associated press 
the districts combined areas have a population of 2 million 
people 
he added that the subsequent opening of routes to the west made 
it certain that the number has doubled by now and may have 
increased even further 
other authorities estimate that 10 percent of east germanys 
doctors have emigrated either legally or illegally wohlfarth said 
karl marx stadt a city in southern east germany is among the 
hardest hit 
in some hospitals there is an emergency situation he said 
citing the example of one nurse doing the work of four 
but he said vital functions including intensive care and urgent 
surgery have not been affected so far 
this is partly because hundreds of people have been switched 
from other jobs to replace ambulance drivers technicians and 
administrative staff who left he said about 300 army conscripts 
are expected to join the support staff soon 
wohlfarth a practicing dermatologist and a member of the 
communist party said he was personally shocked by the 
departure of the doctors 
he said it would be a genuine help if young doctors from 
west germany would temporarily replace those who had left 
but it is much more important that the many east german 
doctors and dentists who left come back think of their medical 
ethics and above all think of the patients they left behind he 
said

solidarity leader lech walesa who 10 years 
ago was inspired by the vision of a peaceful revolution in the 
soviet bloc is telling americans now that he foresees a united 
europe without cold war divisions 
the wall that was separating people from freedom has 
collapsed walesa told congress last week in a speech celebrating 
his success not only in creating free unions in poland but in 
forging the first noncommunist government in the soviet bloc 
the end of a divided europe has long been a us policy refrain 
but american decisionmakers are being forced to examine the 
prospect anew and quickly given the rapid changes under way in 
poland hungary and east germany symbolized by the opening of the 
berlin wall 
the wall itself is a paradox it is an abnormal 
situation walesa said in an interview 
the reforms in poland and hungary should lead to a political and 
economic integration of europe a europe in which there are no 
borders walesa said he said that with the destruction of the 
berlin wall east and west germany should be reunited 
the german problem must be solved but as part of the 
integration of the whole of europe and not against anybody he 
said 
not on the nazi model not the stalin model but a new and 
wiser model that has to bring peace tranquility said walesa 
who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 
east european reformers have been inspired in part by the 
economic integration of western europe planned for 1992 said 
francis fukiyama a deputy director of the state department policy 
planning staff 
if you look at poland and hungary the prospect of being left 
behind as the train leaves the station will stimulate the 
introduction of market economies fukiyama said friday in a 
speech to the american association for the advancement of science 
integration of the european economic community is likely to 
heal the divisions of europe he said we do look forward to 
the ec playing an important political was well an economic role 
meanwhile walesa said in a television interview on cnns 
newsmaker saturday that a goal of his visit to the united 
states was to prove to demonstrate that the changes in eastern 
europe are irreversible 
i have come to prove that eastern europe offers great 
opportunities for business right now walesa said 
he reiterated that europe is one and must be integrated 
primarily it must be integrated economically so that it would be a 
profitable solution for all if political solutions are followed 
and economic solutions are put off there wont be enough time for 
those for economic solutions 
walesas concept of an undivided europe sounds a bit like soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs vision of a common european 
home 
and president bush expressed similar sentiments in a letter to 
gorbachev on friday said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
he said the united states wants a calm and peaceful period of 
change in eastern europe as poland hungary and east germany seek 
to implement their reforms the president said he believes these 
historic steps will make a positive contribution to a europe that 
is whole and free fitzwater said 
walesa steering poland away from 45 years of what he calls 
destructive soviet control clearly does not envision a europe 
under the russian or german domination 
german reunification is a complicated problem he said 
adding that two world wars in this century started because of 
german expansionism 
i remember how much europe and the world paid for nazism 
said walesa noting that poland was the first nation invaded by the 
armies of adolf hitler 
although he praised gorbachev walesa was not willing to forget 
the brutality of josef stalin who imposed communist rule on poland 
and the other nations of eastern europe 
discussing solidaritys efforts to dismantle polands 
sovietstyle economic and political system walesa said our task 
is viewed with understanding by our eastern neighbors and their 
leader mikhail gorbachev 
this understanding lays foundations for new relations between 
poland the ussr much better than before these improved mutual 
relations will also contribute to stabilization and peace in 
europe removing useless tensions walesa told congress

day after her 35th birthday in 1909 hospital records described her 
problem as posttyphoid psychosis a term that isnt recognized 
by doctors today

her past she sleeps about 16 hours a day has a strong heart

bedroom and the woman was in a bedroom by herself

mob bosses probably ordered the killing of a 
lowlevel associate accused of murdering a federal drug agent this 
year authorities said saturday 
mob justice isnt always swift but its always deadly and 
this may be an example of deadly mob justice james fox head of 
the new york fbi office said at a news conference 
costabile gus farace 29 was shot friday night as he sat in 
a car the same manner in which he was accused of killing everett 
hatcher a drug enforcement administration agent who was posing as 
a drug buyer 
hatchers death feb 28 sparked a manhunt that involved up to 
100 federal agents working seven days a week and it prbably made 
the mafia bosses angry said us attorney andrew maloney 
its reasonable to assume all of that pressure could have 
resulted in last nights shooting maloney said the intensity 
of the investigation never faltered it was a full court press as 
recently as yesterday 
farace also was to be featured sunday as the countrys no 1 
fugitive on the fox network television show americas most 
wanted 
maloney described farace who was paroled in 1988 after serving 
eight years for a kidnapmurder as a young punk associated 
with the bonanno and colombo crime groups 
i think its reasonable to assume organized crime figures were 
aware of the intensity of the investigation maloney said i 
assume that people higher up were as interested in finding him as 
we were 
robert stutman head of the deas new york office said a 
rational and prudent person would obviously believe that this is 
probably a mob hit the investigation is continuing i cant say 
that for sure 
stutman said farace who grew a beard and dyed his hair red 
while hiding out apparently never left new york city he said 
agents at times had come within two hours of farace but he always 
disappeared with the help of mob associates 
authorities hoped that by capturing farace they could make him 
the first defendant to face the death penalty under a new federal 
drug law stutman said 
it would have been nice to see him sitting there and 
squirming knowing hed never see the streets again stutman said 
hatcher 46 was shot to death in february on staten island 
after he went to meet farace to set up a cocaine deal in an 
undercover operation authorities said 
on friday farace was sitting in the front passenger seat of a 
car double parked on a brooklyn street when a van pulled alongside 
about 11 pm seven to nine shots were fired into the car maloney 
said 
farace was found dead the driver joseph sclafani who had been 
hit in the chest three times got out of the car and fired a few 
shots from his 38caliber handgun at the fleeing van maloney said 
sclafani 24 was listed in critical condition at coney island 
hospital

motorists cheered tooted their horns and 
raised victory signs as the bay bridge reopened exactly one month 
after an earthquake ruptured the main artery between oakland and 
san francisco 
what a moment youve just got to be here said roger 
mccune of piedmont among the first motorists to pay his 1 toll 
and head across the 53yearold bridge at 11 pm friday its 
something we had to do 
six california highway patrol cars and 13 bay bridge toll 
trucks sirens wailing and lights flashing led the first cars in a 
triumphant procession westbound across the empty upper deck to san 
francisco 
ever since the quake shut the 85mile bridge the worlds 
longest highlevel span bay area commuters have suffered through 
choking gridlocks on the bays four other bridge crossings 
the bay area rapid transit set ridership records as the huge 
disclocation drove workers by the thousands from their cars the 
emergency also geared up ferry runs not seen for 30 years ever 
since the bridges killed the ferries some groups have organized to 
try and keep the ferries going 
im going to keep this forever a laughing darin holzen of 
suburban pinole said waving his toll receipt many cars rolled by 
with occupants waggling vvictory signs out the windows or giving a 
thumbsup 
the joyful scene was a stark contrast to the grim instant at 
504 pm on oct 17 when a 71magnitude quake centered 70 miles 
away jolted the area killing 66 people and causing an estimated 7 
billion in damage 
the temblor sent a 50footlong 250ton section of the upper 
deck crashing onto the lower deck killing one woman in a car 
technicians and engineers rushed to complete a 25 million 
repair job that ordinarily might be expected to take months instead 
of weeks included in the job was 18 months worth of scheduled 
maintenance that left the bridge sporting a shiny new coat of 
silver paint 
especially pleased at the festive reopening was sam hassoun a 
structural engineer with the california department of 
transportation who had been working on the bridge every day for a 
month 
im more than happy he said at the toll plaza wearing his 
orange reflective vest and hard hat everything is aok 
its almost like a grand opening celebration bridge toll 
captain john sant said surveying 17 operating toll lanes 
although the bridge is back in the commute loop workbound 
motorists arent going to have much of a picnic on monday because 
important freeway connections on both sides of the bay are still 
knocked out they include the collapsed portion of interstate 880 
in west oakland where the greatest number of quake victims 
perished 
we had a traffic problem here even before the quake said 
bob halligan a spokesman for the transportation department now 
people will have to decide if they want to sit in their cars for 
hours on the bay bridge or do they want to get to work

cleanup of oil from a greek cargo ship 
that ran aground in the bering sea will begin sometime next week 
with the startup time depending largely on the weather the coast 
guard said 
representatives of the coast guard and the ships owner went to 
the scene friday to assess options for oil cleanup and the ships 
salvage 
the 485foot milos reefer ran aground in 57 mph winds and 
22foot seas late tuesday off st matthew island about 250 miles

plant employees who have contracted cancer indicate there is a 
consistent pattern of exposure to radioactive materials an 
attorney said saturday 
thirteen of the 14 men have died of cancerrelated illnesses 
and the 14th had surgery for bladder cancer said attorney bruce 
deboskey who is handling their workers compensation cases 
there is a consistent pattern of accidents injuries and 
exposure to radiation that has put these mens lives at risk he 
said 
the 14 men were involved in plutonium processes used in the 
manufacture of triggers for nuclear weapons at the troubled rocky 
flats plant some of the cases date back to the early 1950s just 
after the plant was opened deboskey said 
ed heintz a spokesman for rockwell international which 
operates the plant for the energy department declined to comment 
on the allegations saturday citing ongoing litigation and federal 
privacy act restrictions 
we dont discuss health issues as they relate to our employees 
simply because it would violate their privacy heintz said 
rocky flats is one of 17 facilities in the does nuclear weapons 
complex 
in recent months the plant has been the target of a criminal 
probe into allegations of illegal hazardous wastes disposal a 
federal grand jury is considering evidence gathered in the case 
but it has not issued any indictments 
doe is in the process of replacing rockwell as the plants 
contractor egampg inc of massachusetts is scheduled to take over 
operations jan 1 
deboskey a civil ligitator with the law firm of silver and 
deboskey said he has filed eight workers compensation cases 
involving rocky flats employees in the past decade 
he has won two settled one out of court and lost two in the 
past two months deboskey has finished trial work on two other 
cases which are awaiting a ruling from an administrative law 
judge one case is pending in the court of appeals 
the cases name as defendants doe dow chemical co which 
operated the plant until 1975 and rockwell which took over 
management from dow 
two additional cases will be ready for trial next fall and he 
is looking into possible litigation involving four other workers 
he said 
each case is different he said some of these men have 
had autopsies in which the tissues were tested for the presence of 
radiation typically we find it easier to win a case where we know 
how much radiation was in the body at the time of death 
the cases amount to a david and goliath kind of thing with 
a widow of a rocky flats worker taking on dow chemical rockwell 
and the us government he said 
shes not taking on an employer shes taking on the whole 
system he said

sen paul simon urged president bush on 
saturday to forgo his threatened veto and sign a threeyear 
authorization bill that calls for up to 938 million in us aid to 
poland and hungary 
freedom in poland needs our help simon dill said in a 
statement asking bush to sign the bill despite unrelated abortion 
provisions opposed by the white house 
the senate gave final approval to the bill early saturday as 
house and senate negotiators overcame legislative roadblocks after 
a personal appeal from polish union leader lech walesa for rapid 
financial assistance the voice vote sent the measure to the 
presidents desk 
but an appropriations measure providing 533 million in hard 
cash for poland and hungary this year is still awaiting action on 
the senate floor 
and bush has threatened to veto the whole package because it 
includes aid to the united nations population fund abortion 
opponents are against the provision because the agency operates in 
china which has restrictive limits on family size and allegedly 
imposes forced abortions 
the eastern european assistance includes programs for poland 
with a value of 8465 million hungary would receive benefits with 
a total value of 915 million 
this plan is both a wager and an investment simon said in 
his statement its a wager on polands experiment with 
democracy and its an investment in our security we should gamble 
a little on freedom 
i urge the president to sign this bill before lech walesa 
leaves this country and to make america a full partner in 
polands struggle for freedom he said

it sure looked like funny money but 
consumers and merchants have been assured the 100 bills are real 
even though some of them have ink that smudges and flakes 
approximately 400000 worth of 100 bills shipped to a wichita 
falls bank by the federal reserve bank in dallas are the product of 
a printing mishap or experimental ink officials say 
the only problem is them being so new that they are so 
crisp if you crumple it up the ink will flake off in some places 
like you can still see the signature but part of it will be 
faded because the actual ink is gone said elsa suarez an 
investigative assistant with the secret service in lubbock 
the secret service the federal reserve and the bank that began 
distributing the 100 bills sometime over the past two weeks said 
they are still legal tender 
the bills are smeared slightly around the 100 insignias in the 
corners said ms suarez 
however the bills are on treasury department paper and the 
serial numbers match federal reserve records about 300000 of the 
flaky bills have been put into circulation 
police and the bank began receiving calls about the bills last 
week 
mary loe rosas a spokeswoman for the federal reserve in dallas 
said they werent aware of the problem until investigators 
contacted them she said the bureau of engraving and printing was 
made aware of the problem and they were tracking down the cause

western european leaders decided saturday night to 
consider financial and training measures to encourage the political 
and economic changes surging through eastern europe 
leaders of the 12nation european community anxious about the 
fastmoving events in the soviet bloc met for three hours at a 
hastily arranged dinner at the invitation of president francois 
mitterrand 
we declare ourselves ready to cooperate in anything that will 
help the reform of the eastern countries which are going through a 
sometimes dramatic economic crisis mitterrand told reporters at 
a news conference after the end of the summit at the elysee palace 
we are ready to contribute by all our means to the 
installation of a healthy economy which is the sine qua non 
essential condition of the return to democracy through respect 
for human rights and the organization of free and secret elections 
everywhere he said 
west german chancellor helmut kohl speaking with reporters as 
he left the presidential palace said there was a consensus of 
joy and contentment but also a little anxiety and reserve 
regarding the changes in east germany 
mitterrand said he irish prime minister charles haughey and 
prime minister felipe gonzalez of spain had been mandated to carry 
out three measures 
consider the creation of a banking facility for the 
development and modernization of eastern europe 
study the possibility of a european foundation to train 
management people from eastern europe 
open existing european community programs involving education 
and training to eastern europeans 
the meeting gave the european leaders a chance to work out an 
approach to the east just two weeks before president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev hold a summit off malta 
british prime minister margaret thatcher will meet with bush 
this week west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher also 
will travel this week to washington 
the paris meeting comes barely a week after east germany once 
one of the most hardline members of the soviet bloc lifted travel 
restrictions for its citizens and began knocking holes in the 
berlin wall amid a wave of reform 
since september the blocs first noncommunist government has 
come to power in poland and hungary has instituted democratic 
reforms bulgarias leadership has been revamped and thousands of 
people in that country and in czechoslovakia are demanding change 
the summit was expected to touch on the possibility of drawing 
east germany into a 24nation aid effort spearheaded by the 
community for poland and hungary the ecs executive body the 
european commission has proposed a 650 million program of help 
for the two countries 
mitterrand was expected to press his idea for a european 
development bank that would funnel loans to east european nations 
such a fund patterned after the interamerican development bank 
would offer loans at low interest rates to encourage economic 
reforms 
reunification of west and east germany is another issue that has 
gained prominence with the opening of borders between the two 
countries 
it has raised concern that west germany the strongest economy 
in the ec will turn away from the community and toward the east 
some worry it may no longer have as strong an interest in the 
communitys campaign to create a borderfree market by late 1992 
on the eve of the summit east berlin appealed to the european 
community for comprehensive cooperation in a variety of areas 
officials said 
in a note to the governments of the ec the umbrella 
organization that includes the european economic community trading 
bloc or common market east germany said it wants better ties 
with the west officials said 
it called for early negotiations on a trade and economic 
cooperation agreement with the ec the two sides held preliminary 
talks early this year but only for a limited trade accord frans 
andriessen the communitys top trade official was invited to east 
germany for talks 
the community has already signed broad trade and economic 
cooperation pacts with poland and hungary and is negotiating one 
with the soviet union

a soviet leader has suggested that 
czechoslovakias chief communist party ideologist conduct a 
thorough analysis of the past including the 1968 invasion a 
newspaper reported saturday 
soviet tanks led the warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia in 
august 1968 that crushed the liberal communist government and 
ousted party leader alexander dubcek 
the communist party daily rude pravo quoted czechoslovak party 
ideologist jan fojtik as saying he had discussed the invasion with 
vadim medvedev the soviet communist partys leading ideologist 
the two met recently in moscow 
rude pravo reported fojtik said we have discussed the history 
of czechoslovaksoviet relations including the year 1968 
we have reached a fully identical conclusion that without a 
thorough analysis of the past there is no way to formulate clear 
intentions and objectives for the future 
the invasion remains as the main obstacle to national 
reconciliation and to better relations with the soviet union 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev pushing for change in 
eastern europe has pledged noninterference in the affairs of the 
kremlins warsaw pact allies 
all of the warsaw pact members except romania joined in the 1968 
invasion 
poland and hungary both with reformed communist parties and 
governments declared this year that the invasion was not justified 
fojtik was quoted by rude pravo as saying we must not avoid 
any delicate issues whether they are related to the assessment of 
the past or whether they are current problems 
the soviet comrades consistently adhere to the principle of 
noninterference they do not think it suitable to determine how 
another party should evaluate a historical event 
but events of the year 1968 do not concern only us they 
were a matter for five warsaw pact countries 
after the invasion dubcek was replaced as communist party 
general secretary by gustav husak now president the current party 
leader milos jakes was in charge of the purges that removed 
dubcek and other liberals 
there have been reports in prague that the kremlin recently sent 
a directive to czechoslovak leaders urging restructuring and 
reforms 
some observers believe a political struggle between jakes and 
premier ladislav adamec adds to the uncertainty of significant 
changes

crestwood hospital during her 2hour tour 
the tornado left 18 people dead hundreds injured and up to 
1000 homeless the youngest victim a 2yearold girl died 
friday after being taken off lifesupport systems 
the community is filled with heroes people who without 
regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so that 
they could survive said mrs quayle who was accompanied by gov 
guy hunt and us sens howell heflin and richard shelby 
mrs quayle who made similar visits to san francisco after the 
oct 17 earthquake and charleston sc after hurricane hugo also 
praised corporations that have made donations to help huntsville 
recover 
federal and state officials have promised to do whatever is 
necessary to help huntsville even if disaster relief funds are 
squeezed by hurricane hugo and the quake 
were here to get the job done grant peterson associate 
director of the federal emergency management agency said friday 
whatevers needed will be done 
president bush declared huntsville a disaster area but fema may 
have to do some financial juggling to deal with this years rash of 
natural disasters parts of eight states have been declared 
eligible for federal relief 
any one disaster like hugo or the earthquake in california 
exceeds what we have in a normal year alone peterson said 
congress provided 11 billion in supplemental funds to fema 
after hugo devastated the caribbean and the east coast in 
september and 12 billion following the earthquake that ravaged 
parts of northern california on oct 17 
so far about 13 billion has been allocated to disaster 
victims peterson said hes not yet concerned about fema meeting 
its financial obligations 
i would say that to ask for any more money at this point would 
be premature he said 
peterson and his aides urged patience during the arduous task of 
processing thousands of relief requests from the huntsville area 
if everything works well in seven to 10 days we should get 
the first checks out peterson said friday ill make sure that 
we expedite these requests to meet the peoples needs 
the state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost of 
providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims with 
the federal government pitching in the other 75 percent gov hunt 
said he expected the alabama legislature to come up with whatever 
money is needed 
the state doesnt budget for disasters said danny cooper 
alabamas emergency management director we take care of them at 
the time 
hunt stressed that government agencies wont be able to shoulder 
the entire load he requested donations to agencies such as the 
american red cross which set up a shelter for the homeless as 
rescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hours 
after the tornado struck 
the tornado hit huntsville with devastating force winds were 
estimated at 250 mph and virtually no warning about 430 pm 
wednesday leaving a 10milelong path of destruction 
a shopping center and clusters of apartment buildings were 
leveled cars were piled atop each other like the remnants of a 
demolition derby 
cooper said 119 homes were destroyed and 125 had lesser damage 
three churches two schools 35 businesses and 10 public buildings 
were either destroyed or suffered heavy damage 
neighbors pitched in to help debra mckay and her family pick 
through the rubble of their home the only things standing were the 
walls around two bathrooms and an adjacent hallway the area where 
ms mckay and her three children rode out the storm 
i know the lord spared us she said i woke up a different 
person this morning 
officials said several truckloads of food have rolled into 
huntsville but the city is running out of places to store the goods 
theres a sense of thankfulness hunt said its 
heartwarming to see how people have come together 
huntsville is home to nasas marshall space flight center the 
armys redstone arsenal and a number of hightech industries mayor 
steve hettinger said the city would be able to withstand the 
tornados financial impact 
huntsville has a strong economy a diverse economy he said 
thats not the source of our concern

the attorney general on 
saturday accused some roman catholic bishops of fomenting violence 
in el salvadors civil war and urged pope john paul ii to withdraw 
them from the country 
in a letter to the pontiff attorney general mauricio eduardo 
colorado said the bishops should be withdrawn for their own good 
the letter was released the same day as followers buried six jesuit 
priests who were slain in their home thursday the most 
politically explosive slayings since archbishop oscar romero was 
assassinated in march 1980 
colorado accused certain bishops of fomenting the violence 
that culminated in the biggest leftist guerrilla offensive of the 
10yearold war fighting has raged in san salvador and throughout 
the country since it was launched a week ago 
colorado did not mention any bishops by name but it was 
believed that among those he referred to were monsignor arturo 
rivera damas the archbishop of san salvador and his auxiliary 
archbishop monsignor gregorio rosa chavez 
both are identified with human rights causes and have urged the 
government to negotiate with the rebel farabundo marti national 
liberation front to end the war 
rivera damas was appointed archbishop after romero was slain by 
a sniper rightwing death squads were blamed for his murder 
el salvadors rightist government censured news of the letter 
within the country a copy of the letter was provided to the 
associated press 
there was no immediate reaction from catholic leaders here or 
from the vatican the pope on friday decried the killings of the 
six priests 
those murders were denounced in the us congress where some 
members threatened to cut aid to el salvador if the government does 
not bring the killers to justice washington has provided 35 
billion in aid over the past decade to successive salvadoran 
governments 
in his letter colorado said certain bishops who have 
persisted in keeping alive the questionable ideology of the 
church of the poor are considered responsible for much of the 
violence that has devastated el salvador for many years and 
culminated in the rebel actions of this week 
he said he would investigate the murders of the priests but 
added rather than investigating things which have already 
happened it is a thousand times healthier to avoid them 
colorado wrote the letter to the pope on official stationary but 
said he was acting as a catholic and not a government official 
i want to suggest to the dear father for the security and 
safety and wellbeing of all the salvadoran faithful the 
withdrawal at least temporarily from salvadoran territory of 
these bishops he said 
rebel gunners on saturday shot down a ussupplied a37 jet 
fighterbomber in the eastern province of san miguel according to 
witnesses and airport officials 
peter collins of abc news was in san miguel and said he and his 
crew saw the plane stuck by two projectiles apparently from a 
50caliber machine gun fired by guerrillas 
collins did not see the plane crash but the air traffic 
controller at the san miguel airport told two other reporters that 
the pilot ejected and the a37 crashed 
the rebels on their clandestine radio venceremos claimed they 
had downed the a37 the armed forces press committee denied a 
plane had been shot down the military said saturday that 784 
guerrillas have been killed 527 wounded 129 captured in the 
offensive it said 208 soldiers have been killed and 627 wounded 
but gave no report on civilian deaths 
fighting slackened saturday and thousands of hungry exhausted 
residents took advantage of the lull to evacuate their homes 
carrying small children and packages of belongings 
some refugees crossed into governmentcontrolled territory at a 
checkpoint near the northern san salvador suburb of mejicanos 
fighting continued only 800 yards away and flared occasionally 
along the northern and eastern edges of the capital where the 
rebels held their positions 
earlier saturday hundreds of mourners filed past the caskets of 
the six priests and their two housekeepers who were killed in their 
residence at jose simeon canas central american university 
the rev jose maria tojeira head of the society of jesus in 
central america said they will be buried in the university chapel 
because that was their wish 
they wanted to live and die here they wanted to die as the 
leading defenders of justice here did like monsignor romero 
tojeira said 
students fellow religious workers doctors and other 
professionals and members of the faculty staff filed past the 
closed gray caskets which each with a lilac flower on top 
among the dead were ignacio ellacuria the univerisitys rector 
and one of central americas leading educators and ignacio 
martinbaro one of the regions leading polling experts the 
brains of the victims were cut out in a sign of contempt 
university officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms 
enter the slain priests residence just before shooting began 
thursday however the government denied responsibility and said it 
would investigate 
the nations most prominint leftist politician guillermo ungo 
left the country for panama saturday after spending a week in the 
venezuelan embassy 
other leftist politicians union activists and intellectuals 
were in hiding fearing that the killings of the jesuits were the 
beginning of another wave of death squad killings

iraq on saturday rejected an iranian 
proposal to exchange prisoners of war if the iraqis withdrew from 
territories taken during the persian gulf war 
foreign minister tariq aziz told a news conference that iraq 
will not accept any compromise short of redrawing the border to 
include the strategic shattalarab waterway in iraqi territory 
aziz spoke a day after un envoy jan eliasson left tehran for 
new york ending a 17day peace mission in the region 
eliasson acknowledged that his bid to break the deadlock in 
peace talks has failed but said aziz and his iranian counterpart 
ali akbar velayati would meet separately in new york in 
middecember with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
aziz told the news conference we consider the shatt as pure 
iraqi territory when iran recognizes our sovereignty over the 
shatt we will be ready to withdraw our forces from iranian 
territory 
the united nations estimates the iranian territory iraq occupies 
at 385 square miles although tehran claims the area is double that 
the ceasefire began aug 20 1988 but the talks on a final end 
to the 8yearold war have deadlocked 
iran has pushed for implementing the un ceasefire resolution 
point by point iraq insisted on settling first the issue of 
sovereignty over shattalarab 
the resolution makes no reference to shattalarab in addition 
to the cessation of hostilities it calls for troop withdrawals to 
the internationally recognized prewar border the exchange of pows 
and settlement of the border dispute through negotiations 
the channel is iraqs sole outlet to the gulf before the war 
the border ran midstream down shattalarab under a 1975 agreement 
aziz called the latest iranian proposal tantamount to 
blackmail 
the iranians are using a humanitarian issue as a brgaining 
chip he said of the pows 
the international committee of the red cross has registered 
almost 50000 prisoners held by iran and about 19000 held by 
iraq but un estimates place the number of pows at more than 
100000

europe said british prime minister margaret thatcher were 
very pleased these events have happened

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev are to hold a shipboard summit 
off the coast of malta 
mitterrand had called the paris summit last week in a move to 
have the western europeans establish their approach to the 
developments in eastern europe before the bushgorbachev talks but 
mitterrand said he didnt intend to send a formal message to either 
superpower leader although he would talk to bush by phone before 
the malta conference 
mrs thatcher will meet with bush friday at camp david and 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher is scheduled to 
visit washington this week mitterrand said he expected to meet 
with bush next month but he didnt say when 
mitterrand told a news conference after the summit in the elysee 
palace we declare ourselves ready to cooperate in anything that 
will help the reform of the eastern countries 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said there was a consensus 
of joy and contentment but also a little anxiety and reserve 
regarding east germany 
with the opening of borders between east and west germany there 
has been speculation the two countries might reunite that has 
caused some concern that west germany with the most powerful 
economy in the european community ec trading bloc might turn 
toward eastern europe 
but kohl said there is no alternative to membership in the 
ec also known as the european common market 
mrs thatcher without referring directly to germany said 
the question of borders is not on the agenda they should stay as 
they are 
she also said security matters should continue to be conducted 
through the two military alliances the wests north atlantic 
treaty organization and the sovietled warsaw pact 
at a time of great change its necessary to keep the 
background of stability and security she told the news 
conference 
the leaders emphasized their commitment to support the 
democratic reforms in eastern europe 
we must do every single thing we can to encourage it said 
mrs thatcher 
we are ready to contribute by all our means to the 
installation of a healthy economy which is the sine qua non 
essential condition of the return to democracy mitterrand said 
mitterrrand irish prime minister charles haughey and prime 
minister felipe gonzalez of spain were named to study a proposal 
for a european development bank to help modernize the backward 
economies of eastern europe they also were asked to look into 
setting up a european foundation to train managers from eastern 
europe and to open up ec community education and training programs 
to eastern europeans 
the focus of the summits economic attentions was on poland and 
hungary already the recipients of a 24nation aid program 
spearheaded by the european community east germany which had 
appealed to the western leaders for closer ties apparently did not 
receive as much attention 
on the eve of the summit east berlin appealed to the european 
community for comprehensive cooperation in a variety of areas 
officials said 
the western leaders said they would increase aid to poland and 
hungary until the two countries work out financial packages with 
the international monetary fund possibly by the end of the year 
we feel we must give more aid they have to get through the 
winter said mrs thatcher 
the ec nations are belgium britain denmark france germany 
greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and 
spain

design modifications sought for the 
superconducting supercollider project could add at least 1 billion 
to its 6 billion pricetag or cause it to be moved from its texas 
location the washington post reported in its sunday editions 
the post quoting unnamed us officials and independent 
scientists said department of energy officials are determined to 
build the project to cost because of federal budget constraints 
but such a decision if carried out could result in a smaller 
less powerful collider that would be unsuitable for its chosen site 
of waxahachie a remote texas town south of dallas the newspaper 
said 
congress recently approved the first 225 million to build the 
collider over an eightyear period the texas site was chosen after 
fierce rivalry among states for the project and the accompanying 
jobs and dollars it quoted officials who said extensive 
modifications could renew the battle by states who would argue they 
have more suitable sites 
the huge project with a 50mile underground tunnel would study 
the basic makeup of matter by forcing bunches of protons into 
highspeed headon collisions detectors record the particles 
produced by the energy of the collision 
as planned the device would be 10 times as large as the largest 
comparable project in the united states and three times as large as 
its largest european counterpart 
roy schwitters director of the dallas laboratory created to 
supervise construction privately asked for an extra 1 billion for 
the project to make modifications according to the post 
schwitters said his changes were not due to flaws but to 
advances in the stateoftheart technology without the changes 
he said equipment will have to be added later at an additional 
cost 
the newspaper quoted sources who said robert o hunter jr a 
former director of energy research who the post said was forced to 
resign from the project projected the cost of modifications at 2 
billion to 4 billion 
the newspaper said some energy department officials expressed 
skepticism about holding down the costs of important magnets used 
in the project and said a soughtafter proton beam injector 
could bring construction delays adding to costs 
the congressional budget office estimated more than a year ago 
the project would cost 15 billion more than the energy 
departments estimate at the time 
schwitters and deputy energy secretary henson w moore told the 
post a study due to be completed in december should give more 
reliable information 
moore said project managers were told either were going to 
build it for the figure of 59 million dollars or were not 
going to build it at all

czechoslovakias hardline leaders installed after the 1969 
invasion have resisted most of the sovietinspired reforms 
sweeping communist neighbors in eastern europe

friday so he can travel to stockholm this week and receive a human 
rights award swedish officials had planned to come to prague to 
give havel the prize because they did not expect havel would be

this year putting the states execution rate at a level not seen 
in 35 years 
following julius execution for the 1978 murderrape of his

two thumbsup signs and waved both hands after his final words were 
spoken to holman prison warden charlie jones who read the death 
warrant

would not let him suffer 
julius of birmingham was sentenced to death for the slaying of 
his cousin 29yearold susie bell sanders at her montgomery 
apartment he was on an pass from a prison workrelease center at 
the time he was then serving a life term for a 1972 murder 
julius was the fourth inmate to die in alabamas electric chair 
this year and the 119th person put to death in the united states 
since the 1976 us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume 
use of the death penalty 
the last time alabama had four or more executions in one year

hazardous materials earlier this week approved a bill requiring 
federal authorities to determine which materials may or may not be 
backhauled and establishing procedures for the proper cleaning 
between shipments of allowed materials 
that legislation has yet to go before the full committee 
fridays legislation sponsored by rep william f clinger jr 
rpa bans the consecutive shipments in the same refrigerated 
truck of food and garbage the measure also bans shipments of food 
products in cargo tankers that have been used to transport

a group of civil rights leaders met with 
president bush on friday to air honest differences and emerged 
from the session giving the president high marks for listening 
i think we all feel that we have succeeded in opening up a 
dialogue on a number of issues said corretta scott king head of 
the martin luther king jr center 
the widow of the slain civil rights leader said bush was 
receptive to our ideas even if he disagrees on some things 
many things perhaps 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the meeting which 
lasted about half an hour had been requested by the black 
leadership forum 
what we had to bring to the president represents a recognition 
that its in the best interest of the whole country as well as 
african americans that we achieve parity we would hope for it in 
the year 2000 said dorothy height of the national council of 
negro women 
i think the most significant thing was that he listened that 
he showed a genuine interest that we had real dialogue she 
added there are honest differences of opinion on a number of 
things 
jospeh lowery of the southern christian leadership conference 
told reporters after the meeting that bush was surprised to hear 
that there was really overt racisim and he hoped it wasnt true 
but we gave him instances where we think it is true 
were also concerned about covert racisim that puts this 
invisible ceiling in the corporate community on where blacks can 
rise to higher paying jobs lowery said

scientists on friday released 50 parasitic 
israeli wasps each smaller than a pinhead hoping the pests would 
zero in on southern californias growing ash whitefly population 
the wasps were sent to work in a suburban encino ash tree in the 
first of a series of tests to see if they can be used in the fight 
against the problem flies 
this particular trial is not to see if the wasps will kill all 
the ash whiteflies said tom bellows a university of california 
riverside entomologist supervising the experiment this 
particular trial is to see if the wasps can live successfully in 
our southern california climate 
bellows released the imported predators into what he calls a 
sleeve cage a finely woven mesh cloth fitted over a tree 
branch so that all of the wasps will remain in one place 
otherwise scientists monitoring the experiment would have to 
search the whole tree and beyond to find the wasps bellows 
explained 
the ash whitefly infestation is not the only agricultural battle 
being waged in southern california record numbers of exotic insect 
pests have invaded los angeles county this year posing a threat to 
the states 16 billionayear farm economy 
efforts to eradicate the mediterranean fruit fly which lays its 
eggs in more than 250 types of fruit has cost taxpayers at least 
10 million so far county officials said 
scientists also are scrambling to deal with invasions by 
japanese beetles russian wheat aphids gypsy moths fire ants and 
other bugs found in faraway lands but foreign to the united 
states 
we are convinced that its because you are the nations 
melting pot said gera curry a spokeswoman for the california 
department of food and agriculture in sacramento 
the regions booming immigrant population is bringing in 
contraband fruits and vegetables from native lands she said 
the people responsible dont seem to realize their shipments of 
produce also carry alien pests that thrive in southern californias 
warm climate curry said 
one of the most ruinous is the ash whitefly which sucks vital 
fluids from tree leaves and deposits a sticky ooze that discolors 
fruit stains patios and ruins car paint 
the ash whiteflies which have no natural enemies in the united 
states were first discovered in the san fernando valley last 
summer they were apparently imported accidentally from europe the 
middle east or africa where they are common 
the parasite wasps were imported from israel where they act as 
the ash whiteflys natural enemy 
the wasp has no sting but kills by laying its eggs inside ash 
whitefly larvae bellows said after the wasps eggs hatch they 
eat their way out of the whitefly larvae killing the pest 
if the series of experiments set for this month are successful 
bellows said hundreds of thousands of insect predators will be 
released next spring

the justice department said friday it will 
review a complaint that its internal disciplinary unit wrongly 
described the results of a foreign counterintelligence 
investigation of a former official 
department spokesman david runkel said the agency will review 
roger pilons complaint that the office of professional 
responsiblility erred when it said the investigation produced 
sufficient evidence to dismiss pilon 
pilon says he was cleared of allegations that he gave south 
africa a classified document and was reinstated in his job at the 
justice department 
obviously there is a difference of opinion on the facts and 
that has to be looked at runkel said adding that the matter 
would be reviewed by deputy attorney general donald ayer 
pilons lawyers have asked the department for a public apology 
for what they called the reports egregiously inaccurate 
description of the investigation by the fbi and the office of 
professional responsiblility opr 
three house members also called on the justice department to 
resolve the discrepancy between the nov 9 opr report and the 
evidence pilon produced that he was cleared of the allegations and 
reinstated with his security clearance 
oprs report said that while the counterintelligence 
investigation did not develop sufficient evidence to support a 
prosecution it did discover that sufficient cause existed to 
terminate pilon as head of the office of asylum policy and review 
following the reports release on nov 9 pilon produced a sept 
9 letter from a senior department official saying that he was 
being reinstated to his job 
pilon said his security clearance was fully restored when he 
returned to the department following an administrative leave 
the report which did not identify pilon by name said that he 
resigned before the initiation of removal proceedings 
pilon says he resigned only after his reinstatement carrying 
out a longterm plan to join the cato institute a libertarian think 
tank where he is now a fellow 
pilon confirms that he was the subject of an fbi 
counterintelligence investigation that grew out of a background 
check of his wife juliana when she was considered to be an 
assistant interior secretary 
the investigation scuttled her nomination and resulted in what 
pilon calls a kafkaesque nightmare 
pilon denies the allegation that when he worked for the state 
department in 1987 he gave his wife a classified document on 
communist influence in south africa that was relayed to a south 
african diplomat 
in their letter to thornburgh the three members of the house 
judiciary committee also asked thornburgh in a letter to study the 
case and if appropriate issue an apology 
obviously there is a discrepancy that deserves to be 
resolved said reps don edwards dcalif gerry sikorski 
dminn and constance morella rmd 
if the facts are as the pilons allege then they have been 
done an injustice by the inclusion of rogers case in the opr 
report issued last week the lawmakers said

a peruvian diplomat and a lima businessman were 
convicted friday of smuggling 63 million worth of cocaine into 
london in a diplomatic pouch and each was sentenced to 20 years in 
prison 
officers testified that 42 pounds of cocaine were still in the 
pouch which was inside a suitcase when jose manuel pacheco 45 
and carlos alberto margary 47 were arrested by customs officers 
at a london hotel 
pacheco held the rank of minister and headed the supplies 
department at the peruvian foreign ministry when he was arrested 
last march margary operated a business in lima the peruvian 
capital 
pacheco was dismissed from his post by a peruvian tribunal and 
the court was told that customs investigators received full 
cooperation from peruvian authorities 
the cocaine arrived at londons heathrow airport after a twoday 
trip via the united states and paris 
it was discovered march 24 when customs officers at heathrow 
xrayed pachecos two suitcases 
prosecutor david calvertsmith said it became apparent to 
customs officers that what they were seeing was something that did 
not look very diplomatic 
the officers left the leather pouch inside the suitcase and the 
luggage continued on to the delivery carousel where pacheco 
collected it he took a taxi into london and met margary at a hotel 
where the two were found in possession of the cocaine 
calvertsmith said 
judge christopher tyrer said this case is particularly 
serious because it involves the deliberate and outrageous abuse of 
diplomatic privileges 
he told margary i am compelled to the view of you as a senior 
figure in the peruvian drugs industry 
turning to pacheco he said you have had all the advantages 
of intelligence and position instead you have betrayed yourself 
your family and friends and you have brought discredit to the name 
of your country

the regulator of national banks has earmarked 
29 banks for increased scrutiny because of their lending for 
leveraged corporate buyouts 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke who ordered his 
examiners a year ago to begin paying closer attention to lbo 
lending said criticized highly leveraged transactions at the 
11 biggest banks under his jurisdiction jumped from 9 percent at 
the end of last year to 17 percent at midyear 
this raises concern that as competiton among banks to make these 
loans heats up some may make riskier loans he said in a speech 
this week when the marketplace is as crowded as it appears 
it almost always leads to abuses 
moreover smaller regional banks with less experience in the 
field are increasing their involvement he said adding we are 
concerned that banks without proper understanding of the 
transactions or appropriate risk management procedures are 
participating in leveraged financing 
the 29 banks now targeted for quarterly monitoring of their lbo 
portfolios all have at least 2 percent of assets tied up in 
leveraged deals at the 11 largest the average was 4 percent 
the 11 large banks are citicorp chase manhattan and marine 
midland new york bank of america and wells fargo san francisco 
first national bank of boston continental illinois and first 
chicago chicago ncnb charlotte nc mellon bank pittsburgh 
and security pacific los angeles 
lee cross a spokeswoman for the comptrollers office declined 
to release the names of the 18 regional banks we dont want to 
create undue concern she emphasized friday that being on the 
list does not signify a bank is in any danger 
in a leveraged buyout investors often managers seeking to

the estonian parliament on friday compromised on 
an election law that spawned nine days of strikes by ethnic 
russians and other nonnatives who feared lengthy residency 
requirements would deprive them of the right to vote 
the new law requires a 10year residency in estonia for holding 
public office but deletes a twoyear residency requirement for the 
right to vote tass said 
it passed with 186 votes in favor and 40 abstentions by the 
equal rights group of deputies tass said it did not say if 
anyone voted against the bill 
in august tens of thousands of russians and other nonestonian 
residents of the baltic republic walked off their jobs to protest 
the law requiring two years residence in estonia to vote 
the national presidium called the law unconstitutional but the 
estonian parliament in an act of defiance only suspended the 
laws provisions for the local elections set for dec 10 
the law passed friday also requires candidates to live or work 
in the district they hope to represent a departure from current 
national law many soviet legislators especially those well known 
represent districts far from their homes

friday aimed at protecting chinese students in the united states 
from reprisals at home for their participation in the prodemocracy 
movement

under which the 32000 chinese students holding exchange 
visitor visas would not have to return home for two years before

visitor visas also known as j visas to apply for immigration 
status within four years of the bills enactment 
the compromise was reached friday afternoon the senate must

departures as a result of the chinese governments suppression of 
chinese student protesters

department to give careful consideration to applications by chinese 
nationals who express a fear of persecution because of chinas 
family planning law limiting couples to one child 
sen william l armstrong rcolo had asked for a provision to 
protect chinese nationals who refuse to practice birth control or 
have an abortion in order to carry out the policy 
the provision would cover applications for asylum for 
withholding of deportation or for refugee status

300footlong propane pipeline friday to extinguish a towering 
daylong blaze enabling nearly half of the towns 1000 residents 
to return to their homes 
a smaller fire continued to burn friday night at the williams 
pipe line co terminal but it posed no danger and was being 
allowed to burn out company spokesman jim gipson said

said 
the fire started thursday as a work crew was performing routine 
maintenance on a pump at the plant two miles south of jasper in

plant said he was happy to be able to return home and milk his 
cows on schedule the sky had an eerie orange glow to it when he

the navys twoday freeze on normal 
operations to concentrate on safety ended friday with commanders 
awaiting the results of the exercise triggered by an unprecedented 
series of accidents 
in one case they didnt have to wait long shortly after the 
operational standdown ended mechanical problems forced a training 
jet to ditch in the gulf of mexico a navy spokesman said the two 
pilots ejected safely 
the ta4j jet went down on a routine training mission at 340 
pm about 20 miles south of pensacola fla only nine hours after 
the naval air station kingsville texas unit completed its 
standdown said navy spokesman rod duren in pensacola 
the pause in operations was ordered tuesday by navy secretary h 
lawrence garrett iii and adm carlisle ah trost chief of naval 
operations after 10 accidents over a threeweek period killed 10 
and injured at least 71 
under the standdown order all navy units worldwide were to 
halt normal routine and concentrate on safety inspections reviews 
and lectures for 48 of the ensuing 72 hours beginning tuesday 
evening 
trost ordered all commanders to report their findings from the 
standdown to him 
navy officials said the standdown was not ordered because the 
service was operating in an unsafe manner but because garrett and 
trost wanted to ensure that everything that could be done was being 
done to protect servicemen 
for the norfolkbased atlantic fleet that meant the 
reorganization of training and operations schedules for 
approximately 200000 people and 300 ships 
most of the ships will be finished by this evening lt 
cmdr steve burnett a fleet spokesman said friday some 
helicopter units on base began the standdown wednesday though 
most units needed wednesday to prepare for the standdown 
line commanders said the procedures of the standdown were no 
different from their daily training regime 
the only difference is that this is a dedicated period weve 
stopped our routine activities every individual aboard ship is 
devoted to the safety standdown said capt frank j lugo 
commander of the guided missile cruiser josephus daniels 
lugo ran his 470 crewmen through a series of lectures 
inspections and demonstrations thursday and friday while the 
warship was docked at the norfolk naval station 
what youre seeing here is no different than any other day 
except were not flying said lt cmdr chris wuethrich 
executive officer of squadron vf41 at the oceana naval air station 
wuethrich said squadrons normally go on standdown after the 
holidays to review flight safety and past accidents 
navy safety officials said there was no common thread linking 
the accidents which ranged from men washed overboard to plane 
crashes to ship fires to the accidental bombing of a cruiser 
never in the history of the modern navy have so many mishaps 
happened at one time said capt ferguson norton the navys top 
safety officer 
according to navy figures 1989 is the safest year on record 
with 69 major accidents reported so far in 1984 118 major 
accidents were reported every year since then the numbers have 
declined 
where 1989 varies from the previous five years is in fatalities 
there have been 102 this year including the 47 sailors killed in 
the april 19 gun turret explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa 
in 1984 64 people were killed in accidents

roman catholic officials urged the bush administration to press 
for an investigation of the killings of six jesuit priests in el 
salvador and to stem the flow of arms to both sides in the civil 
war 
we have been sickened and outraged at the murders of the six 
jesuit priests and their coworkers as well as the more than 500 
deaths that have occurred in el salvador this past week said a 
statement from some 600 priests of the roman catholic archdiocese 
of los angeles 
we ask that this violence be stopped ten years and 80000 
deaths have proven that the military solution is no solution the 
group which included several exiles from el salvador said in the 
statement drafted late thursday at a meeting in palm springs 
earlier thursday los angeles archbishop roger mahony called the 
slayings wanton murder and asked the us government to urge an 
immediate truce prompt negotiations between the government and the 
guerrillas in el salvador and the cessation of outside military 
armaments to all sides 
dozens of religious workers labor activists academics and 
political figures went into hiding friday in san salvador after the 
killings of the jesuits and the arrest of 12 lutheran missionaries 
the lutherans including four americans were released friday 
unharmed the us embassy said 
the slayings thursday of ignacio ellacuria rector of jose 
simeon canas central american university vicerector ignacio 
martin baro four other jesuit priests their housekeeper and her 
15yearold daughter were blamed on rightwing forces and drew 
international condemnation 
the national council of churches americas largest religious 
federation urged congress to halt delivery of military aid to el 
salvador 
in washington archbishop daniel pilarczyk president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops wrote president bush to 
demand that the salvadoran government be pressed to investigate 
president alfredo cristiani whose government denied any 
responsibility said he had ordered an inquiry 
the slayings shocked even those accustomed to analyzing events 
in the wartorn country 
this was not the work of madmen this was the work of cruel 
politically sophisticated men said richard nuccio author of 
whos wrong whos right in central america and an associate of 
the washington dcbased interamerican dialogue 
beatriz manz a central american specialist at wellesley college 
in boston attributed the massacre to forces within cristianis 
ruling party 
it will intimidate the few voices of dissent the few voices 
of reason in el salvador she said 
nuccio said well probably never know for sure who did the 
killings but he said they will make it very difficult for 
congress to give aid to el salvador without attaching any 
conditions on human rights violations

this is the pennypinching period of the 
economic cycle when consumers watch their bills homeowners study 
mortgage rates and businesses cut overhead even congress tries to 
trim 
it is the mood of the times a period of rentrenchment 
reorganization and correction that follows every economic expansion 
a regular and maybe necessary time in which the stage is prepared 
for the next act 
and that perhaps is why the attempt to cut automobile 
insurance costs is gaining a sort of negative attention while 
lower insurance costs obviously are desirable the effort is being 
resisted and frustrated 
at issue is whether nofault policies which are said to reduce 
costs should be offered as a choice to motorists in states where 
faultbased policies which often lead to costly litigation are 
now firmly entrenched 
consumers groups including many insurers are fighting for 
nofault or consumerchoice insurance the opposition includes 
some insurers and members of state legislatures but the legal 
fraternity makes up its stiff backbone 
leading the consumer effort is project new start whose leaders 
claim that insurance buyers finance costly litigation that could be 
avoided and that benefits a few at the expense of high rates for 
everyone 
founded by consumerists james brown of the university of 
wisconsin and robert j mcewen of boston college project new start 
has plenty of heavy hitters perhaps none better known than 
virginia knauer 
mrs knauer white house consumer affairs adviser in the 
administration of presidents ford nixon and reagan is the 
projects national chairwoman and at a point in her life when 
publicspirited citizens often feel free to speak their minds 
she contends that there is no arguing that nofault makes sense 
and she blames one group the lawyers who make their living by 
arguing over who is at fault for preventing its enactment by 
state legislatures 
she says lawyers made it clear in nevada one of the recent 
battlegrounds that they will fight consumer choice auto 
insurance to the death 
nothing new in that she added for the past two decades they 
have sabotaged or crippled most consumer efforts to enact nofault 
insurance 
those are harsh words and they suggest the bitterness of the 
battle 
the legal profession says it isnt as simple as that involved 
they say are a persons right to sue and a persons right to trial 
by jury and no fault they say places a premium on economic loss 
but minimizes physical loss 
mrs knauer says thats nonsense what her group offers she 
says is called consumer choice because it would allow the current 
system to remain side by side with another system motorists would 
choose one or the other 
that choice pay higher premiums and retain the old system and 
the right to sue or pay less and avoid suits with a personal 
protection policy stated differently a choice between a 
nolawsuit or sue and be sued system 
under the personal protection policy consumers would purchase 
what medical coverage is needed coverage for loss of income and 
whatever level of coverage is desired for fire theft or repairs to 
their cars 
from that point they could choose building blocks of whatever 
insurance they desired including loss of life and survivor 
benefits 
says mrs knauer no longer would a motorist be forced to buy 
an arbitrary level of insurance coverage designed to protect some 
other unknown person with unknowable resources and hypothetical 
needs with whom they might someday be involved in an accident 
but how could two systems exist simultaneously 
it in this area too that some conflict might lie those who 
choose the current system could collect through an uninsured 
motorist rider but they would be limited in their ability to sue 
those with the personal protection policy 
only 14 states now have basic nofault systems nearly two 
decades after massachusetts enacted the first such law new start 
has a long way to go and that suggests plenty of fireworks for the 
decade of the 1990s

cable televisions cspan which has shown live 
proceedings of the us house of representatives since 1979 on 
tuesday will do likewise from a somewhat older place britains 
house of commons 
on that day which starts with an address by queen elizabeth ii 
to the new session of parliament that cspan will carry live at 
530 am est the occasionally raucous commons will open its 
proceedings to television 
that starts at 9 am est in what is a test run the experiment 
will last until at least next july after which the legislators in 
the 650seat commons will vote on whether to make tv permanent 
its unlikely that they wont continue it unless theres a 
major row cspan chairman brian lamb predicted in a phone 
interview from london where hes overseeing a series of live 
telecasts slated for this week 
cspan last week dispatched a staff to london for a week of 
preliminary interviews including callins from american viewers 
among those fielding questions today is john grist who oversees 
the commons eightcamera tv system 
for cspan a nonprofit industrysupported cooperative that 
says it is seen in 468 million homes and offices tuesday may 
prove a legislative tale of two cities one that enables viewers to 
see differences in at least the oratory of lawmakers in london and 
washington 
if the american house still is in session tuesday a cspan 
spokesman says we will go live to the us house and air that in 
its entirety then pick up the british house in progress then 
that evening well air the british house proceedings in its 
entirety 
no video bundle from britain is scheduled for wednesday but on 
thanksgiving day at 930 am est cspan will air live another 
commons session in its entirety 
it might go eight or ten hours lamb says its a good 
chance for people who are busy on tuesday to just tune in just 
look at it 
on sunday cspan will show taped highlights of the week 
the real action cspan hopes to show it live will come on 
nov 28 at 1015 am est when prime minister margaret thatcher 
faces opposition labor leader neil kinnock for a 15minute 
question time session 
such sessions on tuesdays and thursdays are rarely sedate and 
usually rife with riposte unlike the comparatively tame give and 
take of the us house question time in the commons is meant to 
be confrontational lamb notes 
they stand literally eight feet apart looking each other in 
the eye both the prime minister and the leader of the labor party 
its electric and theres a lot of hooting and howling in the 
chamber 
they do it partly to throw everybody off guard 
alas as in the american house the british house has strict 
rules about what tv can and cannot show if there is a noisy 
disruption the commons camera crews are told to ignore it and 
focus only on the speaker bernard weatherill

a growing drug trade has led to 
concern that the philippines is in danger of becoming the colombia 
of the far east calls are going out for tougher laws and the death 
penalty for drug dealers 
police say the illegal drug trade has become a 41 
millionayear business in recent years the three largest drug 
syndicates employ about 15000 people fulltime according to police 
estimates 
the trade comes nowhere near that of colombias 
multibilliondollar drug cartels but experts here say most of the 
narcotics produced in the philippines are used locally 
but filipino and foreign experts fear the country could become a 
major regional drug center because of a favorable climate for 
growing marijuana corruption and inefficiency within the police 
and established trade and communications links to the united states 
and other markets 
in october us agents in los angeles seized two tons of 
philippinegrown marijuana worth 14 million in what was believed 
to be an attempt to establish a pipeline between manila and 
california 
two americans of filipino ancestry were arrested recently in 
honolulu for allegedly trying to smuggle in two pounds of the drug 
crystal methamphetamine a widely abused drug known in southeast 
asia as shabu and said by officials and drug experts to be more 
addictive than crack 
philippinegrown marijuana and other drugs also have turned up 
albeit in modest amounts in australia hong kong taiwan japan 
pakistan turkey and some european countries police say 
foreign and filipino narcotics officials say syndicates have 
been bringing in foreigners mostly europeans to teach growers 
here how to grow better quality marijuana 
last year police uprooted 15 million marijuana plants and 
seized 75 tons of marijuana packed for shipment abroad 
if we do not do something about this there might come a time 
when we will see the spectacle of the philippines becoming like 
colombia where drug lords even have armies helicopters planes 
and even tanks sen alberto romulo said at a recent philippine 
senate hearing 
public concern over the problem began to grow in october after 
sen ernesto herrera charged that at least 17 police and military 
members including a brigadier general were protecting drug lords 
according to the police the drug trade is flourishing because 
of the potential for huge profits in a country where the annual per 
capita income is only about 600 
marijuana can be bought in remote mountain plantations for 200 
pesos 9 a kilo 22 pounds and sold in manila for 10 times as 
much 
shabu the crystaline drug can be purchased in hong kong for 
about 2270 a kilo and sold in manila for the equivalent of 
45450 sources say some shabu also is being made locally 
corruption among police and customs officials is said to 
compound the enforcement problem 
col virgilio david chief of the national police narcotics 
command said his unit is riddled with corruption because poorly 
paid policemen find it difficult to turn down bribes from drug 
syndicates he said at least 40 of his officers and men had been 
removed in an attempt to combat corruption 
david and others say stronger laws and greater police powers are 
needed in the philippines 
in hong kong if you go there and the police doubt your 
papers they can just detain you david said that is the same 
case in singapore and malaysia they have stronger laws that 
empower the police to arrest anybody based only on strong suspicion 
that they are a violators of the law we must have the same kind of 
laws here 
david said the military has urged congress to revive the death 
penalty for drug dealers the constitution ratified in 1987 
abolished capital punishment but allows congress to revive it for 
heinous crimes 
he also said the government should establish special courts to 
handle only drug offenses to speed up trials which often drag on 
here for years 
because of legal obstacles in enforcing the laws critics say 
police often simply execute bigtime dealers and then report that 
they were killed in a shootout 
in the manila area alone at least 22 drug pushers have been 
killed in shootouts with police since herrera made his charges 
about the police and military in october 
sen neptali gonzalez a former justice secretary said the 
killings should persuade drug dealers to turn themselves in and 
seek government protection 
otherwise they may soon find themselves targets of 
elimination he said

us companies dont want to miss out on 
opportunities in eastern europe but they are moving with caution 
as general electric co signaled this past week with its investment 
in a hungarian light bulb maker 
ges 150 million purchase of a 50 percent stake in tungsram was 
labeled as one of the biggest us investments to date in eastern 
europe but in fact it was not especially large 
the sum was dwarfed by ges announcement on friday of plans to 
spend 10 billion over the next five years on repurchasing its own 
stock ge chairman john welch described the hungarian investment as 
a prudent risk not a headoverheels plunge 
there are good reasons for caution communist political systems 
appear to be crumbling but the bloody suppression of protest in 
china this past june is a reminder that an authoritarian reaction 
remains possible 
also the currencies of eastern europe as in the soviet union 
are nonconvertible meaning it is difficult for western companies 
to take profits home from their joint ventures 
the positive side is that eastern europe is not only a huge 
potential market for consumer and capital goods but a source of 
inexpensive relatively welleducated workers a point recognized 
by general electric 
ge has bigger plans than selling light bulbs to hungarians 
welch told analysts and reporters friday that the company hopes to 
export lighting systems from hungary to western europe a market it 
has so far been unable to crack because of the domination of nv 
philips and siemens ag 
ge recognized that too much caution is dangerous too because 
there is a limited number of healthy potential business partners in 
eastern europe 
to some extent the choice spots will be taken by those who are 
there first said peter j pettibone a partner in the new york 
law firm of lord day amp lord barrett smith 
western european companies have a builtin advantage over 
americans when it comes to selling to and investing in eastern 
europe because of the geographic and cultural closeness 
less obviously the western europeans have a banking advantage 
the biggest american banks were burned by foolish lending to latin 
america and are neither willing nor able to make a big plunge into 
eastern europe 
west german banks in contrast are rich and willing notes 
donald wich a new york marketing director for the german american 
chamber of commerce the german banks are more likely to lend to 
companies from west germany than to say an eastman kodak co or 
ford motor co 
volkswagen ag of west germany produces car engines in east 
germany and italys fiat produces cars in poland for export to 
western europe but so far the wests embrace of the socalled iron 
curtain nations has been less than wholehearted 
the ferment in eastern europe has overshadowed the opportunities 
in the soviet union but developments also continued there this 
past week the joint commercial commission met in washington this 
past week bringing together commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
and his soviet counterpart konstantin katushev to discuss 
lowering barriers to trade and investment 
in spite of all the talk investments in the soviet union remain 
modest the typical investment in ussoviet joint ventures is 3 
million according to a survey earlier this year by lord day amp 
lord barrett smith 
when europes abb asea brown boveri ltd bought connecticuts 
combustion engineering inc this past week for 16 billion a 
company executive said it was charging full speed ahead into 
the east bloc 
in fact abb gets less than 1 percent of its revenue in the 
eastern bloc and president percy barnevik told reporters he is 
hoping to raise that to perhaps 3 percent to 35 percent 
yes businesses are moving into eastern europe but with caution 
in other business and economic news this past week 
government reports indicated economic sluggishness reports 
said factory utilization slumped to the lowest level in 1 years 
and retail sales sank by the biggest amount in 2 years as auto 
sales tumbled a big drop in the trade deficit mainly was the 
result of slowing imports although exports rose 
dun amp bradstreet corp announced an expensive overhaul of its 
creditservices operation after being embarrassed by widespread 
customer complaints it said the reforms would cut next years 
profits about a tenth analysts had been predicting an earnings 
gain in 1990 
delta air lines announced it would buy up to 260 jets from 
mcdonnell douglas corp and boeing co in a transaction that could 
be worth more than 10 billion texas air corp said its 
continental airlines unit would buy 45 billion worth of jetliners 
from airbus industrie the european consortium

from the thanksgiving feast to new years day 
football stuffing oneself as plump as the turkey seems almost 
obligatory 
and while a certain smugness may be the reward for not 
indulging few will find that sufficient sustenance at the holiday 
table there are ways to enjoy the fat of the land without making 
the new years diet any tougher 
holidays should be subtitled national days of carbohydrates 
and fat ellen brown writes in the gourmet gazelle cookbook 
bantam books 1995 a few years ago i was horrified to 
realize i had used more than four pounds of butter in cooking 
thanksgiving dinner for eight people 
its estimated that thanksgiving gobbling can total 3000 
calories two normal days worth of food for many women but 
thanksgiving in particular with its celebration of abundance and 
variety provides a chance to serve and eat healthy foods without 
feeling left out a key is flavorful traditionminded dishes 
without large amounts of fats cholesterol or salt 
the centerpiece of most feasts turkey is a good place to start 
you should take off the skin for your portion if youre trying 
to lose weight said barbara kafka author of microwave gourmet 
healthstyle cookbook william morrow and co inc 2295 the 
skin unfortunately and sadly is going to contain a major portion 
of the fat and the cholesterol in the bird 
the roast turkey recipe in the american heart associations 
lowfat lowcholesterol cookbook times books 1895 calls 
for stuffing the bird with parsley sprigs apples and crushed 
peppercorns a separate recipe for cornbread dressing uses egg 
whites vegetable spray and just one tablespoon of margarine 
kafka also suggests paying close attention to side dishes and 
considering skipping such traditional items as creamed onions 
buttery mashed potatoes and sugary canned cranberry sauce 
i think people want some connection to the traditions even 
if they are willing to make some changes she said for dessert she 
plans to make a pumpkin pudding which is lighter than pie but 
satisfies most people in the sense of color sweetness 
were not trying to set out to deprive people if people walk 
around feeling constantly deprived they are not going to stick 
with a diet its very important not to set up an antithesis 
between healthy food and pleasure 
kafka will serve a fairly traditional thanksgiving vegetable 
soup turkey with a simple breadandsage stuffing baked sweet 
potatoes braised leeks raw cranberry sauce with some of the 
canned version for the children apple pie and pumpkin pudding 
for a giblet gravy thats lighter than normal she suggests 
cooking the turkey neck wing tips and giblets except the liver 
in a container of water in the microwave then rather than the 
fatty pan drippings use the broth as the gravy base 
to help make the meal a feast 
choose the freshest foods possible 
eat slowly and savor the flavors and less food will be enough 
decide in advance which indulgence foods are important and 
which can be passed stick to those decisions 
but in the end if the stuffing or the creamed onions or the 
candied sweet potatoes are what makes you happy go ahead 
its better to eat regular food if thats going to make you 
happy but then try not to clean your plate kafka said its 
not going to kill you to have something festive that has butter one 
day a year

the waning weeks of the year provide 
stockmarket investors with a rare opportunity to look favorably on 
their mistakes 
those shares you bought for 50 that now sell for 32 arent 
just a painful lesson in the risks of playing the market theyre 
a potential tax deduction 
that may not be consolation enough to soothe your regrets over 
the loss of some hardearned capital but it may be sufficient 
reason to warrant taking some action before 1989 ends 
if you transform a theoretical paper loss into an actual one 
by selling the offending securities the loss you realize 
including brokerage commissions you paid at both purchase and 
sale can be deducted without limit from any capital gains you had 
during the year 
people with more losses than gains or no gains at all can 
deduct losses against their other income up to a maximum of 3000 
a year losses beyond that are carried forward to future years 
financial advisers urge anyone who is a candidate for yearend 
maneuvers along these lines not to delay much longer 
depressed investments which are most likely choices for tax 
selling often get further depressed in december when that tax 
selling reaches its peak they point out 
in addition they say it may take a little time and planning to 
decide what you want to do with the money you receive from the sale 
the rules dont permit selling a security to realize a loss and 
simultaneously buying it back in fact if the offsetting purchase 
occurs any time within 30 days beforehand or afterward it is 
considered a wash sale and the loss cant be deducted 
a common way to skirt this obstacle is to switch into some 
similar security say a stock of another company in a comparable 
business with about the same business prospects 
switching is especially suited to bond investments where you 
can shop for a security of a different issuer with a yield 
maturity and credit rating much the same as the one you sold 
william brennan editor of the ernst amp young financial planning 
reporter advises wouldbe bond swappers dont delay making a 
decision until december it takes time to find comparable bonds 
with stocks switching is more problematic since the 
performances of individual companies stock prices can be 
drastically affected by a long list of variables 
furthermore you still may consider the future bright for a 
stock you own that has been a disappointment to date 
if you want to take a deductible loss while sticking with that 
stock you have two primary choices sell it now and buy it back 
31 days later or buy another chunk now and sell the original 
holding after 31 days have passed 
the alternative of buying another chunk now protects you against 
the risk that the stock might suddenly soar while you have 
temporarily stepped aside but it demands prompt action for any 
losses you want to take in 1989 
any good broker should be ready and eager to help you through 
the process of taking judicious tax losses as well as suggesting 
strategies for postponing capital gains into 1990 
after all yearend tax transactions are a timetested source of 
commission revenue for the broker and his or her firm 
thats a point worth bearing in mind for the customer as well as 
the broker the research devoted to any yearend tax planning 
should include an appraisal of whether the tax savings achieved are 
worth the transaction costs

investors spooked by the stock market have taken to precious 
metals a fact reflected by the sparkling performance of the gold 
silver and platinum markets in the past week 
the rise in prices also has caught the attention of jewelry 
makers and other commercial consumers of precious metals whose 
highervolume buying underscores the consensus among analysts that 
prices are unlikely to lapse to the relatively low levels that have 
prevailed for much of this year 
the price of gold traditionally the bellwether of the precious 
metals complex has jumped nearly 8 percent in the five weeks since 
the stock markets 190point plunge on oct 13 gold for december 
delivery on new yorks commodity exchange closed at 39580 a troy 
ounce friday compared to 38860 a week earlier 
december silver soared to 5685 an ounce from 526 during a 
week of heavy trading on the commodity exchange while platinum for 
january delivery on the new york mercantile exchange rose to 
52660 an ounce from 50960 
analysts closely are watching the gold market as an indicator of 
the rallys underlying strength a move above 400 an ounce a key 
psychological barrier last crossed in late january likely would 
bring new buyers into the market and push prices sharply higher 
i suspect well see gold test the 400 level before the years 
end said bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber 
inc in new york 
other analysts said the gold market seemed poised for a test of 
400 an ounce as early as next week 
precious metals especially gold traditionally are perceived as 
a safe haven for investors during periods of rapid inflation or 
economic uncertainty when it is considered more likely to hold its 
value than paper currencies or stocks 
analysts say the stock markets volatility has made us 
investors nervous enough to move some of their dollars into 
precious metals meanwhile the farreaching political and social 
changes occurring in eastern europe have stirred fears of economic 
trouble among european investors and driven them to the gold and 
silver markets as well 
youre seeing a lot of retail buying from investors who have 
stood on the sidelines for two years said bruce l kaplan 
president of kaplan amp co a los angelesbased metals and coins 
dealer the money seems to be coming out of the stock and bond 
markets 
experts also have noted heavy buying of precious metals by 
japanese interests in the past week perhaps reflecting investor 
uneasiness in the far east or stockpiling by japanese jewelers 
you can never underestimate the potential demand from japan 
for both platinum and gold savaiko said platinum is the most 
popular jewelry metal in japan 
platinum got an additional boost from the midweek release of 
revised 1989 supply and demand projections by londonbased johnson 
matthey plc the worlds largest platinum refiner 
johnson matthey predicted world platinum consumption would 
outstrip production by 120000 ounces this year which would make 
1989 the fifth straight year of deficit production and falling 
warehouse stocks 
the silver market showed remarkable strength wednesday through 
friday analysts said the market was playing catchup with gold and 
platinum after lagging behind those markets

prices were little changed although prospects for more us 
food aid to poland continued supporting the pork markets a monthly 
agriculture department report released after the close of trading 
friday showed three percent fewer cattle on feedlots nov 1 than on

expectations the report also showed an unexpectedly large number 
of feedlot placements last month that was expected to prompt 
fairly heavy selling of live cattle futures when trading resumes

as political barriers have toppled between 
communist and capitalist parts of europe in recent days wall 
street analysts have been watching with a particular sense of 
urgency 
they see a rare opportunity to spot turning points that might 
well shape economic and financial trends worldwide for years to 
come 
preoccupied as they may often seem with fleeting matters the 
next swing in interest rates or a 15cent reduction in some 
companys earnings estimate for the next fiscal quarter most 
stockmarket professionals are perpetually searching for news with 
a longer shelflife 
these prizes dont turn up very often like the weather 
financial trends are even more resistant to longterm analysis than 
they are to shortterm forecasting 
so the developments in berlin in poland and elsewhere along the 
front lines of the cold war have struck many wall streeters as the 
equivalent of a new gold mine full of risks as well as rewards 
if the eastern bloc continues to liberalize the world is 
going to look very different in a few years said michael sherman 
at shearson lehman hutton inc as a result financial markets 
will undergo major changes some bullish some not so bullish 
at this early stage analysts readily acknowledge the puzzle 
they have to work with is a vast one with many pieces that are 
hard to fit together 
they also caution that a seeming triumph for capitalism can be 
suddenly reversed as happened earlier this year at in china at 
tiananmen square 
at some stage eastern europe will pass a point of no return on 
the path to democracy and it will be impossible for the soviets to 
turn back the clock observed john connolly at dean witter 
reynolds inc 
the trick will be to get to that point quickly before the 
door is shut but not so quickly that evolution devolves into 
revolution and invites reaction 
that kind of qualified optimism seemed to fit the mood of 
investors in general during the past week the dow jones average of 
30 industrial stocks rose 2705 to 265266 
the new york stock exchange composite index climbed 138 to 
18928 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
gained 093 to 45672 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 188 at 37335 
big board volume averaged 14769 million shares a day against 
14876 million the week before 
if capitalism is about to flower in eastern europe most 
analysts see a vast range of possible implications for the worlds 
financial markets 
said sherman trade flows between the west and east could 
accelerate sharply bank credits to eastern bloc countries could 
explode defense budgets would come under enormous downward 
pressure 
adds greg smith at prudentialbache securities the very 
obvious eager demand for american identifiable brand names such as 
levis nike cocacola and mcdonalds means that a huge market 
exists that might well be able to afford these products within the 
intermediate future assuming that no political disruptions occur 
along the way 
furthermore noted connolly a lot of machinery will be needed 
both traditional and technological capital goods 
amid all the optimism however analysts caution that securities 
markets are subject to wide and unpredictable changes of heart as 
they adjust to something as complicated as the situation in europe 
trying to draw some economic conclusions about these 
developments is guesswork at the very best said smith i 
suggest that when the joy and excitement subside something like a 
hangover could be ahead 
theres a lot of risk associated with moving from a very 
centralized controlled political system to one with more individual 
participation
