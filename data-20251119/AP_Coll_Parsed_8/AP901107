in this glamorous tax haven moneys playground by 
the sea the idle rich are making room for the busy bustling rich 
aristocrats still risk fortunes at the casinos velvetcovered 
tables but the 380acre principality is catering to a new breed of 
wealth and power 
it seeks the working rich who may spend a week in monaco not 
six months like the grand dukes of a century ago to check on an 
industrial investment watch the grand prix or attend a business 
convention 
on a stroll through the casino gardens youre more likely to 
meet carpet salesmen from toronto than european royalty last year 
monaco welcomed 50000 conventiongoers 
tourism now generates only onefourth of the 5 billion gross 
national product gambling once the governments mainstay brings 
in only 4 percent 
banking accounts for 35 percent and light industry 27 monaco 
now has 50 banks and more are coming 
prince rainier who has ruled since 1949 sought to preserve and 
capitalize on monacos reputation for glamor when he called for 
economic diversification 
the government has put its money behind prestige and luxury 
said a public relations officer for the principality it used to 
bank on the very rich today it has sought to develop a clientele 
of the slightly less rich 
hotel statistics are revealing monaco has 2400 rooms 80 
percent in the luxury category going for 200 to 450 fewer than 
100 rooms cost less than 50 
officials try to keep industry and tourism apart hardly any of 
the 3 million daytrippers who spilled from trains and buses last 
year went near the industrial park on fontvieille a peninsula 
reclaimed from the sea 
many of the monacos 700 industrial companies are there most 
are in such hightech nonpolluting fields as pharmaceuticals 
cosmetics and engineering 
a value added tax on the new commercial activities is the 
largest source of revenue in monacos annual budget of 510 
million 
fontvieille accommodates both factories and company 
headquarters stacked atop each other in skyscrapers nearby are a 
new sports stadium threestar hotel heliport and monacos only 
lowincome housing 
it was the brainchild of prince rainier who saw the future of 
his tiny realm in real estate a forest of skyscrapers eyesores to 
many visitors looms against a background of steep mountains 
dwarfing hillside villas built in the 19th century 
commercial or residential space in monaco generally is more 
expensive than in paris and new york a tworoom apartment in 
fontvieille rents for 3000 a month and cheaper accommodations 
are hard to find 
housing has become a major headache the government gives 
priority for stateowned housing and rent subsidies of up to 50 
percent to the natives called monegasques but demand exceeds 
supply 
many apartments are owned by investors who spend little time in 
them at night dark windows make patches on luxury highrises 
nightlife revolves around a few expensive discotheques and 
clubs and cultural events geared to the wealthy establishment 
young residents complain of little to do monaco has only one 
movie theater no discount or department stores no major shopping 
center 
there is virtually no unemployment yet monegasques about 
4500 in a population of 27000 worry about the future 
the problem is not finding jobs for young monegasques its 
finding jobs suited to their educational degrees and 
qualifications said stephane valeri 28 
he heads the association of young monegasques founded in 1986 
to handle their employment and housing problems and help them start 
businesses citizens now own less than 3 percent of commerce and 
industry in monaco but valeri said new opportunities were opening 
in services and the law 
were very attached to our history our traditions and to the 
royal family he said were just trying to make monaco better 
for the year 2000 
in addition to the myth that all are rich which the government 
tries to dispel monegasques have a reputation as poor workers 
some monegasques adopt a superior attitude and feel they 
can get away with anything because they know they cant be fired 
a government spokesperson said on condition of anonymity 
the 5000 italians who cross the border each day to work in 
hotels and restaurants envy the privileges of monegasques 
including comprehensive health insurance higher wages and the 
first crack at vacant jobs 
residents of this fiscal paradise except for french nationals 
who have arrived since 1957 pay no taxes on income capital gains 
or on an inheritance if it comes directly from a parent or spouse 
security and respectability are basic tenets the police force 
has 400 members who help tourists direct traffic and discourage 
pursesnatching and other crimes 
monaco is the type of place where you think twice about 
dropping candy wrappers said a retired greek executive who has 
lived here 35 years you feel very safe and life is very calm 
a dress code confines bathing suits to the beach and forbids 
going barefoot shorts are permitted but men are not allowed to go 
bare chested expulsion from monaco is the punishment for 
violations 
officials know the future depends on physical expansion besides 
putting the train station underground architects unveiled plans 
last year for three floating islands with their own stores and 
homes connected to the mainland by bridges and ferries 
it sounds like jules verne but its something im sure my 
successors will have to deal with said jeanlouis medecin the 
mayor

egyptian president hosni mubarak said wednesday 
that usled forces should wait at least two to three more 
months to decide if the trade embargo will force iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait a newspaper reported 
in an interview published in the new york times on thursday 
mubarak warned that if iraqi president saddam hussein doesnt pull 
his troops out of kuwait war will be inevitable 
there will be no other way out mubarak told the times i 
am not bluffing i dont think the united states is bluffing how 
can saddam hussein make such a miscalculation of his situation it 
is very dangerous for him very dangerous i wonder how he cannot 
realize that 
in an interview in cairo mubarak said it is time for the united 
nations security council to approve a resolution authorizing the 
use of force to drive iraq from kuwait if diplomacy fails 
the problem of saddam hussein is that he is one man against 
the world and even against himself simply because he does not 
realize the real danger around him mubarak said and his 
entourage is not briefing him

in taking on the presidency of the american 
red cross elizabeth dole is moving to the helm of an organization 
that has known controversy from the days of clara barton to the era 
of aids and the loma prieta earthquake 
she isnt likely to face criticism for living in a tent and 
directing operations from the field as red cross founder barton 
did but she could end up having easily as many battles on her hand 
as she did in president bushs cabinet 
after a year in which it faced record disaster expenditures the 
organization has taken heat not only for its handling of such 
emergencies but for its role as a supplier of blood for 
transfusions 
elizabeth dole has the stature and talent to revitalize the 
national rd cross and make it the kind of modern helping force 
necessary for disasters in the 1990s san francisco mayor art 
agnos said when the outgoing labor secretary was named to the new 
job 
from our experience in the loma prieta earthquake it is 
needed agnos added 
others echoed his view 
when the national red cross has become involved in the past 
there has been a letdown in coordination said carl bradford 
director of emergency services for west virginia the red cross 
seems to function very well at the local level but when national 
comes in they do not work as well with state and local 
governments 
carol mcarthur press secretary to oakland calif mayor lionel 
wilson was so upset by the red cross performance after the oct 
17 1989 earthquake in northern california that she resigned from 
the board of the organizations oakland and east bay chapter 
the local red cross was very very efficient but they had 
national representatives breathing down their necks ms mcarthur 
said mainly the problems had to do with individuals not 
understanding the varied needs of the ethnically diverse community 
we have here 
jim cassell a media associate at red cross headquarters said 
the organization is making a study of its disaster services due 
for completion in march 
we will look at all disasters including the major ones of 
last year the earthquake on the west coast and hurricane hugo in 
the east cassell said he said the study was in large measure 
due to our own interest in always improving our services and 
not just in response to criticism from outside 
richard smith vice president and general manager at the 
organizations eastern operations headquarters in alexandria va 
said we have learned a lot of lessons we can put into our 
operational planning right away 
mostly our need is to try to streamline our training he 
said at a time when emotions and passions can run rather high 
and then you bring augmented resources in from outside it is very 
challenging to make sure you do that so that feelings dont get 
rubbed in the wrong way some people have worse skills than others 
in doing that and we sometimes have moments of tension 
we had a difficult year but all that assessment is being put 
to our improvement said smith 
in a separate initiative the red cross announced in august that 
it was substituting centralized management for its system of local 
control in each of 54 blood service regions which supply blood to 
more than half the hospitals in the united states 
the action followed months of scrutiny by the news media and the 
food and drug administration in 1988 the red cross acknowledged 
it distributed 24 pints of blood that had failed aids procedures 
but said none of the blood was used and none carried the aids 
virus the fda said the units were shipped by red cross centers in 
washington and nashville tenn 
brad stone an fda spokesman said the purpose of those 
reforms is to help the red cross come into greater compliance with 
our standards we have an ongoing system of inspections and so we 
hope the improvements they are making will be reflected in those 
inspections we are very encouraged by the steps they are taking 
the american red cross is one of 150 national red cross and red 
crescent societies affiliated with the international committee of 
the red cross based in geneva in some countries the society is 
an arm of the government but in the united states it is a private 
organization supported by contributions 
congress gave the red cross a charter in 1918 to conduct 
disaster preparedness and relief there is no congressioal 
oversight however 
the american red cross has around 2700 chapters a paid staff 
of 25000 and more than 1 million volunteers in 1989 it received 
a record 165 million in donations and spent 151 million more 
than tripling the previous record its national office is in 
washington it has operational headquarters for the east coast in 
alexandria va for the midwest in st louis and for the west in 
burlingame calif 
clara barton a former schoolteacher and government clerk who 
became a superintendent of nurses during the civil war founded the 
group as the american association of the red cross in 1881 and 
became its first president 
she was always very much handson when a big disaster 
struck said james perry a national park service ranger at the 
clara barton house in glen echo md she would personally lead 
the field operation 
during the johnstown pa flood of 1889 miss barton was in the 
field for five months 
critics of her style of personal leadership forced her 
resignation in 1904 at the age of 83 
mrs dole 54 will become president in january she succeeds 
richard schubert who resigned from the 185000ayear job more 
than a year ago 
smith whose first disaster experience with the red cross was in 
the aftermath of hurricane camille in louisiana in 1969 said the 
role of the red cross has changed since it was chartered by 
congress in 1918 
at that point the federal agencies role was much more in 
dealing with public utilities and infrastructure and much less with 
individual families and so the red cross in those days took the 
primary job even of rebuilding peoples homes and longterm 
recovery help the red cross vice president said as the 
federal government expanded its role to be more that of longterm 
recovery the red cross withdrew from that and put more emphasis on 
shortterm emergency response 
government disaster relief is now run by the federal emergency 
management agency created during the carter administration as a 
consolidation of several programs 
peg maloy assistant associate director for public affairs at 
fema said if the president signs a major disaster declaration 
we become the coordinator we also then give disaster money and 
temporary housing to the red cross for some of the work that they 
do we have a memorandum of understanding with the red cross we 
also sit on their national board

william j bennett who crafted the strategy 
for the bush administrations war on drugs will resign within a 
week an administration source said tuesday night 
bennett 47 feels he has completed the task of designing a 
strategy for the drug war and that it is working said the source 
this source said personal reasons including safety concerns for 
himself and his family also played a part in his decision to 
resign as director of the office of national drug control strategy 
the washington post reported on the resignation in wednesdays 
editions 
the white house has scheduled a ceremony to announce the 
resignation and that could possibly be before friday said the 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
no one has yet been tapped to replace bennett the source said 
the source denied that bennett was leaving because of boredom 
even though bennett has seemed testy in recent months over the 
relative lack of public interest in drug problems as the persian 
gulf and economic woes took center stage 
its not boredom the source said he set out to do a 
task hes done it and hes seeing the fruition of it now hes 
going on to the next phase of his life 
bennett does not have another job lined up the source said 
the personal reasons and security concerns have become 
increasingly important in the past few weeks according to the 
source 
theres been some threats bomb threats personal threats 
the source said on a recent swing through alaska where he 
campaigned for a ballot measure to recriminalize marijuana a 
third bodyguard was assigned to bennett 
the concerns said the source have been building ive seen 
it start to eat away at him 
bennett and his wife have two young sons 
president bush joined bennett in september to mark the oneyear 
anniversary of the drug strategy and to call attention to signs 
that the cocaine crisis appears to be abating such signs include 
higher prices and lower purity slightly fewer emergency room cases 
involving cocaine and surveys showing americans of all ages 
turning against illegal drugs of all kinds 
bennetts job was created by congress in 1988 to coordinate the 
efforts of several dozen federal agencies involved in the war on 
drugs congress created the post as a cabinetlevel job but bush 
decided not to include bennett in his cabinet and bennett said he 
did not mind

unprecedented fourth fouryear term tuesday just seven months

television encountered the offyear elections 
tuesday night like a doctor ordering a full set of tests to take a 
patients temperature 
it was the election of our discontent cbs correspondent 
bruce morton said in the early going before the nations dreaded 
antiincumbency mood stopped short of actually ousting any major 
rascals 
it had fewer commercials 
and for the first time cable news network and the big three 
broadcast networks pooled resources for election night exit polls 
and winner projections in a collaborative effort called voter 
research and surveys or vrs 
there are always problems the first time you do anything 
said vrs spokeswoman susan morrison adding that there were no big 
problems with winner projections or the state exit polls 
there was a delay in national exit polls which tended to arrive 
all at once because vrs chief warren mitofsky wanted to ensure the 
weighting of 9000 to 10000 interviews accurately reflected 
the national trends 
it worked very well for us said cnn spokeswoman melinda 
mcintire by 9 pm est she said vrs let the cable network 
project 38 governor and senate races its been extremely helpful 
in our analyzing voters in geographic and demographic breakdowns 
by midnight vrs had issued 72 projected winners in senate 
governor and referendum questions ms morrison said 
abc and nbc kept the first two hours of their prime time 
entertainment coverage dropping in brief spot reports until 
hourlong specials at 10 pm est cbs coverage went the distance 
from 9 pm to 11 
but nbcs onehour special and cbs two hours were 
sustaining read unsponsored programs which dont count 
in the november ratings sweeps that help local stations set 
their advertising rates 
the overall ratings race is tight this year and typically low 
election night ratings could pull down a networks overall numbers 
toprated nbc quickly followed suit after cbs said it would air no 
commercials 
cnn which has no prime time entertainment programs began its 
coverage at 6 pm est as the world today neatly capsulized key 
races by 7 pm cnns main coverage was in full swing 
abc and cbs led their nightly news shows with sixminute 
election reports their second story was the assassination of 
radical rabbi meir kahane nbc led its news with nine minutes on 
the election before getting to the kahane story 
cbs election night anchor dan rather spent the night in 
shirtsleeves red tie and burgundystriped suspenders he also got 
off the best quote early were going to be all over these races 
like paint on a wall 
and the graphics 
abc and cbs colored their democrats blue and the gop red 
contrariwise nbc made its democrats red and the republicans blue 
abcs the 90 vote computer graphics screens had a 
traditional look to them candidate pictures numbers percentages 
precincts reporting and the network closed its main coverage with 
a roll of the winners 
nbcs decision 90 graphics were busy and postmodern the 
candidate pictures superimposed on a split ppurple grid beside

bullard president of public relations at universal 
the fire raged in a sound stage area to the rear of the 
studio lot said fire department spokesman pat marek at least 24

used as background for filming are constructed 
the fire is not the first to strike universal in 1987 a stage 
used for the 1959 epic spartacus erupted in flames causing 
25 million in damage

not gain recognition until the 1920s when it produced several 
nowclassic silent films including the phantom of the opera 
and the hunchback of notre dame

news agency reported 
the us geological survey in golden colo said initial 
readings put the quakes magnitude at 70 on the richter scale 
irans geophysics center of tehran university said it measured 66

damage a quake measuring 77 on the richter scale struck northern 
iran on june 21 killing an estimated 50000 people

democrat lawton chiles unseated floridas gov 
bob martinez and ann richards won in texas as democrats wrested 
two big states from gop control tuesday in elections that saw 
incumbents struggle for political survival 
democratic challengers ousted republican governors in rhode 
island kansas and florida 
richards defeat of republican clayton williams in texas bitter 
and tumultuous governors race capped a remarkable comefrombehind 
race williams a bluntspoken texas millionaire squandered a big 
lead in the polls through a series of verbal campaign gaffes 
the gop losses in texas and florida were stinging defeats for 
president bush who visited florida three times to stump for 
martinez and spent the last three days of the campaign in his 
adoptive home state of texas campaigning for williams 
democrats were quick to point to the results as spelling 
political trouble for the president 
to the degree that george bush was a factor he was a 
burden said ohios retiring gov richard celeste head of the 
democratic governors association we have an opportunity to do 
what was inconceivable six months ago that is defeat a republican 
president 
republicans scored gains too however and recaptured the 
governorships in vermont and ohio where democrats are retiring 
republican gov ed diprete lost the rhode island statehouse he 
had held since 1984 to bruce sundlun a democrat he had defeated 
twice before democrat joan finney defeated firstterm republican 
gov mike hayden in kansas 
maines republican gov john mckernan held a slim lead over 
democratic challenger joseph brennan a former governor who led in 
initial returns 
nebraskas republican gov kay orr narrowly trailed her 
democratic challenger ben nelson with threequarters of the votes 
in 
the republican incumbents found themselves the victims of voter 
anger over tax increases and regional economic downturns as well 
as various local issues abortion was a factor in several races 
with victories by both supporters and opponents of abortion rights 
new englands recession hurt most of that regions incumbents 
and diprete suffered from scandals surrounding his family and 
political allies the gop governors in kansas and nebraska were in 
hot water over local property taxes 
some democrats faced stiff challenges too michigan gov james 
blanchard bidding for a third term narrowly trailed republican 
john engler in incomplete returns 
republican george voinovich won in ohio giving the gop 
celestes statehouse office celeste called it my special 
disappointment 
an independent former gop sen lowell weicker won a threeway 
race in connecticut where the democrat also is retiring 
in the democratic bastion of massachusetts republican william 
weld held the slimmest of leads over outspoken conservative 
democrat john silber republican hopes were boosted by democratic 
divisions in the state where former democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis is retiring as governor in the depths of 
recessioninspired unpopularity 
in illinois a state in gop hands for more than a decade 
democrat neil hartigan and republican jim edgar were locked in a 
virtual tie with more than half the vote in 
both parties had focused on the bigthree states california 
texas and florida where governors will influence new 
congressional district maps to be drawn next year 
gop sen pete wilson held the lead over democrat dianne 
feinstein in early returns from california 
democrat barbara roberts held a small lead in oregon 
with returns still far from complete democrats had scored a net 
gain of four seats they captured six governorships previously held 
by republicans florida oklahoma rhode island new mexico texas 
and kansas and they led in several more including illinois and 
maine 
republicans won in two states now in democratic hands ohio and 
vermont and were leading in several others they included 
massachusetts michigan and minnesota 
martinez who failed in his bid to become floridas first 
twoterm republican governor called chiles to concede defeat as 
chiless substantial lead held up in incomplete returns 
he was very very gracious and said he wanted to help us with 
the transition said chiles who called the campaign the most 
glorious glorious time of my life 
chiles support for abortion rights was a significant factor in 
the race according to network television voter interviews the 
exsenator also had refused to accept contributions over 200 
both chiles and connecticuts weicker are former senators 
weicker defeated two years ago after three terms as a senate 
republican becomes the first independent governor elected since 
maines james longley in 1974 
the michigan race was a special target of abortion groups as 
blanchard supported abortion rights and engler opposed them 
the kansas race was a victory for abortion opponents as finney 
the democrat was an abortion foe and hayden the gop incumbent 
had supported abortion rights 
guy hunt alabamas first republican governor in this century 
withstood a strong challenge to win reelection over democrat paul 
hubbert 
democrat david walters won in oklahoma where the republican 
incumbent was retiring georgia democrat zell miller defeated 
republican johnny isakson 
democrats recaptured new mexico where the republican incumbent 
was retiring the winner bruce king is a former governor another 
former governor republican richard snelling won in vermont 
republican governors winning reelection included carroll 
campbell in south carolina judd gregg in new hampshire tommy 
thompson in wisconsin george mickelson in south dakota and terry 
branstad in iowa 
democratic incumbents reelected included ned ray mcwherter in 
tennessee william donald schaefer in maryland robert p caey in 
pennsylvania bob miller in nevada john waihee in hawaii cecil 
andrus in idaho colorados roy romer arkansas bill clinton and 
wyomings mike sullivan 
branstads victory came despite a determined effort by 
abortionrights supporters andrus won despite stirring the wrath 
of abortion foes by vetoing a bill that would have restricted legal 
abortions 
voinovich won over ohio democrat anthony celebrezze in a race 
where abortionrights forces strongly backed the democrat 
celebrezze was a strong abortion opponent until last december when 
he switched positions drawing the enmity of his former allies and 
earning a flipfloppers tag that he never overcame 
in minnesota twoterm gov rudy perpich was locked in a close 
race despite turmoil and scandal that engulfed his gop opposition 
republican arne carlson got on the ballot only last week after jon 
grunseth stepped aside amid charges of sexual impropriety

read their votes no new taxes are likely to 
escape unpunished at the polls 
that was among the voter messages tuesday night in offyear 
elections that hit republicans where it will hurt for a decade 
costing them governors just as the states get ready to draw new 
lines for their congressional districts 
democrats were gaining reinforcements for their house majority 
a gain of about 10 seats was in prospect as the ballot count moved 
westward but their biggest prize was increased control in the 
redistricting process that will be a major factor in shaping 
congressional elections for the rest of the century 
republicans lost in texas a state in which their candidate for 
governor was the early favorite democrat ann richards the state 
treasurer won instead 
in florida lawton chiles a former senator was elected 
governor over a oneterm republican 
the biggest gop gubernatorial gain ohio where former cleveland 
mayor george voinovich takes over after eight democratic years 
in competition for the senate there was no party turnover in 
the partial count tuesday night and incumbents who ran won 
including north carolina sen jesse helms the conservative 
republican whose seat had seemed at risk democratic control never 
was in doubt 
and house incumbents were once again proving their staying 
power more than 95 percent of those who sought new terms got them 
at midnight the partial count showed that five house incumbents 
had lost with a handful more in jeopardy 
but in new jersey a democratic state tax increase put a 
surprising dent in the campaign of sen bill bradley who had to 
struggle to a narrow win over a republican challenger who had not 
looked like a serious threat 
it wasnt a good night for the twoterm senator who ranks among 
the 1992 democratic presidential prospects and was sure enough of 
his own prospects to do some campaigning for candidates in other 
states 
bradley apparently was caught in the undertow of resentment over 
taxes that gov james j florio pushed through the legislature 
after ruling out increases during his 1989 campaign 
and a hairline reelection edge is hardly good advertising for a 
presidential campaign 
numbers were no problem for gov mario cuomo of new york who 
ranks atop most lists of 1992 democratic prospects for the white 
house he won towering reelection 
so did sens sam nunn of georgia unopposed and albert gore jr 
of tennessee 
gov bill clinton of arkansas another democrat whos had 
presidential ideas won easy reelection too but clinton returns 
to office pledged to serve his full fouryear term which may rule 
him out of 1992 competition 
the tax issue dogged president bush after he scrapped his read 
my lips 1988 pledge against new taxes saying as he campaigned 
that congressional democrats made him accept increases as the price 
of a budget deal it showed in his slumping polls some republican 
candidates tried to edge away from the administration late in the 
campaign 
that didnt always succeed rep peter smith of vermont 
trumpeted his differences with bush when the president came to 
campaign for him tuesday night smith lost to socialist bernard 
sanders former mayor of burlington who ran narrowly behind him 
two years ago sanders would vote with the democratic majority in 
the house 
in rhode island and kansas taxtroubled republican governors 
lost another republican governor was locked in a tight struggle in 
nebraska republican gov john mckernan led narrowly in maine 
where he had been deemed a likely loser 
massachusetts democrats had trounced the establishment in their 
primary ousting democrats linked to outgoing gov michael s 
dukakis who pushed through a massive state tax increase earlier 
this year but the voters there spurned a ballot measure that would 
have rolled back 26 billion in state taxes democrat john silber 
and republican william weld were matched in a close count for 
governor there

district of columbia voters denied 
scandalscarred marion barry a city council seat tuesday and 
replaced him in the mayors office with sharon pratt dixon a 
democrat who promised to clean house in the troubled capital 
jesse jackson also won his first elected office an unpaid 
nonvoting shadow senate seat from which he will attempt to 
persuade congress to make the district of columbia a state 
dixon became the first black woman elected to lead a major 
american city she led former police chief maurice t turner the 
republican 86 percent to 12 percent 
civil rights activist eleanor holmes norton was elected 
nonvoting house delegate defeating republican harry singleton 
despite revelations that norton and her husband edward had paid 
no local taxes for seven years beginning in 1983 norton received 
59 percent of the vote compared to 30 percent for singleton 
jackson won an 11candidate shadow senate race with 44 
percent of the vote 
voters narrowly rejected a referendum that would have restored a 
comprehensive overnight shelter law that required the city to 
provide refuge to any homeless person that demands it the city 
council gutted the law earlier this year amid complaints that 
housing the homeless had become too expensive the measure to 
restore the original law failed by a margin of 51 percent to 49 
percent 
but the day belonged to dixon who rode her reformist platform 
into the office barry has held since 1978 
dixon was swept to victory with her pledge to root out 
corruption and waste within the city government chief among her 
promises has been to cut 2000 middlelevel managers from the city 
payroll a move she has said will save 95 million 
turner hit dixon for her lack of experience and said her plan to 
immediately cut the districts work force was inhumane 
barry failed in his bid to win a citywide council seat despite 
his claim to have rebounded from the personal woes that led to his 
drug conviction and sentencing to a sixmonth prison term he is 
free while appealing 
the mayor finished third behind democratic nominee linda cropp 
who had 39 percent of the vote and the incumbent statehood party 
nominee hilda mason who had 30 percent of the vote barry had 19 
percent

montana voters refused tuesday to adopt the 
highest cigarette tax in the country a measure both sides agreed 
was aimed at reducing tobacco use 
with 54 percent of precincts reporting the initiative was 
failing 59 percent to 41 percent 
the measure would have imposed a tax of 43 cents per pack on 
cigarettes up from 18 cents and doubled the tax on other tobacco 
products 
the tobacco industry spent more than 11 million to defeat the 
measure saying the tax revenue would be used only to hire more

oregon voters approved a measure tuesday 
to shut off welfare payments to the poor and offer lowpaying jobs 
instead 
incomplete unofficial returns showed 57 percent of voters 
favoring it 
the measure would establish a threeyear pilot program in six 
counties that eliminates food stamps federal aid to families with 
dependent children and unemployment benefits 
however the proposal cannot go into effect unless congress 
waives a number of federal laws and regulations 
under the plan people who are eligible for public assistance 
would be assigned to jobs with public or private employers and 
would be paid at 90 percent of the states minimum wage currently 
425 an hour 
opponents said the measure offered little more than slavery

the governments plan to build a dioxin 
incinerator at times beach was dealt at least a minor setback by 
st louis county residents voting on an advisory referendum 
tuesday 
the vote with 60 percent of the ballots counted was 95845 
against building the incinerator and 81708 in favor 
opponents of the incinerator who sponsored the nonbinding 
referendum hoped that a resounding no vote would convince state 
leaders particularly gov john ashcroft to stop the project 
the incinerator would burn dioxintainted soil from times beach 
and 27 other eastern missouri sites opponents say it would be 
unsafe in a heavily populated area such as st louis county and 
that it should not be built in a flood plain

democrats wrested governorships from the gop in texas florida 
and four other states on tuesday in midterm elections that sealed a 
season of republican disappointment democrats also expanded their 
dominion of congress in returns that heavily favored the 
incumbents 
north carolina gop sen jesse helms won reelection in the most 
closely watched senate race of 34 on the ballot 
democrats elected ann richards as governor of texas and lawton 
chiles in florida giving them the last word in redistricting that 
will add house seats to both sunbelt states for the next decade 
im sorry i let you down williams said in his concession 
speech president bush had spent the final weekend of the campaign 
in texas and williams defeat just punctuated a painful autumn for 
bush 
republicans looked to pete wilson to hold the california 
governship in his race against dianne feinstein and he was 
leading 
if voters were trying to express any discontent it certainly 
did not affect the senate where 30 out of 31 incumbents were being 
reelected the lone endangered senator was rudy boschwitz of 
minnesota a victory by paul wellstone would pad the democrats 
current 5545 majority 
upsets were few and far between but wisconsins democratic rep 
robert kastenmeier fell after 15 liberal terms in the house house 
republican whip newt gingrich was in a shocker barely winning a 
5050 georgia race 
democratic sen bill bradley survived a surprise close call 
winning reelection with 52 percent of the vote against a 
littleknown opponent who campaigned against tax increases 
engineered by a democratic governor 
mark hatfield won a 5th term as republican senator from oregon 
in a close race 
democrats renewed control over the house and aimed to improve 
their 259176 majority although the modest additions were not much 
to brag about 
the gop got good news in ohio where george voinovich won a 
democratic governorship and in massachusetts where william weld 
will succeed michael dukakis republicans were ahead in races to 
retain the statehouse in illinois and maine 
in connecticut gary franks became the first black house 
republican since 1935 
sen lowell weicker vexed the gop again this time as an 
outsider with an independent victory for governor of connecticut 
republican gov kay orr was trailing barely in nebraska 
vermont sent socialist bernie sanders to the house in place of 
a republican but former gop gov richard snelling won his old job 
back and with it the statehouse for his party 
the polls were still open in half the nation when the democrats 
proclaimed victory and pointed the voters toward the 1992 
presidential race i couldnt feel better said ron brown 
chairman of the democratic national committee both republicans 
and democrats ran against george bush 
charles black spoke for the republican national committee 
telling reporters it appears to be more of an antiincumbent 
trend than a partisan trend he called the midterm results an 
anticongress trend rather than an antipresident trend even 
though incumbent members were being reelected at a substantial 
rate 
well after midnight there was no shortage of close statehouse 
races 
john engler was battling democratic gov james blanchard in 
michigan 
gop gov john mckernan clung to a lead over former gov joseph 
brennan in maine 
illinois gop secretary of state jim edgar led neil hartigan

minnesota race marked by republican turmoil carlson was on the 
ballot only because jon grunseth dropped out in late october over 
allegations of sexual improprieties 
helms bested harvey gantt in his marquee race for reelection in 
a contest that pitted one of the nations best known conservatives 
against a former black mayor im sorry im so late he told 
supporters but ive been home watching the grieving face of dan 
rather the liberal politicians and editors and commentators and 
columnists have struck out again 
appointed democratic sen dan akaka won reelection in hawaii 
dashing the republicans only serious hope for a senate takeover 
three gop representatives were elected to open republican senate 
seats bob smith in new hampshire hank brown in colorado and larry 
craig in idaho 
alabama gop gov guy hunt won a close race for reelection 
more than 6100 legislative races crowded the ballots and 
voters in 43 states and the district of columbia decided ballot 
issues massachusetts rejected a proposed tax rollback 
new york gov mario cuomo won in a possible prelude to a 1992 
democratic presidential campaign besides bill bradley two other 
potential challengers to president bush won easy senate reelection 
al gore in tennessee sam nunn in georgia 
bush voted in his home state of texas after an energetic yet 
awkward campaign for gop candidates then returned to the white 
house to read the returns bush sparked a republican rebellion when 
he broke his memorable 1988 campaign pledge and embraced an october 
deficitreduction plan that raised tax rates 
george bush obviously has had a little setback on the polls 
but hes still the most popular president going into midterm 
elections in modern times said ed rollins the top political 
adviser to house republicans 
all in all the first election of the 1990s came at a time of 
extraordinary volatility with the nation on the verge of 
recession and on the edge of war in the persian gulf other issues 
emerged in scattered races abortion crime the savings and loan 
crisis and ethics scandals among them 
the pollsters agreed the voters were unhappy with the government 
and pessimistic about the economy but that failed to translate

democrats on tuesday padded their overwhelming 
control of political redistricting plucking the potent florida and 
texas governorships from gop hands and adding rhode island 
oklahoma and new mexico to their remapping monopolies 
the florida and texas defeats were disastrous for republicans 
and democrats were in the running for the only remaining major gop 
redistricting weapon the california governorship 
democrats clearly will have a huge edge when lines are drawn for 
1992 congressional races all but cementing the republicans as the 
house minority for another decade and perhaps far longer and 
democrats were calling the texas and florida victories a boost for 
their 1992 presidential hopes 
we feel better about the prospects of fair districts when the 
pen is in democratic hands said democratic national committee 
political director paul tully these are not only net victories 
but victories in places that because of their population growth 
will grow more important to the future of this country and also to 
the presidential race 
in all eight states will gain and 13 will lose seats when house 
districts are reapportioned to reflect population shifts of the 
1980s according to preliminary census data democrats will control 
the process outright in at least five of the states gaining house 
seats 
the ohio governorship was the only significant redistricting 
victory for republicans as results from gubernatorial and 
legislative races trickled in so frustrating was the gops night 
that the only redistricting monopoly the gop gained was in vermont 
which has only one house seat anyway 
despite the millions spent on oftignored state races with the 
postcensus redistricting in mind it appeared but a few of the 
dozen targeted chambers would change hands 
the gop turned back democratic efforts to take over the new 
york pennsylvania and ohio senates redistricting power in all 
three states which will lose house seats in 1992 will be shared 
republicans failed in their bid to wrest the illinois senate 
from democrats but won a close governors race to keep a say in 
redistricting there the gop was trailing in bids to win over the 
democratic florida senate and pennsylvania house early returns 
showed control of the oregon house within reach 
the indiana house was likely to go from gop hands to the 
democrats other democratic targets were the state senates in 
indiana michigan and washington and both chambers in arizona 
the gop suffered a big loss when democrat lawton chiles unseated 
floridas republican governor and things would only get worse 
the rhode island oklahoma and new mexico governors offices 
went from republican to democratic hands and then texas was seized 
by the democrats too 
democrats now will have sole power over the remapping in those 
states florida is likely to gain four house seats and texas three 
the house delegations in rhode island oklahoma and new mexico 
wont change but control of redistricting should allow democrats 
to draw districts that protect their house incumbents and perhaps 
endanger gop lawmakers 
another victory for democrats came in kansas where by unseating 
a republican governor the party went from being shut out of the 
process to having veto power in redistricting kansas will lose one 
house seat 
the republicans last hope was california which will get seven 
of the 19 shifting seats but even with a win in the governors 
race there the gop would only share the power with the democratic 
legislature 
democrats with huge majorities in many legislative chambers 
were virtually assured a redistricting voice in all the 
battleground states even before the polls opened tuesday 
the day began with democrats controlling 69 of the nations 99 
legislative chambers and 29 of the 50 governorships 
more than 6100 legislative races were decided across the 
country but the focus of national party organizations was about 50 
races in 10 states in which chambers are held by narrow majorities 
even with california undecided the democrats were in position 
to draw districts that in 1992 likely would pad their majority in 
the house now at 258175 by a dozen seats or more beyond whatever 
gains they made in tuesdays elections 
preliminary census data suggest the remaining five house seats 
that shift will go to virginia north carolina georgia washington 
and arizona among those states redistricting control was a 
serious question only in arizona democrats already had a 
redistricting monopoly in virginia and kept hold of their sole 
control in north carolina and georgia a nonpartisan commission 
draws the map in washington 
democrats were facing uphill odds in their effort to erase the 
arizona gops 1713 senate and 3426 house majorities but democrat 
terry goddard was leading in early returns in the governors race 
if elected he could veto any redistricting plan drawn by a 
possibly republican legislature 
among the 13 states losing seats new york will suffer the most 
giving up three 
gov mario cuomo was headed to easy reelection and the new york 
assembly had a 9258 democratic majority entering tuesdays voting 
results were slow to come in but democrats conceded they would not 
capture the senate where they had hoped to wipe out a fiveseat 
republican majority and gain a redistricting monopoly 
pennsylvania ohio michigan and illinois are to lose two seats 
each losing one will be massachusetts new jersey west virginia 
kentucky louisiana iowa kansas and montana democrats control 
the process in new jersey west virginia kentucky and louisiana 
in massachusetts iowa kansas and montana the power will be 
shared

andrew j willett knew just what his constituency 
would be doing on election day 
willett is mayor of the grate society as he and 15 to 20 
fellow homeless people call themselves in a grim parody of the 
social welfare experiment of the 1960s that aimed to wipe out 
hunger and poverty 
on election day as on most other days willett and others hang 
out near the boston public library in the morning they wash up at 
a transit stop then panhandle long enough to get money for food 
cigarettes and alcohol 
they sleep on grates to stay warm avoiding shelters as too 
dangerous or too rigid 
i would rather stay outside said willett who also acts as 
the groups banker keeping track of the money earned by 
panhandling or stemming until there is enough for a run 
usually to the liquor store 
two years after president bush called for a kinder gentler 
nation the homeless are as much a part of the urban landscape as 
graffiti and traffic 
they are also among societys most vulnerable citizens and could 
be among the most affected by efforts in massachusetts to get the 
budget under control 
willett a 39yearold vietnam veteran with a heavy limp a 
useless left hand and a fondness for ginger brandy said most of 
the day is spent stemming in the language of the street pennies 
are goobers and dumpsterdiving is searching for food in 
the garbage 
nights are the most difficult because of the danger of being 
robbed members of the grate society sleep in shifts 
just like society at large some homeless prey on each 
other said police sgt john devaney they steal their liquor 
their money 
on the streets loyalty is paramount willett said 
when michael s hathaway 20 began living on the streets three 
years ago willett took him under his wing if it wasnt for 
andrew willett i would be deceased today hathaway said id 
do anything for andy were like a family 
hathaway said willett who has been on the streets about two 
decades and is known to the grate society as its mayor found him 
walking around copley square and showed him where to sleep and get 
free clothes and free food 
i know so much about the streets now that i could teach 
someone else he said hathaway said he repays willett by 
watching out for him 
no one knows how many street people are in boston the emergency 
shelter commission counted 3830 in shelters and on the streets in 
december 1989 
paul koegel an anthropologist working for the psychiatry 
department at the university of california at los angeles found 
that 28 percent of the nations homeless suffered from severe 
chronic mental disorders and 46 percent were chronic substance 
abusers both conditions are likely to be worsened by homelessness 
he found 
a very significant minority experienced their alcohol problems 
after their first episode of homelessness said koegel 
rob smith 27 may be one of that minority he sits near the 
grate society along with lisa fuller 37 and reggie hammond 31 
every day at 8 am they meet outside a liquor store near boston 
common 
i wasnt drinking before now im drinking like crazy said 
smith who was evicted from his apartment over the summer 
you got to drink to survive said hammond you drink all 
day and sleep all night youve heard of false courage drinking 
gives you false courage so you dont worry 
hammonds brother saw smith through his first night of 
homelessness it was scary i didnt know what to expect smith 
said 
but now hes a pro recently he reasoned that logan 
international airport would be a good place to sleep because air 
travelers need comfortable seats so he went there one day after a 
restless night and slept four blissful hours 
smith said he has had no luck getting a job in part because he 
has no phone 
where they gonna call you at

american university is offering a settlement 
of more than 1 million to former president richard berendzen who 
pleaded guilty to charges he made obscene telephone calls 
according to a published report 
the washington post quoting unnamed sources reported today 
that in return the universitys board of trustees would ask 
berendzen to sever his ties with the university 
since resigning as president berendzen has continued to draw a 
salary as a tenured physics professor although he has not worked 
on campus 
according to the newspapers sources university trustees 
authorized the proposed settlement which is not final during a 
closed meeting friday 
sources said the decision followed an acrimonious debate in 
which several trustees argued that the payment was too expensive 
while others said berendzen should not be forced to relinquish his 
university affiliation 
berendzen quit as university president in april saying he was 
exhausted after 10 years in the job later that month he 
acknowledged that he actually had resigned because trustees learned 
he was under police investigation for allegedly placing obscene 
telephone calls to a woman who ran a daycare service 
susan allen of fairfax county va said that in repeated phone 
calls to her he graphically discussed fantasized sexual relations 
with children 
berendzen pleaded guilty to two charges of making the telephone 
calls alen has sued him seeking 2 million in compensatory 
damages and 2 million in punitive damages 
lawyers for the university and for berendzen were negotiating 
how the payments would be made the post said the paper quoted one 
source as saying the proposed payment was in the ballpark of 1 
million and another said the figure exceeded 1 million 
berendzen declined comment to the newspaper saying i really 
just dont want to get into anything dealing with contracts 
university spokeswoman anita gottlieb told the post after 
january there will be no continuing relationship with dr 
berendzen and the university

portauprince haiti ap the field of presidential 
candidates stood at 14 today with a leftist champion of the poor 
favored after the electoral council barred former president leslie 
manigat and 11 others from running 
among those disqualified from the dec 16 elections was dr 
roger lafontant the former chief of the tonton macoute militia 
the private army of the brutal duvalier family dictatorship 
lafontant claimed he was wrongfully eliminated and would appeal 
to the supreme court 
an outstanding warrant charges lafontant with conspiring against 
national security the army long the countrys leading political 
force has never served the warrant 
the tonton macoutes terrorized this impoverished caribbean 
nation of 6 million people for 29 years until a popular uprising 
forced jeanclaude duvalier son of the late francois duvalier 
into exile in 1986 
but the country has been plagued by political turmoil and 
violence ever since the caretaker government of president ertha 
pascaltrouillot appointed in march is the fifth since duvaliers 
ouster 
another former duvalier official disqualified from running for 
president was claude raymond the former army chief of staff has 
been publicly accused of participating in the massacre of voters 
that thwarted 1987 general elections 
in the massacre armed thugs in collusion with troops killed at 
least 34 people twelve duvalierists had been barred from running 
for president in that balloting 
a new constitution drafted earlier in 1987 barred criminal 
supporters of past dictators from running for office until 1997 
the electoral council said the 10 candidates disqualified 
monday including lafontant and raymond failed to comply with 
filing procedures 
it said manigat disqualified tuesday night was barred under a 
constitutional article that specifies the president may not be 
reelected unless five years have passed between terms 
manigat who was widely viewed as a puppet of the military 
gained the presidency in a controversial election in january 1988 
and was ousted six months later in a coup 
the council on tuesday night also disqualified duvalierist 
banker clemard joseph charles saying he was wanted as a fugitive 
in the united states but giving no details 
the rev jean bertrand aristide a leftist priest spokesman for 
the poor and ardent foe of haitis dictatorships is given the best 
chance of winning the dec 16 vote if it is free and fair 
dr louis roy chief of the council of state that rules 
alongside ms pascaltrouillot said aristides campaign may lose 
momentum with lafontants disqualification but he remains the 
leading contender because he enjoys the backing of the impoverished 
masses 
also still in the running are major candidates marc bazin a 
former world bank official former preacher silvio claude and 
businessman louis dejoie jr 
the councils disqualifications this week were welcomed by many 
leading haitians 
i foresee a relatively normal unfolding of the electoral 
process now said jeanclaude bajeux a human rights activist and 
leader of the congress of democratic movements a socialist party 
about 800 observers from the united nations and the organization 
of american states will monitor the vote

in balloting tuesday with 99 percent of precincts reporting 
biden had 111191 votes or 625 percent to republican m jane 
bradys 63962 votes or 36 percent 
biden thanked voters for their willingness to look not only 
beyond the negatives but to examine the distortions and to make 
some fundamental judgments about me

labor party leader neil kinnock was accused of improper footnoting 
and asked to repeat a course in law school and exaggerated his 
academic record

lowell p weicker jr a former 
republican senator known as a maverick maintained that reputation 
with his successful bid for governor as an independent 
we didnt ask or bequeath any particular party to run our 
business for us weicker said after his victory we can run it 
better than anybody else can 
weicker lost his senate seat in 1988 when he sought a fourth 
term he said at the time that there would be no comebacks 
after that defeat the 59yearold greenwich millionaire whose 
grandfather helped found the er squibb pharmaceutical 
corporation worked for a foundation promoting medical research 
then eight months before election day weicker announced he 
would return to politics as an independent candidate for governor 
from the beginning weicker led republican john g rowland and 
democrat bruce a morrison in public opinion polls despite the 
fact that connecticut had elected nothing but republican and 
democratic governors since 1856 
aside from the fact that were going to put the state back on 
its feet i hope we send a message that dirt is out of politics in 
the state of connecticut weicker said referring to the 
oftenbitter campaign 
weickers independent attitude was best demonstrated in 197374 
when as a member of the senate watergate committee he was one of 
president nixons most outspoken critics 
he battled his party at home too but was elected and 
reelected enjoying strong support from democrats and unaffiliated 
voters in a state where democrats outnumber republicans by a margin 
of about 3to2 
during his 20 years in washington 18 in the senate and two in 
the house weicker was an advocate for the rights of children the 
handicapped aids patients and the politically oppressed he was 
arrested outside the south african embassy in washington during an 
antiapartheid protest 
he faced a serious intraparty challenge for his senate 
nomination in 1982 from prescott s bush jr brother of president 
bush bush eventually dropped his challenge and weicker was 
narrowly reelected 
six years later weicker was upset by thenattorney general 
joseph i lieberman a democrat who won by 10000 votes a margin 
of less than 1 percent after a bitter campaign 
before being elected to washington weicker served a term as 
greenwich first selectman and two terms in the state house of 
representatives 
he made a brief bid for the 1980 republican presidential 
nomination

two years ago lawton chiles complained of 
burnout later diagnosed as depression when he retired after 
three terms in the us senate and 30 years in government 
on tuesday the veteran democrat roared back into political 
life riding a populist campaign to the governorship of the 
nations fourthlargest state and easily defeating oneterm 
incumbent republican bob martinez 
chiles 60 who once expressed his frustrations at the inability 
of politicians to get things done invoked the optimistic political 
spirit of the early 1960s in his acceptance speech 
camelot is a state of mind and if you have it and i have it 
we can start bringing camelot back he told cheering supporters 
in orlando referring to the nickname admirers gave president 
kennedys administration 
for the selfdescribed cracker from mostly rural polk 
county the victory was the result of a return to the downhome 
political style that first sent him to the senate in 1970 
he earned the nickname walkin lawton when he walked the 
length of florida during that first senate campaign 
his comeback bid against martinez only the states second 
republican governor since reconstruction was equally unorthodox 
chiles voluntarily limited individual contributions to 100 each 
allowing martinezs campaign to outspend him by more than 21 
limiting contributions he said would mean he wouldnt be 
beholden to special interests as governor 
what were saying is the way you campaign tells a lot about 
the way you will govern chiles said 
the chiles campaign often seemed almost intentionally 
inefficient disdainful of photo opportunities live tv news events 
and massive rallies 
instead chiles concentrated on visiting daycare centers 
recycling plants senior citizens homes drug treatment centers 
and schools 
martinez tried to blunt his opponents folksy image with charges 
that chiles was really a washington insider and liberal 
slowed by a 1985 quadruple heart bypass operation and depression 
tendencies controlled by the drug prozac chiles quit politics in 
1988 republican connie mack went on to win his senate seat in a 
razorthin election over rep kenneth buddy mackay 
chiles with mackay as his lieutenant governor running mate 
easily won the democratic primary in april but then he saw an 
early lead over martinez of up to 30 percentage points evaporate in 
the face of the incumbents wellfunded vigorous reelection 
campaign 
chiles and mackay say they will work together like a corporate 
team of top executives and there is wide speculation that chiles 
will step aside after one term so that mackay can seek the 
governorship in 1994

democrat zell miller georgias lieutenant 
governor for 16 years used a single issue legalizing state 
lotteries to portray himself in the governors race as a familiar 
face with new ideas 
miller 58 presiding officer of the state senate seized the 
issue early championing it unsuccessfully for two years in the 
legislature then he employed it to dominate two campaigns this 
year 
first he used the issue to vanquish four challengers for the 
democratic nomination including former atlanta mayor andrew young 
youngs bid to become the states first black governor brought 
international notice to the campaign 
he pressed the issue again in the general election campaign 
against republican johnny isakson who sought to neutralize 
millers advantage by endorsing the lottery himself 
silverhaired with sharp hawklike features millers nasal 
country twang reflects his heritage in the north georgia mountains 
the son of an educator miller grew up in young harris ga 
served a stint in the marine corps and then spent three decades in 
politics he has been a state senator an aide to former gov 
lester maddox a member of the board of pardons and paroles and 
lieutenant governor 
at various times along the way he has run unsuccessfully for 
congress in 1980 he lost a bid to unseat thensen herman 
talmadge in the democratic primary talmadge subsequently lost to a 
republican 
some of the sharpest fighting of this years general election 
campaign came when isakson seeking to gain the upper hand on the 
lottery question advanced what he termed a better plan for 
targeting lottery profits to education 
both campaigns armed with paid media consultants and 
professional pollsters in the most expensive campaign in state 
history fired off television commercials arguing whose 
distribution formula was best and argued the issue in person in 
several debates 
race became an issue late in the campaign although both 
candidates were white 
during one of several debates miller accused isakson of hiding 
behind his father to escape charges that the real estate firm he 
heads previously run by his father was charged with racial 
discrimination in the past 
isakson countered that miller ran a segregationist campaign 
during an unsuccessful bid for congress 26 years ago newspaper 
clips produced later disclosed miller condemned thenpresident 
lyndon johnson as a turncoat for pressing the landmark civil rights 
act of 1964

this is a game of hardball mrs finney said before the 
election i know ill have all of the big guns coming out after 
me but im used to it 
mrs finney 65 has spent the past 16 years as state treasurer 
winning five elections in 1985 she created a program of making 
idle state funds available for lowinterest loans for farmers and 
she has made a crusade out of her offices efforts to find the 
owners of unclaimed property 
but she also has come under fire for her administration 
repeatedly state audits criticized her management hayden has 
pointed to a 1976 incident in which a topeka boy found a 2 million 
state check in an alley something she blamed on a careless bank 
runner 
mrs finney began her political career in 1953 when she joined 
the staff of us sen frank carlson mrs finney worked for 
carlson a revered figure in the kansas gop until he retired in 
january 1969 
i didnt want to go on but after a few months i was back into 
it she said it gets into your blood 
in 1972 mrs finney began receiving encouragement to run for 
the 2nd district seat in the us house she did and lost the 
primary 
two years later bob brock the topeka hotel magnate and 
prominent democrat urged her to change parties to run against the 
incumbent state treasurer she thought about it for a month 
all the old carlson people were retired so i called brock and 
said lets go she said 
that time she won 
mrs finney speaks frequently about bringing government back to 
the people and has advocated a proposal to amend the state 
constitution to allow voters to put laws and amendments on the 
ballot without going through the legislature 
never overestimate the amount of information people have but 
never underestimate their intelligence she has said

in favor of bernard sanders the socialist former mayor of 
burlington sanders will become the first socialist in the house

antiincumbent themes like the congressional pay raise and 
specialinterest political money in his campaign 
a member of the armed services committee dyson had barely 
survived a challenge by gilchrest in 1988 when dyson was hampered 
by accusations of conflictofinterest involving defense contractor 
campaign money this year it was revealed that dyson had escaped 
service in the vietnam war by claiming conscientious objector 
status in contrast to his hawkish defense views since entering 
the house 
several other incumbents were in extremely close races to hang 
onto their jobs including several not previously thought to be in 
danger

going into election day analysts on both sides were predicting 
republicans would slip further into the minority losing from six 
to 12 seats despite reported widespread voter disaffection with 
the democratcontrolled congress 
additional gop losses would further hamper president bushs 
ability to push his legislative agenda through congress 
the democrats have controlled the house since 1954 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said he believed the 
outcome could help democrats prevail on closely divided issues 
including some override votes on bushs vetoes 
he cited as an example the civil rights bill which was vetoed 
in the waning days of the 101st congress the house vote to pass 
the bill had been 273 to 154 17 votes short what would have been 
needed to override the presidents veto foley said the measure 
would be pressed again when the 102nd congress convenes in january 
a bolstered democratic majority will also carry a mandate to 
undertake a serious review of our national health delivery 
system foley said the change also could affect perennially 
close votes on issues such as the budget and abortion 
even with the ouster of some incumbents the reelection rate 
appeared to be near the 98 percent rate of the past two elections

complaining of unfinished parks and libraries and 
just plain secondclass treatment a section of dallas comprising 
onethird of the citys population is threatening to dissolve an 
87yearold bond and secede 
oak cliff would become texas seventhlargest city and reduce 
dallas in area by half if allowed to become independent as it was 
until 1903 
a referendum to decide the issue could be on the ballot by 1992 
and the new city could be in operation by 1993 the secessionists 
say 
if dallas doesnt change its way of doing business it will 
lose oak cliff said bob mcelearney president of the oak cliff 
chamber of commerce 
the community on dallass south side has 310000 people evenly 
divided among blacks whites and hispanics it has pockets of 
affluence but is largely in decline the north side of dallas is 
more prosperous 
we dont want to deannex we want to improve the quality of 
life in the southern half of dallas said city councilman charles 
tandy of oak cliff that includes direct city services like trash 
pickup code enforcement street repairs things like that 
we have libraries that were promised eight to 10 years ago 
that were never built and parks that were initially approved 15 
years ago that were never completed 
city officials have said budgetary constraints have stopped 
projects all over dallas not just in oak cliff in addition they 
say oak cliff depends more on libraries and recreation programs 
than the north side where people can afford travel and other 
diversions 
political underrepresentation has been blamed in part for oak 
cliffs problems the community has a third of the population but 
only one member on the 12person city council a referendum in 
december would reorganize the city council to address the 
disparity 
the roots of the dallasoak cliff split are deep oak cliff 
joined dallas by a margin of 18 votes and a decade later secession 
already was being discussed 
on june 1 the secession movement created 19 committees with 130 
people to study the possibility of a breakup and its effects three 
city accountants have been working fulltime to analyze projections 
on revenue and expenses 
at a meeting last month where oak cliff residents voted 
overwhelmingly to proceed with a referendum on secession mayor 
annette strauss was shouted down by a crowd of almost 2000 
we are one family she pleaded thats the way its been 
and thats the way its got to continue to be 
oak cliff is home to some of dallas largest hotels and 
warehouses but 80 percent of city bond money is spent outside oak 
cliff said tandy 
and louis salcedo an oak cliff engineers said city contracts 
have traditionally gone to businesses on the north side it is 
easy to drive around oak cliff and see areas that have been 
neglected he said 
west jefferson boulevard was the former citys downtown section 
but some businesses have closed in the last decade and thrift shops 
are now numerous 
i grew up in oak cliff and i have seen its condition grow 
worse for many years now said theresa floyd who runs a clothing 
shop it used to be pretty nice but now its going straight 
downhill 
other residents arent sure secession is the right course 
there are just as many greedy people in oak cliff as in dallas i 
can see taxes going up in oak cliff if it becomes a city said ed 
johnson crna an anesthesiologist

the outlaws had made a sizeable dent in the 
evenings beer supply by the time charlie papazian rose to deliver 
the invocation he raised a glass of frothy ale grinned through 
his beard and led the crowd in the familiar chant 
relax dont worry have a homebrew 
up went a hundred glasses and down went the beer 
down went sal pennacchios bme porter a rich black ale with a 
toasty aroma and down went john quinns spiced brown ale redolent 
of chocolate and cinnamon down went a nutty germanstyle ale and a 
malty golden pilsener and down went several other brews that will 
never be found at your neighborhood tavern 
the beers were the star attraction at the annual dinner of the 
outlaws of homebrew one of a growing number of clubs around the 
nation devoted to home beer brewing the dinner the food was 
bratwurst and sauerkraut drew more than 100 people to brooklyn 
brewerys distribution warehouse on a dark industrial block in 
brooklyn 
its estimated that somewhere between 500000 and 1 million 
people in the united states brew their own beer homebrewing has 
been legal since 1978 and by all accounts is in the midst of a 
heady spurt of growth 
i think people are paying more attention to what theyre 
putting down their mouths said papazian whose book the 
complete joy of homebrewing is the hobbys bible 
membership in the american homebrewers association which 
papazian founded in 1978 is up 41 percent in the past year and is 
expected to top 10000 by years end there are at least 150 
homebrew clubs in the country and 1200 retail supply shops 
its growing tremendously said seth schneider the general 
manager of crosby amp baker a brewing supply manufacturer and 
distributor in westport mass were still on the steep part of a 
growth curve 
the growth in homebrewing has mirrored the development of 
microbreweries small breweries that typically devote themselves 
to fullbodied highquality beers these beers account for a 
microscopic 15 percent of the national market but loom large in 
the world of homebrewers 
there is a strong symbiotic relationship between homebrewers and 
microbrewers homebrewers are microbrewers most loyal customers 
microbrewers frequently sponsor the homebrewers organizations and 
events 
the outlaws of homebrew dinner for instance was sponsored by 
brooklyn brewery which provided the warehouse and two varieties of 
its own beer company founder steve hindy is himself a homebrewer 
who likes to tinker with recipes in his kitchen before trying them 
out in the brewery 
actually right now im brewing something i call a chocolate 
stout at home he said 
the attractions of homebrewing are several foremost is the 
ability to make good beer quality has improved mightily in the 
past decade as homebrew suppliers have become increasingly 
sophisticated 
a homebrew rivals the best beer youve ever had said 
schneider it hasnt traveled it has more body it hasnt been 
filtered and you can make it exactly to your taste 
some of those tastes are exotic some would say bizarre 
homebrewers have been known to toss all manner of ingredients into 
their brew spruce beer cherry beer and ginger beer are among the 
more common of the strange brews 
sal pennacchio treasurer of the outlaws of homebrew recalls 
what happened last november when his wife was about to toss out the 
halloween pumpkin the result was his pumpkin ale which won third 
prize in a national homebrew competition it tasted he said 
just like pumpkin pie 
i think thats the great thing about homebrewing pennacchio 
said with a little experience you can create anything you 
want 
not everyone wants a pumpkin ale of course but a more 
runofthemill brew is a simple thing to make beer essentially 
consists of malted barley yeast hops and water with those 
ingredients and a few rudimentary pieces of equipment a bucket 
some plastic tubing a siphon an airlock valve a capping tool 
and caps and bottles anyone can make beer in their kitchen 
equipment for a novice costs about 45 ingredients for two 
cases of beer run about 15 or roughly 35 cents a bottle but that 
can vary widely depending on the kind of beer being made 
a survey a few years ago by the american homebrewers association 
found that the overwhelming majority of homebrewers were white 
males somewhat to the chagrin of those who champion the hobby 
brewers also tend to be married well educated and divided almost 
evenly among cities suburbs and small towns 
the glibbest generalization said schneider would be 
adult males with facial hair 
beyond that he said hes noticed that homebrewers are 
frequently computer buffs indeed one of the busiest meeting 
places for homebrewers is on compuserve information services beer 
forum a sort of electronic saloon for personal computer 
owners 
the fact is brewers are a gregarious lot they are in their 
element at an event like the outlaws dinner drinking beer and 
swapping brewing notes with abandon 
were out for a good time said pennacchio and to have 
good beer

every new improved product on the supermarket 
shelf these days seems to be greener than green 
environmentally conscious shoppers are being offered more ways 
to preserve the planet while stocking up on cleansers paper 
towels plastic bags or disposable diapers 
unfortunately some of the assertions sprouting on the new 
ecologyfriendly packages are misleading confusing or possibly 
even fraudulent 
so many of these claims dont mean anything says joel 
makower publisher of the monthly green consumer letter 
consumers are becoming discouraged early on im afraid were 
losing them before we get them firmly in the green consumer fold 
makower says shoppers who bought supposedly degradable plastic 
trash bags were turned off when they learned the bags will not 
really decompose in landfills which is where they are likely to 
wind up 
similarly consumers picked up supposedly earthfriendly 
aerosols only to find that the ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbons 
have been replaced by other suspect chemicals or they purchased 
recyclable plastics then found no recycler would accept them 
much of the confusion about marketing claims may be traceable to 
underlying policy questions that have not been settled 
what is the best way to deal with solid waste should we make 
biodegradable products even if they cant be recycled push 
recycling to the limit accepting that nothing decomposes in a 
landfill anyway or reduce packaging to a minimum even if whats 
left is neither recyclable or biodegradable 
meanwhile federal and state investigators are looking into 
whether consumers are being deceived by some advertising or 
packaging asserting environmental benefits 
were very concerned with the number of claims that were 
seeing said julie vergeront assistant attorney general in 
minnesota one of 10 states that formed a task force this year to 
work together on cases involving environmental products 
seven of the states filed suit against mobil corp saying its 
hefty trash bags advertised as biodegradable would not break down 
in landfills the suit has been settled in texas but is still 
pending in the other six states 
in another case the maker of bunnies disposable diapers agreed 
to stop claiming the product was biodegradable the diapers could 
degrade under the right circumstances but not in landfills which 
is where nearly all the diapers end up 
the manufacturer american enviro products of placentia calif 
also agreed to redesign the diapers to use thinner plastic and 
cotton in place of paper the new package will say using bunnies 
instead of other disposable diapers saves trees 
they let us off the hook because they thought we were moving 
in the right direction environmentally said robert chickering 
the company president 
were going to give up on biodegradability he said even 
though he still believes there may eventually be an environmental 
benefit to having degradable wastes in landfills 
the federal trade commission is pursuing at least a dozen 
investigations into environmental product claims but cant discuss 
the details yet said barry cutler director of its consumer 
protection bureau 
cutler said the commission was trying to make sure its 
enforcement did not give an unfair advantage to paper products over 
plastic or viceversa 
to help puzzled shoppers and to verify product claims two rival 
certifying agencies have sprung up 
the first to begin operations is green cross certification co 
based in oakland calif since june it has authorized 60 products 
to use its logo with specific statements of environmental virtue 
renew brand trash bags for instance are certified to contain 
at least 80 percent recycled plastics clorox 2 bleach comes in a 
box which green cross has verified was made from 81 percent 
recycled paper fibers 
were very specific with our claims said stan rhodes 
president of green cross we really need to clean up the 
confusion in the marketplace 
a competing outfit green seal inc is planning more ambitious 
endorsements and hoping to announce early next year the first 
products that have met its standards 
were trying to identify products that over their entire life 
cycle are better for the environment said norman dean executive 
director of green seal which is based in washington dc we 
think consumers want to know about the overall impact on the 
environment 
cutler said the ftc is watching the environmental certification 
groups closely worried that overbroad endorsements could add to 
consumer confusion rather than clear things up 
much of the bewilderment he said doesnt really stem from 
advertising claims or scientific uncertainty but to the unsettled 
policy questions 
the real issue is having an environmental policy about the 
best way of disposing of solid waste cutler said the real 
issue is what we do with the garbage itself not what we put on the 
box

fear that politicians are manipulating the throne 
for their own ends has arisen again more than 40 years after 
allied occupation forces rewrote the constitution to prevent it 
this time the warnings come from within japans own society as 
the nation prepares for the coronation nov 12 of emperor akihito 
the first monarch to be enthroned under that constitution 
i am very worried that the palace is being used for political 
purposes just as the military used the late emperor showa 
hirohito before the war minoru hamao a former imperial 
chamberlain said in an interview 
hamao who directed the education of the akihito and his sons 
for 20 years said conservatives who would return to the old 
imperial system are a minority within the governing liberal 
democratic party and lack public support 
he added however that there was increasing evidence of 
attempts by politicians to align themselves with the emperor 
because they feel that will get them prestige and votes 
the chrysanthemum throne has been politically important 
throughout japanese history but has had little to do with 
daytoday policy 
it was used as a justification for their own power by feudal 
samurai leaders political reformers at the turn of the century and 
militarists in the years leading up to world war ii 
today the liberal democrats who have governed since their 
conservative party was formed in 1955 use a logo similar to the 
imperial chrysanthemum 
according to hamao links between the palace and party were 
relatively weak until yasuhiro nakasone prime minister in the 
mid1980s tried to strengthen his control of the imperial 
household agency that manages palace affairs 
the imperial household agency is officially under the 
supervision of the prime ministers office and since nakasone they 
have used their control over personnel appointments to gain 
power hamao said 
he expressed particular concern about politicians being involved 
in an enthronement rite called the daijosai or great food offering 
ritual 
it is very inappropriate for the prime minister and other 
government leaders to attend the daijosai because of its religious 
nature hamao said having the politicians there is an 
imposition and not in line with the constitution 
hamao said the palace could not have kept politicians off the 
guest list which was strongly influenced by the prime ministers 
office 
prime minister toshiki kaifus government has acknowledged the 
religious nature of the daijosai in which a new emperor has his 
first communion with the gods of shinto japans state religion 
until the war ended 
it also has described the rite as an ancient tradition and 
denied that state funding violates constitutional bans on 
government support of religious activities 
in hamaos view the decision to follow prewar precedent for 
akihitos coronation is an attempt to free the government and 
liberal democrats from constitutional constraints on political 
manipulation of the throne 
if politicians are allowed to ignore those restraints for the 
coronation he said they may seek to use the emperor in pursuing 
their goals 
sadao yamahana a legislator and and senior member of japans 
largest opposition party the socialists said he believed the 
handling of the coronation reflected a desire by conservatives to 
restore some degree of the thrones old status 
yamahana said members of his party would not take part in the 
daijosai a rite that is intended to make the emperor closer to a 
god 
the japan federation of bar associations several teachers 
unions and the national christian council of japan have announced 
their opposition to state support for the daijosai 
in the constitution written by the usled occupation 
authorities who ran japans government for seven years after the 
surrender in 1945 the emperor is defined as the symbol of the 
state and the unity of the people 
this largely ceremonial figure was to replace a sovereign called 
sacred and inviolable in the imperial charter of 1889 
most japanese support the monarchy as it is in the 
constitution but because of memories of the war we also have 
rather complex feelings toward it yamahana said 
about 2500 dignitaries including vice president dan quayle and 
prince charles of britain are expected to attend the main 
coronation ceremony 
while yamahana acknowledged the need to guard against possible 
attacks by leftist radicals he also said extreme security could be 
a means of expanding police powers 
police are planning what can only be seen as excessive 
security and in this way too though subtly they are saying that 
the emperor is not a regular person he is like a god that needs 
special treatment he said 
before the war yamahana said the police and government used 
such thinking to justify silencing dissent he added that his 
father a social activist was arrested dozens of times in the 
emperors name 
radicals have declared they will use whatever means available to 
disrupt the enthronement including violence tokyo police are 
believed to be planning japans largest security operation 
possibly involving tens of thousands of officers 
two cabinet ministers have suggested invoking a law that would 
allow the government to force violent antisocial groups to 
disband the law never used for that purpose has been criticized 
as a threat to freedom of speech and association 
political analyst asao yamaguchi said he did not expect a 
serious effort by prime minister kaifu to use the throne for 
political ends 
really trying to redefine the role of the monarchy would 
require a strong political foundation he said kaifu hasnt 
got that

excavation has begun on nine buried 
sections of the transalaska oil pipeline for corrosion rechecks 
after charges the original inspectors were poorly trained or worked 
under the influence of drugs or booze 
in all 19 sections of the approximately 800mile line are to be 
reinspected for rust or cracks a federal criminal investigation 
meanwhile is under way into accusations by a former corrosion 
inspector that his employer ignored drinking and drug use on and 
off the job 
the quality of information related to the corrosion repair 
work along the pipeline is in question said mike mengle federal 
pipeline officer for the us bureau of land management 
the 48inchdiameter line carries a quarter of the nations 
domestic crude oil production from wellhead at prudhoe bay to a 
marine terminal at the icefree port of valdez 
the renewed concern comes at a time when president bush has 
ordered domestic oil production increased because of the persian 
gulf crisis 
but state and federal officials wont agree to increase the 
pressure in the line until the inspection issues are settled 
digging began friday on a section in the brooks range about 170 
miles south of the start of the line at prudhoe bay and the 
alyeska pipeline service co hopes to finish the reinspections by 
middecember alyeska is the oil company consortium that operates 
the pipeline 
initial results monday from a 76foot section of pipeline showed 
no cracking or corrosion problems officials said 
thorpe technical services is the alyeska contractor that 
conducted the original inspection at sites where corrosion or other 
problems were suspected the company has been doing the testing 
since 1988 
state and federal agencies ordered the second look for corrosion 
or cracks that could lead to leaks after edward william thompson 
26 of fairbanks wrote a 16page letter last month accusing thorpe 
of submitting flawed work 
thompson alleged that thorpe inspectors were poorly trained or 
supervised and that drug and alcohol use was widespread among 
workers 
the company denies the allegations 
dave vickery a spokesman for the bureau of land management in 
anchorage confirmed that a criminal investigation was under way 
into thompsons allegations about drug use on federal land he said 
he did not expect a report from investigators until midnovember 
alcohol and drugs were widespread on the job and after work 
hours thompson said in a telephone interview from fairbanks i 
cant say if that affected their work 
i also wasnt comfortable with the level of training we had i 
had received some schooling about two weeks worth in 
ultrasonics but prior to starting magnetic particle inspection id 
received no training i learned on the job 
ultrasonic testing is designed to turn up internal corrosion 
magnetic particle testing is used to find stress cracks officials 
said 
thompson claimed in his oct 3 letter he never used drugs or 
alcohol but court documents show he was arrested for driving while 
intoxicated last year and in 1985 was convicted of cocaine 
possession after failing a drug test at his probation officers 
office 
questioned about his criminal record thompson responded that 
his past is not the issue 
dan claeys thorpe vice president for operations denied 
thompsons accusations about drug and alcohol use and inadequate 
training 
we have done random screening since the incident claeys 
said we did it immediately and everything seemed to be in order 
weve also had federal authorities and alyeska authorities 
gather up training documentation to show our people were trained 
and competent to do the job he said they have interviewed all 
our employees 
alyeska said it expects to spend from 600 million to 800 
million by 1993 on corrosion detection and repair 
the company has inspected about 8000 feet of pipe above and 
below ground officials said it has dug up 30foot to 100foot 
sections at 138 sites to repair corrosion damage by placing steel 
sleeves over the original pipe 
no cracks have been detected they said

aware of the value of free publicity many speakers spoke 
without charging the public relations society of america which 
organized the event that ends wednesday 
pr specialists themselves society aides armed with 
walkietalkies roamed four floors of the marriot marquis partly to 
ensure that visiting reporters were shown the conferences best 
face 
while public relations professionals are among the first layoff 
victims during an economic downturn attendees couldnt resist the 
urge to tell reporters their business was performing quite well 
thank you despite widespread job losses elsewhere 
the conferences official theme was our world in transition 
or how public relations firms can adapt to the changing needs of a 
market becoming more global in character 
but a more timeless notion seemed to dominate as attendees sat 
through the clattering of fine silverware at a monday afternoon 
award luncheon how to balance imagepolishing roles with the need 
for honesty 
several pointed to perriers handling last spring of its tainted 
water as an example of poor crisis management and insisted that 
public pressure eventually forces a company to tell the whole truth 
no matter how well it tries to conceal it 
after all it was perriers corporate communications department 
that initially insisted the discovery of benzene in bottles of the 
spring water resulted from a filtering equipment malfunction 
later they conceded the carcinogen for years has occurred 
naturally in frances underground source for the global drink 
if i tell this lady here that i love her and punch her in the 
jaw she is more likely to believe the punch in the jaw said 
larry newman owner of a pr firm in columbia sc pointing to a 
kindlylooking whitehaired lady seated nearby 
the truth is always the ceiling above which no amount of 
terrific public relations can rise said james e arnold 
chairman of the conference and president of a new york consulting 
firm 
on the other hand many praised mcdonalds pr coup last week 
when the fastfood giant announced it would abandon foam packaging 
for environmentally friendly paper containers 
indeed pr proponents insisted it is a profession with high 
ethics i dont take any clients where i dont believe they are 
right or the case for them cant be proven said newman 
recalling that he didnt take the shah of iran in the 1970s because 
i thought the shah was a crumb bum 
it became clear at the convention that pr workers consider 
themselves a vastly misunderstood bunch bravely trying to earn 
respect from the very newspapers and broadcast stations they help 
supply news to 
in their minds they are crucial links in a complex world 
helping everyone from businesses to nonprofit groups communicate 
with a doubting american public 
indeed at an event where youd think nary a disparaging word 
could be heard about the industry at least one workshop moderated 
by fordham university business school professor william j small 
was selfdeprecating how to spend a billion or two and still get 
a black eye in public the exxonvaldez story

a legislative candidate who proposed 
public humiliation for women who have multiple abortions was 
defeated in another race an incumbent who spoke out in favor of 
masturbation won 
democratic state rep john d mordasky on tuesday beat 
republican challenger robert bechta during the campaign bechta 
said he supports a womans right to abortion and supports 
statefunded abortions but doesnt think abortions should be used 
as a primary means of birth control 
public degradation i think would probably be the best way 
of deterring people from having multiple abortions he said 
mordasky opposes all abortions except in cases of rape incest 
or risk to the mothers life 
in another race democratic state rep lynn taborsak defeated 
republican challenger alex nahas who had criticized her for 
proposing legislation encouraging young people to masturbate to 
avoid sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies 
the bible says cast your seed into the belly of a whore rather 
than onto the ground nahas said during the campaign 
taborsaks measure was intended to counter a republican 
amendment requirng that students be taught abstinence from 
premarital sex as the expected norm neither measure became 
law

sen jesse helms spurred his loyal 
supporters to line up at the polls in a plentiful turnout that gave 
the conservative republican a fourth term and vanquished democratic 
challenger harvey gantt 
well there is no joy in mudville tonight helms told 
cheering supporters late tuesday the mighty ultraliberal 
establishment and the liberal politicians and editors and 
commentators and columnists have struck out again 
with 93 percent of precincts reporting helms had 996082 votes 
or 54 percent to 865240 votes or 46 percent for gantt a former 
charlotte mayor 
helms 69 attributed his victory to an embrace of north 
carolina values gantt whose supporters hoped to enshrine him as 
the first black elected to the senate from the south since 
reconstruction ran as an unabashed liberal and attacked what he 
called helms lying and distortion 
gantt 47 said he did not regret his campaign which focused on 
education the environment and social issues 
im still smiling from way down deep even though i hurt a 
little bit gantt said i hurt quite a bit because we gave our 
best 
voter turnout approached 55 percent unusually heavy for an 
offyear election the helms campaign got out the people who they 
had to get out said thad beyle a political science professor at 
the university of north carolina at chapel hill 
judges in durham and greensboro extended voting hours because of 
long lines and problems with voting machines other urban areas 
also reported long delays at voting places but did not extend 
their hours 
helms who campaigned fulltime for only eight days after the 
late adjournment of congress relied on a barrage of television ads 
that raised racial issues helms attacked quotas and accused gantt 
of running a secret campaign on black radio stations 
campaign finance reports as of two weeks ago showed helms had 
spent 108 million and gantt 46 million giving north carolina 
the nations most costly senate race 
state voters kept democrats in control of their legislature 
where incomplete returns showed republicans in danger of losing 
several seats 
seven democrats and three republicans kept us house seats in 
north carolinas fickle 11th district democratic rep james 
mcclure clark had 50 percent of the vote in a race too close to

whether in victory or defeat to be dignified was the final 
challenge 
so as the returns rolled in candidates across the nation were 
mindful that gracious winners dont gloat and graceful losers never 
whine they stood tall before their boosters and smiled beneath 
campaign 1990s last spotlight 
when the spotlight finally dimmed today was here the battle 
was done 
you fought nobly republican pierre rinfret said as gov 
mario cuomo breezed to a third term tuesday we have not seen the 
end of each other 
applause sputtered quickly into silence the controversial 
millionaires staffers hung in when his caustic style split the gop 
and his coffers ran dry but this was the end of the line 
stacks of blueandwhite placards lazed against the walls like 
decommissioned soldiers crumpled soda cans were piled high and 
halfeaten bags of chips were already growing stale 
one campaign worker turns to another so whats next for 
you 
before 7 pm rinfrets staffers had pulled on their jackets 
and disappeared into the manhattan night they couldnt hear 
republican jim keet a 2nd district congressional candidate down in 
arkansas 
why are you looking so glum it aint over til its over 
keet reminded his staff at 915 pm you do not have permission 
to go home 
their spirits lifted slightly by the pep talk and a late surge 
in the polls the troops stayed on until 1120 pm when keet 
conceded victory to democrat ray thornton 
losing is difficult for me keets said after the race was 
called but the political risk is secondary participating in 
the american political process is much more important we will 
begin again tomorrow 
gov mike hayden of kansas sounded a similarly stalwart note in 
conceding democrat joan finneys upset victory as tough as it is 
and as hard as it is therell be another day 
then there was michael tobias a 19yearold poltiical neophyte 
from portland ore in volunteering to work for gop sen mark 
hatfield she signed on with a winning campaign on her first time 
out and it felt good 
its fun being in politics ms tobias said im not sure 
what party im in but im interested in like maybe becomeing 
secretary of state whats his name 
suddenly whoops go up around the television monitors at 
hatfields headquarters latest returns nope the portland 
trailblazers just scored against the los angeles lakers theres 
politics and then theres basketball 
of this sen bill bradley was reminded uncomfortably late in the 
game the democratic incumbent nearly lost one to the new jersey 
voters 
what can i say its been a few years since i was in a double 
overtime bradley said running down republican opponent christine 
todd whitmans early lead 
manny minelli briefly dances the fox trot then pauses to 
reflect the 65yearold has over the decades watched his old 
friend gov edward diprete of rhode island move from school 
council to city council to the statehouse 
on tuesday democratic challenger bruce g sundlum ended the 
republican governors threeterm reign 
he will be depressed minelli said of course he will 
be and the band played on filling a downtown providence 
ballroom with dixieland jazz and the occasional gershwin ditty 
in west virginia things were less melancholy millionaire sen 
jay rockefellers 27 million campaign staged a party far 
different from that hosted by gop challenger john yoder who ran on 
a 20000 budget 
but the yuks were bipartisan 
while the incumbent celebrated his victory at a packed reception 
room stocked with free munchies and a cash bar yoder spent the 
night in a 35 motel room off the west virginia turnpike 
rockefeller supporters watched returns on bigscreen tvs a cash 
bar offered mixed drinks at 3 each wine for 2 and beer for 
175 soft drinks were free at yoders hotel visitors were 
welcome to purchase smoothies for 50 cents and soft drinks at 55 
cents a can 
if i were a rockefeller it would not be a cash bar yoder 
said considering im not its byob for anybody who comes by 
but deadpanned yoders wife hes pretty tight even when he 
has money a fire raged at the universal studios complex not a 
mile away but republican gubernatorial candidate pete wilsons 
boosters still rolled into campaign central along with favorable 
returns against democratic contender dianne feinstein 
said candidate wilson to his supporters happily there seems 
to be only property damage 
among the clear winners tuesday evening was sen david pryor of 
arkansas minutes after the polls closed the democratic incumbent 
heaved a sigh of relief in an interview with a little rock 
television station 
i was very fortunate the people of our state were very kind 
to me this year pryor said humbly i didnt think this would 
happen to me

bruce king who has served longer than any 
governor in new mexico history says onthejob training wont be 
necessary as he returns to the office after an eightyear hiatus 
a bearlike man known for his friendly folksy ways including a 
lot of elbownudging and backslapping usually accompanied by a 
hows it goin fine fine king has become famous for his 
ability to track and follow the political winds 
if you have a problem i have an open door and we will work 
with you he told campaign audiences 
the 66yearold stanley rancher beat republican frank bond on 
tuesday earning a third fouryear term with the chance to seek 
reelection in 1994 
he first was elected governor in 1970 and again in 1978 and 
holds the record for the longest tenure in the states top office 
eight years 
voters in 1986 approved a state constitutional measure allowing 
governors elected from 1990 on to seek a second consecutive term 
previously governors could not run for reelection 
a force in new mexico politics for most of four decades king 
also has served as a county commissioner and in the legislature 
where he was elected speaker of the house 
getting along with dissonant interest groups legislators of 
diverse political stripes and bureaucrats of every type is his 
forte rarely one to challenge political adversaries he usually 
brought them all in to work out a compromise for the benefit of 
all 
as governor king met regularly with legislative leaders he has 
said he used the legislature very much as a board of directors 
with myself being the ceo 
his ability to bring people together also has helped king refine 
a difficult tightrope act 
for example king often described himself and his lieutenant 
governor running mate casey luna as the businessman team that 
understands business however as governor king often sided with 
labor twice vetoing righttowork legislation which would 
prohibit union membership as a condition of employment 
and as a rancher king leases public land yet he was endorsed 
by an environmental coalition which included some who want to ban 
cattle from public land 
king and his wife of 43 years alice who have two grown sons 
worked sidebyside in the campaign mrs king served as de facto 
campaign manager scheduler and adviser and king said she would 
head a task force in his administration that would study the 
states children and family programs 
he still lives near his parents 1917 homestead on the edge of

after a grueling 18month gubernatorial 
campaign in which she was dogged by personal attacks democrat ann 
richards says she wouldnt be surprised if her own children dont 
recognize her 
ms richards who on tuesday overcame millionaire republican 
oilman clayton williams knew what was coming when she ran for 
governor of a state where she describes politics as a very tough 
contact sport 
i think its an awful thing for anybody to have to go 
through she said during the campaigns final week i had to 
tell the kids when we made the decision youre not going to 
recognize your mother by the time they get through with me 
ms richards 57 entered the race after soaring to national 
fame as the keynote speaker at the 1988 democratic national 
convention 
there she claimed a lasting reputation with her line about 
george bushs sometimes mangled syntax poor george he cant 
help it he was born with a silver foot in his mouth 
in the campaign she found herself recalling her divorce 
talking about her history as a recovering alcoholic disputing 
accusations of drug use and facing attacks that she was a liberal 
and defender of gay rights 
a poll in the fall of 1988 showed more than half of texas voters 
could identify her and only 14 percent didnt like her a week 
before the election a gallup poll put her unfavorable rating at 53 
percent 
bemoaning the negative tone she called her race a nowin 
situation and said candidates are afraid to even make a joke for 
fear of it becoming frontpage news 
born and raised near waco ms richards received a bachelors 
degree from baylor university she was married for 30 years to 
civil rights lawyer david richards the two were divorced in 1984 
and have four children 
her politicking began in the late 1950s when she volunteered in 
the gubernatorial campaign of henry b gonzalez ms richards first 
ran for public office in 1976 winning a seat as a county 
commissioner she won terms as state treasurer in 1982 and 1986 
humor always has been an essential ingredient in her politics 
and that was a key reason thendemocratic party boss paul kirk 
tapped ms richards to keynote the atlanta convention 
ms richards said she still isnt sorry about poking fun at 
bush although williams used it against her candidates she said 
must be willing to laugh at themselves 
i wanted that speech to say that this is fun that politics is

govelect george voinovich remembers a

kid are you sure you want to be a republican asked the 
elder voinovich an architect and a democrat 
voinovich supplied that answer long ago and defeated democrat 
anthony j celebrezze on tuesday 
i dont believe government by itself solves problems he 
said but government working with other governmental agencies and 
the private sector can solve problems that was frankly my ticket 
to success in cleveland 
the 54yearold voinovich was mayor of cleveland for 10 years 
he is credited with leading the city out of default after taking 
over from democrat dennis kucinich who left cleveland 111 million 
in debt and with helping to revitalize its downtown 
voinovich who cited his experience in cleveland throughout his 
gubernatorial campaign said he would find ways to cut state 
spending through a management audit of state government 
he said that after eight years of a scandalplagued democratic 
administration of gov richard celeste the state needs to work 
harder and smarter in controlling costs 
some state agencies during celestes administration were 
investigated for awarding state contracts that were 
snelling who was governor 197785 decided to seek the office 
again because he believed his successor gov madeleine kunin a

forget counting ballots at the top of cbs 
election special dan rather began announcing the winners of the 
nations 35 senate races 
in shirtsleeves and suspenders rather didnt use the words 
projection or exit polls he declared ictors 
small problem some of the polls on the east coast were still 
open and no bureaucracy not even cbs can count that fast 
forty minutes into tuesdays primetime cbs election special 
rather finally told viewers that abc cbs nbc and cnn were using a 
firstever joint venture called voter research and surveys which 
projected all senate house and gubernatorial races based on exit 
polls 
cbs did place a tiny cbs news estimates in the lefthand 
corner of the screen when it moved on to the governors races 
across the country 
but the premiere of vrs as those in tv news refer to it 
served only to heighten the networks preoccupation with providing 
instantaneous election results while most of the nations ballots 
are still in boxes 
cable news network in its comprehensive and ambitious coverage 
that lasted six hours used the word estimate nbc and tom 
brokaw called races abc and peter jennings projected 
winners 
on cbs it was hard to tell what was a prediction and what was a 
pronouncement 
network election coverage hype was heightened by a ploy to boost 
ratings during the november sweeps period cbs and nbc said 
days before the election that both would carry no commercials 
during their special coverage 
it was not an altruistic move 
the ac nielsen co does not include primetime programs 
without advertisements in its ratings and election specials are 
not known for drawing huge audiences 
thus when cbs and nbc affiliate stations set advertising rates 
based on the number of november sweeps viewers neither network

republicans who saw their midterm election 
hopes fizzle along with president bushs promise not to raise taxes 
were in no mood to put their feelings on display as voting returns 
rolled in 
in contrast to past elections the gop declared tuesday nights 
celebration at its national headquarters offlimits to reporters 
and television cameras 
also closed to the media was a downtown hotel ballroom where the 
national republican senatorial campaign committee was holding its 
customary postelection party 
a small press room was set up one floor above sen don nickles 
rokla the committees chairman along with a gop spokesman and 
pollster were escorted to the room to put their spin on the 
results but no other mingling was allowed 
maybe we learned something from 1986 said one young gop 
campaign worker referring to the last midterm election when 
republicans lost their sixyear reign over the senate 
with republican senate candidates faring better than the partys 
gubernatorial and house hopefuls nickles was given the task of 
being the gops main spokesman on the election results 
we got into a real debacle over the budget nickles said 
it hurt president bush it hurt republicans three or four months 
ago we were hoping to gain two three or four seats right now i 
think well be satisfied if we can hold our own 
just wait until 1992 he said when we have a lot of senators 
in trouble on the democratic side up for reelection 
charles black a spokesman for the republican national 
committee said the results indicate more of an antiincumbent 
trend than a partisan trend a view echoed by ed rollins 
cochairman of the gops house campaign committee 
when its all over youre going to see four or five 
incumbents on our side and four or five incumbents on their side 
going down to defeat rollins said even though a lot of 
incumbents are not being defeated theyre being scared theyre 
not getting the 60 percent margins they had two years ago 
antiincumbency has ranked only slightly behind antitaxes 
antigovernment and antispending in recent years as a cause for 
republicans who have not controlled the house since 1954 
asked if an antiincumbent trend might hurt bushs reelection 
in 1992 black said its an anticongress trend rather than an 
antipresident trend

gov mario cuomo walked away with a third term 
but not without a few blisters that could make it uncomfortable to 
break into a run for the 1992 democratic presidential nomination 
cuomo failed to lead democrats to control of the state senate in 
tuesdays election and he lost his battle for approval of a 2 
billion environmental bond act cuomo also fell far short of the 65 
percent of the vote he racked up four years ago 
this guy gets 52 53 percent of the vote and hes going to be 
a presidential contender state gop chairman j patrick barrett 
said mario cuomo ran against himself and lost 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting cuomo had 2097394 
votes or 53 percent republican pierre rinfret had 850764 votes 
or 21 percent and conservative party challenger herbert london had 
814036 votes or 21 percent 
at cuomos victory party early today about 250 aids activists 
from the group act up staged a raucous protest that delayed and cut 
short the governors acceptance speech 
what these people are proving is that this is a very hard time 
to govern cuomo said to supporters but with your help were 
going to do it better the next four years than its ever been done 
before 
rinfret a millionaire economist who had demonstrated an ability 
to insult republicans almost as often as democrats made no public 
appearance after suffering the worst defeat in state history for a 
republican gubernatorial candidate 
barrett said londons strong showing pointed up a need for the 
republican party to get back together and restore our 
historical conservative base 
lee miringoff director of the marist college institute for 
public opinion said cuomo was hurt by having to announce that the 
state faced a potential budget deficit of 824 million despite his 
approval earlier this year of a record 18 billion tax increase 
package 
however all of new yorks 34 us house members 21 democrats 
and 13 republicans were reelected 
on staten island voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum to 
start a process that could lead to secession for the smallest of 
new york citys five boroughs

massachusetts voters were in the mood for change 
but not enough to adopt what would have been the biggest 
voterinitiated state tax rollback in history 
bay staters rejected the multibilliondollar measure tuesday 
apparently satisfied with ousting incumbents and relying on new 
officeholders to carry out their mandate 
one political analyst said the tax rollback was too dramatic 
even for the frustrated and cashstrapped massachusetts electorate 
they wanted change but the measure went too far 
university of massachusetts political scientist paul watanabe said 
after the election 
crafted by citizens for limited taxation in response to four tax 
increases in the past two years it was defeated 60 percent to 40 
percent with 85 percent of the precincts reporting 
the measure called for cutting state taxes and fees to 1988 
levels it would have slashed 13 billion from the states 134 
billion budget in the second half of the current fiscal year and 
cut 26 billion in fiscal 1992 which begins next july 
recent increases in the state income sales and gas taxes would 
have been rescinded 
after a decade in which the public was told to feel good in 
the reagan years and to feel angry by talkshow hosts the voters 
decided to speak for themselves and recognize reality said james 
braude the initiatives leading opponent 
he and other opponents had argued the measure could almost shut 
down the state which raised fees in recent years as it tried to 
keep pace with a failing economy and cover the costs of an 
escalating budget 
im mad but im not crazy was the slogan of the 
initiatives opponents 
said barbara anderson executive director of citizens for 
limited taxation it was a great fight and we certainly made them 
work for every penny theyre going to take from us 
the financially ailing massachusetts government has the lowest 
state bond rating in the country bond rating agencies warned that 
passage of the measure could drop the states rating from its 
current level of baa to junk bond status

former state legislator for the 3rd district seat 
with 56 percent of precincts reporting unsoeld had 38520 
votes or 53 percent to 34205 votes or 47 percent for williams 
unsoeld a guncontrol advocate in the legislature was rapped 
for championing a key amendment sought by the national rifle 
association and later accepting campaign cash from the group 
otherwise the race was a classic contest between liberal and 
conservative 
foley easily won reelection and the rest of the house 
delegation was heavily favored an unsoeld victory would leave the 
delegation at five democrats and three republicans 
washington voters rejected a slowgrowth initiative seattle

guy hunt alabamas first republican 
governor in more than a century narrowly won reelection despite a 
virtual sweep of top state offices by democrats and democratic us 
sen howell heflins big margin 
hunt a preacher and farmer who blended folksy appeal with a 
hardhitting campaign turned back the challenge of state teachers 
union leader paul hubbert in tuesdays vote 
hubbert delayed any concession speech until today saying there 
remained the possibility of error in the unofficial count 
with 98 percent of precincts reporting the unofficial tally 
showed hunt with 619108 votes or 52 percent to hubberts 574213 
votes or 48 percent 
heflin chairman of the senate ethics committee and a frequent 
swing vote on the senate judiciary committee won a third term over 
republican bill cabaniss 
with 98 percent of precincts reporting heflin had 697458 
votes or 61 percent to cabaniss 454298 votes or 39 percent 
democrats won every statewide office on the ballot and 
maintained their 52 edge in congressional seats 
the 57yearold hunt who first was elected in 1986 won by 
splitting most of the rural vote with hubbert and building solid 
leads in urban centers around birmingham and huntsville 
hunts victory made him the only person other than george c 
wallace to win successive fouryear terms as governor of alabama 
i think it shows the power of incumbency and hunts own 
personal appeal said university of alabama political analyst 
patrick cotter 
hubbert 54 who was making his first run for statewide public 
office said his strong challenge showed alabama is ready to join 
the ranks of the new south

destroyed in the temblor in fars province on tuesday night 
the islamic republic news agency said 21 people were killed 80 
injured and 12105 rendered homeless tehran radio said 22 were 
killed and 100 injured 
the radio monitored in nicosia said most of the victims were 
children who were sleeping when the quake struck at 947 pm 
the us geological survey said initial readings put the 
magnitude of the quake at 70 on the richter scale irans 
geophysics center of tehran university said it measured 66 
an earthquake of that magnitude is capable of widespread heavy 
damage a quake measuring 77 on the richter scale struck northern 
iran on june 21 killing about 50000 people and rendering half a 
million people homeless 
tuesdays quake was centered near the city of darab about 600 
miles southeast of tehran irna said it quoted darab gov yahya 
hashemi as saying at least 12 villages were heavily damaged 
two of the villages irna said were razed it identified them 
as qarehno and doborje fourk both in the fourk county which 
have a combined population of just over 6300 people 
irna reported a series of aftershocks well after the earthquake

indicated the quake hit the route that connects darab with the port 
city of bandarabbas on the strait of hormuz

government in tehran said this is a mountainous area

night when most villagers are at home so thats real 
unfortunate

david walters may have defeated his gop 
gubernatorial opponent but he hasnt seen the last of him walters 
is fending off a libel lawsuit filed by his foe 
republican bill price filed the suit after walters alleged he 
was involved in oil price gouging 
walters who chopped cotton on the family farm as a boy before 
going on to earn a harvard education first ran for the states top 
office in 1986 showing promise by upsetting frontrunner mike 
turpen then the states attorney general in the primary 
it was his first run for political office but the oklahoma city 
businessman quickly made points with his campaign energy and 
mastery of political rhetoric 
walters primary victory then was tarnished by questions over 
the legality of a 162500 loan from five people who already had 
contributed the maximum 5000 allowed by law 
controversy over the loan was a major factor in republican henry 
bellmons defeat of walters in 1986 and was the subject of negative 
television ads by price in this years elections bellmon is 
retiring 
walters countered with his own allegations including those of 
oil price gouging 
walters 38 relied heavily on voter dissatisfaction with 
government in overcoming his own negatives he raised more than 
23 million a record for the campaign 
he defeated two strong contenders in the democratic primary 
seventerm us rep wes watkins and sitting house speaker steve 
lewis as in 1986 he hammered on the theme that he was an outsider 
battling career politicians calling himself a businessman who 
wanted to bring a fresh approach to government 
walters was associate provost at the university of oklahoma 
health sciences center located only a few blocks from the capitol 
before he quit to go into private business a few years before his 
first race for governor 
in the runoff campaign with watkins walters repeatedly ran 
television ads supporting a proposal to make oklahoma the first 
state in the nation to limit legislative terms 
he won a close runoff race with watkins and the legislative 
tenure plan was adopted overwhelmingly 
walters was born and raised in canute a small community in 
southwestern oklahoma he and his wife rhonda have four children

ann richards who roared from 15 points 
behind in the polls only six weeks ago to capture the governors 
mansion derided republican clayton williams millions and the help 
he got from president bush 
ive always believed in people politics more than money 
politics the democratic state treasurer said after becoming the 
first woman to win a texas governors race since miriam ma 
ferguson in 1932 
with 97 percent of the vote counted richards received 1862705 
to 1756634 for williams or 51 percent to 49 percent 
the victory for the 57yearold richards was a major 
embarrassment to bush who calls texas home and campaigned with 
williams all day monday 
texas voters gave republican us sen phil gramm a second term 
with 95 percent of precincts reporting gramm had 2161422 votes 
or 61 percent to 1360731 votes or 39 percent for his 
democratic opponent state sen hugh parmer of fort worth 
democrats retained 19 of the states 27 seats in the us house 
a jubilant richards held aloft a tshirt that said a womans 
place is in the dome as her supporters cheered tuesday night 
she said the vote showed that average texans didnt want another 
millionaire as governor millionaire incumbent bill clements a 
republican is retiring 
they want a governor that gets up and goes to work every 
morning she said they want a governor that isnt going to be 
distracted by other business they want their children educated 
they want something done about their insurance rates and they want 
a governor thats going to do that 
richards also said her abortion rights position was 
wellreceived by voters 
they want a governor who is committed to the freedom of the 
people of this state and who is not going to allow government to 
interfere in their private lives she said 
williams who spent 8 million of his own money on the race that 
cost him over 20 million total hushed supporters who booed at 
richards name 
to ann richards and to those who voted for her and worked long 
and hard and ably for her i say congratulations he said 
in defeat williams acknowledged his various verbal gaffes 
throughout the campaign and the resultant damage 
the fact that i didnt win is no reflection on the values that 
we believe in he said maybe im a little too open maybe 
straightforward 
besides setting a spending record their race also gained 
national notoriety for mudslinging 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic found herself dogged by 
questions about drug use after refusing in the primary to answer 
yes or no to a debate question on whether she had ever used 
illegal drugs 
williams problems stemmed from his gaffes he was sharply 
criticized after likening bad weather to rape and joking that if it 
were inevitable just relax and enjoy it 
he also admitted visiting prostitutes as a youth saying thats 
how young men got serviced 
when told that ms richards had said she was catching up 
williams cracked i hope she didnt go back to drinking again

hank browns methodical rise to the senate befits 
his image as a competent easygoing and articulate man who has 
represented colorados agricultural flatlands in congress for the 
past decade 
brown a republican cruised by democrat josie heath of boulder 
on tuesday a victory expected ever since he announced in 1989 that 
he would seek the senate seat being left vacant by republican sen 
bill armstrong who retired 
during his campaign against heath brown enhanced his reputation 
as a campaigner projecting an unflappable demeanor in public 
brown 50 a fifthgeneration coloradan from greeley had 
represented colorados mainly agricultural eastern plains in 
congress since 1980 winning 70 percent or more of the vote in each 
outing 
he came to the job with an agricultural background of sorts 
having worked for a meatpacker monfort of colorado inc from 1969 
to 1980 he was a vice president during his later years there 
while serving on the house ways and means committee brown 
became one of the most effective republican critics of a welfare 
reform package backed by committee democrats he is credited with 
getting the house to endorse a version that produced the workfare 
reform that was signed into law in 1988 
brown sought tougher child support enforcement mecha said summing 
up his political creed and 
campaign theme 
cut spending hold the line on taxes ensure a strong national 
defense and execute the most heinous of criminals those have been 
the hallmarks of craigs fiveterm congressional career 
they were also the theme of the campaign that earned craig the 
seat of retiring gop sen james mcclure over democrat ron twilegar 
republicans have held it for 40 years 
ive never voted to raise your taxes and im not about to 
start craig told voters throughout the campaign he stood firmly 
against president bush and the budget deficit packages the 
administration backed because they included higher taxes 
he is perhaps best known for sponsoring a proposed balanced 
budget amendment to the us constitution 
craig 45 is idahos third straight 1st district congressman to 
join the senate mcclure held that house seat for three terms 
before winning a heated 1972 campaign to succeed retiring sen len 
jordan 
conservative steve symms took over the district in 1972 and then 
passed the mantle to craig eight years later when he defeated 
longtime democratic sen frank church in 1980 
craig attended the university of idaho where he was student 
body president and a champion debater and later worked on the 
familys midvale ranch in western idahos middle valley while he 
polished his republican credentials 
in 1974 at 29 he began a political career that has yet to be 
tarnished by defeat at the polls he was elected to the first of 
three terms in the state senate serving part of that time with 
twilegar 
he was generally viewed as moderate by his colleagues in the 
legislature his move to the right began with his decision to run 
for congress in 1980 
a relatively lowprofile lawmaker on the national scene craig 
was never really challenged at the polls his last three 
reelection campaigns produced twothirds majorities democrats 
lost two of their challengers to fatal accidents 
during his congressional service craig has run up high ratings 
from conservative groups and low assessments from most 
environmental organizations 
a man of modest means craig saw an investment in a boise 
doughnut shop go sour early in his congressional career during the 
agricultural depression of the mid1980s his family ranch was 
forced into farm bankruptcy and eventually old 
seven years ago he married suzanne scott and the couple has 
three children from his wifes previous marriage

voters ousted two republican governors 
associated with tax hikes and nearly threw out a senator to show 
their fury at a governor who recently raised their taxes but was 
not on the balot this year 
if they sent a clear message on tax matters voters were less 
definitive on abortion prochoice stands helped some candidates 
and proved irrelevant in other cases and top targets of abortion 
rights groups lived to serve another term 
in other trends widespread public dissatisfaction with congress 
translated into only a handful of surprise defeats and though 
voters rated the persian gulf standoff one of the most important 
issues facing them and the country it did not influence contests 
one way or another 
its the forgotten issue said frank newport 
editorinchief of the gallup poll but looking ahead something 
is going to happen there and thats going to set the agenda for the 
months to come even if nothing happens and our troops just sit 
there its a very significant issue that may dwarf the others 
the overriding themes in tuesdays races were economic taxes in 
particular were at issue in florida and kansas where democratic 
gubernatorial challengers won at least in part by tying the 
incumbents to tax increases 
some said the chickens of the past decade came home to roost on 
people who were not at fault 
the real reason this is happening to the governors has got to 
be traced to the reagan administration said benjamin page a 
public opinion expert at northwestern university the cuts in 
federal aid to the states put tremendous pressure on finances and 
thats why these people have been raising taxes without adding 
services 
were having the morning after he said were having our 
hangover 
one nearcasualty of the antitax revolt was sen bill bradley 
dnj thought to be popular and heavily favored yet barely 
holding his seat most analysts blamed his problems on democratic 
gov jim florio who was elected last year and promptly raised 
taxes 
new jersey is a real solid example of what happens with people 
who try to raise taxes said newport he said state executives 
are taking the hit now and you can extrapolate and say president 
bush raised taxes where will he end up in 1992 were going to 
poll on that 
in the sagging economic climate of new england retirements and 
challenges resulted in an almost complete turnover in governors 
mansions 
and in another variation on economic concerns democrats in 
texas and florida made effective use of a populist pitch fueled by 
bushs waffling on whether to raise taxes on the rich 
youve got a resurgence of the democratic fairness theme and 
the notion that the republican party has served the interests of 
the welltodo said bruce buchanan an analyst at the university 
of texas people are tired of it 
in texas he said democrats swept all major statewide offices 
and in florida winning challenger lawton chiles exploited the 
idea of taking the power back to the people away from the elements 
of privilege and big money buchanan said 
chiles also benefited somewhat from his prochoice abortion 
stand as did jim moran a virginia democrat who unseated rep stan 
parris but being prochoice didnt help kansas gov mike hayden or 
north carolina senate candidate harvey gantt both of whom lost 
rep craig james rfla survived though he was a top target of 
abortion rights forces and idaho gov cecil andrus won another 
term after vetoing a restrictive abortion bill and enduring the 
wrath of the antiabortion movement and voters in iowa delivered a 
mixed verdict reelecting a prochoice senator and an 
antiabortion governor 
where abortion was a fundamental issue it cut for the 
prochoice candidate said analyst larry sabato of the university 
of virginia but where other issues took precedence then 
prolife candidates were able to win in iowa lots of people voted 
simultaneously for both candidates so obviously abortion was not 
the motivator 
a poll taken election day found voters giving congress an 18 
percent approval rating but the discontent translated largely into 
unexpectedly close races for some incumbents and not actual 
losses except in a very few cases 
the voters wanted to send a message without killing the 
messengers sabato said the reelect percentages are down a 
lot of incumbents have been given scares

if you can stay out of battle the army can be a 
pretty healthy way of life 
military researchers found that soldiers died at half the rate 
of their civilian counterparts during the peacetime year of 1986 
the lead researcher joseph m rothberg a mathematician in 
military psychiatry at walter reed army institute of research said 
the most important factor in the difference is the screening of 
army enlistees all of whom are volunteers have high school 
degrees and are healthy enough to pass a physical 
the army also provides housing food meaningful work and lots 
of fresh air and exercise as well as controlling substance abuse 
and regulating firearms rothberg said in a telephone interview 
tuesday from bethesda md 
further study is needed to determine how much of a contribution 
to longevity is made by exercise and by recently introduced army 
programs in nutrition smoking reduction and stress reduction the 
reserachers said 
the researchers compared death rates among all 781000 army 
troops and civilian counterparts of the same age race and sex in 
1986 
the study reported in todays journal of the american medical 
association did not give actual death rates but rothberg said in 
an interview that soldiers overall died at a rate of 109 per 
100000 while comparable civilians died at a rate of 215 per 
100000 
sam sarkesian a political science professor at loyola 
university in chicago objected that figures from a peacetime yaer 
like 1986 fail to reflect the dangers of serving a nation that goes 
to war about every 10 years 
he added that being a soldier still means you have to be ready 
to give up your life 
even in nonwar years military personnel die violently such as 
in the 1983 beirut bombing when 237 were killed in the 1985 
gander newfoundland plane crash when 248 died and in the 1989 
panama invasion when 23 died 
from 1945 on if youd put all those together and compare it 
to the equivalent in civilian life i think youd get a totally 
different picture sarkesian said 
in the military study the greatest disparity in death rates 
involved homicides which were almost six times less common among 
soldiers deaths by disease or suicide were also lower 
the most striking difference was among black men who died in 
homicides almost 12 times less often in the army than in the 
population at large 
the homicide rate among black male soldiers was nine per 
100000 compared with 100 per 100000 for black male civilians 
rothberg said 
army women who make up 102 percent of soldiers died at about 
threequarters the rate of civilian women of the same age overall 
black women soldiers died at 39 percent the rate of comparable 
civilians but white women soldiers died at 139 percent the rate of 
white women civilians

wally hickel has tried to get back to the 
governors mansion ever since he moved out in midterm more than 
two decades ago on his fourth longshot attempt he succeeded 
entering the race just hours before the deadline on a 
thirdparty ticket the conservative hickel was condemned by some 
republicans as a spoiler but the selfdescribed independent 
republican attracted a following that by late october had pushed 
him ahead of his republican and democratic rivals in the polls 
hickel 71 had to attract support from a large percentage of 
voters who were children or not even born when he was at his 
political zenith 
while his campaign slogan was for a bright future hickel 
often cited achievements from two decades ago and spoke longingly 
of restoring alaskas lost spirit 
hickel associates call him an energetic man of limitless 
optimism and belief in his own abilities 
im not one to study things to death he said i get 
things done 
he arrived in anchorage in late 1940 a boxer from kansas with 
37 cents in his pocket as he tells it he went on to make a 
fortune in construction and real estate and his holdings now 
include hotels and shopping centers 
in 1966 hickel defeated democratic gov bill egan to become 
alaskas second governor during his two years in juneau he 
approved construction of an ice road from fairbanks to prudhoe bay 
that allowed expanded oil exploration on alaskas north slope when 
summer turned the road to mud it became known as hickels 
ditch 
president nixon called hickel to washington dc as interior 
secretary in 1968 three days before the santa barbara oil spill 
after initial criticism hickel won praise for writing regulations 
to control offshore drilling and make the oil industry financially 
liable for well blowouts 
nixon fired hickel in 1970 in response hickel says to industry 
pressure hickel also had written nixon a letter chiding him for 
failing to listen to americas youth protesting the vietnam war 
in 1974 hickel ran for governor but lost the gop primary to jay 
hammond he tried again in 1978 and lost to hammond by 98 votes 
hickel then ran a writein campaign as an independent in the 
general election and lost 
in 1986 hickel ran again but lost the republican primary to 
arliss sturgulewski hickel supporters promoted him as a writein 
candidate in the general election he got less than 3 percent of 
the vote 
this year hickel headed the alaskan independence party ticket 
his campaign stressed independence from the federal government 
reduced state spending and protecting the family 
hickel is married and has six grown children

former gov walter hickel a 
toughtalking conservative swept past the two major party 
candidates to recapture the statehouse as an independent 
i think alaskans just want a change they want to have more 
of a say in government hickel said after voting tuesday its 
sort of an antigovernment feeling out there 
republican sen ted stevens had no trouble defeating democratic 
businessman michael beasley 
with 83 percent of the vote counted hickel had 46799 votes or 
38 percent to 39150 or 32 percent for democrat tony knowles 
republican arliss sturgulewski was third with 31649 votes or 26 
percent 
with 83 percent of the precincts reporting in the senate race 
stevens had 78941 or 66 percent to 38615 or 32 percent for 
beasley 
alaskans also approved a referendum making the private use of 
marijuana a crime once again with 89 percent of the precincts 
reporting the measure passed by 75829 votes or 55 percent to 
62942 or 45 votes 
hickel 71 is a longtime republican who was elected the states 
second governor in 1966 he entered the race just six weeks ago on 
the alaskan independence party ticket and quickly passed the major 
party candidates in the polls 
his victory is believed to mark the first time in american 
history that two independent governors have been elected at the 
same time former connecticut sen lowell p weicker jr was 
elected governor there tuesday as an independent 
those people that voted for us thank god those people that 
didnt well welcome them lets build a great alaska hickel 
said in a victory speech 
sturgulewski she her campaign was hurt by hickels entry into 
the race 
i feel weve run a wonderful campaign with wonderful people 
around the state she said but i do think its unfortunate 
that we had someone come in at the last minute with a lot of money 
and whos not subject to public scrutiny 
hickel supporters said he offered the only conservative 
alternative to the moderate sturgulewski and to knowles

in a nation of people who complain about taxes a funny thing 
happened tuesday when voters got a chance to change the laws 
mostly they didnt 
down went a 26 billion tax rollback in massachusetts which 
would have been the largest voterinitiated state tax cut in the 
nations history down went a 2 percent limit on annual state and 
local budget increases in nebraska 
montanans refused to scrap their state income property and 
sales taxes in favor of a transaction charge of 1 percent on 
all financial dealings neither backers nor opponents seemed sure 
whether it would have raised or lowered taxes 
and colorado voters narrowly rejected a measure requiring voter 
approval for any state or local tax increase a similar proposal 
was soundly defeated in 1988 
an exception to the trend appeared in oregon which passed a 
limit on property taxes of 15 percent of assessed value the 
measure would cut property taxes by almost 50 percent 
in unofficial returns today from 82 percent of the precincts 52 
percent voted for the oregon measure 
don mcintire chief proponent of the new limit said he thinks 
oregonians are frustrated with state governments inability to 
tackle the property tax question 
people are realizing the political system is paralyzed 
mcintire said they state leaders just cant deal with this 
subject responsibly 
but john marshall of the oregon school boards association warned 
that school programs face major amputation as a result of the 
vote 
the massachusetts measure would have shrunk state taxes and fees 
to 1988 levels it would have slashed 13 billion from the state 
budget in the second half of the current fiscal year and 26 
billion in the fiscal year starting next july the states current 
budget is 134 billion 
it also would have rescinded recent increases in the state 
income sales and gas taxes 
opponents had charged that the cuts would hamper such state 
services as day care elderly programs and police and firefighter 
training officials said the measure could shut down college 
campuses and bankrupt some school districts 
one political analyst said the tax rollback was too dramatic 
even for the frustrated and cashstrapped massachusetts electorate 
they wanted change but the petition went too far said 
university of massachusetts political scientist paul watanabe 
james braude the leading opponent of the initiative said 
after a decade in which the public was told to feel good in the 
reagan years and to feel angry by talk show hosts the voters 
decided to speak for themselves and recognize reality 
californians rejected two measures that would have increased the 
state tax on alcohol in utah voters refused to abolish the state 
sales tax on food 
although montanans preserved their income property and sales 
taxes they decided in another vote to put the lid on they snuffed 
out a measure to boost the state cigarette tax 140 percent to 43 
cents a pack the highest in the nation a device that had been 
expected to cut tobacco consumption

vanquished gubernatorial hopeful john silber said 
voters werent angry with his blunt remarks but with incumbent gov 
michael dukakis when they chose their first republican governor in 
20 years 
voters in overwhelmingly democratic massachusetts preferred 
mildmannered former federal prosecutor william weld to silber a 
democrat but conservative in many ways by 51 percent to 49 percent 
on tuesday 
silber whose fiery nature had become a major issue in the race 
blamed his defeat on the withering of the massachusetts economic 
miracle that dukakis had touted during his futile presidential 
bid in 1988 
i think there was a very antidemocratic spirit running in 
this state said silber with 90 percent of precincts reporting 
weld had 1027184 votes to silbers 972050 
but democrats won other closely watched races sen john kerry 
a former lieutenant governor under dukakis won a second term 
solidly as did us rep barney frank reprimanded by the house 
earlier this year for his activities with a male prostitute 
voters elected a republican state treasurer joe malone to 
succeed democrat robert q crane retiring after 26 years and the 
states sole gop congressman silvio conte won reelection easily 
but none of six democratic congressmen in contested races was 
repudiated four other democratic incumbents ran unopposed 
in the senate race with 90 percent of precincts reporting 
kerry had 1155686 votes or 57 percent to 866828 votes or 43 
percent for james rappaport a republican mutimillionaire 
businessman 
twentyfive years ago some of us my age jumped around to a 
song with the title money cant buy me love and today in 
massachusetts we have proven that money cant buy you a united 
states senate seat kerry said in his victory speech 
the results of the governors race buoyed state republicans 
outnumbered 31 by democrats among registered voters there are 
several thousand more independents than democrats however 
by a 32 margin voters rejected a 12 billion tax rollback 
that weld had supported and silber opposed 
i dont believe government should be in the miracle business 
i believe government should do a very few things but do them 
well weld said 
during his primary campaign silber on leave as boston 
university president uttered a series of blunt statements dubbed 
silber shockers on women immigrants and welfare mothers 
his tone was quieter in the general election campaign though he 
tried to attack welds image as a wealthy descendant of bostons 
old ruling class 
weld replied that silber lacked the temperament to govern 
silber frequently complained he was quoted out of context 
both candidates tried to appeal to both right and left 
weld 45 a former us attorney for massachusetts stressed his 
progressive views on social issues including abortion and 
conservative fiscal beliefs 
silber 64 a philosophy scholar from texas and bu president 
since 1970 acknowledged voting for president bush over dukakis in 
1988 and blamed dukakis for the states fiscal mess

jewish leaders condemned the assassination of 
rabbi meir kahane while taking pains to distance themselves from 
his extreme antiarab views and support of violence 
we always condemned kahane and the antiarab racist views he 
espoused said arden e shenker head of the national jewish 
community relations advisory council we nevertheless are shocked 
by this cold act of political violence 
kahane founder of the radical jewish defense league and a 
former member of israels parliament was shot to death monday 
after a speech to a zionist group at a new york hotel his alleged 
assassin a naturalized egyptian was shot and wounded 
followers of kahane vowed revenge on tuesday arab spokesmen and 
mainstream jewish leaders counseled against further violence 
i hope this is just hyperbole more rhetoric dr mt 
mehdi president of the americanarab relations committee said of 
the threats of reprisals 
this is not the time to be speaking of revenge said rabbi 
marc d angel president of the rabbinical council of america it 
is the time to be speaking of peace and reconciliation this cycle 
of violence must be ended 
mehdi said he had debated kahane numerous times and found him to 
be honest courageous and decent despite mehdis beating by jdl 
members in 1974 
we disagreed 100 percent with his basic assumptions which was 
that god has given palestine to the jews he said but now i 
feel the attack upon him is not only an attack upon rabbi meir 
kahane but also an attack on the first amendment 
it is an endeavor to shut up a voice a disagreeable voice 
mehdi said and we have condemned the alleged assassin whoever 
he is 
zaheer uddin president of the new york unit of the islamic 
circle of north america condemned the assassination and said we 
hope that it will be the last act in the cycle of violence and 
counterviolence 
sholom d comay president of the american jewish committee 
said despite our considerable differences meir kahane must 
always be remembered for the slogan never again which for so 
many became the battle cry of postholocaust jewry

the environmental movement suffered a blow at 
the polls on tuesday led by the firm defeat of californias 
sweeping big green initiative 
big green would have stiffened regulation of emissions 
pesticides offshore oildrilling and logging it trailed by a 
margin of about 2 to 1 as late results came in early today 
california voters also appeared to be rejecting 
environmentalists proposition 130 forests forever a ban on 
clearcutting of forests two industry countermeasures to big 
green and forests forever were soundly rejected 
from the pacific northwest to missouri to new york other 
environmentalistbacked measures also were voted down 
big green would have provided 300 million in bond funds to 
buy and preserve ancient redwood forests tried to slow global 
warming by curbing auto and other emissions banned oil development 
in state waters and barred pesticides suspected of causing cancer 
it would also have created an elected post of environmental czar 
i dont think that anybody who voted against big green voted 
for polluted air or cancercausing chemicals sierra club 
official bob hattoy said voters apparently were swayed by 
broadcast commercials paid for by oil and chemical companies he 
said 
california attorney general john van de kamp a primary sponsor 
of the measure said voters were conservative when it came to 
spending money on new programs because of a confluence of 
events 
i think the invasion of kuwait the beginning of the 
recession the national budget crisis the state budget crisis 
all those things have scared people he said 
proponents who spent 45 million to boost the initiative said 
it would have saved californians several billion dollars a year in 
energy and health costs 
corporations including major oil companies based outside the 
state spent 10 million in a campaign condemning the measure as a 
potential economic disaster foes said the controls would have 
increased gas electricity and food prices while falling short of 
environmental cleanup goals 
elsewhere two environmental measures did pass south dakotans 
approved an initiative requiring legislative approval for 
largescale garbage dumps and arizonans voted to spend 20 million 
a year in state lottery receipts on wildlife habitat protection 
parks trails and other environmental endeavors 
but these environmental measures were defeated 
a washington initiative to create regional boards to oversee 
and enforce landuse planning at the local and regional levels 
an oregon initiative to require recycling standards for all 
food and product packaging 
a missouri initiative to protect 52 natural waterways mainly 
in the ozarks by banning new dams and restricting landfills and 
dumping septic tanks and structures near the waterways

hills of south dakota

police early today released about 50 
saudi women they detained for a daring protest driving their 
normally chauffered cars around riyadh to demand that they be given 
the right to take the wheel 
the women many supported by their husbands called tuesdays 
unprecedented protest a practical matter saying any saudi 
involvement in a persian gulf war could leave them without male 
drivers for their luxury sedans 
this has nothing whatsoever to do with politics one said 
if a crisis erupts we must drive for the sake of our families 
we cannot stay immobile like sitting ducks 
the protest was a startling act of defiance in this 
conservative maledominated moslem country under saudi arabias 
strict islamic code women cannot drive mingle with men in public 
or expose their skin to public view 
many women in the kingdom speculate however that saudi arabia 
could finally be ready to make some tentative first steps toward 
allowing women greater freedoms they think the arrival of tens of 
thousands of women drivers among kuwaiti refugees and in the us 
military could help spur such change 
tuesdays women drivers many of them completely veiled except 
for their eyes piled into 15 cars and took a 30minute drive 
through the capital 
all the women who took part were experienced drivers having 
learned the skill outside of saudi arabia they included 
businesswomen houswives and a woman who was eight months pregnant 
they met in a supermarket parking lot and revved their engines 
in excitement just as the meuzzins call signaled the end of the 
afternoon prayer 
husbands brothers and a crowd of filipino drivers stood 
watching with open admiration 
passing motorists stared in disbelief as the women drove 
expertly down riyadhs highways most of the women previously had 
only rode in the back seats of their cars which usually are driven 
by foreign chaffeurs 
some people joined the convoy and pulled over to the side of the 
road after 30 minutes when the women were finally stopped by the 
police who blocked observers trying to speak with the women 
we dont know what will happen next said a woman in one of 
the cars this is just the first little bit of freedom 
they parked in row alongside the road for several hours until 
the policemen drove the womens cars to a police station 
the women said the episode ended at 4 am today when they were 
all released to the custody of their relatives 
we didnt like it but there was no alternative one woman 
said like others interviewed she spoke on condition of anonymity 
the womens closest male relatives were summoned to the station 
to witness as they signed a statement that the protest would not be 
repeated participants in the demonstation said 
the driving ban has been a topic of heated debate with 
conservative citizens arguing that the islamic prohibition against 
men and women mingling in public included women drivers 
others have pointed out that women were allowed to lead camels 
in the era of prophet mohammed the founder of the islamic faith 
so modern women should be able to drive cars having a chauffeur 
especially a foreigner was a form of mingling with strange men 
they point out 
one informed source told ap that the women had written a letter 
to riyadh governor prince salman bin abdelaziz informing him that 
the drivein protest would take place but not revealing the 
date or place 
with the onset of the persian gulf crisis king fahd had 
instituted a program opening the way for saudi women to volunteer 
for nursing and first aid

colorado voters expressed a disaffection for 
politicians by overwhelming approving a referendum to limit their 
terms but they reelected gov roy romer and sent rep hank brown 
to the us senate 
and although a taxlimitation amendment was rejected tuesday it 
gathered significant support and was seen as a signal that tax 
reform can no longer be ignored 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting democrat romer had 
623835 votes or 63 percent to 362157 votes or 37 percent for 
gop candidate john andrews 
brown defeated democrat josie heath in the race to succeed the

57 percent to 43 percent 
veterinarian wayne allard edged dick bond to claim browns old

house members including patricia schroeder prevailed 
brown a former state legislator who went on to win five 
consecutive terms in colorados 4th district said voters showed 
that the nations strength comes from working men and women up 
and not from washington down 
heath in conceding said i got into this race because i 
believed i could make a difference first there were a dozen of 
you then 100 and then a thousand and now hundreds of thousands 
of voters who have said it is time for a new agenda 
romer 62 said he felt honored and humbled by his 
reelection 
you dont go through this process without understanding who 
you are your possibilities and your limitations he said 
tuesday night 
voters in a mood for change approved four of colorados five 
ballot issues including the termlimitation measure and a proposal 
to establish casino gambling in three small mountain towns 
the termlimiting amendment would make colorado the first state 
to limit congressional terms however questions linger about 
whether it would withstand a constitutional challenge 
the measure would limit us senators and representatives to 12 
years of consecutive service and would cap terms for state 
officeholders and lawmakers to eight years at a time 
the taxlimitation amendment was the only one to fail

former spymaster said he expected to be dealt with under existing 
german law 
stern did not say where it tracked down wolf who disappeared 
after german unification on oct 3

wolf also was quoted as saying he advised erich honecker last year 
that the communist leaders antireform policy had no support 
the ddr east germany was on the way to becoming a second 
albania stern quoted wolf as saying 
after his talk with honecker wolf said i gave up the last 
hopes that he would change the magazine reported 
it is virtually impossible to determine the accuracy of wolfs 
statement that he was against the policies of honecker who was 
toppled oct 18 1989 by reformist communists who permitted free 
elections 
since the collapse of the communist regime in east germany many 
of the countrys former leaders and top officials including 
honecker have given interviews trying to put their personal roles 
into the best light possible 
in another report the newspaper bild zeitung said it has 
learned from security sources that wolf is at a hungarian spa for 
treatment of a slipped disc 
wolf who served as the head of east german espionage from 1952 
to 1986 became legendary because of his agents success in 
infiltrating west german intelligence and obtaining important nato

rising gop star jim edgar squeaked to victory in 
the governors race while veteran democrat paul simon was easily 
reelected to the us senate both men credited outspokeness for 
their victories 
edgar who campaigned in favor of making a temporary 20 percent 
increase in the state income tax permanent gained 51 percent of 
the vote in tuesdays election to edge democrat neil hartigan the 
twoterm state attorney general 
the voters have sent a message throughout illinois and across 
the country that politicians can be candid with voters about taxes 
and still win he told cheering supporters early today 
hartigan opposed extending the twoyear tax but edgar said it 
was necessary to provide needed revenues for schools 
with 98 percent of the precincts reporting edgar the 
44yearold illinois secretary of state had 1633330 votes or 51 
percent to hartigans 1535514 or 48 percent solidarity party

simon seeking election to a second sixyear term had 2075145 
votes or 65 percent to rep lynn martins 1119949 or 35 
percent 
simon said his victory was an endorsement of his call for 
government to take a greater role in tackling the nations top 
issues 
we want a nation that sees its security in education health 
care and a clean environment as much as in weapons systems 
he said we want a nation that is firm on the international scene 
but that is also sensitive to human rights and the suffering of 
people of other nations 
in other major races republican lt gov george ryan was 
elected to the secretary of state post being vacated by edgar but 
democrat john cox defeated republican john hallock to capture the 
congressional seat martin is vacating state rep hallock had been 
favored until he was battered by publicity about a childsupport 
dispute and a ticket for driving 107 mph 
democratic victories in state legislative races also gave the 
party a vetoproof 7345 majority in the state house of 
representatives with reapportionment to be considered next year 
two congressional democrats veteran frank annunzio of chicago 
and freshman george sangmeister of mokena also survived stiff 
challenges as their party widened its majority in the states 
congressional delegation to 157

sen bill bradley who began his bid for a 
third term with polls showing him 47 points ahead of gop unknown 
christine todd whitman ended the contest by eking out a twopoint 
win 
what can i say its been a few years since i was in a double 
overtime the former new york knicks basketball star said early 
today when he finally was able to give a subdued victory speech 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting bradley had 964309 
votes or 50 percent to 909694 votes or 48 percent for mrs 
whitman 
bradley has been widely named as a democratic presidential 
prospect but he has insisted he will concentrate on serving new 
jersey for the next six years and that promise may be easier to 
keep following the razorthin win 
voters turned to his opponent to show their disapproval of new 
federal and state taxes along with general concerns over the 
lagging economy he said 
i think it was close because people were frustrated and 
angry bradley said for all of those of you who are 
dissatisfied with government even for those who voted against 
me as a sign of protest i hear your voices too he said 
i know you dont distinguish between federal state or local 
taxes i know that all of you want a chance to be free of the 
constant financial pressure and i finally know that you dont 
think politicians have much to offer 
some observers suggested the squeaker catapulted mrs whitman a 
former president of the state board of public utilities into the 
frontrunners spot in the 1993 race against democratic gov jim 
florio 
mrs whitmans response to the speculation who knows 
an unpopular 28 billion tax package that florio unveiled after 
his election gave mrs whitman an opportunity to attack bradley for 
refusing to comment on his fellow democrats policies 
mrs whitman hit bradley over his refusal to comment on the 
widely hated tax plan saying it was a sign that he was out of 
touch with new jersey taxpayers 
thats the thing he missed by not being in the state enough 
these past years she said 
this morning bradley acknowledged the florio tax plan was 
clearly an element of the mix but he defended his refusal to 
debate the plan with mrs whitman who has repeatedly denounced it 
i didnt comment because it is essentially not my 
responsibility he said 
polls showed that a majority of new jersey voters believed 
bradley should have addressed florios tax plan 
he and his friends can forget about any national aspirations 
they ever had said joseph sullivan mrs whitmans finance 
director 
however anita dunn of the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee said a weak showing by all incumbents was expected in 
light of the messy budget process in washington 
especially in new jersey where the state budget is an 
especially volatile issue she said its not a key indicator 
of anything beyond whats going on in the internal politics of your 
own state 
in house races democrats kept control of eight of 14 seats in 
new jerseys delegation the same share they had before florio 
vacated his seat upon election as governor

oregonians strongly rejected a pioneering 
measure that would have given tax breaks to parents who send their 
children to private schools or educate them at home 
unofficial results showed measure 11 rejected by a margin of 67 
percent to 33 percent tuesday 
the national education community watched the measure closely 
and vice president dan quayle came to oregon to campaign for it 
measure 11 would have allowed tax credits of up to 2500 for 
sending children to private schools including religious ones or 
for schooling them at home the proposal also would have let 
parents send children across district lines to any public school in 
the state 
foes said the plan would mainly have helped the wealthy and 
amount to state aid to religion 
im delighted said karen famous president of the oregon 
education association the states largest teachers union i 
think it shows oregon voters do not want public tax dollars 
diverted to private education 
ed marihart a spokesman for the campaign to pass the proposal 
said confusion probably helped defeat it 
it was a relatively new concept that people misunderstood 
he said some people thought it would increase the costs and take 
away control from public education 
he said backers of the measure might continue their campaign in 
the 1991 legislature or launch another initiative drive for the 
1992 election

democrat paul wellstone rode a repainted 
backfiring converted school bus nicknamed the magellan ii to 
defeat the bigbucks campaign of 12year republican sen rudy 
boschwitz 
the bus named after the campaign train harry truman took on a 
whistlestop train tour in 1948 became a symbol of the political 
science professors lowbudget volunteerdriven campaign against 
boschwitzs multimilliondollar war chest 
wellstone 46 bunked with supporters while on the road and once 
borrowed campaign money from his wife ive only stayed in a 
hotel once said wellstone whose campaign raised 800000 to 
boschwitzs 62 million 
once called a leftist hustler and an abbie hoffmanlike 
character by boschwitzs campaign secretary the unabashed 
liberal said he wanted to go to washington to shake things up 
im not going to be one of the inner club he said 
wellstone took a leave of absence at the elite carleton college 
to run for against boschwitz a selfmade millionaire he said 
hell return to teaching when his political career is over

community organizing 
wellstone refused to accept campaign contributions from 
political action committees unless they have some affiliate or 
some membership connection with minnesota saying he doesnt want 
to be beholden to wealth special interests 
wellstone said his low budget forced his campaign to come up 
with creative tv commercials to catch voters attention 
he gained national attention for his infrequently broadcast 
twominute looking for rudy ad that showed him in a madcap 
effort to engage boschwitz in a debate the ad was a takeoff of the 
1989 documentary roger and me in which a filmmaker tries to 
track down general motors chairman roger smith 
throughout the campaign wellstone called for a shift of the sampl 
bailout costs to the rich tougher environmental standards 
guaranteed health care and affordable day care 
he supports abortion rights and opposes nuclear power and says 
minnesotas law requiring a sevenday waiting period for handgun 
purchase should be a model for the nation

doctorate at the university of north carolina at chapel hill he 
moved to northfield in 1969 where he still lives with his wife

a marcher fired shots on red square not far from 
soviet leaders during todays revolution day parae and thousands 
of angry citizens held the first protests ever sanctioned in moscow 
on the major soviet holiday 
during the traditional parade a man fired two shots from a 
sawedoff shotgun about 80 yards from lenin mausoleum where 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other leaders were watching a 
tass correspondent said 
no one appeared to have been hit and police quickly grabbed the 
unidentified man said correspondent sergei vozianov who witnessed 
the incident voizanov said it was not clear if he was aiming at 
anyone 
the incident occurred on what was already the most unruly 
revolution day ever with alternative demonstrations bemoaning the 
legacy of the 1917 bolshevik revolution given official sanction in 
moscow 
in the independenceminded baltic republics authorities told 
residents to boycott the holiday by going to work 
even official media questioned the wisdom of holding a 
celebration amid mounting political economic and ethnic turmoil 
moscows streets became forums for celebration by communist 
party supporters and denunciation by radicals who contend the 1917 
revolution served only to throw russian civilization into decline 
revolution day has been the biggest holiday on the soviet 
calendar focusing until gorbachev came to power on the red square 
parade during which the military always showed off its latest 
hardware 
gorbachev took the traditional soviet leaders position atop the 
lenin mausoleum in flagdraped red square today and opened the 
official celebration with a sober assessment of the state of the 
nation 
its not the fault of previous generations that the goals they 
dreamed of were not fulfilled he said referring to what he 
called distortions of socialist ideas 
speaking behind a row of microphones and wearing a gray wool 
coat gorbachev also acknowledged that shortages of goods a 
breakdown of law and order and ethnic strife had worsened in recent 
years 
a few blocks away at least 2000 people gathered near communist 
party headquarters for a counterdemonstration two sound trucks 
played funereal music as people unfurled banners from different 
regions and political groups 
genocide is the gift of the leninist leaders to the people 
read one countrymen how long will we endure hypocrisy lies 
demagoguery violence and theft from the mafiacommunist party 
read another 
similar rallies were held in leningrad kiev and other cities 
gorbachev spoke for 15 minutes flanked by critical and 
supportive leaders including russian republic president boris n 
yeltsin and prime minister nikolai ryzhkov an army band played the 
national anthem 
red flags hung from street lamps and fluttered on buses across a 
capital covered by a thin layer of the seasons first snow 
after rows of armored personnel carriers tanks and rocket 
launchers passed gorbachev antiestablishment mayor gavriil popov 
and other leaders filed down the front steps of the mausoleum to 
lead a peoples parade 
the official news agency tass said it was the first time soviet 
leaders had walked with the people on revolution day 
gorbachev was followed by thousands of people carrying official 
banners touting his reform program gorbachev and the others broke 
off from the parade and laid red carnations at the base of the 
mausoleum before going back on top to watch the parade 
banners the marchers carried reflected criticism of gorbachev 
gorbachev take your eyes off foreign affairs and pay 
attention to the country read one banner carried by a branch of 
moscows city communist party organization 
cpsu get out of your coma read another referring to the 
party 
in the baltic republics authorities declared today a working 
day although promoscow groups planned traditional parades in the 
caucasian republic of georgia where noncommunists prevailed in 
recent elections the military parade was moved from the center of 
the capital of tbilisi to an army base 
in kiev radical students and nationalists occupied central 
pobeda square vowing to block the official celebration and 
military parade on tuesday night 5000 people gathered for an 
anticommunist rally in another square according to the 
independent news agency interfax 
in the siberian city of omsk anticommunist protesters from the 
democratic union today held banners near an official demonstration 
that read history will not forgive the crimes of the communist 
party a local journalist reported 
morning newspapers were filled with reports some glowing and 
some critical of anniversary plans 
tass noted the complex situation the nation faces the 
economy is in throes discord is tearing ethnic minorities asunder 
and various social forces are in confrontation 
it is no wonder that some politicians have called into 
question the advisability of holding celebrations at all tass 
said 
ethnic bloodshed forced cancellation of parades in kishinev the 
capital of moldavia and in nagornokarabakh the mountainous 
region coveted by both the republics of armenia and azerbaijan 
in moscow on tuesday night knots of people holding candles 
gathered after nightfall at a new monument to victims of communist 
repression said galina starovoytova a russian member of 
parliament 
the monument erected outside kgb headquarters in dzherzhinsky 
square was unveiled last week and been heaped with flowers ever 
since 
ms starovoytova appealed to other legislators taking part in 
the celebrations to after seeing the military power turn your 
faces to look at the misery and poverty our country is facing 
society is falling apart said gleb yakunin a russian 
orthodox priest leading one of the counterdemonstrations it is a 
day of mourning the day of the most tragic event in our history

arizona voters rejected two proposals to honor 
martin luther king jr with a state holiday and waited for the 
other shoe to drop a move by the national football league to yank 
the 1993 super bowl out of the state 
proposition 301 which would have created a paid king holiday 
but eliminated a paid columbus day was rejected tuesday by a 
3to1 margin proposition 302 which would have given state 
workers both days off was defeated by fewer than 15000 votes out 
of about 1 million cast 
the nfl awarded the 1993 super bowl to suburban tempe earlier 
this year but philadelphia eagles owner norman braman promised to 
lead a drive to reverse the decision if the state failed to enact a 
king holiday 
it was with that threat in mind that the legislature ended 
nearly two decades of divisive debate over the issue last year by 
passing a bill creating martin luther kingcivil rights day in 
arizona 
but opponents led by impeached gov evan mecham circulated 
petitions to force a referendum on the issue 
arnie zaler one of the leaders of the king day campaign said 
there probably will be a renewed effort next year to create the 
holiday in honor of the slain civil rights leader 
this is going to be a test of our leadership and our belief in 
dr kings dream zaler said

tom harkin said his support for abortion 
rights helped him become the first iowa democrat to win a second 
us senate term 
republican gov terry branstad meanwhile said voters who swept 
him to a third fouryear term tuesday gave him a clear mandate for 
his policies he also retains veto power over congressional 
redistricting approved by the democraticcontrolled state house and 
senate 
harkin 50 had been a target for the gop since he ousted 
republican sen roger jepsen in 1984 and became a persistent vocal 
administration critic 
he faced gop us rep tom tauke in a twoyear fight that was the 
most expensive political race in iowas history at 11 million in 
combined spending 
harkin drew a sharp distinction with taukes antiabortion 
stance and groups on both sides of the issue targeted the race 
people knew where we stood on the issue harkin said i 
didnt say it was a key issue but it was an important issue 
tauke had said he would ban abortion even for rape and incest 
victims president bush and vice president dan quayle campaigned 
repeatedly for him 
with 99 percent of the states precincts reporting harkin 
collected 518109 votes or 54 percent to 441456 or 46 percent 
for tauke 
with 98 percent of the votes counted in the governors race 
branstad had 61 percent or 575437 votes to avensons 39 percent 
or 370430 votes 
its clearly a mandate for the policies that ive 
established branstad said ive never won by that kind of a 
margin in the governors race

democrat paul wellstone who ran his campaign 
on a shoestring and a laugh defeated republican sen rudy 
boschwitz in a fitting conclusion to minnesotas strange political 
season 
the wild gubernatorial race between democratic gov rudy perpich 
and republican challenger arne carlson was still too close to call 
today 
returns were slow because carlsons lastminute substitution for 
gop candidate jon grunseth required votes to be counted by hand 
grunseth dropped out of the race a little over a week ago following 
allegations that he had gone skinnydipping with teenage girls and 
cheated on two wives 
with 83 percent of precincts reporting today carlson held a 
slim lead over perpich the democratfarmerlabor incumbent who was 
trying for an unprecedented fourth term carlson had 565045 votes 
in unofficial returns to 564962 for perpich 
i feel like lazarus carlson told supporters

a clear negative move away from the republicans and rudy in 
general 
boschwitz was the only incumbent senator to lose in tuesdays 
elections 
republican arlan stangeland who had been hounded by questions 
about latenight telephone calls to and from a virginia womans 
home lost his us house seat to dfl challenger collin peterson

1962 when dfler karl rolvaag won a 91vote recount victory over 
republican gov elmer l andersen in a race that wasnt decided 
until march 1963 
carlson 56 had finished second in the republican primary he 
had already begun a writein campaign for the general election when 
grunseth dropped out of the race and a reeling republican party 
quickly made carlson its official candidate 
perpich 62 had been considered easy to beat earlier in the 
year when he was dubbed governor goofy for a series of odd 
statements but the republican disarray allowed him to bounce back 
boschwitz blamed grunseth for his own political problems saying 
he had cast the entire party in a bad light 
wellstone 46 a carleton college professor who campaigned in a 
ramshackle bus gained recognition with a series of humorous 
television ads one of which showed him looking for rudy in a 
takeoff of the documentary film roger and me his shoeleather

candidate for governor since john r doc brinkley in 1932 
unofficial returns showed democrats with a oneseat edge over 
republicans in the state house of representatives

keep republicans in charge

sen nancy kassebaum as expected easily defeated democratic 
challenger dick williams ringing up 73 percent of the vote 
the gop also kept its 32 advantage in the states us house

bruce g sundlun the voters 
overwhelming choice over republican edward d diprete in the rhode 
island governors race is a harddriving businessman with the 
touch of a new deal democrat 
a quintessential state political insider the 70yearold 
millionaire triumphed in his third challenge of diprete for 
possession of the highest office in the nations smallest state 
along the way the candidate who smiles easily in private but 
had a stiff and sometimes brusque public persona softened and 
seemed to enjoy campaigning 
i think its because i have learned not 100 percent but i 
have learned to be a public person sundlun said 
after his victory he said the voters also caught on 
i thinkthe voters of rhode island said hes been out there 
twice and hes been right on all the issues sundlun said 
the former outlet co chief executive twice fought diprete when 
the republican was at the height of his popularity this year he 
took umbrage when two primary challengers sensing a weakened 
diprete stepped in 
i put the food on the plate and they want to eat it and at 
that point my competitive hackles start to rise a bit sundlun 
said before the primary 
sundlun went public with a 61page homily called hope in 
which he described himself as a formerly shy jewish kid who grew up 
on providences east side during te depression and admired 
president franklin d roosevelt 
i learned early on that you have to help people and i learned 
early on that the government is a good vehicle for helping people 
in times of crisis he wrote 
sundlun promises to do it with a businessmans touch offering 
incentives to firms that provide services like day care and 
promising time off for juvenile prisoners who complete classes 
the harvardeducated lawyer became a federal prosecutor in 1949 
but returned to private practice five years later he participated 
in tennesee sen estes kefauvers 1956 campaign and helped john f 
kennedys presidential run in 1960 
sundlun says hes made the transition from uptight executive to 
atease public official 
i know exactly when and where i crossed it he said it was 
just before a television interview when his campaign manager told 
him to be a governor not a candidate and i understood exactly 
what he meant

voters in california colorado and kansas city mo slapped 
limits tuesday on how long politicians can hold office 
californians imposed a lifetime cap on an individuals service 
granting a total of six years three terms for assembly members 
and eight years two terms for state senators the eightyear 
limit also applies to statewide officers 
the change will rock the careerists in the state 
legislature said lewis uhler cosponsor of the proposition it 
demonstrates the depth of feeling on the part of the people and 
helps to launch a national crusade he said 
the measure also eliminated the legislatures pension program 
and cut its operating budget about 40 percent 
californians defeated another measure backed by consumer 
advocate ralph nader and common cause to limit statewide officers 
to eight consecutive years and allow legislators only 12 
consecutive years in each house 
the colorado measure the biggest votegetter on the state 
ballot imposed a limit of eight consecutive years for holding a 
single state office 
it applies to the governor lieutenant governor secretary of 
state treasurer attorney general and seats in the state 
legislature 
it also would limit members of the us senate and house to 12 
years in office but such state limits on federal offices may be 
vulnerable to a constitutional challenge 
the measure won support from 71 percent of voters 
the vote signaled that voters support sweeping reform said 
state sen terry considine the driving force behind amendment 5 
on amendment 5 it came as no surprise to me there was such an 
overwhelming number supporting it he said colorado has set an 
example that will be imitated all across our country people from 
30 states worked with me on this and i think we can get reforms in 
congress 
kansas city residents limited city council members and the mayor 
to two consecutive fouryear terms council members can run again 
after sitting out a term 
the measure which passed 36596 to 31379 prevents nine of the 
current 13 council members from seeking reelection in the spring 
eight years is enough said henry e lyons a real estate 
developer who was behind the move to get the proposal on the 
ballot 
apart from tuesdays contests efforts are under way to limit 
terms of office in florida illinois new york and ohio several 
states are also considering constitutional amendments to limit

loser was twoterm republican rudy boschwitz of minnesota 
with 88 percent of precincts reporting boschwitz lost to 
college professor paul wellstone a political neophyte by a 5248 
margin 
wellstones victory boosted democrats majority in the senate to 
5644 a oneseat gain from the 101st congress 
i think the main thing was that people are kind of angry at 
washington dont feel represented and want to see some real 
change wellstone said today on nbc we focused on issues and 
people and it captured the imagination of people in minnesota 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said democrats 
success tuesday means that the republican chances of taking 
control in 1992 are much diminished and i think we will retain 
control in 92 
democratic hopes of picking up another seat in north carolina 
were dashed as republican sen jesse helms turned back a tough 
challenge from former charlotte mayor harvey gantt 
meanwhile some democrats touted as possible contenders for 
president bushs job in 1992 shored up their political standing 
with easy wins in tuesdays election 
the lone surprise was new jersey sen bill bradleys slim 
victory over unheralded gop challenger christine todd whitman 
feeling the heat of antigovernment anger prompted by democratic 
gov jim florios 28 billion tax increase bradley managed a 
5248 percent victory

disappeared as appointed democratic sen daniel akaka withstood a 
stiff test from rep pat saiki and won his first full term 
wellstone a liberal activist who traversed minnesota on a green

term

senator from minnesota to washington dc wellstone told his 
backers tuesday evening before he was declared the winner 
boschwitz who hoped to receive a boost when bush visited the 
state to campaign for him told supporters he did not expect the 
race to be so close 
bradley one of 14 democratic incumbents who retained their 
senate seats expressed similar disbelief 
what can i say its been a few years since i was in a double 
overtime said the former princeton university and new york 
knicks basketball star 
republicans contend that bradleys narrow victory could hurt his 
presidential aspirations 
senator bradley might be off the charts now said charles 
black the communications director for the republican national 
committee 
democrats however said the final outcome was merely a 
reflection of the electorates discontent and will have no bearing 
on a possible bid for the white house 
the major democratic target was helms the 69yearold champion 
of the right wing who was pitted against gantt 
helms who had contended in the closing days that gantt favored 
racial quotas relished his victory 
there is no joy in mudville tonight the senator said the

japanese officials today heatedly denied any link 
between iraqs release of more than 70 japanese hostages and the 
tokyo governments decision to drop its proposal to send troops 
overseas 
seventyfour japanese nationals flew to freedom today with 
japans former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone who secured their 
relase during a fiveday mission to iraq 
the iraqis had announced that 77 japanese were free to go but 
japanese embassy officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said three of them decided to stay in baghdad to finish their 
businesss 
the embassy officials denied that the iraqis had refused to give 
exit visas to some of the japanese 
the iraqis did not change their mind the three businessmen 
did said one of the officials 
the departure of the 74 freed hostages leaves 237 japanese in 
iraq and occupied kuwait of whom 119 are held at strategic sites 
as human shields 
in tokyo chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto told reporters 
it is unthinkable that there was any linkage between the 
release and other issues 
america britain and the european community have taken the 
position that they will not directly negotiate over the hostages 
and our government has followed the same basic position sakamoto 
said 
but some analysts feared the timing of the two events would 
create the impression that japan had succumbed to saddam husseins 
apparent strategy to divide the international alliance against 
iraq 
they also worried that prime minister toshiki kaifus 
embarrassing setback in parliament over the troop bill has further 
undermined his weak administration particularly since he was shown 
up the same day by a powerful former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone 
the iraqi news agency reported that nakasone had assured saddam 
in a meeting sunday that the troop deployment proposal was unlikely 
to succeed 
on tuesday iraq announced its hostagereleasing plan on the 
same day kaifu and the governing liberal democratic party 
abandoned the troop deployment proposal which faltered against 
powerful opposition in parliament and strong public opinion that it 
violated japans constitutional ban on using force overseas 
the bill which would have sent up to 2000 troops to the 
persian gulf in a noncombat role was also harshly criticized in 
recent weeks by other asian countries fearful of a resurgence of 
japanese militarism 
japan has already pledged 4 billion in aid for the 
multinational deployment and for refugees of the crisis 
japanese government officials could not confirm today whether 
nakasone had made any assurances to saddam they said nakasones 
mission was unofficial 
but sakamoto said today that nakasone pledged before his 
departure that he would demand the unconditional release of 
japanese and all other hostages 
nonetheless analysts said the timing of nakasones visit was 
unfortunate it underscored the perception that japans persian 
gulf policy never firm was disintegrating in the hands of a weak 
prime minister upstaged by party elders 
even if this release was not related to the abandonment of the 
bill in the diet parliament i would say criticism of mr 
nakasone would be likely to come from washington and other 
western countries said masashi nishihara a politics expert at the 
defense academy 
the bill was criticized by many japanese as a cavein to us 
pressure to participate in the gulf 
my concern is the lack of power of mr kaifu said 
nishihara by inviting nakasone to visit iraq seemed to think 
that kaifu is just no good and nakasone would do a better job 
kaifu visited the gulf region early last month but was unable to 
obtain any solid results japan imports 70 percent of its oil from 
the gulf

qichen to tell saddam hussein that us forces would attack if he

region to cement support for the antiiraq forces and to discuss 
military options 
in its report rtl plus said of the reported ultimatum within 
14 days iraq must pull out of kuwait if not the united states

a proposal to strip arkansas 
constitution of a relic from its racist past appeared to have won 
voter approval barely 
amendment 3 to repeal a 1956 antidesegregation statute held a 
51to49 percent margin in unofficial returns from tuesdays 
voting 
with 2580 of 2696 precincts reporting the amendment was 
leading 262679 or 51 percent to 250946 or 49 percent 
the 1956 law instructed state officials to take appropriate 
action and pass laws opposing in every constitutional manner the 
unconstitutional desegregation decisions of may 17 1954 and may 
31 1955 of the united states supreme court 
it was enacted the year before federal troops thwarted gov 
orval faubus attempt to keep nine black students from enrolling at 
allwhite little rock central high 
state officials have ignored the statute and last year it was 
declared unconstitutional but a federal district court mentioned 
it in orders that assigned the state liability for desegregating 
the pulaski county schools 
state leaders had said arkansas surely would face national 
ridicule if the proposal failed 
it would be a tremendous embarrassment if we dont vote this 
thing out we need to clean up the constitution for our children 
said rep ben mcgee the first black legislator from eastern 
arkansas since reconstruction

maine voters reelected republican gov 
john r mckernan in a tight race that pushed democratic us rep 
joseph e brennan from elective office for the first time in more 
than a decade 
a referendum on a plan to repeal maines blue laws and allow 
large stores and supermarkets to do business on sundays throughout 
the year appeared to be passing but was too close to call early 
today 
republican us sen william cohen won a third term handily 
defeating state rep neil rolde a democrat with 94 percent of the 
precincts cohen had 294663 votes or 61 percent to roldes 
185189 or 39 percent 
state sen thomas andrews of portland was elected to fill the 
1st congressional district seat being vacated by brennan gop rep 
olympia j snowe who is married to mckernan clung to a slender 
lead over her democratic challenger state rep patrick mcgowan 
with 96 percent of precincts reporting snowe had 112494 votes 
to mcgowans 107663 a 51to49 percent margin 
the outcome of the threeway gubernatorial race remained in 
doubt until shortly before daybreak today although mckernan had 
expressed increasing confidence through the night that he had won a 
second fouryear term 
returns from 94 percent of the precincts showed mckernan with 
225238 votes or 47 percent and brennan with 211677 or 44 
percent independent candidate andrew adam maintained a 9 percent 
margin 
brennan served two fouryear terms as governor stepping down in 
1987 because of a constitutional provision that barred him from a 
third successive term in the 1986 election he traded jobs with 
mckernan who had held southern maines 1st congressional district 
seat for two terms 
with 82 percent of the precincts reporting in the sunday sales 
referendum the prorepeal forces were leading by a 53 percent to

republican dan coats won election to dan 
quayles old us senate seat but indiana democrats pronounced 
their party alive and well after winning several other key races 
coats appointed to the senate after quayle was elected vice 
president won the right tuesday to serve the final two years of 
quayles term by defeating democrat baron hill 
in other races however democrats held their seven us house 
seats and took one of three away from the republicans democrat 
joseph hogsett also defeated republican william h hudnut for 
secretary of state in a hotly contested battle that may have an 
influence on the states 1992 gubernatorial race 
hogsett had 702746 votes or 52 percent to hudnuts 662022 
or 48 percent with about 92 percent of the vote counted early 
today 
hudnut a fourterm mayor of indianapolis was widely expected 
to run for governor in 1992 if he had won tuesdays election 
i think its an important victory because what it firmly 
establishes is there is a healthy competitive twoparty system in 
indiana said hogsett a protege of democratic gov evan bayh 
in the senate race republican coats a fourterm congressman 
had 790872 votes 54 percent to 682131 46 percent for state 
rep hill with 99 percent of the vote counted

john hiler 51 percent to 49 percent in the 3rd district 
congressional race with all votes counted roemer had 80422 
votes to hilers 77616 
republicans blamed the losses on low voter turnout 
we are disappointed with the republican turnout there may be 
a number of factors for this including the budget debate in 
washington said state republican chairman keith luse

republican bob smith says hes just a 
common man who will push conservative issues as a us senator 
such as maintaining the defense budget and supporting the star 
wars program 
smith made fiscal conservatism the overriding theme of his 
campaign to replace retiring republican sen gordon humphrey 
he voted against the recent federal budget compromise because it 
contained tax increases which he said could be avoided despite 
that president bush campaigned in new hampshire for smith who 
stayed in washington because of house votes 
smith says one of his greatest accomplishments in three terms in 
the house was his leadership last year in defeating the 50 percent 
congressional pay raise a claim derided by his democratic 
opponent former us sen john durkin 
im a common man representing common people with common goals 
and values and a whole lot of common sense and im real proud of 
that says smith 49 
born in trenton nj smith lives in tuftonboro a veteran who 
served on a navy supply ship during the vietnam war smith was a 
high school history teacher and real estate agent before being 
elected to congress in 1984 
he consistently supports defense spending including for the 
strategic defense initiative or star wars program and says 
any defense spending cuts due to improved relationships with 
unfriendly countries should be gradual 
smith opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother 
but says he would support an exception for rape and incest if it 
meant enactment of federal antiabortion legislation 
he easily won the gop senate nomination in september over a 
prochoice opponent he opposes the equal rights amendment and 
favors the death penalty for violent criminals 
smith served on the house armed services and veterans affairs 
committees 
he and his wife mary jo have three children

a marcher in todays revolution day parade fired 
two shots into the air in red square about 80 yards from where 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet leaders were 
standing reports said 
no one appeared to have been hit by the shots and the man was 
immediately arrested said sergei vozianov a correspondent of the 
official news agencys video branch who witnessed the incident 
he said by telephone that he could not determine whether the 
gunman fired at the lenin mausoleum from which gorbachev and the 
other leaders were watching thousands of marchers 
the tass news wire quoted kgb officials as saying the man fired 
into the air with a sawedoff shotgun and that no one was hurt it 
said the gunman was from leningrad but gave no further details 
but moscow kgb spokesman andrei oligov said the 38yearold 
suspect fired a doublebarreled hunting rifle that was shortened to 
be more easily concealed the weapon is readily available on the 
thriving soviet black market and is often used by soviet 
criminals 
oligov said the suspect whose name was not immediately 
released was questioned by authorities 
vozianov said the shots were fired about five seconds apart and 
that he was standing 10 yards from the gunman 
the shooting occurred five minutes after gorbachev russian 
president boris yeltsin and other officials returned to the 
mausoleum after talking with some demonstrators in another part of 
the square journalists standing near the mausoleum heard the shots 
over the sound of music playing through loudspeakers 
vozianov said about a dozen auxiliary police and kgb 
plainclothes agents immediately grabbed the gunman knocked the 
shotgun to the ground and carried the man into the huge gum 
department store which is opposite the mausoleum 
a videotape of the incident recorded by the tass video service 
showed a plainclothes agent picking the gun off the gray 
cobblestones and putting it in his overcoat 
the tv correspondent said the man was marching as part of a 
delegation from the bauman region of moscow that marched through 
red square as part of the procommunist demonstration but oligov 
said the suspect is not a communist party member he said 
the man wore brown shoes a blue coat and carried a plastic bag 
vozianov said 
the incident occurred on the soviet unions most important 
holiday which celebrates the 73rd anniversary of the bolshevik 
revolution 
thousands of anticommunist demonstrators filled moscow streets 
which were already packed with communist supporters

its getting lonelier at the top where 
president bush has seen his house veto margin shaken in offyear 
elections that also turned down republican governors in two of the 
states he campaigned hardest to hold 
bush waged the most extensive midterm campaign of any president 
a yearlong effort that included 115 stops for republicans and 
helped them raise more than 80 million but he didnt have much to 
show for it 
republican sen pete wilson won the biggest of the offyear 
prizes governor of california that job is vital to republicans 
who a decade ago watched helplessly as democrats carved up 
congressional districts to their advantage with a democratic 
legislature only a gop governor could block a replay this time 
for a house delegation growing to 52 seats 
but democrats will succeed republican governors in florida 
which is gaining four seats in the reapportioned house and texas 
which picks up three bush made three campaign stops for gov bob 
martinez in florida and he spent the last three days in his texas 
home base stumping for clayton williams the republican 
gubernatorial nominee who lost to democrat ann richards 
richards the state treasurer was the 1988 democratic 
convention speaker who had taunted bush as a man born with a 
silver foot in his mouth 
offsetting these sun belt setbacks republicans gained governors 
in ohio and in massachusetts and held on to illinois those states 
too will draw new house districts next year because of population 
shifts that cost them seats 
for all the poll findings of voter frustration and 
disenchantment incumbent members of the congress proved again to 
be almost impervious to challenge more than 95 percent of them 
were returned to congress 
charles black spokesman for the republican national committee 
said he saw more of an antiincumbent trend than a partisan trend 
an anticongress trend rather than an antipresidential 
trend 
it all added up to a likely democratic majority of 267167 in 
the house not counting socialist bernie sanders of vermont in the 
senate democrats gained one seat as college professor paul 
wellstone ousted incumbent republican rudy boschwitz 
those numbers are well below the average midterm losses of the 
white house party but its the mirror image of a 1988 presidential 
election in which the gop lost congressional strength while the 
bush ticket was winning 
and even marginal losses could jeopardize bushs ability to 
withstand the twothirds votes it takes to override a presidential 
veto a tool he has used 16 times so far 
george bush cannot win the congress and must no longer rule by 
veto said rep richard a gephardt dmo the house majority 
leader 
other democrats turned instantly toward the next election with 
the white house at stake we have an opportunity to do what was 
inconceivable six months ago that is to defeat a republican 
president said gov richard f celeste of ohio chairman of the 
democratic governors association 
if the election for president were tonight george bush would 
lose claimed ronald h brown the democratic national chairman 
but edward j rollins who manages the republican congressional 
campaign committee and drew white house wrath by advising gop 
candidates that they shouldnt hesitate to oppose bush on tax 
increases said he now thinks the president is doing fine 
democratic leaders who rank among the likely prospects to run 
against him in 1992 were reelected on tuesday among them are new 
york gov mario cuomo georgia sen sam nunn and tennessee sen 
albert gore who won in landslides and sen bill bradley of new 
jersey who didnt 
bradley got a surprising challenge from a republican woman whose 
chances against the twoterm democrat had seemed slim to none she 
got little party support financing was scanty and she made the 
tightest of races out of it before bradley edged by with 52 percent 
of the vote his showing apparently dragged down by an unpopular 
democratic state tax increase 
the senator who came to politics from professional basketball 
said its been a few years since i was in double overtime

voter turnout in tuesdays elections appears 
close to that of 1986 the lowest in nearly a halfcentury voting 
analyst curtis gans said today 
in the 1986 midterm election 364 percent of eligible voters 
went to the polls the fewest since 1942 
if there are 3 million votes yet to be counted it will be 
slightly under 1986 if there are 4 million more it will be a 
little over gans said 
democrats stayed about the same in turnout republicans 
declined by very little and there was an increase in voting for 
third parties and others said gans director of the nonpartisan 
committee for the study of the american electorate 
the vote for independents was boosted by the election of 
independent governors in alaska and connecticut and an independent 
house member in vermont 
while voting totals were still incomplete gans said he expected 
the final result to show slight increases in turnout in 23 states 
and slight declines in 23 others

japan will continue as the no 1 foreign 
customer of american farmers at least through the turn of the 
century maintaining its lead over the european community 
according to agriculture department trade analysts 
in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 japan once again topped 
foreign buyers of us agricultural products at an estimated 83 
billion compared with the ecs imports of 7 billion 
emiko miyasaka of the departments foreign agricultural service 
said she expects japan to maintain its lead over the 12nation ec 
at least in the 1990s 
miyasaka said tuesday in a telephone interview that japans top 
ranking as a foreign buyer of agricultural products appears solid 
through the turn of the century despite the ecs plan to unify 
economically by the end of 1992 
beyond the 1990s however she said the situation is too 
uncertain for predictions at this time 
miyasaka was asked to elaborate on a report by her agency last 
week which said japan is likely to be among the strongest export 
growth markets for us farmers 
this optimism is based on the expectation that japans 
economic growth while slowing is expected to be the strongest of 
all industrialized countries fueling consumer demand the report 
said 
further there has been some liberalization of japans 
agricultural imports through the current uruguay round of 
negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
since 1964 when it emerged as asias first billiondollar 
market for us farm products japan has steadily expanded its 
agricultural imports the report said 
japan moved in front of the ec as the top us farm market in 
1988 
bulk commodities such as corn soybeans wheat cotton tobacco 
and logs are the bigticket items but miyasaka and other analysts 
believe there are greater market opportunities for highvalue 
products like beef vegetables citrus fruit fruit juices and 
processed wood products 
in 1988 the usjapan beef agreement opened the door to 
growing sales of beef from a value of 556 million in 1987 to 1 
billion last year 
us exports of fresh frozen and prepared vegetables rose to 
253 million by 1989 the report said sales of french fries for 
example rose to 79 million from 37 million in 1983 
a thorn in this trade development has been japans rice policy 
which effectively bars imports part of a national policy to 
protect domestic growers the united states has called on japan 
during the gatt negotiations to ease the restrictions 
miyasaka noted that the us position on japanese rice is part 
of an overall bid under gatt to reduce trade restrictions all over 
the world 
in any case she said whatever japan does about its rice policy 
will not keep that country from continuing as the leading foreign 
market for american farmers 
 
washington ap a plan calling for modest cuts in farm 
payments has been approved by the european community but us farm 
organizations are watching closely to see what happens when it goes 
before international negotiators 
its a step said dave lane of the american farm bureau 
federations washington dc office but itll still probably 
go right down to the wire 
the uruguay round of negotiations under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade is scheduled to conclude dec 31 in geneva 
late tuesday in brussels belgium the 12nation ec endorsed a 
carefully worded proposal that sought to soothe fears of 
governments that their farmers would be hurt by reductions 
at issue was a proposal to pare farm subsidies by 30 percent 
over 10 years starting in 1986 some reductions have already been 
made 
the ec proposal which had been due oct 15 will be submitted 
to the trade talks as the communitys opening position in the final 
round of bargaining 
meanwhile a coalition of 29 us farm organizations and 
commodity groups on tuesday released a letter to us trade 
representative carla hills and agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter declaring that no gatt agreement on agricultural trade 
would be preferable to one that papers over fundamental 
differences with the c 
the american farm groups have bitterly attacked the ecs system 
of export subsidies and certain other practices that bear on world 
agricultural trade 
as the deadline approaches without any encouraging sign from 
the ec that problems dealing with market access export subsidies 
and health and sanitary issues are truly negotiable we are 
becoming increasingly concerned that a final agricultural package 
may be fabricated to once again paper over our differences the 
groups said 
the american farm bureau federation and the national grange were 
joined by 27 commodity and agricultural trade associations 
representing a wide variety of products including meat soybeans 
nuts avocados raisins peaches cattle corn pork turkeys 
wheat and fresh fruit and vegetables 
 
washington ap milk production has been rising this year and 
so has the output of some major dairy products according to a 
monthly report by the agriculture department 
in september butter production was estimated at 848 million 
pounds up 4 percent from a year earlier total cheese output 
excluding cottage cheese was reported tuesday at 477 million 
pounds up 6 percent 
nonfat dry milk for human food was reported at 506 million 
pounds in september up 13 percent from a year earlier 
but ice cream production at 629 million gallons was down 1 
percent from september 1989 the report said

in 1983 norton received 59 percent of the vote compared with 30 
percent for singleton 
district voters also narrowly rejected 5149 percent a 
referendum that would have restored a sweeping law that required 
the city to provide overnight shelter to anyone who requested it 
the city council scrapped the law earlier this year amid cost 
concerns 
but the day belonged to democrat dixon who captured 87 percent 
of the vote to 11 percent for her republican opponent former 
police chief maurice turner she becomes the first black woman to 
lead a major american city 
the people of the district of columbia have sent a message 
clearly unequivocally and almost universally dixon told 
cheering supporters they have said it is time to clean house 
dixon also said she would seek barrys help in calling for the 
resignations of all city employees he appointed 
if he barry wont cooperate in that regard then i am 
going to urge the city council to forge a partnership that allows 
us to do what the people of the district of columbia clearly 
want dixon said they want us to get rid of the waste they 
want new blood they want a government that responds and works 
again 
dixon was swept to victory with her pledge to root out 
corruption and waste within the city government her chief promise 
has been to cut 2000 middlelevel managers from the city payroll 
a move she estimates will save 95 million 
jackson won an 11candidate shadow senate race with 44 
percent of the vote 
many observers saw a clear link between dixons triumph and the 
defeat of barry who had been the dominant force in local politics 
since he was first elected mayor in 1978 he was convicted of 
cocaine possession last summer 
one jury rendered a partial verdict in august but today the 
jury of the voters issued their verdict and issued a resounding no 
to marion barry said julius hobson a civic activist and former 
barry aide this city is tired of him and is ready for something 
new 
barry failed in his bid to win a citywide council seat despite 
his claim to have rebounded from the personal woes that led to his 
drug conviction and sentencing to a sixmonth prison term 
barry running as an independent finished third with 19 percent 
of the vote behind democratic nominee linda cropp who had 39 
percent and the incumbent statehood party nominee hilda mason 
who won 30 percent 
i said that it was an uphill battle a subdued barry said 
after conceding his loss i said it would be a miracle if i had 
won

oregonians bucked an election day trend 
and approved a property tax limit out of frustration over a state 
political system that is paralyzed a leading backer of the 
measure says 
people are realizing the political system is paralyzed don 
mcintire said tuesday night they state leaders just cant deal 
with this subject responsibly 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting measure 5 had garnered 
523593 votes or 52 percent to 481961 no votes or 48 
percent 
propositions aimed at slashing taxes or spending were also on 
ballots in massachusetts california nebraska utah montana and 
colorado all were defeated 
the amendment would phase in a 15 percent property tax ceiling 
over five years instead of imposing it from the start it would 
require the legislature to replace whatever money would be lost to 
schools from the property tax cuts 
the legislative revenue office predicted the measure would cause 
property taxes to drop an average of 12 percent in the first year 
and 45 percent by 1995 when the phasedin reduction was complete 
measures to limit property taxes have been on every oregon 
statewide general election ballot except one since 1978 voters 
defeated all of the earlier plans 
this time mcintire said oregonians sent a message to their 
state politicians that they no longer believed promises that the 
issue would be addressed 
john marshall of the oregon school boards association which 
opposed measure 5 warned that school programs were facing major 
amputation as a result of measure 5 
sponsors said the plan would protect the school system by giving 
lawmakers plenty of time to come up with money to replace the 
property taxes 
opponents including most of the education establishment said 
requiring the legislature to replace the money as the tax ceiling 
declines would impose huge burdens on the state treasury 
the good news as far as most oregon educators was concerned 
was that voters rejected another ballot measure that would have 
granted 2500 tax credits to allow parents to choose any school 
they liked public private or even churchrelated 
the legislative revenue office estimated the states cost for 
replacing the money lost to schools would be 791 million in the 
199193 budget period and rise to almost 32 billion in 199597 
the school cost replacement money would consume almost half the 
entire state general fund by the 199597 budget period according 
to the estimate

republican john engler ousted michigan gov james 
blanchard by a razorthin margin today ruining the democratic 
incumbents quest for a third term 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting engler had squeaked 
past blanchard 1253469 votes to 1240535 a margin of only 
12934 votes 
blanchard campaign spokeswoman katie wolf said early today that 
a recount was likely 
a beaming engler told cheering supporters and his staff this 
morning i know weve won this wake me up when you know the 
margin 
engler is the first michigan challenger to unseat an incumbent 
governor since republican george romney ousted democrat john 
swainson in 1962 
in the senate race with 99 percent of the precincts reporting 
democratic incumbent carl levin had 1450319 or 58 percent his 
challenger bill schuette had 1036169 votes or 42 percent 
schuette blamed the outcome in part on the nationwide slump in 
republican popularity following the october wrestling over the 
federal budget in congress democrats who held a 6050 edge in the 
michigan house going into the race picked up one seat unofficial 
returns showed 
blanchards campaign was plagued by missteps one of his 
television commercials was criticized as racist he was criticized 
for dumping his 78yearold lieutenant governor martha griffiths 
and his exwife wrote a book accusing blanchard of having an 
extramarital affair with the woman who is now his second wife 
early figures showed the republicans keeping their narrow 2018 
edge in the state senate the democrats kept their 117 edge in the

democrats today celebrated their gains in congress and the 
takeover of governors offices in highgrowth sunbelt states they 
swiftly proclaimed the midterm election results a vote of no 
confidence in president george bush 
republicans countered with the biggest prize of all as pete 
wilson kept the california governorship in gop hands the gop also 
made inroads in the northeast and industrial midwest electing 
governors in michigan ohio and massachusetts 
in an election framed by fear of recession and war by 
unhappiness with taxes and politicians governors of both parties 
took a beating that wasnt true in the house and senate where 
most incumbents won and where the 102nd congress will look a lot 
like the late unlamented 101st 
weve got a lot to smile about said democratic national 
chairman ron brown as he surveyed the midterm returns on cbs 
this morning he mentioned takeaway wins for governorships in 
florida and texas and said bush campaigned heavily for 18 
candidates and 14 of them lost 
bush spent the morning in the oval office and offered no 
comment 
but the republicans chief spokesman charles black said the 
gop had bested the trend for midterm losses and insisted its a 
good day for the president 
of the 32 senators who sought reelection 31 won easily only 
republican sen rudy boschwitz lost to liberal college professor 
paul wellstone in the house the reelection rate for incumbents 
was 96 percent 
with several house races still to be decided the likely outcome 
would give the democrats a 268167 majority a gain of nine seats 
including vermont socialist bernard sanders whos expected to side 
with the democrats 
the three fastest growing states california florida and texas 
entered the election with republican governors the democrats 
captured florida and texas while the republicans held on to 
california illinois and led the way into the postdukakis era in 
massachusetts 
as usual some races were too close to call even hours after the 
polls closed 
john engler brightened the morning after election day for 
republicans when he won the michigan governors race ousting 
democratic incumbent james blanchard 
that left three gubernatorial races undecided minnesota 
arizona and nebraska 
a halfdozen house seats were unsettled as well and in three 
of them democratic incumbents were trailing 
lawton chiles of florida and texas state treasurer ann richards 
led the democratic assault on statehouses crucial to next years 
redrawing of political maps to follow population shifts to the 
sunbelt 
wilson won the multimilliondollar battle with democrat dianne 
feinstein for californias top job with 98 percent of the vote 
counted wilson had 49 percent of the total to feinsteins 46 
percent 
republicans picked up some statehouse of their own electing 
governors in ohio where george voinovich defeated anthony 
celebrezze in massachusetts where william weld edged out 
conservative democrat john silber vermont where exgovernor 
richard snelling reclaimed his old job defeating peter welch 
but democratic gains were more widespread joan finney rode 
voter anger against gop gov mike hayden to victory in kansas and 
businessman bruce sundlun unseated republican gov edward diprete 
in rhode island on his third try democrats won formerly republican 
statehouses in oklahoma and new mexico 
former republican sen lowell weicker always a maverick was 
elected governor of connecticut as an independent in alaska 
former gop governor walter hickel was running as an independent and 
leading two opponents for the governorship 
the democraticdominated senate emerged unscathed challenges 
once thought formidable were swept aside by wellfinanced 
incumbents 
but the night had its terrifying moments for sen bill bradley 
dnj whose anticipated easy ride to a third term ended up a 
cliffhanger before he outlasted rookie republican christine todd 
whitman she capitalized on virulent antitax sentiment 
generally it was not a good night for democrats with 
presidential ambitions 
along with bradleys scare gov mario cuomo of new york 
received a disappointing 53 percent of the vote against a 
blundering republican and a little known conservative who were 
never seen as more than fighting for second place 
two other wouldbe presidents democratic sens albert gore jr 
of tennessee and joseph biden of delaware rolled over token 
opposition sen sam nunn of georgia was reelected without 
opposition 
winning more easily than expected were republican sens jesse 
helms of north carolina mark hatfield of oregon mitch mcconnell 
of kentucky democrats daniel akaka of hawaii paul simon of 
illinois claiborne pell of rhode island james exon of nebraska 
carl levin of michigan and john kerry of massachusetts 
in minnesota boschwitz spent more than 7 million more than 
seven times wellstones budget 
house gop whip newt gingrich also had a scare the outspoken 
georgia conservative who abandoned bush when the president was 
seeking support for a budget compromise that increased taxes 
narrowly edged democrat david worley 
if the election for president were tonight george bush would 
lose said the dncs brown more than anything else this 
election has been a vote of no confidence in bush 
this is not a referendum on george bush countered gop 
strategist edward j rollins he runs for reelection in 1992 
the results did nothing to strengthen bush for 1992 during the 
campaign the president made 115 stops for republicans and white 
house aides said his appearances raised 80 million 
particularly devastating to bush was the loss in his adopted 
home state of texas where millionaire oilman clayton williams lost 
the governorship after spending 8 million of his own money 
floridas results also hurt bush who campaigned three times for 
gov bob martinez to no avail 
the gops black filling in for ailing gop national chairman lee 
atwater black who sought to minimize the damage called the 
results an anticongress trend rather than an antipresident 
trend 
we beat the historical averages in house races senate races 
and governorships by taking very minimal losses in yesterdays 
election black said so its a good day for the president 
in all eight states will gain and 13 will lose seats when house 
districts are reapportioned to reflect population shifts enumerated 
in the 1990 census democrats will control the process outright 
holding the governors office and both legislative chambers in at 
least five of the states gaining house seats 
the biggest winner will be california gaining seven house 
seats florida will pick up four and texas three 
the only state where the gop gained a redistricting monopoly was 
vermont where it wont matter vermont has only one house seat and 
that seat was captured by sanders who defeated republican 
congressman peter smith 
a record number of women sought office this year but with mixed 
results 
richards and finney were elected goverors and whitman ran far 
stronger than even she could have dreamed but challenges to 
democratic senators by congresswomen lynn martin of illinois 
claudine schneider of rhode island and pat saiki of hawaii failed 
to live up to expectations 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan was an easy winner and the senate 
remains 98 men and two women all three congresswomen who sought 
senate seats were replaced in the house by men 
the highest profile black candidate was harvey gantt the 
democrat who challenged helms in north carolina gantt ran ahead in 
the polls but on election day helms swept to victory 
the number of blacks in the house increased by two to 25 
william jefferson was elected to the seat formerly held by rep 
lindy boggs dla and gary franks of connecticut will become the 
first black republican in the house since 1935 
in the district of columbia sharon pratt dixon won the race to 
succeed marion barry as mayor barry recently sentenced to six 
months in jail on a cocaine possession charge failed in his bid 
for election to the city council as an independent 
voters in california colorado and kansas city mo approved

when it comes to beating incumbents 
governorelect john engler wrote the book or at least the term 
paper 
the 42yearold republican launched his political career in 1970 
by beating an incumbent state house member after writing a college 
term paper on the subject while a student at michigan state 
university 
engler defeated an incumbent state senator in 1978 but the 
biggest coup came in tuesdays nipandtuck governors race when he 
ousted twoterm democrat james blanchard 
englers victory returned the governors office to gop hands for 
the first time since 1982 and marked the first time an incumbent 
governor had been bounced out of office since 1962 
englers mother who appeared in campaign ads said she thought 
he might be headed for higher office i was always telling 
everybody when he was 2 years old hes going to run for 
president said agnes engler 
engler grew up on the familys cattle farm near beal city where 
hard work was a way of life for the seven children when he wasnt 
working he was reading or trying to get elected to a leadership 
post at school or in future farmers of america 
engler was active in dorm government at michigan state where he 
graduated in 1970 fighting to have guests of the opposite sex 
visit was a major goal he said recalling how he invented a 
curtain to hang in doorways to skirt the university rule requiring 
open doors 
he was married to colleen house in 1975 and divorced in 1987 
they had no children engler became senate majority leader in 1984 
he works the guy will work and work and work said 
republican sen richard posthumus 
engler was a strong majority leader who was able to keep senate 
republicans voting together but often was an obstructionist said 
sen mitch irwin a democrat john changes his mind and looks for 
every technical way to adjust and sneak out of a deal and go back 
on his word 
what that really means engler said is that he is a strong 
negotiator id say weve been aggressive and have pursued an 
agenda we have been innovative and novel in developing approaches 
to legislation

democrats bolstered their huge redistricting 
advantage by adding two big prizes florida and texas to the 
list of states where they hold a lock on redrawing political lines 
for the next decade 
besides taking the governorships in those two states 
considered key because together they stand to gain seven us house 
seats democrats added rhode island oklahoma and new mexico to 
their remapping monopolies on tuesday 
republicans won a crucial redistricting battle by taking the 
california governors race the gop needed it to keep a role in 
drawing lines for the seven new house seats california is expected 
to gain because democrats easily retained control of the 
legislature 
the gop also scored victories by winning the ohio and illinois 
governorships but democrats clearly will have the national edge on 
the process of reapportioning the 19 house seats that will change 
hands due to population shifts of the 1980s 
advantages won tuesday should help cement democrats as the house 
majority party for at least another decade democrats also said the 
florida and texas wins would boost their 1992 presidential hopes 
we feel better about the prospects of fair districts when the 
pen is in democratic hands said paul tully political director 
for the democratic national committee 
these are not only net victories but victories in places that 
because of their population growth will grow more important to the 
future of this country and also to the presidential race tully 
said 
according to preliminary census bureau figures eight states 
will gain and 13 will lose seats when house districts are 
reapportioned next year democrats will control the process 
outright in at least five of the states gaining house seats 
despite the antiincumbent mood thought to be sweeping the 
country voters appeared unwilling to turn out their state 
legislators millions of dollars were spent on legislative races 
this year due to their importance in the redistricting picture but 
few chambers changed hands 
the gop turned back democratic efforts to take over the senates 
of new york pennsylvania and ohio redistricting power will be 
shared in all three states which will lose house seats in 1992 
this proves the republican party is alive and well despite the 
doom and gloom predicted said new yorks state senate republican 
leader ralph marino 
democrats fended off republican efforts to take over the state 
senates in illinois and florida and the lower chamber in 
pennsylvania the gop was trying to wrest control of the oregon 
house from democrats too 
arizonas gubernatorial race was up for grabs as the lead 
seesawed throughout election night 
meanwhile the gop lost the indiana house but republicans kept 
control of the state senate democrats captured control of the 
state senate in arizona a democratic effort to gain control of the 
washington state senate hinged on absentee ballots in two 
neckandneck races 
in michigan republicans kept control of the state senate 
by losing in the governorships in texas and florida the gop 
lost its say in how political maps will be drawn for those ne 
house seats 
similar gubernatorial wins in rhode island oklahoma and new 
mexico gave democrats absolute control there too the house 
delegations in those states wont change but democrats can aim to 
draw districts that protect their house incumbents and perhaps 
endanger gop lawmakers the political lines for state seats are at 
stake as well 
another victory for democrats came in kansas where they ousted 
a republican governor and gained control of the state house kansas 
will lose one house seat 
election day began with democrats controlling 69 of the nations 
99 legislative chambers and that margin was on track to change 
little 
more than 6100 legislative races were decided across the 
country but the focus of national party organizations was about 50 
races in 10 states in which chambers were held by narrow 
majorities 
the democrats were in position to draw districts that in 1992 
could pad their house majority now at 258175 with two vacancies 
by a dozen seats or more beyoe tuesday 
the other five house seats are expected to go to virginia north 
carolina georgia washington and arizona democrats already had a 
redistricting monopoly in virginia and kept their sole control in 
north carolina and georgia a nonpartisnd the gains madan commission draws 
the map 
in washington 
among the 13 states losing seats new york will suffer the most 
giving up three 
pennsylvania ohio michigan and illinois are to lose two seats 
each losing one will be massachusetts new jersey west virginia 
kentucky louisiana iowa kansas and montana

mayor by about 3589 votes with 99 percent of 104 million votes 
counted 
legislators approved a constitutional amendment require runoffs 
in races in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes 
but no laws are in place to implement a runoff 
officials say it could be next spring before a runoff is 
completed 
an estimated 300 ballots were reported missing from a phoenix 
precinct considered goddard territory and nearly 2000 absentee 
ballots remained to be counted 
almost 7000 votes went to writein candidates including max 
hawkins a former aide to impeached gov evan mecham hawkins 
entered the race after the primary saying he wanted to offer an 
antiabortion alternative 
arizonas four gop and one democratic congressmen won by margins 
of 57 percent and larger 
neither of arizonas two us senators was up for reelection 
and none of the states congressmen faced more than token 
opposition 
secretary of state rose mofford a democrat was elevated to 
fill mechams term but didnt seek one of her own mecham lost out 
in the gop primary 
mofford will likely remain in office until a runoff is held or 
the race is otherwise decided 
voters defeated two ballot measures that attempted to create a 
paid holiday honoring martin luther king jr 
one king plan went down by a 31 margin as expected the other 
expected to win narrowly lost by about 11000 votes observers 
attributed the defeat to a report that the national football league 
would move the 1993 super bowl from arizona if the measure failed 
they tried to leverage the public and that just wont work 
said phoenix mayor paul johnson 
other propositions rejected included one to boost the pay of 
state legislators by 60 percent to 24000 per year and a 6 
billion 10year boost in education spending 
voters approved an initiative to use 20 million of arizona 
lottery money each year to acquire land for wilderness areas or 
parks they also approved a victims rights plan

a panel of scientists today began 
reviewing utahs national cold fusion institute with a member 
saying their study of the controversial research would be open and 
objective 
as the meeting got under way electrochemist b stanley pons 
who along with british colleague martin fleischmann claims to have 
produced nuclear fusion in roomtemperature experiments ducked 
from television cameras after being spotted sitting on the back 
row 
all the meetings are closed a sign posted outside the door of 
the meeting room stated it is required that only those persons 
who have signed a national cold fusion institute confidentiality 
agreement attend this review 
the panel hired by the state fusion energy advisory council is 
comprised of stanley bruckstein a professor of chemistry at state 
university of new york at buffalo loren g helper a chemist from 
alberta canada dale f stein president of michigan technological 
university and robert adair a professor of physics at yale 
university 
stein who was also a member of the original department of 
energy fusion panel said although that group recommended against 
federal funding for the project he would remain objective 
i was very open and objective as a member of that panel he 
said he said the group would 
fritz will director of the institute said he was pleased with 
the selection of scientists and predicted the review would move 
smoothly 
this is no different from any other scientific review he 
said the only thing that makes this one different is the 
attention of the media because it involves cold fusion 
will said pons was expected also to attend thursdays meeting of 
the state fusion energy advisory council which is reviewing the 
states expenditure of 5 million in cold fusion research 
last year the claim by pons and fleischmann that they had 
created energy through socalled cold fusion created a 
sensation in the scientific world experts had said that it was 
believed the fusion of atoms could be achieved only at extremely 
high temperatures 
but controversy erupted when many other scientists said they 
could not duplicate the utah scientists findings 
the furor erupted anew last month when pons and fleischmann 
failed to appear at a meeting of the fusion council 
the pairs attorney c gary triggs said at the time they were 
reluctant to divulge much information because they were working on 
a new patent application but council chairman raymond hixson noted 
the state held any patents and in any event all council members 
were sworn to secrecy 
fusion which powers the sun and stars creates energy by 
combining or fusing two hydrogen atoms into a heavier helium 
atom by contrast fission which powers conventional nuclear 
plants creates energy by splitting atoms 
fusion long has been sought as a potential source of cheap safe 
and virtually inexhaustible energy

followers of rabbi meir kahane shook their fists 
and vowed revenge at the funeral of the assassinated militant 
leader police stepped up security at arab and israeli diplomatic 
offices and jewish newspapers 
mainstream jewish leaders in new york and israel where the body 
of the 58yearold antiarab extremist was flown for burial today 
appealed for calm 
but the funeral procession in jerusalem turned violent today 
when scores of people broke away from the march to smash shop 
windows and chase arabs down nearby streets kahane supporters 
moved from shop to shop asking owners whether they employed arabs 
before smashing windows 
along the processions route one terrified arab ran down the 
street followed by several kahane loyalists shouting death to 
terrorists near the cemetery an arab was beaten to the ground 
and members of kahanes kach movement tried to block an ambulance 
from arriving 
the alleged assassin remained in serious condition at bellevue 
hospital elsayyid a nosair 34 of cliffside park nj was 
identified as a moslem immigrant from egypt who repaired air 
conditioners for the city of new york 
police said they had not established any links between nosair 
and terrorist groups 
there will be revenge we believe in revenge said sol 
margolis president of kach international the us arm of kahanes 
extremist israeli party as thousands of mourners thronged a 
brooklyn synagogue for his funeral 
we dont buy that crap of turning the other cheek there will 
be hell to pay for this affront he said tuesday 
revenge said several signs written in red hebrew letters 
outside the synagogue 
death to arabs a small contingent shouted 
mourners also took up the cry never again the slogan of 
the jewish defense league formed by the brooklynborn rabbi in 
1968 to take up arms against antisemitism in the united states 
the slogan refers to the holocaust 
police stepped up security at the un missions for israel 
saudi arabia and egypt el al israel airlines offices and several 
jewish newspapers 
dr mt mehdi president of the americanarab relations 
committee said of the threats of reprisals i hope this is just 
hyperbole more rhetoric 
zaheer uddin president of the new york unit of the islamic 
circle of north america condemned the assassination but said it 
should come as no surprise 
he lived by his sword and died by it uddin said we hope 
that mr kahanes assassination will be the last act in the cycle 
of violence and counterviolence 
the israeli government appealed for peace as well and police 
and army reinforcements spread out in israel and the occupied 
territories to head off revenge attacks two arab deaths on tuesday 
were linked to kahanes slaying 
kahane who campaigned to drive all arabs from israel as an 
extreme rightwing member of the jewish states parliament was 
shot from four feet away monday night after addressing a zionist 
group at a manhattan hotel 
nosair was shot in the neck by a postal police officer as he 
fled he was charged with murder and other offenses 
the new york times today quoted an unidentified law enforcement 
official as saying nosair denied shooting kahane when he came out 
of sedation his wallet included an ad from a jewish newspaper for 
monday nights event officials said 
nosair immigrated in 1981 and took us citizenship last year 
authorities said his american wife converted to islam and the 
couple had three children 
a motive has not been established police said 
what we have and all we know is that we have a lone gunman who 
committed a homicide in new york said chief of detectives joseph 
borrelli 
the identification numbers on the murder weapon a 357caliber 
revolver had been filed off making it difficult to trace police 
said 
mainstream jewish leaders many of whom reviled kahane for such 
acts as a fatal firebombing in 1972 that was linked to the jdl 
appealed for restraint 
the bullet that killed rabbi kahane was the opening of what 
might fearfully be a wave of terrorism and collectively we stand 
against it said rabbi max shreier one of a stream of speakers 
at the funeral 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
we dont see this as a time for revenge now is the time for 
restraint 
the guilty person should be tried and punished under our 
laws said rabbi irwin groner president of the rabbinical 
assembly but we urge that no further violence be perpetrated

green bay wis pressgazette on the farm bill 
there is no more bedeviling piece of federal legislation than 
the 1990 farm bill 
it is a complex tangle of economic political social and even 
philosophical issues served up as a housesenate compromise 
covering national agricultural policy for the next five years 
in general the 41 billion bill seems headed in the right 
direction 
first it cuts more than 13 billion in subsidies for 
agricultural products 
second it contains economic scientific and environmental 
strictures designed to reduce federal costs and to do less damage 
to the environment according to those who put the bill together 
 
obviously a bill so complex wont please everyone 
our longterm hope is that us agriculture be weaned off 
federal assistance as soon as possible and to as great an extent as 
possible 
that is no easy task phasing out subsidies and supports has a 
serious impact on every segment of the huge agribusiness industry 
and there is an impact on the nation itself 
food production is part of the nations muscle it can be used 
as a bargaining chip or a weapon 
setting policies that will safeguard production and encourage 
innovation without favoring corporations at the expense of family 
farms is as tough a legislative job as there is 
sen patrick j leahy the vermont democrat who chaired the 
housesenate conference committee that shaped the measure said the 
1990 bill offers farmers greater choices than earlier legislation 
the major choice for many farmers is in deciding whether or not 
to drop out of support programs to take their chances on the 
vagaries of the market 
a package that encourages or even allows such choices seems to 
us an improvement over policies of the past

the telegraph nashua nh on the firing of air force gen 
michael dugan 
george bush sensitive guy that he is has arranged to have air 
force gen michael dugan retired at fourstar rank on jan 1 
specifically so dugan can get a fatter pension after pay raises for 
generals take effect at the start of the new year 
defense secretary dick cheney removed dugan as air force chief 
of staff in september after he divulged military contingency plans 
in the persian gulf 
normally dugan would have been demoted to major general and 
retired on an annual pension of 60000 now his pension will be 
about 77000 per year 
so much for the hard decisions and the tough reprimands 
the senate grumbled but it has okd the deal

the arizona republic phoenix on south africa 
the gestation of what president fw de klerk hails as a new 
south africa may seem interminably long to those impatient for 
progress in the moves to make dramatic changes in that countrys 
social and political structures but it must be remembered that 
neither de klerk nor black activists promised an overnight 
miracle when they began their dialogue the birth of a nation or 
what in this case might be called a rebirth does not occur in a day 
or two 
the peace process which commenced earlier this year with the 
release from prison of african national congress leader nelson 
mandela and the legalization of the anc is following a realistic 
timetable little by little the pillars supporting the 
longstanding platform of white supremacy are being knocked down 
much remains to be done of course one problem is that the 
leaders of the black factions have failed to present a united front 
in talks with the government they expend their energy fighting 
each other instead of working together to find ways to replace 
apartheid with a democratic system given time however tensions 
should ease patience is critical to the birth of a new south 
africa

le figaro paris on us economic and political woes 
at regular intervals specialists of all types announce the 
decline of the american empire this was a theme that surfaced with 
the launching of sputnik during the war of vietnam and the first 
energy crisis each time however the united states succeeded in 
picking itself up 
again today the signs of a minicrisis are multiplying the 
value of the dollar a symbolic thermometer fell under the 
5franc barrier monday the popularity of george bush which 
peaked at the beginning of august has fallen in an impressive 
manner the last three months 
why this sudden worry is it fear of war doubtless the 
progressive awareness of the dangers of open conflict plays its 
role in the present disenchantment however polls show american 
policy remains popular 65 percent of american citizens approve the 
united states engagement in saudi arabia 
thus its the economy and domestic policy american opinion 
begins to recognize that the country is living above its means 
the battle between congress and the president over the budget 
showed citizens the seriousness of the problem reducing the 
federal budget deficit has become a necessary imperative 
all of a sudden american opinion searches its soul it suspects 
politicians of lying a phenomenon we know well its almost the 
same these days on both sides of the atlantic 
nevertheless for george bush the hardest things remain to be 
done first to win the battle of the gulf then to wake up the 
american decisionmakers who appear hypnotized by a cobra of a 
different type japan

the new straits times kuala lumpur malaysia on the persian 
gulf 
us secretary of state james baker is spending this week 
canvassing european and arab allies to determine the circumstances 
under which they will support military action against iraq 
so with a large degree of certainty one can say there will be 
no fighting in the gulf for at least another week 
that is about the only sure thing in the storm simmering in the 
gulf 
oil prices and stock exchanges have been on a wild 
rollercoaster ride in the past three months propelled by rumors 
aggressive bluster peace feelers 
a lot of the hawkish noise from both armed camps has been part 
of a requisite demarcation of entrenched lines and positions 
but three months after iraqs engulfing of kuwait there has 
been little appreciable change in the situation 
for the moment iraq is still adamant about regarding kuwait as 
its newest province but there have been indications that iraq will 
be amenable to negotiations and an agreement which will either 
leave it with territory which will justify the costs of the 
invasion or a guarantee that iraq will not be attacked 
here is the sticking point because the forces arrayed against 
iraq must stick by the basic position an unconditional withdrawal 
before there can be talks about anything else 
the economic sanctions against iraq will hurt but precedents 
have shown that a determined population with belttightening can 
hold out for a long time 
a war will not just involved blood spilled in iraq kuwait and 
saudi arabia but will also possibly spill over into jordan 
israel turkey or syria not to mention the threat of terrorism in 
other parts of the world 
which is why one hopes mediators can still find common ground to 
explore or one side will soften its positions 
if both sides refuse to blink the odds will increase that at 
some point one side will close patience and decided to back up 
talk with muscle

the daily telegraph london on the persian gulf 
after apparent wavering in the determination of both western and 
arab countries to make saddam hussein yield kuwait without 
conditions the american and british governments are rightly 
telling the world that fundamentally nothing has changed 
iraq shows no sign of withdrawing from the emirate whose people 
and culture it continues brutally to suppress it has failed to 
agree to the other basic demand of the international community the 
release of all hostages 
saddam still considers his foreign prisoners useful as a means 
of disturbing and confusing western public opinion 
president bushs exasperation with the iraqi leaders brutality 
and this weeks tour of the middle east and europe by 
secretary of state james baker are timely reminders that 
force remains the most likely indeed almost certainly the only 
means of gaining iraqs compliance with the resolutions of the 
united nations 
no sane person could be enthusiastic about the prospect of a war 
in the middle east but it seems almost impossible to anticipate a 
satisfactory outcome of the gulf crisis without the west making 
good its promise to free kuwait by force of arms since iraq will 
not retreat peacefully

straits times singapore on britain and the european community 
prime minister margaret thatchers attitude has gone beyond 
the realm of cultural idiosyncrasy it has in fact become a 
highly contentious issue the resignation of her deputy sir 
geoffrey howe is yet another indication of how her stand on europe 
could affect her leadership of the conservative party and possibly 
the partys prospects in the next general election 
the tide this time might run against her perhaps as liberal 
democrat leader paddy ashdown says europe will be the anvil on 
which mrs thatchers government will finally be broken 
that would be a pity given what she has done to turn britain 
around by putting british industry and business on its feet again 
and curbing runaway labor unions more than anything else she has 
redefined the common ground in british politics forcing a vast 
array of politicians and pressure groups to show their true colors 
it is an irony that all the good work should today be put in 
jeopardy by an unspoken and inexplicable notion that belonging 
fully to europe means that britain will belong less to itself the 
truth is that only by being a vital part of the new europe can 
britain hope to maintain the standards of living at home and the 
influence abroad which makes the country what it is

nrc handelsblad amsterdam netherlands on the english channel 
tunnel 
the channel tunnel is a tangible proof of the unification of 
europe the decision of british prime minister margaret 
thatcher and french president francois mitterrand in february 
1986 to build a tunnel underneath the channel paired a historic 
vision with the courage to take business risks the tunnel is 
entirely privately financed mostly by japanese banks and for a 
long time it has been unsure if the construction would ever be 
completed because the costs were getting more and more out of hand 
 
the united kingdom may be physically connected with the 
continent in many other aspects mrs thatcher is stubbornly 
hanging on to british isolation 
the connection with the main stream of the european platoon on 
the road to unity threatens to disappear from sight due to this 
anachronistic attitude 
now europe unfortunately still has to switch lanes midway in the 
tunnel

prime minister vp singh lost a vote of 
confidence in parliament today ending 11 months in office troubled 
by increasingly violent religious and political upheavals 
he was defeated by a vote of 346 to 142 according to united 
news of india and press trust of india there were eight 
abstentions 
singh was expected to submit his resignation to president 
ramaswamy venkataraman within hours 
after the vote singhs former allies who turned against him 
approached him on the floor and shook his hand 
the vote came at the end of an 11hour debate in which singh was 
accused of leading the country deeper into class divisions failing 
to control prices and ignoring separatist insurrections in its 
border states 
before the vote singh who claimed he had tried to hold the 
country together appealed to parliament to preserve indias 
secular government 
his chief rival fellow secular politician chandra shekhar 
replied that singh should stop shedding crocodile tears and 
resign to spare the country more bloodshed 
at least 368 people have been killed in hindumoslem riots in 
the past two weeks when hindu fundamentalists defied singh and 
pressed ahead with their campaign to replace a moslem mosque with a 
hindu temple in northeast india 
a rightwing hindu party withdrew its support for singhs 
government forcing him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament 
while the debate was under way a 17yearold schoolboy burned 
himself to death in new delhi to protest the governments 
opposition to the temple plan sanjeev goels death was the first 
case of selfimmolation related to the religious issue 
in the last two months at least 150 uppercaste students have 
died in suicides or protests against the governments efforts to 
reserve nearly half of all government jobs for lowcaste hindus 
the two issues grew into serious crises for singh and alienated 
him from many members of his own party 
it is not the government which has to be decided on today 
its the principle singh said speaking in hindi the question 
before us is whether anyones religious view is above the 
constitution whether this country will be divided on religion 
during the debate police fired tear gas to disperse uppercaste 
students protesting near parliament against the job policy there 
were no injuries 
chandra shekhar a leftleaning political veteran who led the 
defection within singhs own janata dal party has staked a claim 
to replace singh as prime minister such a move would at least 
temporarily avert new elections 
singh called chandra shekhars move political opportunism 
chandra shekhar addressing parliament immediately after singh 
appealed to the prime minister to give up 
is the state of the country better than it was 11 months ago 
hasnt terrorism increased havent prices risen hasnt tension in 
society increased he asked 
the religious riots and job protests added to singhs other 
problems separatist insurrections in kashmir and punjab escalated 
after singh took office fuel and food prices soared an economic 
liberalization plan stalled 
the prime minister bogged down in trying to hold together a 
fragile coalition of communists hindu fundamentalists and his own 
factionridden centrist janata dal 
the hindu rightwing bhasatiya janata party deserted singh two 
weeks ago when its leader was arrested while marching to ayodhya to 
supplant a mosque with a temple 
the party leader lal krishna advani said their opposition to 
the government did not stem only from the temple issue 
in 11 months singh has not even been able to keep his 
ministers together what can this government take pride in 
advani asked during the confidence debate 
singhs janata dal broke apart monday with longtime rival 
chandra shekhar leading the revolt that included several cabinet 
ministers 
on tuesday chandra shekhar won the support of exprime minister 
rajiv gandhi whose congress party is the largest in parliament 
gandhi lost the prime ministers job to singh in last years 
elections

at clark air base next year as originally planned the f15es were 
to replace f4e aircraft in the 3rd tactical fighter squadron at 
clark 
the f15es will instead be based in alaska the announcement 
said 
the administration announced last april that it would remove the 
90th tactical fighter squadron of the 3rd tactical fighter wing at 
clark in may 1991 wednesdays announcement means the wings second 
squadron the 3rd tactical fighter squadron also will be removed 
instead of being replaced by the f15e squadron 
the net effect of this decision is that by some point in 1991 
the united states will have no fighter aircraft permanently based 
in the philippines and more than 1800 us military personnel 
will have departed the announcement said 
the pentagon public affairs office said it could not immediately 
determine how many us aircraft will be withdrawn from the 
philippines as a result of the announcement 
the pentagon said the decision was not a result of 
usphilippine negotiations on the future of us forces in that 
country it said the move was influenced though not dictated by 
the philippine governments publicly expressed position that the 
us fighters should be removed by september 1991 
us allies are being told of the decision and assured that the 
removal of the fighter aircraft in no way diminishes our 
commitment or ability to meet our responsibilities in the 
pacific the announcement said

a raucous funeral procession for militant rabbi 
meir kahane turned violent today when hundreds of people broke away 
from the march to smash shop windows beat arabs and stone police 
in a shopping district near the central bus station in jewish 
west jerusalem kahane supporters moved from shop to shop asking 
owners whether they employed arabs before smashing windows 
a terrified arab ran down the street followed by several kahane 
loyalists shouting death to terrorists police reported some 
palestinians were hurt in scattered attacks along the processions 
route 
one arab was beaten to the ground near the cemetery in givat 
shaul and a passing israeli and two soldiers tried to help him 
when he appeared to revive members of kahanes kach movement tried 
to block an ambulance from arriving police reports said one 
policeman was injured in the melee 
elsewhere along the procession route hundreds stoned a 
television building and a mounted policeman trying to disperse the 
rioters was hit by a stone and fell off his horse israel radio 
said 
hundreds of police reinforcements had been deployed to prevent 
violence between arabs and kahanes followers during the funeral 
procession by 18000 people but authorities did not interfere 
during the windowbreaking rampage 
the main procession of men in yellow kach tshirts and 
ultraorthodox jews in black coats moved through downtown 
jerusalem organizers with megaphones led chants of death to the 
arabs and death to arafat the plo leader vans carrying 
yellow kach flags led the marchers 
during the earlier memorial service one kach activist vowed to 
avenge the slaying of kahane who was fatally shot after a speech 
at a manhattan hotel on monday night revenge the right to 
speak will be spoken by a knife he told the crowd of thousands 
jammed into a jewish seminary 
security officials apparently worried by the kach threats of 
violence deployed police outside the homes of palestinian leaders 
we will not allow any riots and provocations will be stopped 
immediately said jerusalem police commander arieh bibi 
science minister yuval neeman of the ultrarightist tehiya party 
was turned away from the memorial service amid shouts of leftist 
leftist absorption minister yitzhak peretz of the ultraorthodox 
shas party entered the hall under heavy police escort 
neeman later told israels army radio he had come to represent 
the government i meant to eulogize rabbi meir kahane may god 
avenge his blood neeman said using a traditional jewish phrase 
in cases of violent death the rabbi was a proud jew and warrior 
apparently the anger should directed at the killers neeman 
said 
kahane and his antiarab kach movement have been hostile toward 
the political establishment which shunned them 
with kahanes death ultrarightists and religious parties are 
expected to compete for the votes of his followers 
at the burial site the givat shaul cemetery hundreds of 
mourners awaited the funeral procession those awaiting the coffin 
included legislators rehavam zeevi of the ultraright moledet 
party 
some kach followers there carried placards reading transfer 
a euphemism referring to kahanes key demand the ouster of all 
arabs from israeliheld territories 
the kahane killing has been denounced by israeli leaders from 
across the political spectrum and some voices warned that it could 
lead to a wave of political assassinations 
this is the danger engulfing us now that kahanes murder 
will spark a dizzy cycle of further murders the masscirculation 
yedioth ahronoth newspaper wrote in its editorial 
on tuesday hours after word of the kahane killing spread two 
elderly arabs were gunned down in a west bank village and police 
said the slayings may have been prompted by kahanes murder 
kahane 58 preached a violent doctrine of jewish power his 
organizations the jewish defense league in new york and the kach 
movement in israel were known for political violence 
after immigrating to israel in 1971 he built a small but 
passionately loyal following although he was shunned by the 
political establishment 
israel army radio said today that the assassination changed 
kahanes image in israel the israeli media that once avoided 
covering him is now devoting a good deal of the time explaining his 
dogma the radio said

administration for the 21st century proceed to relocate the diet

secretary of state james a baker iii turned to 
the soviet union on wednesday to support sterner measures against 
iraq as the bush administration acknowledged a worldwide economic 
boycott was inadequate to force saddam husseins invaders out of 
kuwait 
at the top of bakers agenda is determining if president mikhail 
s gorbachev who has strongly urged that a diplomatic solution to 
the crisis be sought would support a un resolution authorizing 
the use of force 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen told baker on tuesday in 
cairo that beijing would not block such a resolution however the 
chinese minister stressed his governments preference for a 
political settlement 
baker needs at least as much from gorbachev whom he sees at the 
kremlin on thursday before the united states makes its move in the 
security council for a resolution authorizing force and another 
demanding iraq permit the resupply of the beleaguered us and 
british embassies in kuwait the only two still defying iraqs 
order to shut down 
after more than three months of a trade cutoff and other 
sanctions the iraqi president has not budged in his determination 
to hold on to kuwait as an annexed province 
president bush and baker had expressed confidence that once the 
sanctions bit the iraqi leader would have to reassess 
but a senior us official who flew here with baker from turkey 
acknowledged that despite a battery of 10 council resolutions 
that point had not yet been reached among them is a demand saddam 
release his grip on kuwait an oilrich emirate at the northern tip 
of the persian gulf 
the sanctions are having an effect he said weve never 
disputed that i think the question is are the sanctions yet having 
an effect that would alter saddams political calculus and lead 
him to withdraw peacefully and otherwise fully implement the 
resolutions were obviously not yet to that point 
as he left ankara baker said we would all like to see a 
peaceful diplomatic political solution to this problem at the 
same time it is the view of our president and the united states 
that we cannot rule out the use of force 
he added that credibility of the united nations is at stake 
one step baker took in cairo was to assure egyptian president 
hosni mubarak of us logistical support to help get the 14000 
egyptian troops in saudi arabia into combat if there was a war 
gorbachevs special middle east envoy yevgeny primakov was 
more positive about the chances for peace saying there had been a 
big difference in the tenor of his discussions with saddam 
between a first meeting in september and a second on oct 27 
in the second meeting there was not mention by hussein that 
kuwait is part of iraqi territory primakov told reporters at a 
kremlin reception 
i put it like this to him if you do not withdraw you will 
face a military strike against you he said that he was in a 
position to do something i am still optimistic 
primakov said he did not think the united states opposed his 
search for a diplomatic solution i dont think they are against 
them i reported to president bush and explained to him what i have 
in mind and i didnt see that he was against it 
waiting for baker at sheremetyevo airport outside moscow was 
alexei obukhov the soviet official in overall charge of efforts to 
complete a treaty to reduce the nonnuclear weapons the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact have deployed in 
europe 
obukhov handed baker a sheaf of papers which the secretary of 
state began to read before climbing into his limousine 
on tuesday a group of us arms control specialists arrived 
here to try to put the finishing touches on the conventional forces 
in europe treaty to be signed in paris at a summit meeting nov 
1921 
the negotiators are also working on another treaty to reduce 
us and soviet longrange nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines

democrats padded their house majority in 
turbulent elections that cost several veterans in both parties 
their seats and threw a scare into others including republican 
whip newt gingrich 
roughly 96 percent of incumbents were reelected tuesday but 
some big names including rep robert kastenmeier a democratic 
house subcommittee chairman felt the wrath of burgeoning voter 
disgust with government 
democrats were assured of a net pickup of nine seats 
strengthening their majority to 267 in the 435member house and 
heightening their ability to override president bushs vetoes in 
addition the election of a socialist who will line up with the 
democrats for organizational purposes gives them an effective 
majority of 268 
republicans won 164 contests and led in the remaining three 
races in those contests two incumbent democrats trailed slightly 
while the third battle was over an open seat held by a republican 
who retired 
while the gop loss was well below the historic average of 27 for 
a party holding the white house in midterm elections it left them 
with their lowest house numbers since 1982 
house democratic leaders touted the results as evidence that 
voters accepted their pitch about tax fairness and had identified 
the republicans more as the party of the rich 
the results are clear george bush cannot win the congress and 
must no longer rule by veto said majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo next year he must come to capitol hill with an 
action plan for reviving the economy and reworking the system to 
the benefit of working families 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said a strengthened 
democratic majority will carry a mandate to undertake a serious 
review of our national health delivery system 
but gop house campaign chief ed rollins said he didnt think 
either party should feel comfortable with the results 
i dont think the antiwashington mood ends today rollins 
said even though a lot of incumbents are not being defeated 
theyre being scared theyre not getting the 60 percent margins 
they had two years ago 
notwithstanding the generally standpat nature of the results 
history was made in several respects 
bernard sanders the socialist former mayor of burlington vt 
ousted incumbent freshman republican peter smith to become the 
first socialist in the house since victor louis berger of 
milwaukee wis six decades ago 
sanders handily defeated smith who publicly disagreed with 
bushs position on taxes when the president appeared with him at a 
campaign event 
gary franks an alderman from waterbury conn became the 
first black republican to serve in the house since oscar de priest 
of illinois during the depression franks vanquished former 
democratic rep toby moffett for a seat vacated by a republican 
voters in new hampshires 2nd district elected democrat dick 
swett an architect over oneterm incumbent republican chuck 
douglas the first time a democrat has won that seat since 1912 
the year the titanic sank 
although the democrats kept intact the majority they have held 
in the house since 1954 the results of several contests showed an 
underlying voter restiveness 
in kentucky threeterm rep carl perkins won a razorthin 
victory over republican will t scott a former circuit judge by a 
margin of only about 2000 votes 
gingrich the fiery secondincommand house gop leader nearly 
lost his rematch against democrat david worley in a suburban 
atlanta district gingrich had led the opposition to the bipartisan 
budget deal reached by bush and congress 
kastenmeier had been in the house for 32 years but was ousted 
by a 37yearold former madison newscaster scott klug kastenmeier 
was chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on courts 
in oregon an incumbent tainted by the savingsandloan scandal 
also went down to defeat fiveterm rep denny smith was defeated 
in his second round with democrat mike kopetski who had narrowly 
lost to smith two years ago 
the sampl mess also helped bring down sixterm rep charles 
pashayan jr rcalif farmer and businessman calvin dooley a 
36yearold democrat won narrowly in part by pointing to 
pashayans receipt of 26000 from lincoln savings and loan 
chairman charles keating pashayan later returned the money 
minnesota voters ousted republican rep arlan stangeland a 
congressman since 1977 and replaced him with democrat collin 
peterson 
stangeland who is married was stung by reports that he had 
used his congressional credit card to make hundreds of telephone 
calls to and from the home of a female lobbyist peterson 46 
supports the death penalty and a constitutional amendment limiting 
abortions 
conservative republican stan parris decisively lost his seat in 
the virginia suburbs of washington to alexandria mayor james moran 
who had made parris antiabortion stand a major issue 
the bad news is in 1974 i got run over by a train called 
watergate parris said now it very much appears the same 
train 16 years later is going to run me over again the good news 
is there is life after government 
in pennsylvania attorney rick santorum shocked seventerm 
democratic rep doug walgrens bid for reelection from an affluent 
district in pittsburgh santorum emphasized antiincumbent themes 
like the congressional pay raise and specialinterest political 
money 
and in maryland fiveterm democratic rep roy dyson a member 
of the armed services committee was beaten by republican wayne 
gilchrest a high school teacher seeking public office for the 
first time 
it had been revealed during the campaign that dyson avoided 
service in the vietnam war by claiming conscientious objector 
status in contrast to his hawkish defense views since entering 
the house 
in the st louis suburbs in missouri twoterm republican jack 
buechner was edged out by democrat joan kelly horn buechner said 
he would request a recount in light of the 52vote victory margin 
republican challenger charles taylor edged democratic rep james 
m clarke by fewer than 4000 votes in a western north carolina 
district that perennially features one of the countrys tightest 
congressional races taylor a former state senator was beaten 
narrowly by clarke two years ago

in massachusetts and five other states voters rejected ballot 
measures that would have taken giant whacks out of taxes or 
government spending only oregon kept the embers of the tax revolt 
alive 
oregon voters left state educators quaking by approving measure 
5 which will phase in a 15 percent ceiling on the property tax 
rate by 1995 it will cause property taxes to drop an estimated 45 
percent by 1995 and would require the legislature to replace 
whatever money would be lost to schools from the property tax cuts 
but elsewhere massachusetts residents rejected a proposed 26 
billion tax rollback to 1988 levels it would have been the largest 
voterinitiated state tax cut in us history 
opponents had charged that the cuts would hamper such state 
services as day care elderly programs and police and firefighter 
training officials said the measure could shut down college 
campuses and bankrupt some school districts 
they wanted change but the petition went too far said 
university of massachusetts political scientist paul watanabe 
californians who started the national tax revolt movement 12 
years ago when voters approved proposition 13 narrowly turned down 
a son of jarvis initiative the measure would have required a 
twothirds legislative or popular majority for new taxes 
california voters also rejected two measures that would have 
increased the state tax on alcohol 
nebraskans voted against a 2 percent limit on annual state and 
local budget increases 
montanans defeated a highly unusual ballot measure that would 
have scrapped their state income property and sales taxes in favor 
of a transaction charge of 1 percent on all financial dealings 
neither backers nor opponents seemed sure whether it would have 
raised or lowered taxes 
but montana voters also rejected an initiative that would have 
raised the state cigarette tax 140 percent to 43 cents a pack the 
highest in the nation in an effort to curb smoking in marlboro 
country 
in utah voters heeded dire warnings of fiscal distress from 
state educators and refused to abolish the state sales tax on food 
and colorado voters narrowly rejected a measure requiring voter 
approval for any state or local tax increase a similar proposal 
was soundly defeated in 1988 
don mcintire chief proponent of the newly approved oregon tax 
limit said he thinks oregonians are frustrated with state 
governments inability to tackle the property tax question 
people are realizing the political system is paralyzed 
mcintire said they state leaders just cant deal with this 
subject responsibly 
but john marshall of the oregon school boards association warned 
that school programs face major amputation as a result of the 
vote

william j bennett is resigning as the 
nations drug policy director the white house announced today 
saying he had helped produce a turnaround in americans 
attitudes towards drugs 
president bush will accept bennetts resignation in a ceremony 
at the white house on thursday spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
administration sources revealed his departure plans tuesday 
night and fitzwater confirmed them 
bush is not yet ready to name a successor fitzwater said he 
denied that bennett was leaving because of threats to his family 
saying bennett has lived with threats of a kind ever since day 
one of the job 
bennett the former secretary of education became the nations 
first director of drug control policy last year at the outset of 
the bush administration 
the president feels that bill bennett has provided 
extraordinary leadership and service to the country during his 
tenure as drug czar the spokesman said 
two years ago this country viewed this problem as impossible 
to deal with and with no end in sight said fitzwater today 
there has been a turnaround there is strong bipartisan support in 
the congress for drug programs and there is growing evidence that 
society is beginning to turn away from the drug scourge 
earlier an administration source said bennett was leaving after 
18 months in office with a feeling of accomplishment 
he set out to do a task hes done it and hes seeing the 
fruition of it the source said tuesday now hes going on to 
the next phase of his life the source said bennett has no new 
job lined up 
the source said bennett also has been subject to increasing 
threats to his safety recently 
bennett 47 designed the nations antidrug strategy which 
focuses heavily on drug users as the fuel that keep international 
gangster organizations in business his plans devoted about 70 
percent of the money to law enforcement the rest to treatment and 
education but treatment programs grew the fastest under bennetts 
guidance 
the voluble bennett has used his job of director of the office 
of national drug control policy as a bully pulpit much as he did 
when he was education secretary under president reagan 
he traveled the nation praising antidrug activists and urging 
tougher drug laws and novel punishments as well as treatment and 
education programs he was critical of congress when it tried to 
change his plans and called calls for drug decriminalization 
stupid and morally atrocious 
one reason bennett is leaving is concern for his safety and that 
of his wife and young sons the source said 
there have been some threats bomb threats personal 
threats the source said on a recent swing through alaska where 
he campaigned for a ballot measure to recriminalize marijuana a 
third bodyguard was assigned 
the source said the concerns have been building ive seen it 
start to eat away at him 
when bennett was confirmed in march 1988 many said fighting the 
war on drugs would prove a hopeless task but he said in ceremony 
in september that progress had been made that the drug problem 
in general nationwide is no longer getting worse and in some 
very significant aspects it is now getting better not victory but 
success 
the ceremony called attention to signs that the drug crisis 
particularly the cocaine problem appeared to be abating cocaine 
prices were higher and purity levels lower emergency room cases 
were fewer and americans were turning against illegal drugs of all 
kinds polls found 
bennett said that as cocaine supplies were restricted violence 
among dealers could increase with more dogs chasing fewer 
bones but he said the overall signs showed the problem is 
certainly not getting worse 
in recent months bennett has found himself urging the public to 
keep its attention focused on the drug war and not be diverted by 
the persian gulf crisis and other issues 
it is possible for a great nation to take care of its own kids 
and its own principles in more than one place at one time he 
said 
bennett said he was unsure how long he expected to stay in his 
job but said ill tell you theres more for me to do thats 
for sure

british hostages held in lebanon will be 
freed if london restores relations severed with damascus four years 
ago amid allegations of syrian involvement in terrorism a 
government newspaper said wednesday 
in a frontpage editorial the tishrin daily accused british 
prime minister margaret thatchers government of blocking efforts 
to free the four britons who are among 13 westerners held by 
proiranian moslem extremists 
the editorial signed by the newspapers editorinchief 
mohammed kheir alwadi said britain has not done a thing for the 
release of the missing hostages 
had the british government been concerned about its citizens 
it would have reconciled with syria he wrote such a move will 
create the appropriate atmopshere for syria to look for the 
hostages and secure their release 
it was the first time the governmentcontrolled news media has 
openly linked the hostage issue to renewing diplomatic ties 
ruptured in november 1986 after london blamed syria for an attempt 
to blow up an israeli jetliner at heathrow airport 
in london a spokesman for the foreign office said syria is 
an important country in the middle east and we would like better 
relations but there are obstacles 
the spokesman said foreign secretary douglas hurd has quite 
deliberately refused to specify what britains conditions are for 
renewing ties last month hurd said the 1986 el al affair remained 
the main obstacle 
syria has denied it was involved in the terror attempt calling 
it an israeli plot to damage syrias image in the west the tishrin 
editorial repeated the claim that syria was set up 
when this became apparent to western governments they 
improved relations with syria except for mrs thatcher who moved 
in the opposite direction it said 
the united states recalled its ambassador from damascus after 
the british accusations but he was sent back a few months later 
mainly to follow up on american hostages in lebanon 
tishrin referred to a recent european community vote taken 
under british pressure to maintain a ban on arms sales to syria 
and keep restrictions on the number of syrian officials in europe 
the british governments intransigence and confrontational 
attitudes are delaying the solution of acute problems it 
said 
syria is the main powerbroker in lebanon with 40000 troops 
deployed in the civil warplagued country damascus also is a close 
ally of iran which backs shiite moslem factions holding the 
western hostages 
in addition to the britons the hostages are six americans two 
germans and an italian american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press is the longest held 
syria was involved in the release of american hostages robert 
polhill and frank reed in april and irishman brian keenan in 
august 
the editorial deflated speculation that a british hostage 
possibly anglican church envoy terry waite would be freed 
following londons restoration of ties with iran in september 
waite 51 disappeared in beirut on jan 20 1987 while trying 
to negotiate the release of american hostages 
the other missing britons are alec collett 68 a new yorkbased 
journalist john mccarthy 33 a reporter for the londonbased 
worldwide television and jack mann 76 a former air force pilot 
who had been living in lebanon for two decades 
the revolutionary organization of socialist moslems claimed it 
executed collett in retaliation for us air raids on libya it 
released a videotape purporting to show him hanged but no body was 
produced

the official iraqi news agency said 100 germans would be freed 
at the intervention of former west german chancellor willy brandt 
who met with president saddam hussein today

appreciation for the german policy which does not support trends 
toward war 
it said 20 hostages of other nationalities would be freed as 
well including an unspecified number of americans britons 
italians and others 
the announcement did not say when they would be freed 
but the release of the japanese hostages who left baghdad today

officials who have traveled to baghdad on hostagefreeing misions 
are being used by saddam for propaganda purposes presidential 
spokeman marlin fitzwater speaking to reporters specifically 
mentioned brandts trip 
he also accused saddam of toying with the emotions of the 
families of captives 
prime minister margaret thatcher said today that time is 
running out for saddam and force will be used unless he withdraws 
soon from kuwait 
he has been warned she said in a speech to lawmakers 
secretary of state james a baker iii meanwhile said the use 
of military force against iraq cannot be ruled out baker is on a 
weeklong mission sounding out allies on their willingness to go to 
war he was in turkey today and will stop in moscow paris and 
london 
he told reporters in ankara that the united states seeks a 
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis but he added that we cannot 
rule out the possible use of force before we see that the matter is 
resolved peacefully 
baker also denied reports he gave iraq an ultimatum to get out 
of kuwait in the next two weeks the reports by israel army radio 
and stations in luxembourg and monte carlo said baker had asked his

unexpectedly announced in february he wouldnt seek a second term 
roberts a democrat moved to fill the void on tuesday she 
defeated republican dave frohnmayer 
roberts 53 grew up in a small willamette valley town and ended 
up in portland where she began her political career 
her first exposure to the capitol was in the early 1970s when 
she helped get a bill passed requiring special education classes 
for emotionally handicapped children in public schools 
she launched the effort because the older of her two sons is 
autistic she was a divorced mother with two kids and no child

familiarity with voters after crisscrossing the state on the speech 
circuit many times as secretary of state 
shes an unabashed liberal who emphasizes concern for the 
downtrodden she says she rejects the label however if its meant 
as support of higher taxes and more regulation of business 
her republican opponent dave frohnmayer portrayed her as a 
free spender with budgetbusting plans 
roberts candor sometimes left supporters nervous 
months ahead of the election she endorsed a controversial 
ballot measure to shut down the states only nuclear power plant 
later she came out for a hardfought measure to impose strict 
recycling standards on packaging

mayorelect sharon pratt dixon on wednesday 
wasted no time acting on her pledge to overhaul the district of 
columbia government urging that all of mayor marion barrys 
political aides quit 
i am going to indicate to the mayor that i would like for him 
to ask for the resignations of all the political appointees 
dixon said in the aftermath of her landslide victory over 
republican nominee maurice turner 
if he wont cooperate in that regard then i am going to 
urge the city council to forge a partnership that allows us to do 
what the people of the district of columbia clearly want 
the mayorelect did not elaborate on what type of legislative 
action she would seek from the council but that 13member panel 
has in recent weeks passed bills designed to limit barrys spending 
authority during his last days in office 
several legislators said they were worried barry would reward 
friends and political cronies with pay raises and city contracts 
while he still had the power to do so 
barry who was defeated in his bid for a seat on the city 
council said during his concession speech tuesday that he intended 
to cooperate in the transition to the dixon administration 
however he declined to provide specifics and refused comment 
wednesday on dixons request for the departure of his political 
lieutenants 
barry has appointed about 200 of his aides to highpaying 
government posts many of barrys top aides are also career 
government workers and are eligible under city personnel rules to 
take other government posts if dixon wishes to replace them 
dixon who won with 86 percent of the vote to turners 11 
percent becomes the first black female to lead a major american 
city 
she won after promising sweeping reform in a government many 
believe is bloated and inefficient including a pledge to cut 2000 
middlelevel managers from the districts 48000member work force

at an unusual prayer breakfast south 
african foreign minister pik botha urged three black african 
leaders wednesday to join hands in regional cooperation 
botha who represented president f w de klerk addressed the 
heads of state as my african brothers during the informal 
meeting which was punctuated by joking and laughter 
the breakfast host was zambian president kenneth kaunda head of 
the sevennation frontline states a regional bloc that once led 
efforts to end apartheid in south africa 
the other two leaders were president joaquim chissano of 
mozambique who maintains close contacts with south africa and 
president yoweri museveni of uganda the current chairman of the 
51member organization of african unity 
president bush sent a congratulatory message saying the meeting 
marks a new era in africa 
the gettogether over eggs bacon and croissants signaled a 
further easing of tensions between whiteled south africa and its 
antiapartheid neighbors 
zambian officials said it was made possible by de klerks recent 
steps toward dismantling apartheid including legalizing the 
african national congress freeing political prisoners including 
the anc leader nelson mandela and lifting the state of emergency 
in black townships 
the anc outlawed for 30 years in south africa had its 
headquarters in the zambian capital of lusaka until early this 
year 
kaunda once one of the most vocal african critics of apartheid 
said the theme of the meeting was peace unity and 
reconciliation 
botha told the black african leaders that south africa could 
help economic development in the largely impoverished region 
adding we in africa must join hands and move closer together 
south africa must play its rightful role in southern africa 
and we are ready to play that role botha said 
ugandan president museveni said he got the idea for such a 
meeting from a prayer breakfast he attended with us congressmen 
two years ago he wanted to organize something similar he said 
but as he was not a good christian he asked kaunda to be host 
three other african heads of state quett masire of botswana 
pierre buyoya of burundi and metsing lekhanya of lesotho were 
invited but did not attend

nasa today set nov 15 as the launch 
date for space shuttle atlantis and its classified cargo a spy 
satellite that needed lastminute repairs and caused a oneweek 
flight delay 
atlantis had been scheduled to blast off friday on the secret 
military mission but the air force last week delayed the flight 
because of undisclosed problems that arose during cargo testing 
the satellite aboard atlantis reportedly is to spy on iraqi 
forces liftoff is scheduled for sometime between 630 pm and 
1030 pm est the exact time will not be divulged until nine 
minutes beforehand 
atlantis was supposed to carry the spacecraft into orbit in 
july weeks before iraq invaded kuwait but hydrogen leaks grounded 
the shuttle during the standdown the satellite reportedly was 
modified for information gathering in the persian gulf 
atlantis was cleared for flight during an oct 24 fueling test 
that found no significant leakage the shuttle columbia also 
crippled for months by leaking hydrogen was found to be free of 
dangerous leaks during a similar test last week 
the national aeronautics and space administration plans to send 
columbia on a longdelayed astronomy mission in early december the 
sevenman crew has endured four launch attempts since may three of 
which were halted by leaking hydrogen in the final hours before 
liftoff 
nasa likes to have at least three weeks between missions so 
flight data can be analyzed officials have said they will try to 
shorten that period by about a week so columbia can be back before 
christmas and the agency can shut down certain operations for 
routine maintenance and avoid holiday pay 
before hydrogen leaks crippled two of nasas three shuttles the 
space agency had planned nine launches for 1990 six will be 
achieved if atlantis and columbia go up as planned

enjoying enormous popularity among germans but 
facing problems at home soviet president president mikhail 
gorbachev plans to spend the first anniversary of the berlin wall 
opening looking for economic help 
gorbachev scheduled to arrive in bonn on friday is likely to 
be heaped with praise for his role in ending the cold war he may 
get a cooler response to his requests for support for reform 
efforts 
he is believed to be seeking more credits from germany to help 
the soviet transition to a market economy and modernize nuclear 
power plants among other programs 
but german businessmen who were eager to rush into partnerships 
with the soviets last year are more cautious now with reports of 
growing soviet unrest 
the soviet unions internal development is so unclear that it 
does not create a good climate for investments says karlhermann 
fink managing director of the german eastwest trade committee 
we are heading for trouble this is too much too fast said 
heinrich vogel head of the federal institute for soviet and 
international studies nobody knows who will stand behind what is 
decided in moscow 
on friday the anniversary of the first openings in the wall 
that divided berlin gorbachev is scheduled to sign a 
sovietgerman treaty that includes a nonaggression pact and other 
provisions for financial and technological help for the soviet 
union 
on saturday gorbachev plans to visit chancellor helmut kohls 
hometown of oggersheim near the rhine river for informal talks 
although economic issues are likely to dominate the twoday 
visit other topics likely to be raised include the fate of soviet 
soldiers who have deserted in what used to be east germany 
the 20year accord gorbachev and kohl plan to sign friday is one 
of the most expansive agreements ever worked out between the two 
nations 
the countries will pledge not to use force against each other 
and to respect the boundaries of all countries in europe 
the treaty also creates the framework for german financial and 
technological help for the soviet union and for intensified 
political and cultural ties 
both nations have strong historical connections in peace and in 
war 
writers aleksandr pushkin and johann goethe became close friends 
in weimar novelist ivan turgenev called germany his second 
fatherland russian writer boris pasternak studied philosophy in 
marburg 
for germans russia represented a land of great economic 
opportunity with wideopen spaces their nation lacked 
catherine the great the germanborn ruler of russia at the end 
of the 18th century invited her former countrymen to settle land 
along the volga river 
their descendants repressed under stalin now number in the 
millions many want to emigrate to germany 
the 1922 treaty of rapallo which outlined close military and 
political consultations between germany and the young soviet state 
alarmed the rest of europe the word rapallo still signifies 
something sinister 
strong economic links emerged again with the foundation in 1949 
of the communist state of east germany which became the soviets 
largest trading partner 
moscow was reluctant to agree to the oct 3 german 
reunification but agreement finally came in july 
now some of germanys european allies are worried about its 
relationship with the soviet union 
the french press referred to the july meeting between gorbachev 
and kohl in the soviet leaders hometown of stavropol as 
stavrapallo 
germany has sought to reassure its western neighbors its 
interest in the soviet union in no way reduces the commitment to 
european integration 
germans have a special responsibility for their eastern 
neighbors said historian juergen kocka we should take care of 
the east but not so that it disassociates us from the west

from a major quake in northern iran in june which killed an 
estimated 50000 people 
the temblor shook 18 villages around the city of darab about 
600 miles southeast of tehran the official islamic republic news

radio report suggesting the count was ongoing 
it said two of the villages qarehno and doborje fourk were 
razed they had a combined population of more than 6300 people

seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude for example a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 
10 times stronger than one of 65

fouled environment but ballot contests decided in 26 states showed 
theyre not about to rock the economic boat to solve those 
problems 
environmentalists had hoped to buoy their cause with big 
green a sweeping california proposal that would have imposed a 
wide and unprecedented array of restrictions on offshore drilling 
pesticide use and air pollutants 
instead big green was done in tuesday by big bucks a 10 
milliion campaign against it by various industries that apparently 
convinced californians that the potential cost of the measure would 
be a crushing new burden in a sagging economy 
the measure was trounced by nearly a 21 margin and except for 
pacific grove calif where voters approved a 12 million bond to 
protect a butterfly preserve environmentrelated ballot issues 
took beatings practically everywhere else in new york oregon 
missouri and washington 
meanwhile residents of massachusetts and six other states 
rejected stringent antitaxing antispending measures apparently 
heeding warnings from educators and local officials that the 
resulting school and municipal cuts might be even worse than the 
disease of government waste 
oregon however passed a tough antitax measure 
voters narrowly approved measure 5 which will phase in a 15 
percent ceiling on the property tax rate by 1995 it will cause 
property taxes to drop an estimated 45 percent by 1995 and require 
the legislature to replace whatever money would be lost to schools 
from the property tax cuts 
in all americans decided 236 statewide ballot questions tuesday 
and scores of local contests 
arizonans may have lost their shot at being host to the super 
bowl in 1993 after rejecting a proposal to make martin luther king 
jrs birthday a state holiday 
national football league commissioner paul tagliabue recommended 
wednesday that the game be played elsewhere after arizonans decided 
to remain one of just three states without a formal holiday 
honoring the slain civil rights leader 
alaskans recriminalized private use of marijuana for the first 
time in 15 years while maine voters abolished tough blue laws

civil engineer jim allerton of seattle didnt 
vote 
its just sleazeball a or sleazeball b he said 
college student jennifer toledo didnt vote 
i dont believe in santa claus i dont believe in the tooth 
fairy i dont believe in politicians she said 
food service manager jim madzinski didnt vote 
honestly im not registered he said the last thing i 
want to do is get pulled in for jury duty 
these americans were among the estimated 110 million adults who 
sat out tuesdays election they far outnumbered the 76 million who 
voted 
were they sending a message 
the experts arent sure some see anger in the low turnout 
others just see indifference 
curtis gans director of the committee for the study of the 
american electorate who provided the turnout estimates said voter 
turnout rose in places where there was something important to 
decide 
in places where the public saw only messages framed by political 
consultants and sensed that nothing real was at stake turnout was 
down he said 
bruce buchanan a university of texas political scientist read 
it somewhat differently 
its not that nonvoters are turned off buchanan said but that 
they are untouched by government 
most people in america come close to regarding politics as 
very distant from their lives he said its just not an urgent 
matter 
people are more likely to tune in when a president is being 
elected buchanan said turnout always rises in presidential years 
but buchanan says it is wrong to assume that nonvoters share 
similar reasons for their failure to vote 
some are kept away by barriers such as registration requirements 
and poll closing hours he said 
some feel impotent frustrated certain their vote cant make a 
difference 
and some especially young adults 1824 feel politics simply 
has no relevance to their lives 
abc news polled 1028 likely nonvoters it said the nonvoters 
expressed the same concerns about the course of the country and the 
prospect of war as those who vote 
six in 10 said it is not true that all politicians are alike 
they said that it does matter who is elected 
among the nonvoters who were registered 30 percent said time 
constraints would keep them from voting another 22 percent cited 
health 
whatever the reasons some people think the united states 
simply conducts too many elections for too many offices turnout 
is lower in this country than in any democracy in the world 
this year gans calculates the figure will be about 363 
percent the same as four years ago 
across america on election day talking to associated press 
reporters nonvoters tried to give their reasons most had a 
theyreallbums quality 
why bother asked skyp krantz 43 of dayton ohio who 
earns 9000 a year as a record store clerk he said he has never 
voted no matter who is voted in once they are elected they do 
what they want or worse what somebody with a lot of money wants 
in albuquerque nm appliance salesman robin smedley 36 
abdicated purposely i can voice my opinion by having no opinion 
at all he said 
kim cruea 26 a nanny who cares for four children in 
indianapolis wasnt registered but even if she were she said 
with all these horrible campaign commercials i wouldnt know who 
to vote for they make everyone sound so horrible 
in madison wis college student kevin moore 25 seemed to 
confirm buchanans theory about the unaffected young im just 
not interested he said while waiting to cross a street on his 
bicycle i dont think anyone running for office can do anything 
for me 
in traverse city mich sewing store manager beverly kozacek 
ticked off her reasons on her fingers 
i did not vote because of the way the campaigns were run 
she said bending an index finger i did not vote because i did 
not like any of the candidates running 
you know i could have voted she said i drove right by 
the polling place and said i will not turn in there was just so 
much negative everything this year

strolling arminarm and carrying red carnations 
in a revolution day parade retired schoolteachers lina solomanaya 
and olga stoyanovskaya appeared to be in a holiday mood they 
werent 
all my life ive been deceived mrs solomanaya said i 
was a communist and i believed what they told me i raised my 
children that way too i sent them to the pioneers and the 
communist youth league 
we have begun to open our eyes only in the last few years we 
know what happened in 1917 and we can see what it has brought us 
we just cant pretend anymore that it was right 
the nov 7 holiday traditionally has glorified the 1917 
bolshevik revolution with a military parade through red square 
but on wednesday in addition to the red square parade tens of 
thousands of soviets marched through moscow and other cities in 
counterdemonstrations expressing anger and disillusionment 
increasingly soviet historians and politicians are publicly 
declaring the revolution a failure some call it a noble but 
unsuccessful experiment others call a criminal coup that blocked 
the countrys evolution toward parliamentary democracy 
mrs solomanaya 61 and mrs stoyanovskaya 55 marched with 
more than 5000 people behind banners with slogans such as nov 
7 a day of mourning for russia 
the rally began a few blocks from red square outside the 
communist party headquarters where radical politician lev shemayev 
told the crowd we no longer want to be guinea pigs in the giant 
experiment forced on us by false bolsheviks for the past 73 
years 
it ended about one mile away at the apartment building where 
dissident physicist and 1975 nobel peace prize winner andrei 
sakharov lived before his death last december 
along the way mrs solomanaya and mrs stoyanovskaya explained 
why they have lost faith both in revolutionary ideology and 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
for 73 years we thought we were moving to a brighter future 
and we never got there said mrs solomanaya who taught 
literature in a moscow high school 
they promised us free medical care free educations good 
pensions but all we got was crumbs added mrs stoyanovskaya 
passing a row of embassies the two friends said western 
countries have a higher standard of living more freedom and less 
fear they complained that sugar is rationed in moscow butter and 
eggs have disappeared from state stores and shopping is 
humiliating 
mrs solomanaya said long lines have put the soviet people in an 
evil mood 
we are irritable annoyed vexed because every step in our 
lives has become difficult said mrs stoyanovskaya a former 
english teacher 
both women said gorbachev failed to revive the economy 
gorbachev brought us free speech which was something we never 
expected and we have to thank him for that mrs stoyanovskaya 
said 
but gorbachev is like a weather vane turning whichever way 
the wind blows first he supported the 500day economic reform 
program then he rejected it he is pressured by the right and he 
gives in 
mrs solomanaya said she is now pinning her hopes on reformers 
in the russian republic government led by president boris yeltsin 
because they are willing to take more resolute steps toward 
economic reform 
but she said she expects conditions to worsen before getting 
better 
we are tired of socialism communism internationalism she 
said all we want is a better life not another ism

the justice department today announced a 
70count indictment against a georgia man for the mailbomb 
killings of a federal appellate judge and a savannah civil rights 
lawyer 
attorney general dick thornburgh and fbi director william 
sessions announced the indictment which was returned in atlanta 
against walter l moody jr 
moody 56 is charged with mailing package bombs last december 
that killed circuit judge robert s vance and savannah ga city 
alderman and civil rights lawyer robert e robinson 
both vance and robinson suffered fatal injuries by the force of 
the blasts when they opened packages mailed to them less than a 
week before christmas 
moody of rex ga is charged with murder of a us judge 
which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison he also is 
charged with sending package bombs to the court where vance sat 
the 11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta and the jacksonville 
fla office of the naacp 
other charges alleged that moody who is in custody on another 
federal case mailed assassination threats to all of vances 
colleagues on the 11th circuit 
six of the charges against moody carry sentences of up to life 
imprisonment including allegations he mailed package bombs with 
the intent to kill the bombs found in the atlanta courthouse and 
the jacksonville naacp office were removed without causing any 
injuries 
thornburgh said the bombings strike at the heart of our 
american concept of the rule of law 
those who would seek to attack the integrity and sanctity of 
our legal system through violent behavior would undermine the very 
foundations of our democracy he said 
vance died after opening a package that was mailed to his home 
in mountain brook ala 
moody and his wife susan previously were accused of conspiracy 
and obstruction of jusice in an alleged scheme to induce a federal 
court in macon ga to vacate moodys 1972 conviction for unlawful 
possession of a pipe bomb 
moody was convicted of the explosives charge after a pipe bomb 
went off in his home injuring his thenwife hazel he served two 
years in federal prison for the conviction moody and his wife were 
accused in july of persuading witnesses to sign false affidavits 
and give false testimony 
during the current investigation there were reports that agents 
seized 17 25cent stamps showing the american flag over yosemite 
national park from the purse of susan moody all four mail bombs 
bore the yosemite commemorative stamps 
several news organizations received the letters from a group 
calling itself americans for a competent federal judicial system 
which threatened to kill lawyers judges and naacp officials 
investigators said the letters bore similar markings and were 
sent from locations in georgia 
in the letters the group claimed it assassinated judge robert 
s vance and attorney robert robinson in reprisal for atrocities 
to a white women who was robbed raped and murdered in atlanta in 
1988 
the letters also expressed anger over a school desegregation 
case in dekalb county ga in which vance participated as a judge

teachers to schools with predominantly black student populations

a handful of key races this year demonstrated 
once again that polling may be more art than science 
while most prelection surveys were reliable voters provided 
enough ballotbox surprises to befuddle the experts 
new jerseys popular democratic sen bill bradley got a scare 
from a political unknown who took 49 percent of the vote 
sen jesse helms the combative conservative republican from 
north carolina burst the bubble of liberal democrats and exulted 
over his 6point margin of victory 
and in michigan republican john engler pulled off a stunning 
upset that blindsided even his own pollsters 
was englers razorthin defeat of twoterm democratic gov james 
j blanchard a surprise 
without a doubt said john wilson of american viewpoint who 
did englers polling 
two weeks before the election american viewpoint said 53 
percent of the voters were backing blanchard 33 percent engler and 
14 percent undecided 
wilson attributed the dramatic shift to complacency by blanchard 
and the challengers tenacity and good organization in getting out 
the vote on tuesday 
engler is just not the kind of guy that loses said wilson 
it was against all the odds 
pollsters rarely admit to mistakes there are as many 
explanations as races when the pulsetakers are confounded 
the bradley contest is a good example 
the former rhodes scholar and professional basketball star was 
considered untouchable in new jersey and a good bet for a 
presidential bid somewhere down the road 
ironically some believe his own popularity may have cost him 
support 
hes an incredibly popular candidate said janice ballou 
polling director of the eagleton institute of politics at rutgers 
university in new jersey some people voted against bradley to 
send a message even though they liked him because they were 
confident he would survive she said 
to wednesday morning quarterbacks the message was clear no 
taxes 
bradley was burned by a decidedly unpopular tax program pushed 
by democratic gov jim florio who was not on the ballot 
two weeks before the election the eagleton institute said 
bradleys lead over republican christine todd whitman was 62 
percent to 26 percent with 12 percent undecided 
but ms ballou said her organization saw the tide shifting 
sort of 
a week before the election after ms whitman stepped up her 
television ads she cut the lead almost in half bradley was ahead 
50 to 33 percent with 17 percent undecided 
then eagleton which had not budgeted any more money for the 
race stopped polling 
maybe retrospectively we should have continued to do it ms 
ballou said thats a tough call 
the helms contest perhaps the most closely watched in the 
nation had its own unique dynamic 
helms who makes many a conservative look moderate stepped up 
his attacks in the closing days on harvey gantt by branding his 
democratic challenger a supporter of racial quotas gantt was the 
first black mayor of charlotte and made no secret of his 
liberalism 
probably some white voters had second thoughts about voting 
for harvey gantt race certainly played a role in that said neil 
newhouse of the republican polling organization the wirthlin group 
on election night helms came out 6 percentage points ahead and 
gloated over the turnaround from late polls that showed him 
trailing by as much as 9 percentage points 
there is no joy in mudville tonight helms told gleeful 
supporters the mighty ultraliberal establishment and 
commentators and columnists have struck out again 
sometimes even candidates rely too much on polls 
rep newt gingrich rga said he felt confident staying in 
washington for much of the campaign homestretch because of what his 
pollsters were telling him 
we thought frankly that based on what we were seeing that 
things were going pretty well gingrich said wednesday 
he won by less than a percentage point

patience has become the political bedfellow 
of ben nelson who was not ready to claim victory wednesday after 
narrowly defeating republican gov kay orr 
obviously im elated but ive got to tell you until those 
absentee ballots are counted im waiting said nelson who had 
to wait two months last spring before he was declared the victor by 
42 votes in the democratic gubernatorial primary 
with all but about 9500 absentee ballots counted nelson had 
286608 votes to orrs 281827 a recount would be required by 
state law if nelsons margin of victory dwindled to less than 1 
percent of his total votes 
the absentee ballots will be counted beginning thursday when all 
93 county canvassing boards meet secretary of state allen beermann 
said he expected the absentee ballots to follow the pattern of the 
counted votes 
but nelson 49 wasnt taking anything for granted in his first 
bid for public office 
its not over until its over said nelson an insurance 
attorney from omaha 
orr 51 the states first woman governor and the nations 
firest republican woman elected governor refused to concede defeat 
in her bid for a second term 
obviously it doesnt look very optimistic but we think we owe 
it to the more than 23000 volunteers to make saminfotechnology

prime minister vp singhs embattled 
government wednesday became the first ever ousted by a parliament 
vote collapsing under political divisions and controversy over 
religious and caste bloodshed 
following the vote singh convened his defeated cabinet to 
endorse his resignation letter to president ramaswamy venkataraman 
the two are expected to meet thursday 
we arent going with our heads down this is a struggle we 
struggled in government we will continue outside singh said 
the 11monthold coalition government was shaken by continued 
separatist struggles in kashmir and punjab states rising prices 
and singhs program to raise the government job quota for lowcaste 
hindus the policy launched widespread clashes and a wave of 
suicides among uppercaste hindus 
the government was ultimately crippled last month when a 
fundamentalist hindu group withdrew from the coalition in protest 
over a mosque dispute which has left more than 365 people dead 
the 11hour debate ended with a 346142 vote against the 
government with eight abstentions the vote was greeted with 
cheers and the thumping of desks 
it was the first time an indian government was ousted by a vote 
of parliament since independence in 1947 
the lok sabht unleashed every illicit force every raw 
nerve was exposed gandhi said this government has reduced the 
credibility of this nation in the eyes of the world 
indias rules of succession in the event of the governments 
fall are vague and leave some discretion to the president by 
custom venkataraman should give gandhi first chance to form a new 
government because his congress party is the largest 
gandhi has said he doesnt want the job right now and will 
support chandra shekhars breakaway janata dal faction chandra 
shekhar is known to have 58 supporters from the janata dal 
congress has 195 members in the 522member lok sabha 
unrest over hindu attempts to raze a mosque and build a temple 
on the site raged even while lawmakers met to oust singhs 
government 
four more people were killed in uttar pradesh state and a 
17yearold student burned himself to death in new delhi to protest 
the governments opposition to the temple project in ayodhya about 
300 miles east of new delhi fundamentalist hindus claim the 
460yearold mosque stands on the birthplace of the warriorgod 
rama they want to destroy the mosque and build a temple 
at least 368 people have died in the dispute since late october 
across india and others have been killed in related unrest in the 
neighboring nations of nepal bangladesh and pakistan 
singhs government lost its majority in parliament oct 23 when 
the rightwing bharatiya janata party withdrew following the arrest 
of its leader while on a crosscountry march to muster support for 
the temple 
singh said he does not oppose building a temple but he wouldnt 
allow the moslem holy place to be overrun he turned the issue into 
a battle to defend secularism against the hindu radicalism 
since singhs aug 7 announcement to guarantee about half of all 
civil service jobs to lowcaste hindus at least 67 students have 
committed suicide and 67 have died in street clashes with police 
about 82 percent of indias 800 million people are hindus and 12 
percent are moslem 
in jammukashmir state where moslem separatists seek autonomy 
at least 270 people have died this year about 600 have been killed 
in the northwestern punjab state in violence linked to a separatist 
struggle by sikh militants 
singh likened the new government to a 25horsepower vehicle 
being dragged backwards by a huge trailer he said chandra shekhar 
had no mandate from the people to be prime minister and accused 
him of political opportunism

germanys top police official confirmed the fears 
of many ordinary citizens when he said wednesday that the eastern 
half of the new nation could become a breeding ground for organized 
crime 
in recent weeks german news media have been filled with reports 
about crime bands moving into the former east germany to gain 
control of prostitution gambling and even garbage dumping 
the fears come at a time of upheaval in the former communist 
nation marked by skyrocketing unemployment and the virtual 
breakdown of the justice system 
rightwing extremism is also on the rise and gangs of rowdy 
soccer fans have been clashing outside hotly disputed games police 
shot to death one soccer fan last weekend in the troubled city of 
leipzig 
the developments in the five new states of former east 
germany are causing many of us to be concerned said hansludwig 
zachert president of the federal criminal police 
these transitional difficulties form an ideal breeding ground 
for organized crime zachert said during a forum discussion at 
the police headquarters in wiesbaden 
the federal criminal police known in german as the 
bundeskriminalamt are the german equivalent of the fbi 
like many other developments in the rapid unification completed 
on oct 3 violent and whitecollar crime have caught many former 
east germans off guard 
zachert called for stepping up the crimefighting efforts 
within a very short time 
under the communist regime an evervigilant secret police 
apprehended most people likely to step out of line the result was 
a low crime rate that left women and children free to walk the 
streets in complete safety any time of day or night in the country 
of 166 million 
all that began to change as the borders fell just a year ago 
friday west germans flooded eastward by the tens of thousands 
bringing criminals along with them 
in fact caretaker premier hans modrow even said late last year 
the berlin wall would stay up in part to keep out lawbreakers and 
illegal drugs 
complete statistics do not exist although the few available 
numbers start to tell the story 
in the first nine months of this year there were 1400 armed 
robberies and serious extortion cases in the former east germany 
three times as many for the comparable period in 1989 
seventyseven of them were bank holdups a once virtually 
unheardof crime 
financial scandals stemming from the july 1 merger of the two 
countries currencies are uncovered weekly 
mafia heading east is the way the influential newsmagazine 
der spiegel headlined its comprehensive report on the organized 
crime two months ago 
der spiegel said swindlers fences and con men were heading 
to east germany 
also the bigtime crooks from the organized crime gangs have 
discovered what is still east germany as a market der spiegel 
wrote 
zachert said front men were already operating in the former east 
germany they are trying to gain control over some urban areas in 
hope of turning them in to red light districts complete with 
illegal gambling 
the former east german regime once profited handsomely by 
selling dumping space to garbage companies from western countries 
the discarded products included toxic wastes 
zachert says there are signs that organized crime elements have 
been trying to muscle their way into the dumping arrangements to 
make huge profits 
he added that east germans eager to acquire westernstyle wealth 
quickly may be drawn to organized crime

six governors found themselves out of a job 
wednesday after elections that gave democrats a new hold on two 
highgrowth sun belt states florida and texas while producing 
republican surprises in the northeast and midwest 
the results in the governors races didnt fully satisfy either 
party but produced one clear winner independents former 
republicans running as thirdparty candidates won in connecticut 
and alaska 
voter anger over taxes and unease over the economy appeared to 
be behind some of the incumbents losses including the ousters of 
republicans bob martinez in florida kay orr in nebraska mike 
hayden in kansas and ed diprete in rhode island 
the democratic incumbents who lost rudy perpich in minnesota 
and james blanchard in michigan both were longtime political 
fixtures who were seeking third terms and whose personalities had 
become an issue 
this is simply an overpowering moment said john engler the 
republican winner in michigan a week ago he was far behind in the 
public opinion polls 
sen pete wilsons victory in california keeping the state in 
republican hands for a third term was the gops top priority 
party spokesman charles black said wilson defeated democrat dianne 
feinstein and now gets to appoint his own successor in the senate 
the victory also means republicans will have veto power when 
californias democraticcontrolled legislature draws new 
congressional district lines california stands to gain seven house 
seats as a result of population shifts and texas and florida also 
will pick up seats 
republicans captured five statehouses that had been in 
democratic control massachusetts ohio vermont michigan and 
minnesota 
massachusetts winner william weld had campaigned with a call for 
cutting state spending but he appeared to benefit most from 
lingering anger at retiring gov michael dukakis and a series of 
meanspirited remarks from democratic nominee john silber silber 
had called weld a backstabbing son of a bitch and an 
orangeheaded wasp and displayed startling anger in a network 
television talk show interview three days before the election 
democrats captured seven governorships from republican control 
they will replace retiring gop governors in texas new mexico and 
oklahoma as well as the incumbents unseated in florida kansas 
rhode island and nebraska 
one state was still in doubt and seemed likely to remain that 
way for a while 
arizona republican fife symington led narrowly over democrat 
terry goddard but he was below the majority required by a new 
state law passed in the turmoil of evan mechams impeachment two 
years ago 
writeins won enough votes to deny symington 50 percent of the 
vote the arizona law calls for a runoff but no one knew when it 
would be held 
overtime declared goddard the rules of this game havent 
been written yet 
the results produced a net decline of one governorship for the 
democrats to 28 and a drop of one for the republicans to 20 if 
symington prevails 
the gains were the independents in alaska former governor and 
nixonera interior secretary wally hickel and in connecticut 
lowell weicker reborn as an independent after losing his gop 
senate seat two years ago 
numbers and independents aside democrats looked like the bigger 
winners 
ann richards victory in texas was a stinging embarrassment for 
president bush who claims texas as his home and spent the last 
three days there stumping for republican clayton williams 
bush doesnt make any difference said mark gearan director 
of the democratic governors association he doesnt have any 
coattails and in some cases he burdened the candidates 
the overriding issue in texas appeared to be williams himself 
and the gaffes he committed in squandering a onceoverwhelming lead 
in the preelection polls the last straw may have come last week 
when the millionaire oilman offhandedly admitted he paid no income 
taxes in 1986 
williams acknowledged that his damage was mostly selfinflicted 
maybe im a little too open maybe straightforward williams 
said 
the loss of martinez to former democratic sen lawton chiles in 
florida was also an embarrassment to bush who had made three 
campaign visits to the state the victory gave democrats the chance 
to claim they have halted at least for now floridas clear 
trend toward republicans in recent years 
i think all republicans are breathing a huge sigh of relief 
because there was so much doomandgloom going on said michele 
davis director of the republican governors association 
obviously texas was a heartbreaker but michigan takes a little 
of that pain away 
gearan said democratic losses in ohio and michigan and the 
partys failure to regain illinois were in part due to a weakened 
economy and increased burdens on state governments as a result of 
10 years of republican presidents democrats he said were blamed 
for their states economic troubles 
we took the fall he said 
one of the most startling outcomes was in minnesota the winner 
republican arne carlson had been a loser in the gop primary but 
he was placed on the generalelection ballot just 10 days before 
the election when the gop nominee jon grunseth withdrew from the 
race amid allegations of sexual misconduct 
in victory carlson compared himself to lazarus the biblical 
character who rose from the dead

lech walesa said wednesday he will resign 
as chairman of the solidarity union he has led for a decade if he 
loses polands presidential election 
walesa has also said he will step down if he wins polands first 
popular presidential election on nov 25 his main opponent is his 
former adviser prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
walesa told solidaritys national commission meeting at its 
gdansk headquarters that the union will have to battle the new 
government to protect its interests and he does not want to be 
accused of seeking revenge 
the union will have to wage a fight and i do not want to lead 
this fight so that people will not say that i am taking revenge 
he said 
walesa was an unemployed electrician fired for his political 
activism when he took charge of a shipyard strike that led to 
solidaritys creation in august 1980 he has been chairman of the 
east blocs first independent trade union ever since 
walesa is considered to be the frontrunner in the sixway 
presidential contest if no candidate wins a majority the top two 
votegetters will compete in a dec 9 runoff 
meanwhile a government investigation into the former communist 
regimes attempts to thwart solidarity has uncovered a plot to 
kidnap walesa and raid the gdansk shipyard during the 1980 strikes 
the probe also found evidence that the communist government had 
been preparing for martial law as early as fall 1980 more than a 
year before the crackdown in october 1980 a list of activists to 
be interned was prepared including all the leaders of the 
thenopposition investigators said 
the secret police considered sending a police commando group 
to gdansk to kidnap walesa and strike committee members on aug 27 
1980 and bring them to warsaw interior ministry spokesman 
wojciech wroblewski said tuesday 
the next step would have been to pacify gdansk and the other two 
baltic port cities where the nationwide unrest was centered he 
said 
the plan was dropped and walesa signed historic agreements with 
communist authorities four days later legalizing the east blocs 
first independent trade union on aug 31 1980 
the report from the interior ministry now under the leadership 
of a civilian for the first time in five decades confirmed long 
circulated rumors concerning attempts to suppress solidarity 
since the creation of the solidarityled government last year 
the interior ministry has been overhauled the secret police have 
been disbanded

the democrats romp for control of 
redistricting cements the gop as the house minority for the 
foreseeable future and will allow democrats to draw local political 
lines to their advantage in many states 
the democrats gained a handful of new redistricting monopolies 
tuesday most significantly in florida and texas which will gain 
seven of the 19 house seats likely to shift in 1992 to reflect 
population shifts of the 1980s 
only republican pete wilsons win in the california 
gubernatorial race kept a disheartening day for the gop in the 
costly decadelong redistricting battle from turning to total 
disaster 
the greatest area of democratic victory was democratic 
party chairman ron browns assessment of the redistricting fight 
its hard to argue with him although republicans did 
our party is very well positioned not only for 1992 but for 
the rest of this decade said charles black chief spokesman for 
the republican national committee 
blacks assessment was based on the gops having a voice in 
redistricting for 231 of the 435 congressional districts roughly 
65 more than 10 years ago 
but given the overwhelming reelection rate of incumbents the 
true battlegrounds are in the states gaining or losing seats an 
area where democrats clearly will have an edge and for most of the 
1980s republicans said their chances of becoming the house majority 
and making inroads at the state legislative level rested on their 
success in redistricting battles this year 
overall democrats emerged from tuesdays vote with 
redistricting monopolies in 17 states republicans control the 
process outright in just three new hampshire utah and vermont 
none of them major redistricting battlegrounds 
democrats also have an edge of sorts in many of the states where 
power is shared because they control or were likely to control 74 
of the nations 99 legislative chambers a gain of five chambers 
eight states are expected to gain seats after the 1990 census 
and democrats control the redistricting process outright in five of 
those florida texas georgia north carolina and virginia 
by holding the sole pen in those states democrats should be 
able to protect their house incumbents while drawing 10 new 
districts favorable to democratic candidates 
california is projected to get seven new seats and arizona and 
washington one apiece to round out the gainers 
wilson will be able to veto any plan drawn by the democratic 
legislature which would send the fight to the courts the 
legislature next year will control the ink governor wilson will 
decide whether the ink dries or not said the gops black 
still courts have tended to side with legislatures so wilsons 
best bet might be to strike a deal with democrats 
the washington remap is done by a bipartisan commission control 
in arizona will be split with the outcome of the undecided 
governors race to decide which party gets two of the three seats 
at the table 
redistricting power is crucial in the states losing seats and 
therefore house incumbents too 
control is split in all of the big losers new york 
pennsylvania ohio illinois and michigan eleven of the 19 
shifting seats will come from these five states three from new 
york and two each from the rest 
at first glance it appeared republicans could boast about gains 
here by virtue of taking the governors office in michigan ohio 
and massachusetts from democratic hands and holding onto the top 
job in illinois 
but with the exception of massachusetts redistricting power was 
shared in those states even before tuesdays vote because of split 
control of legislative chambers 
two republicans and one democrat likely will be squeezed from 
new yorks house delegation while each party faces the loss of a 
seat in michigan illinois pennsylvania and ohio 
and massachusetts was likely to pencil out a democrat anyway 
when it loses a seat unless veteran republican rep silvio conte 
retires so the gops win in the governor race there while 
significant likely will not impact congressional redistricting 
democrats will decie who loses out when new jersey west 
virginia kentucky and louisiana each erase a house seat in two 
years power over the remapping is shared in the other states 
expected to lose a seat montana iowa and kansas democrats held 
none of the three seats at the redistricting table in kansas on 
monday but on wednesday had two the governors office and the 
kansas house

democrat ann richards once said president 
bush was born with a silver foot in his mouth in clayton 
williams she found an opponent capable of putting his foot in his 
mouth and shooting it too 
williams a millionaire republican oilman admitted as much 
wednesday after being beaten by richards in the texas governors 
race 
i just would shoot myself in the foot and then id load up and 
try it again williams said i hold no blame against anyone 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting richards had 
1909929 votes or 51 percent to williams 1813405 votes or 49 
percent 
williams campaign which spent more than 204 million had 
everything money could buy and enjoyed a 15point lead in the polls 
with just six weeks to go 
but he couldnt stop making the gaffes that dated bac to march 
when he likened bad weather to rape and said if it was inevitable 
just relax and enjoy it 
more followed and in the campaigns final week he made two 
major missteps 
first he admitted on a statewide tv broadcast that he didnt 
understand the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot 
concerned with gubernatorial appointments 
then friday with the polls opening in only 84 hours he 
acknowledged that he had paid no income taxes in 1986 
a cbstv exit poll said 25 percent of tuesdays voters made 
their choice in those last seven days 
williams said he didnt see defeat as rejection of his values 
but conceded maybe im a little too open maybe straightforward 
if theres anything that weve proven its that im not a 
politician 
for her part richards did many things well 
first she raised more money than skeptics had thought she 
could while being outspent nearly 2to1 she still raised more 
than 11 million putting her on a par with the 1986 candidates 
mark white and bill clements 
she mobilized women the cbs poll showed richards capturing 61 
percent of the womens vote including 21 percent of republican 
women 
she found issues that struck a nerve improving education 
getting control of soaring health insurance rates and her 
experience in government 
and she rallied the democrats she needed she carried east and 
south texas and the cbs poll found her winning 67 percent of the 
hispanic vote and 89 percent of the black vote 
down the ballot texas voters sent some mixed messages 
republican us sen phil gramm who reportedly may be readying 
for a 1996 presidential bid breezed to reelection with more than 
60 percent of the vote over democratic state sen hugh parmer of 
fort worth 
democrats again won many of the statewide offices theyve held 
for more than 100 years including lieutenant governor attorney 
general and comptroller 
but the gop in january will take control of two offices they 
havent held this century treasurer and agriculture commissioner

republicans celebrated their first gubernatorial 
victory in 20 years wednesday as the election of william weld a 
mildmannered former federal prosecutor helped massachusetts take 
on the longlost look of a twoparty state 
there was the notion that republicans just couldnt get it 
together said george bachrach a former democratic state 
senator that notion has been blown out the window 
the political tremor was felt not only in welds narrow victory 
over democrat john silber in the governors race but also in a 
dramatic power shift in the state senate 
the gop entered this weeks election holding just nine seats in 
the 40member body but unofficial returns wednesday boosted that 
number to at least 14 enough to sustain a veto and give weld some 
leverage against the democrats 
republicans also gave democratic officeholders some surprising 
scares such as the congressional races in which reps chester 
atkins and gerry studds both narrowly survived before joining the 
other nine house incumbents from massachusetts who were reelected 
the campaign took such a toll on atkins that he announced 
afterward he planned to step down as state democratic chairman 
there is only so much punishment any one individual can 
endure he said 
republicans had high expectations this year democratic gov 
michael s dukakis was not seeking reelection with his popularity 
and the state government both in a shambles after he lost the 1988 
presidential race 
both weld and silber on leave as boston university president 
offered voters sharp alternatives to the dukakis administration 
their contest drew a record number of voters for a 
nonpresidential election according to unofficial returns with 97 
percent of the precincts reporting approximately 227 million 
voters cast ballots for governor marking about a 70 percent 
turnout 
weld received 1140403 votes or 50 percent silber received 
1067103 votes or 47 percent independent high tech candidate len 
umina picked up 64048 votes or 3 percent 
i think there was a very antidemocratic spirit running in 
this state silber said 
a republican joseph malone will be watching over the purse 
strings as state treasurer filling a spot that democrat robert q 
crane filled for 26 years before his retirement this year 
there was a very clear mood among the public for a change 
said senate minority leader david locke people are absolutely 
fed up with whats going on they began to recognize the product of 
overwhelming oneparty control 
in ballot issues massachusetts voters rejected by a 32 margin 
a 12 billion tax rollback that critics said would plunge the 
feeble state economy into ruins 
and in boston activists trying to carve out a separate 
predominantly black city failed again at the ballot box the 
proposal has lost twice before and this time supporters failed in 
a nonbinding referendum that would have requested a feasibility 
study of the plan

the powerful leader of a black sect was arrested 
wednesday and charged with directing the slayings of 14 people 
including white devils who were slain in initiation rites and 
whose ears were cut off 
a federal grand jury here indicted yahweh ben yahweh god 
son of god in hebrew and 16 followers of his secretive 
miamibased yahweh cult for allegedly using murder fire bombings 
and extortion to build a business empire and keep followerng a hearing 
friday yahweh who faces up to 60 years in prison if convicted on 
all charges was expected to waive removal proceedings from 
louisiana said rubin 
four of the 17 defendants were still being sought according to 
the fbi 
the yahwehs consider themselves the true chosen people and 
yahweh ben yahweh is their selfappointed leader who in the past 
has referred to all whites as devils 
but recently the yahwehs who have claimed about 10000 members 
have diminished their antiwhite beliefs and have won a reputation 
as hard workers who built a modest empire of 27 small innercity 
businesses and properties the yahweh properties tax value is 
almost 3 million but the market value is believed to be more 
their enterprising spirit strict religious practices promotion 
of family values and strong opposition to drugs has won them 
support in many areas of the black community mayor xavier suarez 
recently attended a ribboncutting at a new yahweh store with 
yahweh ben yahweh who has also received civic honors for 
rebuilding the inner city 
but the indictment says the businesses were built in part by the 
threat of violence and by extortion of contributions from 
reluctant black neighborhoods the charges include fire bombing 
homes after people opposed fundraising efforts 
the sect first became widely known in 1986 when it took over a 
druginfested opalocka apartment complex violently evicting the 
residents and promising to make it into a crackfree haven two 
residents who resisted were shot to death and yahweh member robert 
rozier a former st louis cardinals defense end was convicted in 
the slayings 
rozier who could have faced the electric chair also 
confessed to two other killings and rubin said he agreed to 
provide much of the evidence against yahweh in exchange for a 
22year sentence 
most of the victims were yawheh members who left or opposed 
their leader according to the indictment some were shot others 
decapitated and some were beaten to death according to the 
charges 
but seven white men were killed by those applying to join the 
brotherhood entering the secret group within the sect required 
a ritual killing sometimes of a white devil 
yahweh ordered the ears cut off of some victims as proof they 
were killed according to lehtinen 
the threecount federal indictment naming yahweh and his 
followers accused them of racketeering racketeering conspiracy and 
extortion charges for crimes committed in dade and palm beach 
counties from 1981 to 1987

democrats boasted wednesday of a sun belt election breakthrough 
that could buoy their presidential prospects in 1992 republicans 
gained two late upsets to go with a win in california and claimed 
we didnt do too bad despite midterm setbacks 
still a democratic celebration was in full swing 
george bush is in a slide theres absolutely no question 
about it said ron brown chairman of the democratic national 
committee 
the white house saw it differently as a midterm election with 
something for everyone and said it could not be interpreted as a 
referendum on bushs popularity anyway 
for winners everywhere the day after brought exultation an 
overpowering moment said john engler elected governor of 
michigan in a long late count over democratic incumbent james 
blanchard 
from the disappointed there were generally gracious comments 
said democratic rep jim bates trailing narrowly in california 
if the voters decide to make a change thats what democracy is 
all about 
after weeks of talk that voters were angry about congress 
performance and ready to make changes about 96 percent of 
incumbents won reelection 
senate democratic leader george mitchell and house speaker 
thomas s foley their majorities strengthened in the 102nd 
congress went to work on an agenda for the next two years brown 
predicted it would center on economic themes 
the debate over the budget was the best thing that happened 
he said of the october political freeforall in which bush 
abandoned his nonewtaxes campaign pledge 
in the ensuing scramble democrats jumped on a theme of tax 
fairness depicting themselves as defenders of the middle class 
and republicans as protectors of the rich 
a day after the polls closed there were four races unsettled 
arizonas gubernatorial contest appeared headed for a runoff 
after neither democrat terry goddard nor republican fife symington 
amassed 50 percent of the vote in a threeway race

major congressional disappointment gop sen jesse helms 
biggerthanexpected reelection in north carolina 
democrats took seven governorships away from republicans 
including bushs home state of texas where ann richards vanquished 
clayton williams and florida where lawton chiles ousted gov bob 
martinez 
pete wilson defeated dianne feinstein to keep california in 
republican hands and the gop took away five statehouses from the 
democrats including ohio and michael dukakis massachusetts 
englers win was an upset and arne carlson won minnesota in a race 
so close it wasnt called until well after dawn 
with independents lowell weicker and wally hickel winning in 
connecticut and alaska democrats held 28 governorships for sure 
and the republicans 19 if the gop wins arizona where its 
candidate was leading narrowly but heading for the runoff that 
would mean a loss of one for each party 
both sides claimed gains in the race to control the 
redistricting of house seats before 1992 democrats emerged with 
complete control over reapportionment in texas and florida which 
together will gain seven seats and in 15 other states republicans 
have outright control in three states and wilsons victory gave 
then a share of the power with the democratic legislature in 
california which gains seven seats 
rep beryl anthony noted house democratic gains of two seats in 
the south and declared an end to the gradual move toward the gop 
there realignment is dead he said the republicans will 
have to find a new slogan 
you win some and you lose some shrugged bush spokesman 
marlin fitzwater and he and party spokesman charles black said 
republicans beat the historical averages for midterm losses by the 
party in the white house 
bush campaigned hard in texas and lost campaigned hard in 
california and won fitzwater added speaking of two key 
gubernatorial races 
but brown chortled that bush campaigned heavily for 18 
candidates and 14 of them lost asked why the democrats lost 
california he replied george bush didnt stay long enough 
outgoing ohio gov richard celeste tried to blame democratic 
gubernatorial losses in new england and the industrial midwest on 
republican economic policies democrats may be paying a price for 
the weakening of the national economy he said it would be 
ironic if those democrats who have been carrying the burden of 
republican parties for the last decade would pay the price for a 
recession 
fitzwater said bush was looking forward to working with the new 
democratic majorities in congress but also predicted the election 
results would not affect the presidents ability to sustain any 
vetoes 
it means the veto will continue to be a legislative strategy 
tool the presidents been very successful in that regard 
upholding some 16 vetoes in his first two years he said

alaskans have voted to again make private 
possession of marijuana a crime striking dwn the nations most 
liberal pot law 
fiftyfive percent of voters approved the measure 
for 15 years alaska law has permitted adults to possess less 
than 4 ounces of the drug in their homes and other private places 
ballot measure 2 will make possession of small amounts of 
marijuana a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a 
1000 fine the new law takes effect in late february 
its wonderful said marie majewske the anchorage 
grandmother who led the initiative campaign i have great faith 
in the people of this state i truly believed they would do the 
right thing 
i think that this will say to people that the law didnt work 
and we need to be looking in the other direction toward a 
drugfree environment for our children the only way to do that is 
to tell them its illegal 
the race was closer than most observers expected polls had 
shown the measure supported by a nearly 2to1 margin as late as a 
week ago 
it certainly doesnt look like a mandate does it said 
glenda straube campaign manager for alaskans for privacy which 
led opposition to the measure 
straube said the measure will be challenged in court based on 
the strong privacy clause in the alaska constitution 
weve had people around the state call and volunteer to be 
arrested for a test case she said

voter surveys said economic concerns were evident republican 
governors mike hayden of kansas kay orr of nebraska and martinez

sen bill bradleys close call seemed to reflect anger with a tax 
increase engineered by democratic gov jim florio 
there will be four new faces in the new senate the list 
includes republican reps bob smith of new hampshire hank brown of 
colorado and larry craig of idaho all of whom succeeded retiring 
gop lawmakers the fourth is paul wellstone a liberal who defeated 
rudy boschwitz in minnesota 
wilsons election in california will mean a republican 
replacement for his senate seat 
wilson won instant national standing with his victory while 
richards victory in texas and chiles in florida gave democrats 
their biggest wins of the night 
new republican governors include jim edgar in illinois william 
weld in massachusetts engler in michigan carlson in minnesota 
george voinovich in ohio and richard snelling 
new democrats include chiles richards zell miller in georgia 
joan finney in kansas ben nelson in nebraska bruce king in new 
mexico david walters in oklahoma bruce sundlun in rhode island 
and richards in texas 
the number of women in the house shrank by one to 28 in part

of minnesota who made sveral hundred long distance telephone calls 
to a female lobbyist on his government credit card 
republicans won a signal victory in massachusetts where they 
increased their minority strength in the state senate from nine to

an array of economic concerns aggravated by a 
heavy dose of voter exasperation left some political careers in 
ruins wednesday and others on the brink 
economic concerns are paramount in the minds of people said 
frank newport editorinchief of the gallup poll the deficit 
savings and loans increases in taxes recession worries about 
unemployment thats what people talk about when asked 
openended questions about their discontent 
although abortion did not play a consistent or decisive role in 
the elections it was mentioned much more frequently in exit polls 
this year than in 1988 in response to questions about what mattered 
most to people 
andrew kohut president of princeton survey research associates 
group attributed the higher frequency to the supreme courts 1989 
webster decision giving states more authority to restrict abortion 
it wasnt the dominant issue in every race but it was in the 
top tier in most of the key races kohut said its now an 
important basis by which people make choices about candidates 
in most parts of the country exit polls mirroring national 
polls suggested that economic themes were the dominant influence 
on voter decisionmaking 
the themes took a variety of turns 
six incumbent governors were ousted among them three who were 
blamed for higher taxes and two who suffered from the effects of 
slumping economies the same problem almost spelled doom for maine 
gov john mckernan 
and two potential democratic presidential contenders sen bill 
bradley of new jersey and gov mario cuomo of new york won by less 
than the landslides they had anticipated anger about higher taxes 
was a chief reason 
even in texas where the strong personalities of the 
gubernatorial candidates overshadowed other issues economics came 
into play particularly after multimillionaire republican clayton 
williams said he had paid no taxes in 1986 the information was 
perfect fodder for ann richards victorious populist pitch modeled 
on the fairness theme national democrats have been trying to 
push 
if youre going to look for one issue that seemed to have some 
clout in 1990 youd have to say it was taxes voters punished 
governors who raised taxes no doubt about it taxes continues to 
be an issue out there said stuart rothenberg publisher of the 
political report 
some analysts said governors were paying for the reagan 
administrations federalist policies 
reagan transferred the authority and the responsibility and 
the fiscal burdens to the states and the governors were forced to 
raise taxes said larry sabato an analyst at the university of 
virginia 
given the chance to raise taxes on themselves voters in four 
states said no 
they did however reject drastic tax cuts or government limits 
in four out of five states where such measures were on the ballot 
and at least two winning governor candidates illinois republican 
jim edgar and florida democrat lawton chiles carefully avoided a 
promise of no new taxes 
if you can convince people that tax money will be well spent 
they will vote for it said newport but he added that in 
general the american public is not in favor at this point of 
increased taxes more and more when we talk about congress people 
talk about ineptness and inability to get things done they dont 
think its efficient to send more money to people who are bungling 
and not managing it well 
voter restiveness over congress an election day poll put its 
approval rating at 18 percent translated into only a few surprise 
defeats but victory margins were lower and challengers nearly 
overcame apparently safe incumbents in kentucky maine georgia and 
elsewhere 
in addition turnout appeared to be slightly elevated in new 
england the region with the deepest economic problems 
clearly in new england where an independent candidate was 
elected governor in connecticut and a socialist was elected in 
vermont there was a lashing out at politicians said kohut in 
other areas of the country where things are not quite as bad 
there was less of that

president bushs struggle to put more 
republicans in congress was a resounding flop portending tougher 
battles ahead with democratic lawmakers and tripping warning alarms 
for bushs reelection campaign next year 
while the presidents men tried their best to put a positive 
spin on tuesdays elections some republicans grumbled they would 
have fared better had bush stuck by his nonewtax pledge 
the tax issue was the one thing the republicans had going for 
them and he gave that away and didnt replace it with anything 
complained lyn nofziger who was white house political director for 
ronald reagan 
hes got to begin to put his base back together nofziger 
said the base that elected him in 1988 is really kind of 
shattered 
gop political consultant john sears said bushs flipflop on 
taxes gave democrats a good campaign issue and emboldened them to 
challenge him 
democrats see there isnt any penalty for attacking the 
president sears said they were fairly docile for the first 
year or so 
david mason a political analyst for the heritage foundation 
said it was not bad for bush for an offyear election overall 
the big question was what would have happened if the president had 
stuck to his nonewtax pledge 
if he cant get a more defined message in 1992 than he did 
this year hes going to have a problem mason added 
in the most extensive midterm campaign of any president bush 
made 115 stops for republicans over the course of a year and helped 
raise nearly 90 million everywhere he implored americans to 
chase out the democrats from congress and the state capitals and 
put the republicans in charge 
voters ignored bushs plea 
democratic national chairman ron brown chortled that bush 
campaigned heavily for 18 candidates and 14 of them lost 
bushs reversal on taxes and the confusion about his position 
during the budget negotiations cost him dearly raising questions 
about his credibility and ability to govern 
his poll ratings dropped nearly 20 points then leveled off and 
began to inch back up before the elections 
generally speaking you dont win points by raising taxes 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater acknowledged thats 
been clear 
nofziger said bush has got some fencemending to do he cant 
afford to alienate people any further hes got to go get a hold of 
things again 
yet some analysts say bush should not be blamed for the losses 
particularly in states like texas where republican gubernatorial 
candidate clayton williamss campaign was plagued by clumsiness and 
misstatements 
it would be very hard to blame george bush for clayton 
williams defeat in texas said stephen hess an analyst at the 
brookings institution he did that all by himself 
ultimately all the candidates lost by themselves yesterday 
hess said 
democrats strengthened their hold on the house and picked up one 
seat in the senate with the defeat of republican rudy boschwitz of 
minnesota 
in the governors races democrats shoved republicans out of 
office in texas and florida two states where bush had campaigned 
hard fitzwater called the results two sentimental losses 
on the other hand republicans held on to the governors office 
in california the biggest prize of the midterm elections and in 
illinois they also picked up governorships in ohio and 
massachusetts california and ohio were deemed sentimental 
victories 
all in all fitzwater insisted it looks like a pretty 
standard offyear election that has something in it for 
everybody 
the democrats emerged with a stronger hand to battle bush on 
vetoes they are expected to have a 268167 majority in the next 
house and the senate lineup will favor the democrats 5644 
theres no question but that hell have to have a little 
more aggressive strategy and he may have to go to a veto 
strategy said ed rollins cochairman of the national republican 
congressional committee 
richard viguerie a hardline conservative leader said the 
elections should be a wakeup call for george bush he is in 
serious trouble the republican party under his leadership is 
in serious serious trouble 
ohios retiring gov richard celeste head of the democratic 
governors association said we have an opportunity to do what 
was inconceivable six months ago that is defeat a republican 
president 
the heritage foundations mason said the good news for bush 
is that a couple of his potential opponents didnt come out so 
well new jersey sen bill bradley is going to look a lot weaker 
on the national scene and new york gov mario cuomo didnt do 
nearly as well as anyone expected

the nations farm population dipped again last 
year but more people than ever were living in small towns distant 
suburbs and the rest of rural america the government reported 
wednesday 
farm people declined by 150000 to an estimated 4801000 in 
1989 a decrease described by the report as not a statistically 
significant difference from 1988 
the new estimate put the farm population at 19 percent of the 
us total of more than 2482 million people the smallest share on 
record 
in 1980 the 605 million on farms represented 27 percent of 
the 2217 million people in the united states and at the turn of 
the century the 1900 census showed 299 million living on farms 
393 percent of the population of 76 million 
the annual report was released by the census bureau of the 
commerce department and the economic research service of the 
agriculture department 
overall the rural population was estimated at more than 662 
million up from just under 648 million people in the 1988 survey 
the rural population includes those in living in the open 
countryside and small towns not in the suburbs of large cities 
large cities and their suburbs plus towns of 2500 or more are 
considered urban 
as used in the report the farm population consists of those 
living on farms in rural areas but does not include the relatively 
few who live on farms in urban areas a farm is defined as a place 
that sold agricultural products worth 1000 or more in the 
previous year 
felicia leclere of the economic research service one of the 
authors said there were no real surprises in this years figures 
the things that have come out have been longterm trends and 
none of them has been surprising she said in a telephone 
interview 
leclere cautioned that all the figures are subject to revision 
when the official 1990 census results are available next year she 
is confident that the annual figures are on track however 
department officials have noted the increase in rural population 
rising by 12 million people since 1950 and point out that urban 
sprawl and a willingness of city workers to commute greater 
distances have been important factors 
one possible effect of the 1990 census is a reclassification of 
some of these distant areas from rural to urban that could show up 
later as a slowdown in rural growth 
the report said the largest share of the rural population about 
44 percent continues to be in the south that has been the case 
since the first us census was taken in 1790 
although the regional distribution of the rural population 
changed only slightly in the last 40 years the regional 
distribution of the farm population shifted markedly the report 
said 
in 1950 onethird of all farm people lived in the midwest and 
slightly more than half in the south 
a rapid decline in the southern farm population rather than 
growth in the midwests farm population reversed the regional 
rankings the report said half of the total farm population 
now lives in the midwest and less than a third lives in the 
south 
other observations in the report included 
farm people continue to be older than the nonfarm population 
in general with a median of 38 years in 1989 compared with 325 
years for nonfarm a median age means half of the people are 
older half younger nonfarm refers to urban plus rural nonfarm 
people 
last year 974 percent of farm residents were white and 18 
percent were black compared with 84 percent white and 125 percent 
black in the nonfarm population the remainder were described as 
of other races 
only 29 percent of the farm residents were of hispanic origin 
nearly 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older were 
married and living with spouses in 1989 compared with 554 percent 
of the nonfarm people

ambitious democrats with white house dreams 
won their reelection campaigns but some will have to deal with 
homestate problems and live down embarrassingly small victory 
margins 
new york gov mario cuomo who has kept himself on everyones 
list of presidential hopefuls for most of a decade managed only 53 
percent of the vote in neighboring new jersey sen bill bradley 
anticipated a landslide but got only 51 percent against a political 
unknown 
that doesnt look like presidential timber in 1992 to me 
said charles black communications director of the republican 
national committee 
history shows close races or even losses at the state level 
dont drive a spike through a politicians heart richard nixon 
rebounded from losing the presidency and then the california 
governorship and went on to win the white house 
and national democratic chairman ron brown said that two years 
from now i cant imagine that anybody will be asked what 
perentage did you win by the last time you ran 
regardless of his margin cuomo must deal with massive budget 
problems in his home state before turning his sights on washington 
he kept quiet wednesday 
bradley once a national voice on tax policy kept mum through 
much of this falls congressional debates on the topic and became a 
target of backlash against gov jim florios tax increases 
voters were sending a message to florio through bradley said 
larry sabato an election expert at the university of virginia 
bradley on wednesday declared again that his only plans were to 
serve another six years as new jersey senator his media adviser 
michael kaye said the closeness of this years race will be quickly 
forgotten 
hes not a candidate in 1992 and if he becomes a candidate at 
a later date they sure wont go back six years and replay what 
happened in his race in 1990 he said 
exit polls by cbs in both new jersey and new york showed a 
plurality of voters thought cuomo and bradley would not make good 
presidents 
a big margin didnt guarantee a clear path to the primaries 
gov bill clinton of arkansas won handily with 57 percent of the 
vote but along the way he promised hed serve his fouryear term 
hed have to break that promise to seek the presidency in 1992 
rep richard gephardt dmo was reelected to his house seat 
he ran for president in 1988 and then was elected the house 
majority leader after promising not to run for the white house 
again in 1992 a pledge other house democrats have said theyd let 
him break 
prospects of another run for the democratic nomination by 
tennessee sen al gore certainly werent hurt by the fact he got 70 
percent of the vote 
now that its over ill sit down and think about running for 
president but i dont have any plans gore said i havent 
ruled it out at all 
sen tom harkin of iowa became the first democrat ever 
reelected in his state on wednesday harkin seemed to have the 
1992 iowa caucuses in mind 
i intend to be active in the next couple of years in the 
presidential process he said 
democratic chairman brown claimed wednesday that bush who 
seemed invincible a few months ago looked beatable in 1992 
i believe yesterday was a referendum on the leadership of 
george bush he failed that test it was in effect a no 
confidence vote for his domestic agenda 
he said send us more republicans the american people sent 
him more democrats i think george bush is frankly hurt brown 
said 
but black responded that bush wasnt on the ballot 
yesterday if he had and had faced the likes of cuomo or 
bradley they would have had their clocks cleaned he said 
on the republican side some winners probably had thoughts of 
succeeding bush in 1996 
the eventual presidential ambitions of republican sen phil 
gramm rtexas certainly were not dampened by his 62 percent 
margin in that important state 
republicans also took over the governorship of several longtime 
democratic states creating a new class of potential presidential 
candidates

acrid smell indeed tour driver larry made light of some of the 
damage 
we have a lot of great picturetaking opportunities on the 
tour today he said with a laugh

which flames normally leap through windows that facade wasnt 
damaged by the tuesday night blaze but other sets burned like 
kindling

voters made few changes in maines 
political scene but the states commerce was changed dramatically 
by the repeal of a blue law banning sales on sunday 
us rep joseph e brennan whos a former governor failed 
tuesday in his attempt to unseat republican gov john r mckernan 
voters reelected us sen william s cohen and sixterm us rep 
olympia j snowe both republicans 
the sunday sales question was forced to a vote through a 
petition drive bankrolled chiefly by the states major shopping 
malls and department stores 
supporters of the repeal argued that citizens should be allowed 
to decide for themselves whether they want to shop on sundays 
the opposition was led by smallstore owners who feared 
competition from larger businesses they argued repealing the law 
would commercialize a day that families can spend together 
maine and north dakota are the only states outlawing sales on 
sundays 
maines law closed stores with at least 5000 square feet of 
floor space except between noon and 5 pm on sundays between

after months of delays nasa will 
try to launch atlantis next thursday with a pentagon spy satellite 
that reportedly will gather intelligence information in the persian 
gulf 
nasa meanwhile also reported wednesday that a special 
investigative team found no pattern in a series of accidents 
involving shuttle equipment 
atlantis was supposed to blast off in july with the spy 
satellite but the shuttle was grounded by hydrogen leaks during 
the grounding the spacecraft reportedly was modified to spy on 
iraqi forces 
nasa had rescheduled the launch for friday after a fueling test 
last month found atlantis to be free of dangerous leaks the air 
force last week delayed the flight however because of undisclosed 
problems that arose during cargo testing 
columbia also crippled for months by leaking hydrogen was 
cleared for flight during a similar fueling test last week the 
national aeronautics and space administration plans to send 
columbia on its longdelayed astronomy mission in early december 
columbias sevenman crew has endured four launch attempts since 
may three of which were halted by leaking hydrogen in the final 
hours before liftoff improperly installed seals accounted for some 
of the leakage in the engine compartment 
the investigative team led by veteran astronaut john young 
identified nine accidents involving shuttle equipment during the 
past 13 months said william lenoir head of nasas space flight 
program in one case workers left a 9footlong aluminum beam in 
atlantis engine compartment last month resulting in minor damage 
they couldnt find a common thread that said the training was 
bad or the workers were sleepy or they were overworked lenoir 
said 
although the team found sometimes were a little sloppy the 
conditions observed did not differ from findings of earlier 
investigative boards during the past 1 years lenoir said 
the team recommended that more technicians be trained in 
specialized rather than generic jobs and that communications be 
improved among workers lenoir said 
a couple of the techs that they talked to felt like mushrooms 
that we perhaps dont often enough let the whole workforce know 
the big picture lenoir said 
the team also stressed the need for realistic scheduling lenoir 
said before hydrogen leaks crippled two of nasas three shuttles 
for example nasa planned nine launches for 1990 six will be 
achieved if atlantis and columbia go up as planned 
shuttle director robert crippen said the 1991 flight schedule 
still was being finalized 
were trying to lay out the flights using the experience base 
that weve had in the past so we can be more realistic and 
anticipate some things that are taking longer than what wed 
planned crippen said

money wasnt necessarily everything in this 
years elections as some lowspending candidates ousted incumbent 
governors and members of congress 
as usual however the overwhelming majority of incumbents with 
their huge fundraising ability were victorious 
one of the highest profile races saw sen jesse helms buying 
massive tv time and defeating democratic challenger harvey gantt 
the republican senator had raised 11 million as of the 
midoctober deadline for federal financial disclosure reports to 
gantts 6 million 
the overwhelming campaign finance advantage held by 
congressional incumbents dominated and controlled the races said 
fred wertheimer president of the campaign finance watchdog group 
common cause 
in some races however winners upset betterfinanced opponents 
notably paul wellstone over republican sen rudy boschwitz in 
minnesota former sen lawton chiles ousting republican gov guy 
martinez in florida and democratic challenger joan finney beating 
gov mike hayden in kansas 
in rhode island the tables were turned with republican gov ed 
diprete being outspent 21 and defeated by democrat bruce 
sundlun 
in texas democrat ann richards beat republican oilman clayton 
williams despite williams heavy spending incl million of 
his own money 
sen john kerry dmass withstood a challenge from wealthy 
businessman james rappaport after rappaport poured more than 3 
million in personal loans into his campaign kerry who reported 
raising more than 5 million as of midoctober still outspent 
rappaport who had raised 37 million by the same time 
today in massachusetts we have proven that money cant buy 
you a us senate seat kerry said after winning 
the outcome in the new jersey senate race was noteworthy for how 
close challenger christine whitman came to defeating incumbent 
democrat bill bradley despite bradleys huge spending edge 
bradley who spent 126 million to her 1 million according to 
figures supplied by their campaigns won by just two percentage 
points 
in a case similar to bradleys rep newt gingrich rga barely 
kept his seat against a much poorer challenger by midoctober the 
incumbent had raised 13 million against 274000 for democratic 
challenger david worley 
worley had problems with money he might have been able to 
beat gingrich easily with better financing said sabato 
but the overall pattern of incumbents raising the most money and 
holding their seats held true 
in the florida governors race chiles defeated martinez 
although chiles imposed a 100 limit on donations to his campaign 
while martinez had a 21 money edge over chiles the democrat by 
virtue of his reputation as a former senator was in a better 
position to do without the extra money than most challengers would 
need 
in minnesota wellstone beat boschwitz after a campaign in which 
the senator raised nearly 5 million by midoctober to less than 
800000 for wellstone 
our campaign really relied on the shoe leather power of just 
volunteers wellstone said 
victories such as wellstones show that money is not always 
the price of admission special circumstances mean that voters do 
what they want to do said larry sabato a professor of 
government at the university of virginia 
across the country however only 13 of 406 house members who 
had sought reelection were defeated not counting two undecided 
california races 
several of the 13 heavily outspent their victorious opponents 
including reps bill grant rfla roy dyson dmd john 
buechner rmo doug walgren dpa and robert kastenmeier

environmentalists say they are already 
preparing for 1992 following the defeat of californias landmark 
big green environmental initiative 
its going to be a longer battle than wed hoped said susan 
birmingham of the us public interest research group the 
challenge for us is to keep pounding away 
backers and opponents of big green offered conflicting 
explanations for its proposals defeat tuesday 
state chamber of commerce president kirk west cochairman of 
the campaign against the initiative said he thought his forces 
convinced the voters that it tried to do too much covered too 
many subjects 
but environmentalists said voters defeated big green because 
of unfounded fears fostered by opponents that it would hurt their 
pocketbooks activists vowed to press their cause 
big green would have provided 300 million in bond money to 
buy and preserve ancient redwood forests it aimed to slow global 
warming by curbing auto and other emissions and it would have 
banned oil development in state waters and barred pesticides 
suspected of causing cancer 
proponents who spent 45 million said the initiative would 
have saved californians several billion dollars a year in energy 
and health costs 
corporations including major oil companies based outside the 
state spent 10 million condemning the measure as an economic 
disaster its controls would have increased gas electricity and 
food prices while falling short of environmental cleanup goals 
they said 
three other environmental proposals were toppled along with big 
green which lost by a nearly 2to1 margin 
fiftythree percent of the voters opposed forests forever 
which would have restricted clearcutting of forests and authorized 
740 million in bonds for the purchase of oldgrowth redwoods 
two industry countermeasures to big green and forests 
forever with far weaker controls on timber and pesticides were 
also soundly rejected 
polls showed that the maze of four conflicting initiatives 
confused voters a hazard that analysts predicted could lead to 
general rejection of the measures 
i dont think that anybody who voted against big green voted 
for polluted air or cancercausing chemicals said bob hattoy of 
the sierra club 
state attorney general john van de kamp also a primary sponsor 
of the measure said voters were almost universally conservative 
when it came to spending money on new programs because of a 
confluence of events 
i think the invasion of kuwait the beginning of the 
recession the national budget crisis the state budget crisis 
all those things have scared people he said

the food and drug administration banned 223 
ingredients in overthecounter drugs wednesday saying 
manufacturers had offered no proof they were effective for problems 
they were supposed to treat 
the ingredients ranged from pine tar in dandruff fighters 
through dehydrated garlic in digestive aids to aspirin in 
medications for external use 
the fda did not ban the ingredients entirely just in certain 
uses for example aspirin may still be used in products for pain 
relief taken internally because it has been shown to be effective 
pain reliever 
the overthecounter drug industry said most of the ingredients 
already had been withdrawn but some familiar drugstore and 
supermarket products still will be affected the agency said 
for example tegrin lotion sold for use against psoriasis may 
no longer contain allantoin also packers shampoo and soap may not 
contain pine tar and donnagel used to treat diarrhea may no 
longer include atropine sulfate hyoscyamine sulfate and 
scopolamine hydrobromide 
the ban becomes effective in six months the agency said none of 
the ingredients posed a safety problem in any of the banned uses 
the ruling is part of an 18yearlong review of about 300000 
nonprescription products that were on the market in 1972 
as part of its effort to complete that review the agency last 
week proposed to ban 111 drug ingredients in overthecounter diet 
products most companies have stopped using those ingredients 
industry officials said 
manufacturers have been on notice since may that the agency 
wanted to ban the list of 223 ingredients and most have 
reformulated their products said jack walden a spokesman of the 
nonprescription drug manufacturers association 
overwhelmingly this is a housekeeping action he said 
the industry long ago came into compliance it affects 
products now on the market very very little 
dean siegal a spokesman for block drug co inc which makes 
tegrin lotion for psoriasis said the company has been 
reformulating its product and expects to have a new one out soon 
this is not new news he said 
but walden said that some companies disagree with the fdas 
assertion that the action was being taken based on the absence of 
substantive comment or failure to submit new data 
some of our companies disagree that they failed to submit data 
and are in contact with fda on this matter walden said 
he did not identify those companies the products or 
ingredients 
other banned ingredients are used in among other things 
topical acne drug products antiperspirant products cough and cold 
medications laxatives nailbiting and thumbsucking deterrents 
poison treatments asnd drug products used to help people stop 
smoking 
within a few months the agency expects to be about halfway 
through the massive review of nonprescription products it began in 
1972 said spokeswoman bonnie aikman

prime minister margaret thatcher in a fighting 
mood amid talk of a move to oust her on wednesday defended her 
brake on the european communitys drive toward closer unity 
you dont secure the sort of europe we want by a policy of 
always going along with what others propose simply for fear of 
being left out mrs thatcher said in a major speech after the 
opening of a new yearlong session of parliament 
we want to work closely with our european friends but we 
also want to preserve our national currency and the sovereignty of 
this house of commons she said 
on the gulf crisis she declared time is running out for 
saddam hussein either he gets out of kuwait soon or we and our 
allies will remove him by force and he will go down to defeat 
rankandfile conservative party legislators waved their 
programs in support as mrs thatcher rose to address the commons 
for the first time since her deputy sir geoffrey howe resigned 
last thursday in protest of her combative stance on europe 
howe who remains a legislator listened impassively from near 
the back of the packed rows of leather benches behind the prime 
minister 
opposition leader neil kinnock twitted mrs thatcher that her 
government is divided right through the middle 
the british people will get rid of you at the general election 
as soon as you have the guts to call it he shouted struggling 
to make himself heard above the jeers of conservative legislators 
the badtempered exchanges erupted hours after queen elizabeth 
ii opened the parliamentary session with the traditional glittering 
pageantry 
the monarch dressed in a flowing white gown and red robe and 
wearing the jewelencrusted imperial crown outlined an 
exceptionally light legislative program for the coming year in a 
speech written by the government 
proposals included a measure to permit privately financed road 
building and new antiterrorism legislation for northern ireland 
the government also will reintroduce a bill that would allow it to 
try suspected nazi war criminals the measure was previously 
defeated in the unelected house of lords 
the slim legislative program would leave mrs thatcher free to 
call an election next year a year before her third fiveyear term 
expires 
however with a dispute over the pace and extent of european 
union on top of economic troubles the conservatives are running 
as much as 20 points behind labor in opinion polls 
the annual election among tory legislators for the party leader 
who is automatically the prime minister is set for nov 20 
mrs thatcher moved it from dec 5 and the new date was widely 
seen as a move to cut short campaigning time for rivals 
but the halfdozen potential heavyweight rivals who include 
howe and exdefense secretary michael heseltine have said they 
will not challenge this year they apparently fear they cannot get 
sufficient votes 
mrs thatcher isolated 11to1 in the european community 
rejected a plan approved at a summit meeting last month for a 
single currency and closer political ties she sees the moves as a 
surrender of parliaments sovereign powers

the fact that id had a gay life and tht i understood what gay 
sex was about 
it was a real acknowledgment of the fact that id been 
surrounded by people that i really adored and was actually 
sexually attracted to who were men and that side of me that 
responded to those people was a passive side a subordinate side

the last us game of the world chess 
championship began wednesday with organizers and aficionados 
declaring the american segment of the tournament a success 
defending champion garry kasparov and challenger anatoly karpov 
were tied at 55 before game 12 began 
each of the players won one game there were nine draws 
there was a lowered expectation about turnout when we started 
but weve been delighted at how many people showed up from all over 
the world said adam black a spokesman for championship 
organizers interest has not waned people have called and come 
from all over 
the second half of the championship begins nov 24 in lyons 
france the first player to gain 12 points wins the championship 
and 17 million of a 3 million purse opening ceremonies in 
france were scheduled for nov 23 
serious chess players and casual observers paying 25 to 100 
for tickets crowded the hudson theater and adjoining hotel 
macklowe in midtown manhattan during each of the 12 games in new 
york 
several analysis rooms where chess grandmasters explained and 
dissected moves were filled almost every night about 500 
journalists covered some or all of the games 
grandmaster patrick wolff who did commentary during the 
matches said the biggest surprise was the disparity in the games 
wolff said that the first four games could be considered the 
best first four games in world championship history but games six 
through nine were terrible he said the final games were a 
slight improvement wolff said 
chess experts had expected kasparov to maintain a substantial 
lead over karpov but karpov surprised them by more than holding 
his own wolff said 
the two known for their dislike of one another nonetheless 
were polite during the 12 matches in new york 
theyve been cordial to each other said wolff of course 
they dont like each other but theyve played so much theyre used 
to each other

democrats pointed wednesday to their 
strengthened majorities in the house and senate as evidence of a 
new mandate to carry their fairness theme forward in 1991 
with house democrats padding their 259176 edge by an expected 
nine seats and senate democrats expanding their majority by one in 
tuesdays elections the party held its tightest grip on 
legislative power in more than a decade 
i think the issue of fairness and balance of burden sharing 
was well received said house speaker thomas foley dwash and 
that will be reflected in any new tax legislation that may arise 
next year 
foley said in a telephone interview that he was not predicting 
new taxes but added some would predict the surcharge on 
milliondollar incomes has not disappeared from the scene 
he said democrats also saw the election results as impetus to 
pursue their agenda of health care education and infrastructure 
improvements in the coming session of congress 
republicans dismissed any notion that the outcome represented a 
mandate they said their losses were a victory of sorts because 
they fell short of the level normally suffered by the party that 
holds the white house in nonpresidential elections 
the democrats also took aim at president bush 
americans read george bushs lips yesterday and they made it 
clear they didnt like his message said rep beryl anthony 
dark chairman of the house democratic campaign committee 
all over the country voters snubbed candidates bush 
campaigned for showing bush has no coattails anthony said at a 
postelection news conference 
democratic national committee chairman ron brown called the 
congressional budget debate that ended barely a week before 
election day the most significant issue in this years voting and 
in particular the idea of taxing those most able to pay 
george bush clearly demonstrated that they are on the side of 
the rich and we are on the side of the working man and woman 
said brown reiterating a familiar theme that the party believes is 
working to its advantage 
brown said democrats owed their success to an agenda that calls 
for aid for education jobs and health care voters looked to 
democrats to fight for the breadandbutter issues that bush finds 
so distracting and beneath him 
the results reflect an antiincumbent sentiment and the 
incumbent who turned out to be the biggest target was the 
president said sen john breaux dla head of the partys 
senate campaign arm 
house minority leader robert michel rill said the losses 
werent due to any kind of national trend i dont think or 
issue so much as it was something about each individual 
member 
but michel added it sure as heck doesnt make the job any 
easier of carrying forward bushs legislative agenda in the next 
two years 
democrats also were gleeful at the close call suffered by rep 
newt gingrich the combative no 2 republican leader in the house 
gingrich won by less than 1000 votes and his democratic opponent 
david worley requested a recount 
the ambush by worley clearly caught gingrich by surprise one 
gop official said the georgians polls showed him ahead with 57 
percent support just a few days before the election 
newt gingrich now becomes target no 1 for 1992 if he wins the 
recount anthony said 
the outcomes in two california districts remained up in the air 
with two democratic incumbents reps doug bosco and jim bates 
trailing by narrow margins 
if those seats were to fall the way they were leaning the final 
house lineup for the 102nd congress would be 268 democrats and 167 
rpublicans 
several races remained subject to possible recounts including 
the 52vote margin by which joan kelly horn a democrat appeared 
to have defeated twoterm republican rep jack buechner 
in the senate the only shift was in minnesota where college 
professor and political unknown paul wellstone dealt a stunning 
upset to twoterm republican incumbent sen rudy boschwitz that 
left the democratic majority at 56 to 44

californias new governor republican pete 
wilson is heading to the capitol in sacramento surrounded by 
democrats in most top state offices and facing a hostile 
legislature 
with a handful of precincts and an estimated 500000 absentee 
ballots remaining to be counted wednesday wilson had 3473487 
votes or 49 percent to democrat dianne feinsteins 3287109 
votes or 46 percent three minor party candidates divvied up the 
remaining 5 percent 
but democrats increased their majorities in both houses of the 
legislature won five other statewide offices and were leading 
narrowly in a sixth statewide race 
in state and local ballot propositions voters said no no 
to environmental initiatives no to all state and most local tax 
increases no to an unprecedented number of bond issues and no to 
the existing leadership of the legislature 
the omnibus big green environmental initiative proposition 
128 was defeated by a 21 margin big green was a sweeping plan to 
phase out cancercausing pesticides ban chemicals that harm the 
ozone and reduce emissions of gases that contribute to global 
warming 
but voters also rejected two alternative initiatives by timber 
and agricultural interests and proposition 130 a parallel forest 
protection measure 
pennyadrink and nickeladrink alcohol tax increases a 
statewide sales tax hike for anticrime programs and 12 of 14 
statewide bond issues were defeated by voters in the first massive 
rejection of statewide bonds in california history 
santa clara county voters rejected a proposal to raise utility 
taxes to finance a stadium to lure baseballs san francisco giants 
altogether 22 of the 28 statewide propositions were turned 
down of all of the highprofile statewide initiatives the only 
one that passed proposition 140 had a strong negative message to 
politicians of both parties 
proposition 140 will force every current member of the state 
legislature out of office by either 1996 or 1998 eliminate 
legislative pensions and slash the legislatures budget and staff 
by about 40 percent 
for the 57yearold wilson who unsuccessfully sought the 
governors office twice before in 1978 and again in 1982 before 
switching to a successful race for the us senate his victory is 
not without some dark political clouds 
wilson faces an estimated deficit of 500 million to 2 billion 
in the state budget he must submit five days after his jan 7 
inauguration and he faces a legislature in which leaders of both 
parties fought the term limits measure which wilson endorsed 
as close as the governors race was the race between democrat 
arlo smith and republican dan lungren for attorney general was 
tighter the winner may not be known for another week 
with 99 percent of the vote counted smith led lungren 47 
percent to 46 percent election officials said as many as 500000 
absentee ballots which traditionally favor republicans remained 
to be counted 
controller gray davis and secretary of state march fong eu both 
democrats were also reelected davis defeated eus republican 
son matt fong for controller 
democratic challenger kathleen brown the daughter of former 
gov pat brown and sister of former gov jerry brown defeated 
republican incumbent thomas hayes for treasurer 
although democrats won the lions share of california races 
tuesday wilsons victory as governor gives republicans hope for 
some gains in 1992 since he will hold veto power over the new 
districts which must be drawn next year to reflect population 
shifts in this years federal census 
californias congressional delegation will increase from the 
current 45 to 52 or more seats in 1992

william j bennett is resigning as the first 
director of the office of national drug control strategy after 
leading what the white house called a turnaround in the battle 
against the drug scourge 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush will 
formally accept bennetts resignation in a ceremony at the white 
house on thursday 
fitzwater denied that the resignation was prompted by threats 
saying that bennett has lived with threats of a kind ever since 
day one of the job 
a successor for the job has not been named the spokesman said 
bennett leaves office only two weeks after another senior 
administration official secretary of labor elizabeth dole became 
the first member of bushs cabinet to resign 
bennett a former secretary of education became director the 
nations antidrug efforts at the beginning of the bush 
administration he helped to coordinate some 27 departments and 
agencies involved in the drug war 
the president feels that bill bennett has provided 
extraordinary leadership and service to the country during his 
tenure as drug czar said fitzwater 
two years ago this country viewed this problem as impossible 
to deal with and with no end in sight the spokesman said 
today there has been a turnaround there is strong bipartisan 
support in the congress for drug programs and there is growing 
evidence that society is beginning to turn away from the drug 
scourge 
however leading house democrat john conyers jr of michigan 
said bennett was the personification of a drug strategy of the 
last 10 years that failed 
conyers chairman of the house government operations committee 
that created the drug office said bennetts resignation provides 
the opportunity for someone without bennetts partisan 
politicizing more sensitive to the problems of the chronically 
addicted minorities and the poor in urban areas and cognizant of 
the need for economic rather than military foreign drug 
assistance 
an administration official who ask not to be identified said 
that bennett feels he has done all that he told the president he 
would get done he feels hes done what he came to do in the job 
and it was time to get on with his life 
lee i dogoloff executive director of the nongovernmental 
american council for drug education said that bennetts plans to 
leave have been rumored for some time among groups in americas 
war on drugs 
its not surprising said dogoloff i talked to him 
several months ago and he said then that he had not taken a 
lifetime assignment 
dogoloff said that many in the field give bennett high marks for 
accomplishment during the 20 months since he was confirmed as the 
nations first drug czar the position was created in the antidrug 
abuse act of 1988 
he can feel good that the numbers are turning around in the 
drug war said dogoloff we havent solved the problem by any 
means but the data shows it is getting better 
recent reports show that the number of patients treated for drug 
overdose in the nations hospitals has gone down and that there is 
a reduction in the purity of cocaine available on the streets 
dogoloff said that professionals regard these as important signs 
that the drug problem is trending downward 
threats against bennett have intensified in recent days but an 
official said they have always been there 
there was a nut who called in and there were bomb threats 
when he was in alaska he said they did beef up security 
some bennett campaigned in alaska for a law that would make 
illegal the possession of small amounts of marijuana 
i dont think these threats influenced his decision to leave 
hes tough as nails but he does have a family said the 
official 
anybody who has that job is a target said dogoloff 
bennett is married and has two small children 
published reports have suggested that bennetts replacement may 
be former district of columbia superior court judge reggie walton 
who is now associate drug control director for state and local 
affairs in bennetts office 
the washington times said former dc police chief maurice 
turner defeated tuesday in a bid for washington mayor is also a 
possible candidate for the job

universal television has long been a steady moneymaker the film 
division has had ups and downs but periodically produces block

prime minister nawaz sharif lifted 
pakistans 3monthold state of emergency on wednesday his first 
day on the job 
the emergency which gave the army sweeping powers to suspend 
individual rights to maintain law and order was imposed on aug 6 
hours after benazir bhuttos government was dismissed for alleged 
corruption 
in a speech broadcast on state television and radio sharif said 
he wanted the new government headed by his rightwing islamic 
democratic alliance to begin in an open atmosphere of human 
freedom 
democracy and fundamental rights are synonymous there is no 
justification for continuing the emergency during the tenure of an 
elected government coming to power with the support of the 
masses sharif said 
president ghulam ishaq khan declared the emergency shortly after 
ejecting ms bhuttos government on charges of corruption 
incompetence and abuse of power he cited internal and external 
threats 
the emergency would have expired in another month 
sharif a wealthy 41yearold industrialist was a protege of 
gen mohammad zia ulhaq who ruled pakistan for 11 years until his 
death in a still unexplained plane crash in august 1988 
as chief minister of eastern punjab the powerhouse of pakistani 
politics sharif was ms bhuttos chief rival during her 20 months 
in power 
he orchestrated the alliances overwhelming victory over ms 
bhutto and her populist pakistan peoples party in the oct 24 
parliamentary elections 
sharif was elected prime minister on tuesday commanding 
twothirds of the 217member national assembly or the lawmaking 
lower house of parliament he was sworn in later that day as the 
head of pakistans fifth freely elected government in 43 years 
with the transfer of power completed sharif said the emergency 
was no longer necessary 
it does not behoove an elected prime minister to depend on the 
crutches of extraordinary laws to maintain law and order in the 
country he said in the speech delivered in the urdu language

iraqs information minister reacting to 
a saberrattling speech wednesday by british prime minister 
margaret thatcher said she was mentally unbalanced and possessed 
by the devil 
in a statement carried by the official iraqi news agency 
minister latif nassayif jassim said mrs thatchers statements in 
general on the gulf crisis were hysterical in tone and did not 
befit the office of prime minister 
her speeches filled with rancor and hatred toward the iraqi 
people and her continued calls for beating the drums of war 
unequivocally show beyond a shadow of a doubt that this woman 
has lost her mental balance the statement said 
jassim said the only explanation for a woman advocating war was 
that the devil has found a comfortable dwelling within her mind 
and conscience 
the iraqi minister said his country viewed mrs thatchers 
statements with disdain and indifference and that her 
popularity in britain would not be boosted by fighting or calling 
for war 
in parliament on wednesday thatcher warned iraqi president 
saddam hussein that he will face a military strike if he does not 
withdraw his troops from kuwait 
the implacable message of this house must be either he gets 
out of kuwait soon or we and our allies will remove him by force 
and he will go down to defeat with all the consequences she 
said he has been warned 
britain has about 10000 troops with 120 tanks in saudi arabia 
as well as 10 warships enforcing the un trade embargo imposed on 
iraq after it seized kuwait on aug 2

a sothebys auction of contemporary art brought 
in 199 million about half the amount expected in an end to a 
recent price explosion the auction house said 
sothebys had expected the tuesday sale to bring 396 million 
to 52 million 
the contemporary art market over the last few years has been a 
price explosion and what we have seen tonight is a return to price 
levels of about november 1988 said diana phillips a spokeswoman 
for sothebys 
the sale of 34 works of contemporary art brought prices back to 
earth phillips said forty three other pieces did not draw minimum 
bids and were not sold 
the highlight of the auction was a 1961 work by american artist 
robert rauschenberg third time painting it fetched 308 
million from a private european collector said phillips the 
estimate on the rauschenberg was revised downward monday from 
45 million to 34 million 
the rauschenberg showing a clock a chain a shirt and a broken 
bottle neck is combines oil paper fabric wood metal and glass 
the sale of other works also reflected the soft market pulling 
down prices that increased about 20 times since 1984 most 
dramatically in the past two years phillips said 
the second highest price of the evening 26 million came 
for french painter jean dubuffets maison sondee a 1961 paris 
scene the oil on canvas was bought by a chicago dealer 
the third highest priced work auctioned for 23 million was 
another dubuffet vaches au pre the oil on canvas painted in 
1954 depicts one of dubuffets favorite subjects cows 
the american painter cy twomblys 1967 oil on blackboard 
untitled sold for 19 million 
most of the sale was bought by private collectors who are 
serious and committed phillips said the speculators who have 
been present during the price explosion were completely absent from 
tonights activity 
many of the lots that did not sell were by artists whose works 
have gained quickly in value over the last few years she said

many hundreds more combat troops from the 
marine corps reserve are likely to be ordered to active duty for 
operation desert shield an official said wednesday 
the marines on tuesday said 824 reservists including 633 combat 
specialists were being activated to become part of a specially 
tailored 5th marine expeditionary brigade that is undergoing desert 
warfare training in california 
those were the first combat reserve forces to be put on active 
duty in the persian gulf crisis 
col russell appleton head of manpower policy and planning at 
marine corps headquarters said in an interview wednesday that 
reserves will be used to help form expeditionary brigades to 
replace units scheduled to rotate out of the gulf area 
the marines have not said when the first units deployed in 
desert shield will return home but it appears some may be brought 
back after serving about six months 
appleton said the callup of reservists for the 5th marine 
expeditionary brigade is a model of how marine combat reserves are 
expected to be used for desert shield 
youre seeing the tip of that spear of reserve deployments 
he said adding that he could not comment on any reserve callups 
beyond those announced tuesday 
fiftyseven percent of our force is overseas he said if 
youve got to replace that force then the math says there arent 
enough active duty units out there to do that and so a sizeable 
number of reserves will be needed 
defense secretary dick cheney has authorized the marines to call 
as many as 3000 reserves to active duty for 90day periods

only hours before the explosion of more than 100 pounds of dynamite 
packed into a sedan 
the group occupied the office in the predominately christian 
sector after the oct 13 downfall of rebel christian gen michel 
aoun there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the 
bombing in the aukar area

until jan 30 when aouns forces ousted geageas troops from the 
metn mountains

identified the victims as the owner of a bakery and his two 
children among the injured were three lebanese reporters working 
for the conservative daily addiyar

president elias hrawis government on 
wednesday set a 10day deadline for christian and moslem militias 
to withdraw from beirut so that the city can be reunited as a 
demilitarized zone 
unifying the warbattered capital divided into christian and 
moslem sectors since april 1975 is a key element in an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan to end lebanons protracted civil war 
a statement issued after a twohour cabinet meeting said the 
final stage of creating a demilitarized greater beirut will 
begin on saturday and is scheduled for completion nov19 
the major militias on both sides agreed to withdraw their 
fighters and weapons from the city after the syrian army crushed 
christian gen michel aoun on oct 13 removing the main obstacle 
to the peace plan 
but wednesdays statement was the first time the government has 
set a deadline for the reunification process that began immediately 
after aoun was defeated in a fierce eighthour battle that left at 
least 550 people dead 
in the last few weeks much of the green line that divided the 
capital has been dismantled and there are no longer any 
restrictions on travel between the christian eastern sector and the 
moslem west side 
wednesdays statement did not specify the exact boundaries of 
greater beirut 
but earlier statements by government officials said it would 
extend from the dog river north of beirut to the damour river south 
of the city and six to nine miles inland from the mediterranean 
the government did not say what would happen if its deadline was 
not met but the syrians the main powerbrokers in lebanon have 
40000 troops in the country and have pledged hrawi all the backing 
he needs to implement the peace plan 
hrawi is trying to rebuild the lebanese army for years 
fractured along sectarian lines at present military sources said 
he has an effective combat force of only about 9000 moslem troops 
under his army commander gen emile lahoud 
until he can reunify the army which had a nominal overall 
strenth of about 42000 hrawi will be dependent on the syrians for 
his military muscle 
although the main militias have gone along with the plan to 
demilitarize the capital most are hesitant about handing over 
their weapons and disbanding so state authority can be extended 
over more of the country 
the main militias are the rightwing christian lebanese forces 
a prosyrian splinter faction called the lebanese forcesexecutive 
authority the proiranian shiite moslem hezbollah or party of god 
the rival syrianbacked shiite amal movement and the druse moslem 
progressive socialist party 
wednesdays statement said any attempt to obstruct or stall 
the process of creating greater beirut will be dealt with severely 
there shall be no tolerance 
it said justice minister edmond rizk had been authorized to take 
legal procedures to confiscate 116 million and several million 
french francs in local and foreign bank accounts held by aoun and 
his aides 
aoun took refuge at the french embassy on oct 13 and france has 
granted him asylum 
but the government has said he will not be allowed to leave 
before he faces trial on a variety of charges including the 
alleged theft of 75 million of state funds

a supporter of retired gen efrain rios 
montt has lodged a lastditch appeal to block sundays presidential 
election because the former dictator is barred from running an 
official said wednesday 
rios montt was banned by the courts because the constitution 
bars candidates who previously took power by force the latest 
appeal is given little chance of success 
prior to the ban polls showed rios montt as the leading 
candidate for president winning support among voters tired of 
corruption and crime 
the directorgeneral of voter registration felix castillo 
milla said he has passed the petition for nullification to the 
supreme electoral tribunal the tribunal has three days to act on 
the petition which was filed by francisco fuentes parra a 
legislative candidate who supports rios montt 
president vinicio cerezo who finishes his fiveyear term jan 
14 is the first civilian elected president in 17 years in this 
country shaken by a leftist guerrilla insurrection for the past 
three decades 
rios montt headed a military junta that overthrew president 
fernando romeo lucas garcia an army general elected as president 
in march 1982 the military forced rios montt out of power in 
august 1983 
rios montt has accused cerezo of planning to fix the elections 
in favor alfonso cabrera hidalgo the presidential nominee of 
cerezos centrist christian democrats 
 
rios montt claims he was robbed of victory when he ran for 
president on the christian democratic ticket in 1974 with the 
election fixed to put conservative gen eugenio kjell laugerud in 
power 
the former dictator has now broken with the christian democrats 
he has been trying to run at the head of a ticket by a threeparty 
conservative coalition

aides to sen jesse helms said wednesday 
that the incumbents victory showed that he represents north 
carolinas conservative values 
for his part defeated democrat harvey gantt said he may have 
underestimated the impact race would have in the election 
i think that it just shows that the people in this state 
are traditional conservatives and that sen helms represents their 
traditional family values said helms spokeswoman beth burrus 
i think with the strong voter turnout you can definitely say 
that the people in this state want sen helms representing them 
it was a classic campaign between a conservative and a 
liberal the turnout which topped 60 percent gave you a true 
picture of what north carolina wanted 
gantt whos black and a former charlotte mayor said he knew 
that race would be a factor but did not realize it would be such a 
key factor 
we have always factored in the fact that race would probably 
play a role in this election we obviously may have 
miscalculated on how much it would play a role gantt said at a 
news conference in charlotte 
he said he had pledged not to raise race as an issue and we 
didnt sen helms did he said 
state republican party chairman jack hawke said late polls and 
the late adjournment of congress that gave helms only eight days of 
fulltime campaignin helped fire up the helms forces 
all we heard out in our areas was that helms couldnt be 
beat hawke said people would want to know why we were so 
worried because helms was going to win 
but then there was that late poll that showed helms behind by 
8 percent and all of a sudden people were calling us asking what 
they could do hawke said and just about the time people were 
starting to get interested helms came back from washington and got 
our people stirred up 
state democratic party chairman lawrence davis said the gantt 
campaign despite the loss had helped pull together factions 
within the party 
i think were more unified today than weve been in a long 
while davis said people are disappointed to be sure but you 
dont have the bickering we had after 1988 when groups were 
pointing fingers at each other 
gantts 48 percent share of the vote was the same as former gov 
jim hunt who lost to helms in 1984 on tuesday helms garnered 
1080208 votes to 974701 for gantt 
in the end hawke said voters saw the senate race in 
conservative and liberal terms 
i think if gantt had been a little more of a moderate helms 
would have been in real trouble hawke said but the choice was 
between two people who were at opposite ends of the spectrum

black nationalist nelson mandela on wednesday 
accused the west of hypocrisy and prejudice in responding to 
kuwaits occupation saying iraq is being singled out because its 
people are brownskinned 
mandela deputy president of the african national congress said 
western governments had made no objections when us forces invaded 
grenada or panama and had tolerated the israeli occupation of arab 
territory 
but now the whole of the west is screaming and sending 
armies because of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait mandela said 
he emphasized that he did not condone iraqs actions and 
expressed hope the confrontation could be solved peacefully 
mandela however suggested that iraq was being treated 
differently because its people were brownskinned 
during his international tours to raise support for his 
organization mandela has generally avoided comments apt to stir 
controversy on matters unrelated to his antiapartheid struggle 
however while in the united states earlier this year he 
praised cuban leader fidel castro for his support and expressed 
approval for yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization the comments upset many americans 
in paris on wednesday mandela also said he had received a 
positive response from president francois mitterrand to his request 
that france help finance housing jobs and education for anc 
members and their families as they resume their lives in south 
africa after exile or imprisonment the anc is the leading south 
african group opposing the whiteled government of that country 
mandela conferred for 40 minutes with mitterrand at the close of 
a threeweek trip to asia and europe 
speaking to reporters after the talks he declined to single out 
france for criticism in regard to the persian gulf crisis but he 
said we reject the hypocrisy of the west 
france has deployed 13000 soldiers in the persian gulf region 
as part of the multinational force more than 25 countries 
including the united states have sent troops there to counter 
iraq 
mandela said he is not worried that south africa might be pushed 
out of the world spotlight because of the crisis and the gradual 
dismantling of apartheid south africans system of racial 
separation 
he said the leaders he met during his trip responded positively 
to his appeal for aid although he declined to give details 
he also declined to comment on the governments handling of the 
criminal case against his wife winnie she faces charges in 
connection with the abduction and killing of a teenage black 
activist 
i am convinced of my wifes innocence and i welcome the 
charges mandela said for the first time she will have a 
chance to defend herself 
mandela freed in february after 27 years in prison reiterated 
his position that economic sanctions against south africa should 
remain in effect despite the numerous reforms by president fw de 
klerk mandela said the international sanctions should end only 
when the last vestiges of apartheid are gone and the black majority 
has full voting rights 
the anc and other opposition groups are now negotiating with the 
government to give majority blacks a say in the countrys political 
system

with police after breaking away from a funeral procession of 
thousands of israelis some of whom toted assault guns 
police reported four palestinians and two policemen were 
injured and hospital officials said two of the arab victims were 
stabbed israel radio said many more arabs were injured in 
beatings jerusalem police said they arrested 13 rioters

while israeli politicians of every stripe condemned kahanes 
murder a debate in parliament still brought out mixed emotions 
over the brooklynborn rabbi who espoused violence and the mass 
expulsion of arabs from territories ruled by israel 
the establishment shunned him for his extreme antiarab views 
but a chief rabbi and two cabinet ministers came to the funeral 
the parliament that had outlawed him as a racist stood in silence 
for him on tuesday 
both officials and newspaper editorials warned kahanes murder 
could worsen violence between jews and arabs 
this is the danger engulfing us now that kahanes murder 
will spark a dizzying cycle of further murders the daily yedioth 
ahronoth wrote 
the fear is that this act of murder will intensify the racist 
tendencies of our two people police minister roni milo said 
but he added a warning the state of israel as a democratic 
state will defend its citizens and will cut off the hand of those 
who wish them ill 
police brought in hundreds of reinforcements to prevent

loyalists who shouted death to terrorists a shopkeeper gave 
him refuge and police rescued him 
kahane who led the militant jewish defense league in new york 
immigrated to israel in 1971 and later founded kach to spread his 
call for expelling all 25 million palestinians from israel and the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
he openly encouraged his supporters to retaliate for attacks on 
jews by assaulting arabs at random 
police said more than 15000 israelis took part in the 
procession or the funeral at a yeshiva or jewish seminary run by 
the kach faction men in the black hats of orthodox jews mixed with 
kach men wearing the movements yellow tshirt 
frenzied followers waited outside the yeshiva shouting meir 
meir as the rabbis coffin arrived after a flight from new york 
thousands of american jews attended a memorial to kahane on tuesday 
in new york 
at the jerusalem funeral kach activist yekutiel benyaakov 
echoed the vow of revenge voiced by kahanes supporters since his 
death 
we will let our friend the submachine gun talk for us we will 
let our friend the knife talk for us benyaakov told the 
thousands jammed in the streets around the yeshiva 
the procession took three hours to wind along a major boulevard 
to the municipal cemetery 
marchers carried blueandwhite israeli flags and yellow banners 
emblazoned with the kach symbol of a clenched fist set in the 
jewish star of david some supporters waved signs saying 
transfer a euphemism for kahanes call to expel the 
palestinians 
science minister yuval neeman and absorption minister rabbi 
yitzhak peretz came to the funeral along with israels chief 
sephardic rabbi mordechai eliahu

leftist leftist he told israels army radio he had come to 
represent shamirs government 
i meant to eulogize rabbi meir kahane may god avenge his 
blood neeman said using a traditional jewish phrase in cases of 
violent death

religious party recalled that it was traditional to refer to the 
dead as holy

republican fife symington nursed a tiny lead over 
democrat terry goddard early today in a nipandtuck race for 
governor but the margin was so thin that a recount and a runoff 
are likely 
symington hoped for an outright victory 
frankly i think were going to do it but its not sewed up 
right now he told supporters at 330 am i think it would be 
in everyones best interest if we went to bed 
goddard gave his troops a similar message 
with all but six of 1958 precincts reporting symington led 
goddard by 3589 votes out of more than 103 million counted 
more than 10000 votes went to seven writein candidates 
including max hawkins a former aide to impeached gov evan mecham 
aide hawkins entered the race after the primary saying he wanted 
to offer an antiabortion alternative 
some of the uncounted precincts were from rural counties where 
goddard was running ahead of symington and an estimated 300 
ballots were reported missing from a phoenix precinct considered 
goddard territory 
hundreds or thousands of absentee ballots remained to be 
counted 
even if symingtons lead held up it appeared to be too little 
to forestall a runoff mandated by the state constitution for 
elections in which no candidate gets an absolute majority 
goddard a former phoenix mayor had been heavily but 
symington a millionaire phoenix developer spent almost twice as 
much as goddard and the state has 91000 more registered 
republicans than democrats 
the legislature has never passed laws to implement a runoff and 
elections officials estimate it could take months before one could 
be held 
the states sitting governor rose mofford is supposed to leave 
office in early january but would likely stay on if a runoff is 
required 
mofford who succeeded meacham after he was impeached 
neither of arizonas two us senators was up for reelection 
and none of the states congressmen faced more than token 
opposition 
symington and goddard both harvard graduates from prominent 
families shared prochoice stands on abortion and supported a 
martin luther king state holiday which voters rejected tuesday 
symington 45 complained that goddard raised city taxes and 
fees as mayor goddard pointed to symingtons directorships of two 
savings and loans that later failed and suggested in television 
commercials that symingtons development company was in financial 
trouble

several activist groups united 
wednesday as a nationwide opposition movement and warned of a 
possible comeback by former communist rulers 
in a statement covering the front page of the masscirculation 
daily romania libera the civic alliance said the communist party 
was recovering from last years revolution that drove it from 
power 
one alliance source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the coalition intended to begin a nationwide investigation to 
determine the exact role of former communists in the governing 
national salvation front he gave no further details 
the front took power during decembers revolution that toppled 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu it then won a landslide 
victory in may elections and controls about twothirds of the seats 
in parliament its leader ion iliescu became romanias president 
opposition groups have accused iliescu a former ceausescu 
minister of maintaining old totalitarian structures under a 
different name and of secretly holding communist beliefs iliescu 
has repeatedly denied the charges 
ludovic tarca of the timisoara society one group in the 
alliance said the new coalition would breathe new life into the 
civil opposition 
we want not power itself but to keep those in power in check 
whatever their party and correct their mistaken policies tarca 
said 
other members said the group might become a political party in 
the future 
the new civic alliance includes the intellectual group for 
social dialogue the timisoara society the nov 15 group from the 
central city of brasov and other nonparliamentary groups 
its membership also lists wellknown opposition figures such as

dissident writer ana blandiana 
the timisoara society named after the western city where the 
december revolution began has demanded that former highranking

months to demand the ouster of former communists they say the 
excommunists have retained power in the bureaucracy and impeded 
reforms

conflicting stories emerged wednesday about el 
sayyid nosair as the alleged assassin of radical rabbi meir kahane 
began to recuperate from a bullet in the neck 
nosair whose condition improved from serious to fair wednesday 
was described by many acquaintances as a man who kept to himself 
but new york newsday reported one former employer fired him partly 
because his efforts to convert fellow workers to islam interfered 
with his work 
nosair 34 of cliffside park nj was shot by a us postal 
police officer after he allegedly killed kahane an antiarab 
ultrarightwing zionist monday night 
nosair was charged with murder attempted murder assault 
unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon and of a 
defaced weapon the murder weapon a 357 magnum revolver had its 
identification numbers filed off 
newsday cited sources it did not identify as saying nosair had 
no arrest record and neither the fbi nor the cia had heard of him 
before kahane was shot 
tuesday fbi agents and police removed a file cabinet several 
boxes and a target drawn on white plasterboard from nosairs home 
records in this country showed nosair was born in port said 
egypt on nov 16 1955 and graduated from a college in cairo 
where he studied industrial engineering 
however gen ahmed zaatar an assistant to the interior 
minister of egypt said wednesday that government records in port 
said showed no record of a man born there with that name or 
spellings close to it 
immigration records indicate nosair entered the united states 
through new york on a visitors visa july 14 1981 married a us 
citizen caren ann mills in 1982 became a permanent resident of 
pittsburgh in 1983 and became a naturalized citizen in september 
1989 
the new york post said nosair met the woman he married at a 
pittsburgh mosque newsday said they met while taking night classes 
at a university there 
nosairs first job in pittsburgh was as a diamond setter at st 
clairs jewelers 
he came here as a very naive very nice young man from a 
foreign country said barbara ausman his supervisor and he 
had a very high opinion of himself 
his goal she told newsday was to get rich and return to egypt 
ausman said nosair had tremendous national pride as an egyptian 
and seemed reluctant to adjust to american customs 
ausman said nosair was fired from the jewelry store in 1983 
we dismissed him for two reasons in part because of his lack 
of ability to develop his skills she said but also because he 
would consistently try to convert people to his way of religion 
in 1986 nosair moved to jersey city nj 
debra ragab 39 superintendent of a jersey city apartment 
complex where the family had lived said the murder charge was a 
surprise to us to everybody including mrs nosair 
the nosairs moved to cliffside park about a year ago with their 
daughter nora 11 and two sons abdul aziz 7 and abdul rahman 
5 
nosair used a relatives new york city address however to 
obtain a city job in april 1988 as a heating and air conditioning 
repairman

the political ghost of impeached gov evan mecham 
is haunting arizona politics again forcing a gubernatorial runoff 
between republican fife symington and democrat terry goddard 
the problem is that no one knows how or when to hold the runoff 
because the law requiring one doesnt deal with the specifics 
as a result officials say gov rose mofford will have to stay 
on as a caretaker after her term expires in january mrs mofford 
the secretary of state was elevated to the governors office when 
mecham was impeached and ousted two years ago she did not seek a 
term of her own 
mecham lost out in the gop primary in a comeback bid 
arizona voters also defeated two ballot measures that attempted 
to create a paid holiday honoring martin luther king jr 
in the governors race symington a millionaire developer led 
goddard a former phoenix mayor by 4296 votes with all but one 
precinct reporting symington had 522320 votes and goddard had 
518024 
but with more than 11300 writein votes for seven minor 
candidates symington wont have more than 50 percent of the votes 
cast as needed 
the requirement inspired by mechams 1986 win in a threeway 
race and added to the state constitution in 1988 forces a runoff 
between the two top votegetters unless on candidate gets an 
absolute majority 
officials have to resolve about 5200 questioned ballots and 
finish tabulating the writeins before they can issue an official 
statement but assistant secretary of state karen osborne said a 
runoff is likely 
the figures all point to that secretary of state jim 
shumway agreed 
political leaders meanwhile huddled over a possible special 
session to write laws for a runoff 
among the questions is whether an annual january purge of voting 
roles would disenfranchise wouldbe voters and whether those who 
registered too late for tuesdays election should be allowed to 
vote in the runoff 
there are logistical problems as well 
because of past complaints involving minority voters changes in 
arizona voting laws must be reviewed by the us justice 
department 
one of the martin luther king jr holiday plans went down by a 
31 margin as expected the other expected to win narrowly lost 
by about 11000 votes observers attributed the defeat to the 
possibility that the national football league would move the 1993 
super bowl from arizona if the measure failed 
they tried to leverage the public and that just wont work 
said phoenix mayor paul johnson

former gov richard snelling will get the 
chance to do things his way again when he takes back his old office 
in january 
despite leaving office while the state faced a 35 million 
deficit snelling campaigned on the theme that his successor 
democratic gov madeleine kunin had mismanaged the states 
finances snelling a republican was governor from 197784 
with all precincts reporting snelling had 109195 votes or 52 
percent democrat peter welch a former state senator had 97101 
votes or 46 percent kunin did not seek a fourth twoyear term 
snelling is assuming the helm of a state struggling with a 
sagging economy which he says is in recession he predicted he 
will have to work with the legislature to bail the state out of a 
pending deficit that could climb higher than 20 million this 
fiscal year 
but he sets about the task armed with a successful business 
resume 
snelling 63 was born in allentown pa one of nine children 
who learned about politics from their father a scientist 
every major political event during my childhood was debated at 
the family table snelling recalled recently can you imagine 
nine kiddies around the table with a guy with two doctorates at 
the head of the table saying why did you say that whats the 
proof of that 
he received a degree in government and economics from harvard 
university in 1948 after leaving harvard snelling bought a 
bankrupt philadelphia seed and garden supply company with his life 
savings of 10000 two years later the company went bankrupt 
again 
but he went on to make millions after founding shelburne 
industries a ski equipment and power tool company in 1958 his 
children now control the company 
that same year he entered the vermont legislature where he 
served for two more terms in the mid1970s and rose to become 
majority leader of the vermont house 
in 1966 snelling ran for governor against democrat philip hoff 
and lost by about 21000 votes he went on to win the post 10 years 
later and held onto the job until stepping down in 1984 
snelling returned briefly to the public scene in 1986 running 
unsuccessfully for the us senate against sen patrick leahy 
dvt he lost by more than 56000 votes 
referring to his political losses snelling said in both 
cases what i told myself was that it would be nice to win but the 
civic duty was being the champion of a point of view when i 
started running 1 years ago it was a similar thing 
snelling has said that as governor he plans to work to create 
more jobs in the state revamp education funding to provide 
poperty tax relief and control state spending

a new joint venture by the four networks for 
exit polls and projections got its trial by fire on election night 
and proved again an ancient political adage you win some you lose 
some 
we made projections in 80 to 85 races last night warren 
mitofsky executive director of the voter research and surveys 
project or vrs said wednesday 
on calls we were outstanding ive never made that many close 
calls in one night ive never had to said mitofsky who headed 
cbs election unit for more than 20 years 
but a national exit poll a kind of snapshot of the electorate 
and its attitudes which other news organizations bought from vrs 
wasnt distributed because of technical difficulties 
abc cbs nbc and cnn each have paid 3 million for exit polls 
and projections through 1992 in all senate house and governors 
races as well as some state and local races of national interest 
tuesday night vrs called 67 senate and governors races 
cnn which previously had never had fast access to exit poll 
results was pleased with the output of vrs in making state race 
calls and by and large with the state race analysis said tom 
hannon cnns elections unit chief and a board member of vrs 
the national exit poll of voter attitudes a component of the 
house races exit poll wasnt finished in time for wednesdays 
editions of the new york times the washington post and usa today 
the only newspapers which bought it 
there were 14 newspaper among about 60 nonmember news 
organizations which bought state poll results from vrs the 
cooperative said 
mitofsky said the national poll delay stemmed from the 
weighting of data to reflect national proportions 
in other words mitofsky said if the northeast is a 
fourth of the nation you want the northeast to be a fourth of the 
poll and you can follow that down to the precinct level 
in applying that weighting we ran into some computer 
programmng errors he said the poll could have been used 
without weights at all but we didnt think that was the best use 
of the data 
the poll was released to the three newspapers in time for 
thursdays editions vrs officials said 
mitofsky and other vrs officials said time constraints 
contributed to vrs problems 
vrs was conceived as a costsaving cooperative venture between 
competitors and negotiations to establish it began after the 1988 
elections but concluded only in february of this year 
we did this whole project in five months less than i told 
everybody we needed to do it mitofsky said i think the fact 
that we got a late start needs to be weighed into that equation

the test of an american cruise missile 
over northwestern canada was aborted in midflight wednesday because 
of technical malfunctions officials said 
maj luigi rossetto of the canadian forces base at cold lake 
said the test was canceled because of technical problems between 
the cruise missiles guidance system which was being tested and 
the b52 carrying the weapon 
the b52 returned to base ki sawyer air force base in the 
upper peninsula of michigan where the missiles guidance system 
will be examined 
rossetto said no further tests on the missile were planned but 
that more may be held in the spring on other cruise missiles 
the tests are permitted under a canadaus agreement signed in 
1983 and renewed in 1988 they have drawn protests from peace 
groups and the northwest territories government and a 
demonstration was held wednesday at the alberta legislature in 
edmonton 
military officials say the canadian north is ideal for the tests 
because the terrain is similar to that of the soviet union 
a simulated launch sequence began about 1230 am est when the 
b52 bomber carrying the missile reached the beaufort sea 1360 
miles northwest of edmonton 
the flight path turned south from the beaufort along the 
mackenzie river valley into alberta where the test was terminated 
about 330 pm est 
the test was originally scheduled for oct 30 but was postponed 
five times because of technical problems and poor weather

sen bill bradley said wednesday that 
his narrow victory reflected voters anger at higher state taxes 
and a campaign that failed to talk about peoples main concerns 
youre in this job youre in the line of fire he said 
in good times you ride in bad times you take the hit i offer no 
excuses at all 
bradley defeated republican christine todd whitman by slightly 
more than 50000 of the2 million votes cast in the race but the 
twoterm senator said he would have done nothing differently and 
refused to discuss the 28 billion tax package imposed by gov jim 
florio that fueled the anger 
i sensed no deepseated attack on me for something i had done 
maybe its for what i needed to do bradley said the day after he 
defeated mrs whitman with 50 percent of the vote to her 47 
percent 
she made the principal issue of her campaign bradleys refusal 
to comment on florios tax plan 
what people want is for politicians to talk about problems 
that really affect peoples lives bradley said like finding 
quality education and coping with housing health care and fuel 
costs i think the campaign generally on both sides did not 
engage those issues 
my sense is that the senator didnt take his constituents 
seriously said richard roper director of the council on new 
jersey affairs at princeton universitys woodrow wilson school 
im suggesting his agenda should have had a bit more depth in 
view of his years in the senate 
overall though roper discounted the effect of the campaign on 
bradleys longterm political prospects including the presidency 
bradley repeated wednesday that he was firm about completing his 
sixyear term 
i dont think that the public cares a great deal about 
reelection margins said anita dunn spokeswoman for the 
democratic senatorial campaign committee in washington 
she cited the example of gary harts slim 1980 senate victory 
in the 1984 new hampshire primary i didnt hear a lot of voters 
saying he barely squeaked through in colorado she said 
michael kaye bradleys californiabased media consultant 
predicted that bradleys nearmiss would quickly be forgotten 
hes not a candidate in 92 kaye said and if he becomes 
a candidate at a later date they sure wont go back six years and 
replay what happened in his race in 1990 
kaye said the campaign may have failed by emphasizing bradleys 
record on the environment and children 
it was not pertinent to what people were feeling and what 
their anger was kaye said 
mrs whitman speaking at a statehouse news conference accused 
bradley of not talking to the issues voters wanted to hear

congress narrowly voted wednesday not to bring 
criminal charges against former president alan garcia for his role 
in the 1986 massacre of 250 rebel prisoners 
after two days of often bitter debate the chamber of deputies 
voted 8075 not to try garcia who left office on july 28 more 
than 80 congressmen spoke during the session 
the case involves the bloody repression of riots at three 
maximumsecurity lima prisons 
police and soldiers who put down the june 1986 riots killed 250 
prisoners mostly members of the maoist shining path guerrilla 
group an investigation later found that many of the prisoners 
apparently were executed after they surrendered 
the votes in support of garcia came mainly from his own 
centerleft aprista party which controls 55 seats in the 180seat 
chamber most other votes came from members of president alberto 
fujimoris change 90 party 
garcia could have faced jail if brought to trial on charges 
involving the massacre as a senator and former president he cannot 
be prosecuted in a criminal court but he earlier offered to waive 
his immunity if congress voted in favor of a trial 
a minority report issued after a senate investigation in 1987 
blamed garcia and his cabinet for the killings 
the report said garcias decision to cede control of the 
situation to the military led to the massacre 
after garcia left office congress began a new investigation of 
garcias role in the massacre 
he has said repeatedly the investigation was aimed at damaging 
him politically 
he is still under investigation by a second congressional 
committee for the possible misuse of public funds while in office 
many congressmen of fujimoris change 90 party had been expected 
to support garcia in the vote party members earlier voted to pay 
debts left by garcias government 
though strongly opposed to fujimoris economic policies the 
apristas have mounted almost no effective opposition since he came 
to power july 28 
only 36 years old when he took office in 1985 garcia was the 
youngest president in peruvian history 
the constitution bars presidents from holding office for two 
straight terms but garcia is an early favorite to be elected again 
in 1995 
however he would be prohibited from running again under a bill 
introduced in the senate on tuesday to limit presidents to one term 
in office

richard berendzen who resigned as president 
of american university after allegations that he had made obscene 
telephone calls will receive a 1 million settlement from the 
school for giving up his tenure as a professor university sources 
said wednesday 
the washington post said the settlement was authorized by the 
universitys trustees last friday but that it was not final 
anita gottlieb a spokeswoman would not discuss the settlement 
saying the university as a policy does not discuss financial 
arrangements between the university and its employees thats the 
same with the president or a secretary 
she said however that as of january there will be no 
relationship between the university and richard berendzen the 
universitys executive committee met in closed session on friday 
sources confirmed the 1 million sum was in the ballpark 
berendzen last april resigned the presidency of the washington 
university he had held for 10 years and has not been actively 
involved in administrative affairs but he continued to hold 
tenure his salary had been about 140000 a year 
susan allen of fairfax va told police that berendzens calls 
began in march after she placed an advertisement for home child 
care in the post she said berendzen graphically discussed 
fantasized sexual relations with children 
police traced the calls to the university presidents office 
berendzen entered the sexual disorders clinic at johns hopkins 
university in baltimore and later pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor 
counts and was placed on probation 
the hospital said in a statement that the phone calls appeared 
to have been a troubled attempt to make sense out of sexual abuse 
berendzen suffered as a child it said berendzen is not a 
pedophile and has no pedophilic interests he does not have a 
sexual disorder 
berendzen characterized the calls as inappropriate and 
grotesque and apologized to ms allen she has filed suit asking 
4 million from berendzen and 7 million from the university 
richard marks berendzens attorney said the account of the 
settlement with the university contains material inaccuracies 
but he declined to say what they were 
i dont think its appropriate to confirm or deny speculation 
as it appears in the media marks said

wellstone a democrat 
democratic gov rudy perpich was also bounced out of office

just two weeks carlson 52 replaced the partys nominee who was 
driven from the race by allegations of sexual improprieties 
wellstone 46 a political science professor captivated 
minnesota voters with his infectious enthusiasm and a campaign run 
by a covey of young volunteers who boschwitz credited with the 
races dramatic turnaround republicans once considered boschwitzs 
seat one of their safest

going to be reelected by more than a squeaker said republican 
us rep bill frenzel whos retiring after serving minnesotas 
3rd district for 20 years 
wellstone got 52 percent of the vote tuesday to boschwitzs 48 
percent with 99 percent of the states precincts reporting

he outhustled us 
the gop campaign also suffered from intraparty turmoil in the 
independentrepublican gubernatorial race boschwitz said 
the governors race was rated by many observers as the most

girls that drove him out 
perpich governor for 10 years declined to analyze why he lost 
its behind me he said we gave it all we could we 
worked very very hard it happens who knows why this is not an 
exact science

a lawyer for a winery worker 
convicted of killing seven people condemned a prosecutor for 
showing a jury wednesday a naked bloody photograph of one of the 
victims 
prosecutor peter bumerts pinned the photo of the dead 8yearold 
girl to a board near the jury box during the penalty phase of ramon 
salcidos trial 
bumerts apologized to the jury for the difficulty you have in 
looking at it 
one of salcidos lawyers marteen miller decried the move as a 
tactic to imply his client sexually assaulted the girl which was 
never proved 
the very fact that there are seven victims and one happens to 
have her legs spread and her genitalia showing thats going to the 
depth of the barrel as far as im concerned miller said outside 
of the courtroom this is just a red herring 
salcido 29 was convicted oct 30 of killing his wife two of 
his three daughters his motherinlaw her two daughters and a 
coworker 
he also was convicted of attempted murder including slashing 
his third daughters throat during a rampage april 14 1989 
the jury must now decide whether salcido gets the death penalty 
or life in prison without parole the prosecution wants salcido 
sent to the gas chamber 
the defense has flown salcidos mother in from mexico to testify 
thursday for sparing her sons life while a jury typically might 
not heed a killers mother in this case she lost her 
grandchildren whom she loved very much defense attorney bill 
marioni said 
the defense also called a former warden to testify that a 
convict such as salcido could be held safely in prison and a jail 
guard kenton dunkle who testified salcido was congenial and 
a good inmate 
the photo of the girl salcidos sisterinlaw was not shown 
earlier in the trial 
bumerts said the photograph illustrated salcidos callousness 
because he removed the girls underwear and wiped his knife on it 
after slitting her throat 
outside the courtroom bumerts said the photo shows the 
insensitivity to human life that mr salcido had i think the jury 
needs to remember who the victims in this case were 
nonsense absolute nonsense said miller if you believe 
that ill sell you some ocean view property in arizona 
judge reginald littrell told the jury there was no finding of 
sexual abuse in the case but allowed the photograph to be shown

mikhail s gorbachev soght political harmony by 
joining a revolution day march wednesday but the mood was broken 
when a man brandishing a hunting rifle fired two shots in red 
square before he was hauled off 
a group of plainclothesmen wrestled with the gunman who shot in 
the air and into the ground before he was carried away no one was 
reported hurt and the chairman of the kgb security police 
indicated the man was deranged 
besides the traditional military parade in red square hardline 
communists and radical reformers marched in moscow and other soviet 
cities shouting slogans and carrying banners critical of 
gorbachevs moderate reforms 
gorbachev struggling to forge a mainstream consensus in an 
increasingly polarized society said his reforms were understood 
and accepted by the people 
we all now stand a real chance to transform our society into a 
normal healthy just and ulimately prosperous society through the 
second great revolution gorbachev proclaimed from atop lenins 
mausoleum on the 73rd anniversary of the bolshevik revolution 
gray skies and snow flurries cast a somber mood as the soviet 
armed forces sent 8500 troops and 250 armored vehicles thundering 
across the cobblestones of red square 
for the first time the soviets showed off a mobile ss25 
intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hurling a nuclear 
warhead 6300 miles the system has been deployed since 1985 
the theme was peace however and gorbachev joined his political 
foes russian president boris n yeltsin and moscow mayor gavriil 
popov in leaving the mausoleum and joining a civilian march that 
began after the military parade 
it was the first time soviet leaders actually walked in the 
march the state news agency tass reported 
the three men along with defense minister dmitri yazov prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov and others laid red flowers at lenins 
tomb 
the mood was broken by the markedly conservative tone of the 
subsequent civilian marchers consisting of an estimated 100000 
marchers organized by moscow communist party chief yuri prokofiev 
some carried portraits of dictator josef v stalin whom 
gorbachev scorned in his remarks and two carried photographs of 
naked women suggesting variously that current leaders had ravished 
or neglected the country other banners said 
president in our house there is no butter no meat and no 
peace 
gorbachev you are scoring points abroad but losing at 
home 
about four minutes after gorbachev went back on top of the lenin 
mausoleum two shots were heard above the marching music 
plainclothes police hundreds of whom line red square during 
such public events apparently grabbed the man as he leveled a 
sawedoff hunting rifle toward the mausoleum about 80 yards away 
according to tass 
one officer shoved the mans arms up as one shot went off then 
others swarmed around and forced the barrel toward the ground as 
the second shot was fired said rafik nishanov a parliamentary 
leader who was on the mausoleum 
more than a dozen plainclothesmen surrounded the 38yearold 
leningrad resident and carried him horizontal into the adjacent gum 
department store as seen in a tape released by the tass video 
unit 
kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov asked at a kremlin reception 
whether the man was sane replied not in our our opinion but 
we are investigating 
the national evening television newscast vremya broadcast 
videotape of the man being taken off by plainclothes security 
after the official demonstration yeltsin addressed about 10000 
protesters who gathered near communist party headquarters marched 
past the kgb and ended up near the home of the late physicist 
andrei sakharov the nobel peace laureate 
yeltsin and popov also joined another more radical 
counterdemonstration that entered red square two hours after 
gorbachev and other leaders left 
those demonstrators demanded gorbachev resign 
the country is on the verge of a civil war said one of the 
organizers telman gdlyan he also compared the government with a 
fascist regime tass said his remarks insulted the soviet 
president 
official parades were held in other big cities although 
anticommunists tried to ban or disrupt some of them 
in the baltic republic of lithuania locally organized defense 
units clashed with soviet paratroopers who reportedly tried to 
storm a conservatory in vilnius the independent baltic news 
service reported 
in neighboring latvia army troops were deployed to protect 
the official parade in the third baltic republic of estonia the 
official parade was nearly ignored and no counterdemonstration was 
held the report said 
thousands packed leningrads palace square where the 1917 
revolution was centered for a protest after the official parade 
in the ukrainian capital of kiev the military parade proceeded 
peacefully said a visiting us scholar about 5000 people met 
later for an anticommunist rally 
in the caucasian republic of georgia where noncommunists won 
recent elections the military parade was held on an army base 
officials canceled part of an official parade in azerbaijan out 
of fear it would turn into a protest tass reported 
in moldavia where recent ethnic strife has left at least four 
dead the capital kishinev was quiet with no parade but in the 
eastern region where slavic separatists are opposed to moldavian 
nationalism tens of thousands of people staged progovernment 
rallies tass said

portauprince haiti ap former president leslie manigat 
who was ousted in a 1988 coup said wednesday he would sue 
officials for barring him from running for the presidency he also 
said the dec 16 elections should be canceled 
the countrys electoral council on tuesday disqualified manigat 
from running for president next month based on an article of the 
constitution that says the president may not be reelected 
unless five years have passed between terms 
the council barred 11 other presidential hopefuls from the race 
including many officials of the oppressive duvalier regime that 
ruled this poor caribbean nation for 29 years fourteen candidates 
remain 
in a statement read to the press manigat said the elections 
should be declared null and void because he never resigned from 
the presidency and he had not completed his term in office he said 
these factors made the constitutional article cited by the 
electoral council inapplicable 
manigat was elected jan 17 1988 in what are generally 
considered armyrigged elections held after a massacre at the 
polls the previous november canceled the balloting 
most haitians stayed home and did not vote in the january 
elections fearing for their lives although he was regarded a 
puppet of the army manigat was ousted six months after taking 
office and deported 
a former history professor he has lived in exile in the united 
states until his return in october the interim government of 
president ertha pascaltrouillot tried several times to deny him 
reentry permission for reasons of state 
the injustice the council has committed will fall on its 
head said manigat he called for a vast national protest 
against the decision 
election officials said the 1987 constitution did not make 
provisions for coups thus the issue of manigats eligibility to 
run for president is not completely clear 
manigat must accept that he is an ordinary citizen and conform 
his desire to the reality of the electoral law said human rights 
activist jeanclaude bajeux who coleads a socialist party 
roger lafontant who was the head of brutal tonton macoute 
militia that enforced the duvalier rule for nearly three decades 
was also barred from running for president on technicalities under 
the election law 
he said tuesday he would appeal the decision to the supreme 
court 
in 1987 the barring of duvalierists led to the killing of 34 
voters at the polls in the aborted election 
many haitians worried the new disqualifications would provoke 
the revenge of duvalier supporters but there have been no 
incidents 
there are 200 to 300 observers already in the country as part of 
an international team from the united nations and the organization 
of american states that is to monitor the elections 
the duvalier dictatorship ended when jeanclaude duvalier fled 
to exile in france in 1986 but haiti has continued to be plagued 
by political violence 
the current government is the fifth since duvalier was deposed

crude oil that leaked from an amoco pipeline 
and fouled 35 miles of the chariton river totaled 44000 to 66000 
gallons officials said in an estimate up sharply from earlier 
figures 
the oil may spread south another 20 miles reaching the missouri 
river by thursday the state department of natural resources warned 
wednesday the chariton river runs from iowa to the missouri river 
amoco corp which owns the pipeline originally estimated that 
mondays oil leak sent 21000 gallons into the river in 
northcentral missouri fouling about 10 to 15 miles 
william palmer a spokesman for the state agency said the 
spills effect not its size made it very significant 
each spill is different the chariton river is very low which 
concentrates the effect of the oil on wildlife he said 
the agency also advised cities that may have to shut off water 
intakes because of the oil to immediately pump as much water into 
reservoirs as possible 
dave abshear an amoco spokesman said oil company officials 
believe there has been no damage to fish or wildlife 
thats untrue palmer said we have seen dead fish and 
stressed fish coming to the surface and gasping for air were very 
concerned about mammals and fur bearers and waterfowl migrating at 
this time 
the department of conservation stocked the river with otters in 
recent years several nearby state wildlife refuges attract 
thousands of migrating waterfowl and some of them pass over and 
use the chariton 
amoco work crews were on the scene of spill wednesday with 
vacuuming equipment the company said the cleanup could take about 
a month and amoco would cover all costs

govelect jim edgar began taking the reins of 
state government wednesday and paul simon said his own landslide 
may turn some heads in the us senate where liberalism has been 
considered out of vogue 
after his narrow victory over democrat neil hartigan in 
tuesdays election republican edgar said he would begin work on 
cabinet appointments and other personnel decisions by naming a 
transition team 
democrat simon who trounced lynn martin a republican 
congresswoman said i think the margin of victory really does 
say that someone who stands for the things that i stand for can win 
and not just eke out a victory 
with 98 percent of precincts reporting simon had 2076358 
votes or 65 percent and martin had 1120717 votes or 35 
percent 
it says something to my colleagues who are concerned about 
whether they can vote for or against some social legislation 
whether it is politically acceptable to say we ought to be doing 
more in education health care and the environment and have 
government play a more leading role than has been the trend 
simon said 
edgar repeated his campaign assertions that the state will face 
a tight budget he hopes to shift about 100 million in state money 
next year to provide more money for mental health childabuse 
prevention prisons and other programs 
edgar said he was fortunate to win in an election that saw heavy 
republican losses in the illinois house and the shift of a 
congressional seat in northwest illinois from the gop to the 
democrats 
with 98 percent of precincts reporting edgar had 1634524 
votes or 51 percent to hartigans 1537174 votes or 48 percent 
edgar succeeds fourterm gop gov jim thompson whos stepping 
down 
in other major races republican lt gov george ryan was 
elected to the secretary of state post being vacated by edgar but 
democrat john cox defeated republican john hallock to capture the 
congressional seat martin is vacating hallock had been favored 
until he was battered by publicity about a childsupport dispute 
and a ticket for driving 107 mph 
democratic victories in state legislative races also gave the 
party a vetoproof 7345 majority in the state house of 
representatives with reapportionment to be considered next year 
two congressional democrats veteran frank annunzio of chicago 
and freshman george sangmeister of mokena also survived stiff 
challenges as their party widened its majority in the states

the late emperor hirohito said shortly after world 
war ii that he had not opposed attacking the united states because 
he feared civil war might otherwise break out in japan according 
to documents released wednesday 
in an eighthour conversation with aides about his role before 
and during the war hirohito also rejected the japanese tradition 
that reveres the emperor as a living god according to a transcript 
reported by japanese media 
the conversation was held in spring 1946 when allied occupation 
forces were considering whether to charge the emperor with war 
crimes the discussions appear to have been part of preparations by 
aides for a possible trial 
the japan broadcasting corp said the transcripts were recorded 
by hirenari terasaki a former diplomat terasaki also translated 
for the emperor in some of his meetings with douglas macarthur 
supreme commander of the allies during the postwar occupation of 
japan 
the broadcasting corporation said that when terasaki died the 
transcripts of the conversation were given to his daughter mariko 
terasaki miller who lives in the united states and recently 
rediscovered the documents 
if i had tried to veto the beginning of the pacific war a 
coup detat would have occurred and my trusted aides would have 
been killed my life also could not have been guaranteed 
hirohito said he was referring to fears of an uprising in japans 
powerful military 
even if that were acceptable a violent civil war would have 
occurred resulting in a tragedy several times worse than the 
recent war world war ii and leading to circumstances that the 
war would not have ended i believe that japan would have been 
destroyed kyodo news service quoted the transcripts as saying 
he appeared to be referring to the possibility of a civil conflict 
between those japanese who favored going to war and those who did 
not 
japanese officials met and decided to attack the united states 
shortly before the bombing of pearl harbor on dec 7 1941 
the radio network quoted hirohito as saying he did not halt the 
war later because he feared the public might believe the government 
had given in to the united states despite japans strong army and 
navy 
before he died in january 1989 hirohito made few public 
statements about his role during the war however he had 
consistently said he did not intervene in the war plans because he 
could not as a constitutional monarch interfere in decisions made 
by the government 
to my knowledge i have not heard him say that refer to a 
possible coup before said otis cary a professor at kyotos 
doshisha university and an acquaintance of the emperor 
in contrast cary said hirohito took a strong role in 1936 in 
putting down a coup attempt within the army 
but by december 1941 the situation was so tight the military 
had complete hold on the government cary said in a telephone 
interview the emperor just held his peace 
the transcript quoted hirohito as telling the five aides that it 
was troubling for him to be referred to as a living god 
biologically i have the same body as ordinary people so i am 
not a god kyodo quoted the transcripts as saying 
although hirohito is considered to have renounced his divinity 
in a new years message in 1946 japanese rightists have maintained 
he did not explicitly deny his prewar status as a shinto god in the 
japanese translation of those remarks the comments were originally 
written in english and probably intended primarily for western 
consumption 
critics charge that next weeks enthronement ceremonies for 
emperor akihito hirohitos successor will violate japans postwar 
constitution by once again linking the emperor with the shinto 
religion akihitos formal coronation has been delayed more than a 
year by an official period of mourning

publishing the tabloid in the face of a 2weekold strike 
tribune co chairman stanton cook and president charles brumback 
visited the newspaper tuesday and also reaffirmed support for daily 
news management the newspaper reported 
labor leaders contend the tribune co provoked the strike to try 
to break the unions and failing that fold the moneylosing 
newspaper 
brumback conceded some advertisers pulled out and distributing 
the newspaper was a major problem but he said during a meeting 
with senior editors this is a great city and a great franchise 
for us the news said 
he also said departed advertisers were saying if you win 
well be back with you 
brumback said claims that he and cook were calling the shots 
were baloney adding that publisher james hoge was in charge 
and that this is a new york situation and it will be solved by 
the daily news management in new york 
a group of clergymen expressing concern over the economic and 
social damage of the strike came to the news building wednesday to 
urge the news to return to negotiations with its unions the 
clergymen criticized union violence but aimed most of their barbs 
at the company 
speaking for a clerical coalition of conscience the rev 
james a forbes jr senior minister of riverside church said that 
the tactic of hiring permanent replacements for striking employees 
seriously undercuts managements claim to be bargaining in good 
faith 
rabbi balfour brickner of the stephen wise free synagogue said

strike 
lisa robinson a spokeswoman for the news said this company 
is not antiunion we have negotiated for the better part of this 
year and continue to be open to the bargaining process that is the 
place to resolve differences with the parties directly involved

been publishing during the strike which began oct 25 the 
newspaper says 150 of 350 newspaper guild editorial workers have 
returned to work 
the newspaper is difficult to find in many areas of the city 
dozens of newsstand owners say they stopped carrying the news 
because of threats 
the strike began when a dispute involving the drivers union led 
some deliverers to walk off the job the news responded by bringing 
in replacement workers and the strike spread to eight of nine other 
unions representing 2100 workers who had been without contracts 
since march 30 
the news insisted during negotiations that it could not survive 
without ending what it called union featherbedding

iraq on wednesday promised to free 120 hostages including a few 
americans but us officials blasted saddam hussein for his 
cynical use of the captives and the foreign envoys who have 
been seeking to free them 
at the united nations diplomats said the united states is 
sounding out member countries on a security council resolution that 
would authorize the use of un military force against iraq if 
such a measure is adopted it would be an unprecedented step in the 
history of the united nations 
but the text of the resolution has not yet been circulated to 
other security council members because secretary of state james a 
baker iii is overseas trying to line up support for it said the 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
we know theyve got it on paper but it would be absurd for 
them to pass it the text around until theyve got all the crucial 
support lined up said one official 
baker off on a weeklong tour that has already taken him to the 
mideast is now in moscow 
in washington a pentagon source said late wednesday that the 
bush administration has decided to send additional armored 
divisions soon to beef up the 230000 us and 70000 other 
multinational forces in saudi arabia the source said most of the 
troops and tanks would come from europe 
earlier in some of her strongest remarks of the 3monthold 
persian gulf standoff british prime minister margaret thatcher 
warned saddam that time is running out for a peaceful solution 
mrs thatcher told british lawmakers they must send the iraqi 
president the message that either he gets out of kuwait soon or 
we and our allies will remove him by force and he will go down to 
defeat with all the consequences 
he has been warned she added 
the iraqi information minister denounced mrs thatcher saying 
she was mentally unbalanced and possessed by the devil 
in a statement carried by the official iraqi news agency 
minister latif jassim said mrs thatchers statements were filled 
with rancor and hatred toward the iraqi people and did not befit 
the office of prime minister 
he said her continued calls for beating the drums of war 
unequivocally show beyond a shadow of a doubt that this woman 
has lost her mental balance the devil has found a comfortable 
dwelling within her mind and conscience 
her saberrattling sent oil prices surging upward at the new 
york mercantile exchange a key market contracts for december 
delivery of light sweet crude oil were up 268 at 3531 per 
barrel a the close of the session on wednesday 
in iraqs latest round of hostagefreeing 74 japanese nationals 
arrived thursday in tokyo from baghdad their arrival was televised 
nationally the official iraqi news agency said 100 germans and 20 
other foreigners including an unspecified number of americans 
britons and italians would be released 
state department spokesman richard boucher said us officials 
had not yet been notified about plans to free any americans he 
denounced iraqs cynical bartering of captive foreigners who 
were trapped by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iraq did not say when the 120 would be freed but suggested it 
would be soon the announcement marked the second time in two days 
baghdad agreed to release a large group of captives in response to 
an appeal by a former foreign leader 
the white house on wednesday took aim at such missions saying 
the foreign envoys were being manipulated by saddam 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater singled out former west 
german chancellor willy brandt who interceded on behalf of the 
germans and former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone who 
won the japanese hostages freedom 
clearly these people are being used and we want to point 
that out in the strongest terms fitzwater said he accused 
saddam of cynical attempts at propagandizing this situation in 
a bid to build legitimacy for his government 
iraq still holds hundreds of japanese and german hostages along 
with other guests from other countries 
japan denied having changed its gulf stance to win its citizens 
freedom but word that the japanese hostages would be freed came 
tuesday just came as tokyo said it was abandoning its proposal to 
send japanese troops to the gulf region 
the iraqi news agency said the german hostages would be freed to 
reflect appreciation for the german policy which does not 
support trends toward war 
baker meanwhile told reporters in turkey that the united 
states cannot rule out the possible use of force in the gulf 
later he flew to moscow where is is to hold talks thursday with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
baker is trying to win a soviet commitment to go along with a 
united nations resolution authorizing the use of force in the gulf 
region he won a similar pledge a day earlier in a meeting with the 
chinese foreign minister us officials said 
the soviet union and china are both permanent members of the 
united nations security council and their support would be 
essential for any new antiiraq resolutions 
gorbachevs envoy yevgeny primakov who has met with saddam 
twice in the past two months said he told the iraqi leader he 
would be attacked if he did not leave kuwait 
i put it like this to him if you do not withdraw you will 
face a military strike against you primakov told reporters 
wednesday at a kremlin reception 
in other developments 
a us military source in bahrain said navy warships diverted 
the german vessel red sea europa last weekend after chemicals 
intended for iraq were found aboard in violation of the global 
sanctions the source who demanded anonymity did not know what 
the chemicals were 
iraq calls the hostages its guests but it apparently means 
paying guests the dutch government said wednesday it had paid part 
of a 50900 hotel bill for dutch hostages being held at a luxury 
hotel in baghdad a foreign ministry spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the dutch government was billed 
despite earlier iraqi assurances that the foreigners would be put 
up for free

three firefighters battling sharks after 
their boat sank on a fishing trip were rescued when scientists 
flying in search of whales spotted their makeshift raft in the 
atlantic 
mike davis john kaplan and al bourgeois left mayport tuesday to 
go fishing one of two motors on their 30foot fishing boat broke 
down and the other one failed soon waves came along that flipped 
the boat and tossed the men into the water 
the boat sank 
davis was in a wetsuit and had his spear gun so he began 
swimming the 16 miles to shore he encountered sharks 
one shark was real excited about me davis said 
the 9foot predator followed him until davis 37 struck at the 
shark with his spear and it swam away he said 
meanwhile kaplan 35 owner of the lost boat and bourgeois 
30 clung to a raft of coolers life jackets and marker floats 
twice boats passed within 30 yards of them kaplan fired a 
pistol into the air but the people on the boats were blaring music 
and apparently oblivious of the men passed them by 
the pair drifted for four hours when chris slay a researcher 
from the new england aquarium searching in an airplane for whales 
with two other scientists spotted kaplan and bourgeois 
the planes pilot hugh rawls contacted the navy which called 
the coast guard 
it we hadnt had professional observers we would have never 
seen them they looked like a speck rawls said wednesday 
those poor fellows were hanging on to an ice chest 
seeing that plane pass us and then turn around that was like 
being born again bourgeois said 
ten minutes later a helicopter plucked them from the sea 
during the search for davis coast guard petty officer 2nd class 
martin callender was in the bow of a boat when he saw a flash in 
the water it was the sun glistening off davis fluttering fins 
i found him because of his fins i dont think i would have 
seen him otherwise said callender 
davis was found about 1 miles southwest of the other two men 
all three men were in good condition 
they said theyd like to meet whoever saved them and maybe 
throw a party with the pilot as guest of honor

a reclusive georgia businessman with a history 
of criminal charges was charged wednesday with mailing package 
bombs that killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer 
walter l moody jr 56 long the prime suspect in the case was 
accused of mailing bombs last december that exploded when they were 
opened by their recipients circuit judge robert s vance and 
robert e robinson a savannah alderman and civil rights lawyer 
the bombs bore marked similarities to one that moody was 
convicted of possessing in 1972 according to federal authorities 
the indictment announced in washington by attorney general dick 
thornburgh and fbi director william sessions also accused moody of 
mailing similar bombs to the atlanta court where vance sat and the 
jacksonville fla office of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
those bombs were defused without causing any injuries 
the 70count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in 
atlanta also accused moody of sending assassination threats to 
vance and his colleagues on the 11th circuit court of appeals and 
mailing a teargas bomb to the naacp regional office in atlanta 
six of the charges including murder of a federal judge carry 
sentences of up to life imprisonment he also was accused of 
transporting explosive material with the intent to kill and mailing 
the bombs with the intention to kill 
thornburgh called the bombings acts that strike at the heart 
of our american concept of the rule of law 
those who would seek to attack the integrity and sanctity of 
our legal system through violent behavior would undermine the very 
foundations of our democracy the attorney general said 
the indictment capped a massive investigation conducted by the 
fbi postal inspectors and other federal law enforcement agencies 
that involved a meticulous examination of millions of court 
documents bomb fragments and other physical evidence 
moody has been known to be a prime suspect in the case since 
february when fbi agents searched his home in rex ga 
the fbi also searched the home and business of robert wayne 
oferrell an enterprise ala junk dealer who had written 
numerous letters to the 11th circuit 
thornburgh refused to comment when asked if the indictment meant 
that oferrell had been cleared as a suspect but the attorney 
general noted that the indictment charges that moody acted alone 
asked if he expected any more charges thornburgh said not 
soon 
defense attorney bruce harvey said he planned for moody to plead 
innocent to the charges theres absolutely no question about 
that 
oferrells attorney paul harden of evergreen ala said fbi 
and justice department authorities told them officially wednesday 
that oferrell was no longer a suspect and that he is out of the 
case 
describing oferrell as a very religious person harden said 
he was happy and content at the turn of events he just 
thanked god it was over 
vance died dec 16 1989 after opening the parcel at his home in 
mountainbrook ala two days later robinson an naacp leader was 
mortally wounded when he opened a package that had been sent to his 
law offices the same day a bomb was found at the 11th circuit 
courthouse in atlanta 
the next day another bomb was found at the naacp office in 
jacksonville 
the pipe bombs contained the same brand of powder and had 
improvised detonators made with the barrels of ballpoint pens 
according to the indictment 
moody was also charged with sending a dec 21 1989 letter to an 
atlanta television anchorwoman threatening to kill more naacp 
leaders 
the indictment also accused moody of sending letters in august 
1989 to the 11th circuit and 14 television stations around the 
country threatening poisonous gas attacks on large population 
centers 
neither thornburgh nor sessions would say whether the killings 
were racially motivated although the fbi director had indicted 
earlier that race was a possible factor in the case 
moody has been in federal custody since july when he and his 
wife susan were indicted on charges of trying to suborn perjury 
and tamper with witnesses to induce a federal court to vacate his 
1972 conviction 
moody and his wife who has petitioned for divorce are 
scheduled to be tried nov 27 
friends have described moody as a loner a psychiatric 
evaluation ordered since his indictment last summer concluded that 
between 1967 and 1988 there may be reasonable cause to believe 
he suffered from mental illness 
the 1972 conviction arose from charges that moody made the bomb 
with the intention of sending it with an extortion note to an 
automobile dealer who had repossessed his car 
moody was acquitted of manufacturing the bomb but found guilty 
of possessing the device which exploded and seriously injured his 
first wife 
a 1983 trial of attempted murder charges against moody ended in 
a hung jury

the united states has prepared a security 
council resolution authorizing the use of un military force 
against iraq a step unprecedented in the history of the united 
nations diplomats said wednesday 
the us mission has not circulated the text to other security 
council members because secretary of state james a baker iii is 
overseas lining up key support for it the diplomats said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
we know theyve got it on paper but it would be absurd for 
them to pass it around until theyve got all the crucial support 
lined up said one official 
us officials in washington who were close to the situation 
also speaking anonymously confirmed the account 
one state department source speaking privately insisted 
there is no us draft on use of force at this point 
a document is not technically a draft however until it has 
been introduced before the council 
baker said in turkey that iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
is after all the first real crisis of the postcold war era 
and it is very important that when the united nations takes action 
and passes resolutions those resolutions and the act be 
implemented 
iraq has defied 10 security council resolutions they include 
demands that it free all hostages withdraw unconditionally from 
kuwait and permit the restoration of kuwaits government 
obviously we want to see a peaceful diplomatic and political 
solution to this problem baker said but added 
it is the view of our president and the united states that we 
cannot rule out the possible use of force before we see that the 
matter is resolved peacefully he said 
baker flew to moscow on wednesday to continue his diplomatic 
initiative on the persian gulf crisis which includes rallying 
support for the use of unsanctioned military force he then 
travels to paris and london 
british prime minister margaret thatcher has told parliament 
that either iraqi president saddam hussein gets out of kuwait 
soon or we and our allies will remove him by force and he will go 
down to defeat with all the consequences 
on tuesday chinese foreign minister qian qichen indicated to 
baker that his country would not oppose a resolution authorizing a 
military strike to force iraq out of kuwait us officials said 
qian who met for two hours with baker in cairo did not 
explicitly approve sending troops into action 
well have to wait and see qian told reporters china is 
one of the five un security council members with veto power over 
resolutions the others are the united states britain france and 
the soviet union 
iraq seized oilrich kuwait on aug 2 and then annexed it the 
united nations responded by mandating an embargo on trade with iraq 
and ordering it responsible for war damages 
the pentagon says more than 230000 us forces are now in the 
region leading a multinational force of about 300000 troops they 
face an iraqi force of about 430000 troops in kuwait and southern 
iraq 
bakers talks in moscow are the final essential link in the 
chain of support washington needs to take the next step on the 
resolution circulating it among the permanent five council 
members 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in a sept 25 
speech to the general assembly hinted at a un military 
operation saying the united nations has the power to suppress 
acts of aggression 
there is ample evidence that this right can be exercised he 
said but such an step should come only after all peaceful 
nonmilitary forms of pressure have been applied he insisted 
the security council has never had a unified military command 
the closest approach was in the korean war when it authorized the 
united states to command the un forces repelling north koreas 
invasion 
that was only possible at the time because the soviets were 
boycotting the council to protest taiwans being seated as the 
delegation from china 
the new us draft resolution marks the first time the security 
council would approve of un military force under article 42 of 
the un charter 
article 42 permits the council to take such action by air 
sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore 
international peace and security 
such actions may include demonstrations blockade and other 
operations by air sea or land forces of members of the united 
nations it says 
in other developments 
the head of the un committee monitoring sanctions against 
iraq said she feared some of the medicine amassed by baghdad since 
iraq invaded kuwait could be used to make biological or chemical 
arms medicine is excluded from the economic embargo against iraq 
ambassador marjatta rasi of finland said she had no evidence 
medical supplies had been diverted for chemical warfare but she 
wanted her panel to have oversight over dual use medicine 
the palestine liberation organization asked the security 
council to send unarmed un observers to the israelioccupied west 
bank gaza strip and east jerusalem to protect palestinians israel 
has rejected such a demand saying it would violate its sovereignty 
and reiterated its position wednesday

when conditions looked threatening marvin 
lenders parents left poland in 1927 for america escaping 
subsequent persecution and likely death under the nazis to him 
something similar could happen again 
hes doing his utmost to avert the possibility 
a wealthy highly successful businessman he has dropped it all 
to help fund historys biggest jewish exodus this time from the 
soviet union to israel 
theyre at risk he said there seems so much that tells 
us we could be reliving history again enough jews have died 6 
million in the holocaust we cant allow jews to be killed again 
swift and still swelling in size the immense immigration to 
israel is being heavily supported by american jews 
we believe its saving lives said lender national chairman 
of united jewish appeal which this year has raised an extra 450 
million to help finance the huge resettlement 
never in history has there been anything as massive as this 
he said noting that 101736 have moved to israel so far this year 
the number is expected to exceed 160000 by years end and to total 
a million through 1992 
that would increase israels 35 million population by almost a 
third another 40000 soviet jews are being admitted annually to 
the united states 
the political situation is so tenuous that we have to act 
quickly to get people out lender said in an interview as long 
as the doors dont close we have that sense of urgency no one 
knows what may happen tomorrow 
lender of new haven conn has been in israel five times this 
year and the soviet union three times he believes a majority of 
the soviets approximately 2 million jews will want to leave 
i dont see many wanting to sty there he said adding that 
the spread of wider soviet freedoms has unleashed antisemitic 
groups and incidents reflecting antijewish attitudes embedded in 
russian history 
the good news is that the gates are open and the bad news is 
that it has allowed hate groups to come out of the shadows he 
said 
asked if jews had any obligation to stay there under their 
ancient biblical mandate to be a light to the nations rather 
than withdrawing into tiny israel he said 
we have to look at realities i dont think jews should stay 
in a place where theyre not wanted or its dangerous if theyre 
not allowed to live as jews then that light is not just dimmed 
but shut off 
the biblical responsibility is accepted as a permanent duty he 
said but to pursue it we have to be able to express ourselves in 
an open environment 
he said that possibility remains clouded in the soviet union 
gripped by economic distress and political turmoil in which hate 
groups such as pamyat vilify jews as scapegoats for problems 
there is no question that a real struggle is going on in the 
minds of many soviet jews about whether to leave their country 
lender said its been their home for hundreds and hundreds of 
years 
you dont pick up and leave home unless there is a real 
reason 
in some cases he said it divides families younger 
generations from the older and strain is keen in leaving a 
familiar environment and going to a different land of different 
language and ways 
they would stay where their roots are if they were not in 
danger if they were allowed to live in peace as jews he said 
he added that the ujafederation campaign also is providing 
funds for renewing and building jewish community in the soviet 
union where judaism has been suppressed for 70 years but where new 
opportunities have opened to practice it 
some are hoping to stay there if their lives are not 
endangered lender said but the soviet union with its new 
freedoms demonstrations crime food shortages and factionalism 
is not so safe anymore he added 
he said that 70 percent of soviet jews entering israel say they 
have experienced some form of antisemitism from abusive epithets 
to torching of their apartments 
lender 49 whose immigrant fathers tiny backyard bakery 
eventually expanded into a nationwide 65 millionayear 
bakedbagels enterprise sold to kraft in 1984 now concentrates on 
community work mostly raising uja funds 
the regular uja budget this year is 765 million to strengthen 
jewish life here and abroad plus 450 million added this year for 
the massive operation exodus of soviet jews 
when we have an opportunity to free people he said we 
cant sit by and not do it i dont want to look at my kids five 
years from now when they asked what id done and have to sy 
nothing

the year was 1945 and a strike stopped newsstand 
distribution of all the newspapers in new york city for 17 days 
in hindsight in the aftermath of a series of strikes which 
helped drive a passel of papers out of business in the midst of an 
epochal strike that may do the same to the daily news it doesnt 
seem that bad 
the strikers were deliverymen whose demands included wage 
reopening as soon as world war ii federal economic controls were 
lifted 
backshop unions and editorial workers stayed on the job the 
papers were printed and were available to anyone who went to the 
papers offices for those who couldnt mayor fiorello la guardia 
read the funnies on radio 
there were nine general newspapers in manhattan including the 
two with the biggest circulations in the nation the daily news and 
the mirror lively local dailies were thriving in brooklyn the 
bronx and queens 
labor wanted a bigger share of what appeared to be an 
evergrowing pot 
patrick loughlin signed on as an assistant junior pressman as a 
teenager in 1947 i would have a job for life i figured he 
said 
instead at 61 loughlin is a walking history of labor strife and 
bad times in the new york newspaper industry three papers he 
worked for since have folded and now hes on strike at the daily 
news 
the forces that upset loughlins calculations in the pressroom 
as well as publishers plans in boardrooms were stirring 
readers would be moving from city to suburbs television would 
claim more of the publics time and attention and more advertisers 
dollars technology and automation would make many workmen 
obsolete 
four decades of acrimonious labormanagement conflicts would 
follow highlighted by major strikes in 1962 1966 and 1978 only 
three of the old newspapers survived the daily news new york post 
and the new york times a newcomer new york newsday pushed into 
town in 1983 
the new york suns 116year independent existence ended with its 
sale to the world telegram in january 1950 six months later the 
amalgam the worldtelegram amp sun was struck by the new york 
newspaper guild the reporters union 
it was the first strike called under a mutualaid alliance 
between whitecollar and bluecollar newspaper unions the 
mechanical workers refused to cross the reporters picket line and 
the newspaper was shut for 10 weeks 
determined not to let the unions whipsaw them with selective 
strikes the publishers took a 
strikeagainstoneisastrikeagainstall position 
on dec 8 1962 the automationthreatened printers union 
headed by bertram powers struck and shut down the news times 
worldtelegram amp sun and journalamerican five other papers the 
post herald tribune mirror long island press and long island 
starjournal closed down immediately in a show of publisher 
solidarity 
combined they had been turning out 57 million newspapers 
daily 
when the strike ended 114 excruciating days later loss 
estimates ranged from 190 million to 250 million lost ad revenue 
and newsstand sales totaled 108 million and 19000 workers lost 
50 million in wages 
and some lost readership was never recovered 
unknowable consequences of the strike resulted from the blackout 
in the citys cultural life firstnovels unreviewed art shows 
unreported bert lahrs great performance was for nought when the 
beauty part opened in a virtual vacuum on broadway and closed 
quickly 
in october 1967 when hearsts new york mirror folded its 
circulation had been 800000 second in the nation only to the 
daily newss 2 million 
three more newspapers the herald tribune the worldtelegram amp 
sun and the journalamerican also succumbed to the times and a 
debilitating strike 
the three papers announced march 21 1966 that they would merge 
into a single company and publish the trib in the morning and a 
combined afternoon paper to be called the world journal 
the union response was a strike just as the new venture was 
about to begin anticipating that half of 1800 guild employees 
would be let go in the merger the guild walked out at the three 
papers over the issues of which workers would keep their jobs and 
what compensation the others would get 
the strike lasted 135 days a record walkout against a newspaper 
at the time along the way the herald tribune died the surviving 
entity began publishing an afternoon paper named the world journal 
tribune shortened conversationally to the widget in september 
1966 
less than eight months later the widget was gone and 2600 
employees were looking for new jobs 
the long island starjournal called it quits during a printer 
strike in 1968 its companion paper in queens the long island 
press succumbed in 1977 after seeing its circulation shrink from 
440000 to 257000 in seven years 
automation had enabled the news to publish without printers when 
hit with 17day strike in may of 1974 in the spring of 1977 the 
guild struck the news briefly the paper published for two days 
until the drivers walked out 
the post the news and the times went into another bruising 
labor battle in august 1978 over what they called featherbedding in 
their back shops 
unilateral imposition of new pressroom work rules touched off an 
88day strike at the end nov 5 1978 the papers achieved their 
objective but at a cost of guaranteeing work for all 1500 current 
pressmen for six years and loss of about 150 million in 
advertising and circulation revenue 
an uneasy peace prevailed until a minor dispute escalated into 
war at the daily news on oct 25 and another new york paper went 
to the brink

next monday big bird ernie oscar the grouch 
and others will start their 22nd season wandering along that public 
television path that kids of all ages know as sesame street 
therell be a few changes two teenagers are joining the cast 
so is a claymation creature cecille ball oscars mother will come 
to visit whoopi goldberg and robin williams each will be in two 
sesame shows 
and the new street season will concern race relations it 
will try to show preschoolers that its the heart and mind not 
skin color that matters even though as kermit the frog so 
eloquently sang it once its not easy being green 
next monday also will be a special occasion for joan gantz 
cooney itll be her first season as the exchairman of the shows 
producer childrens television workshop she turned the reins over 
last month to david britt a veteran ctw executive who has been 
with the production company for 18 years 
but shes staying with ctw and especially with street she 
says because i want to work entirely on the creative side and 
the strategic planning side 
her renewed involvement with sesame street is due in some 
degree to the death last may of muppetmaster jim henson who 
created a number of characters for the show including kermit 
although the series has an extensive tape library of hensons 
characters i want to make sure that the relationship with the 
muppeteers continues very strong and that we create maybe new 
characters she says im interested in seeing that the show 
stays very contemporary 
it is that having gone from four to five basic educational 
goals its first year to a teachwhileentertaining curriculum 
for preschoolers that cooney estimates has covered 200 topics 
they include sibling rivalry prescience death adoption and 
of course love 
last season the series which is seen in 80 countries and still 
is aimed at children 2 to 5 years old began segments set in a home 
daycare center for tykes 
that was done and remains in the series because its something 
our audience can identify with says street executive 
producer dulcy singer increasing numbers of kids wind up in 
daycare centers or afterschool programs because their parents 
whether divorced or still married must work to make ends meet 
children are much more in day care and afterschool programs 
now says cooney who because of that has two projects afoot 
neither intended for tv 
one is to develop afterschool packages using ctws other 
educational shows square one and 321 contact to tutor 
kids in math and science kids staying after school because their 
parents work she says 
the other is a planned pilot program in which sesame street 
materials and books would be used for childrens activities in 
dallas daycare centers 
also afoot for next season but on pbs is an asyet untitled 
literacy series to teach reading and writing skills to children 7 
to 12 years old she says 
as with the major networks cable independent stations and 
videocassette players have bitten into pbs audience and sesame 
street has been among the shows affected but not so much in the 
morning cooney says 
the real ratings drop of street is due mainly to cables 
nickelodeon channel aimed at viewers 2 to 15 she says it occurs 
in the afternoon when older children come home from school and 
commandeer the tv set 
at such times she says the little kid that might want to 
watch sesame street is overpowered by his or her older sibling 
pondering ways to deal with this and other problems will be part 
of her work now with the company she cofounded 
its like having a 22yearold child she said of her new 
role at ctw the child may not need you full time but when the 
child needs you youre there for it 
 
elsewhere in television 
cheers murphy brown get the onceover nbc tonight is 
airing a onehour retrospective of its toprated cheers the 
hour will be moderated by john mclaughlin the keepitquick 
discussion show host whose the mclaughlin group series is a 
fine example of how washington journalists can be taught to 
harrumph oudly and on cue 
also tonight diane sawyer is taking viewers of abcs 
primetime live behind the scenes of cbs murphy brown the

it started as a sleeper among issues but the 
drive to limit politicians terms is awake and kicking now and the 
people pushing the idea say theyll seek to put it on at least 15 
state ballots in 1992 
claiming headway in both the victories and frustrations of 
tuesdays offyear elections termlimit campaigners will meet in 
washington early next month to talk about their next steps 
while the immediate target is the state legislatures their 
ultimate aim is to limit tenure in congress 
term limits were approved on tuesday in colorado and california 
the two states that had the issue on the ballot and for good 
measure in kansas city mo which put a ceiling on city council 
tenure oklahoma voted for term limits earlier in the fall 
and then 95 percent of the house incumbents who ran again won 
again an outcome one strategist said would help the push for 
limits even in an antiincumbent year you cant beat em 
said eddie mahe a republican campaign consultant and advisor to 
americans to limit congressional terms 
it is largely a republican movement although some democratic 
candidates signed on during the campaign measures that force 
turnover would work to gop advantage they are outnumbered in the 
legislatures as in congress and democrats have just extended their 
house control to 38 years 
proposed constitutional amendments to limit congressional tenure 
to 12 years have predictably gone nowhere in congress the 
measure approved in colorado on tuesday would apply to members of 
congress as well as state offieholders and therefore it is 
certain to be challenged in court 
so the political pressure point is in states especially those 
that hold direct elections on such questions elsewhere mahe said 
the term limit drive will be pressed in the legislatures where 
lawmakers may be loath to limit their own tenure but likely to 
approve a call for limits in congress that might just offer some 
openings for ambitious state lawmakers whod like to get to 
washington 
in the three states that have approved term limits the voters 
overrode opponents who insisted that limits are no cure for the 
ills of government state or federal and could make them worse 
strong seasoned legislators would be dismissed along with weak 
ones the opponents say while bureaucrats and lobbyists would gain 
even more clout 
i think term limits is really a reaction against the fact that 
so many of our congressional elections and our other elections 
are not really competitive said gov richard f celeste of ohio 
chairman of the democratic governors association 
mahe said that when and if more states impose limits or at 
least call for them nationally congress will start to feel the 
political heat once those are in place at the state level the 
pressure at the national level is going to be geometrically 
increased he said 
this is going to be an issue says vice president dan 
quayle you had the tax revolt in the 1970s and early 1980s and 
in the 1990s i think youre going to see the voter revolt 
campaigning for republican candidates this year both quayle and 
president bush pushed term limits the 1988 republican platform 
endorsed limits on house and senate tenure without saying what the 
ceiling should be quayle says he favors 12 years 
all around this country there is a growing momentum for 
limiting terms of legislators bush said before the elections 
term limitation is an idea whose time has come and i think 
its time has come to capitol hill frankly 
quayle built part of his set campaign speech around the issue 
the chairman listen to this the chairman of the house 
appropriations committee has been in the congress longer than my 
mother and father have been married he had seven years of 
seniority when i was born he would say drawing ripples of 
laughter i tell you there is an idea that is sweeping this 
country and that is the idea that it is time to limit the 
terms 
the chairman rep jamie l whitten dmiss just won his 26th 
term 
but there is turnover for all the power of incumbency and more 
than 60 percent of house members have been elected since 1960 
mahe said the organizations pushing term limits will seek 
commitments from house candidates in 1992 that they wont seek to 
serve more than a dozen years in congress when theyre running 
for the first time 12 years looks like a long time he said 
to a veteran though it doesnt look that long former sen 
eugene j mccarthy who also served in the house once recalled 
that hed arrived as a foe of the seniority system 
but the longer he stayed mccarthy said the more he saw the 
wisdom of it

american taxpayers who mix business with 
pleasure have to be careful not to get tangled up with the internal 
revenue service 
as old as that precept may be it carries an uptodate message 
for moonlighters who earn income from a hobby or other sideline 
activity 
whether the endeavor in questionreeding show dogs or growing vegetables 
in your back yard 
uncle sam has a claim on any proceeds it brings in 
the size of that claim may well depend on whether the enterprise 
qualifies as a business or is deemed a notforprofit hobby 
in the case of a bona fide business taxpayers are normally 
allowed to write off all expenses even if to do so produces a loss 
that reduces their other taxable income 
with a hobby by contrast expenses can be deducted only against 
income from the activity itself hobby losses are considered 
nondeductible personal losses point out the authors of the 
justpublished 1991 edition of jk lassers your income tax 
just how do you distinguish between the two through legislation 
and rulings over the years a series of standards has evolved 
first of all any venture that shows a net profit for three out 
of five consecutive years is presumed to establish itself as a 
business in earnest 
if you breed or train horses for racing or show the requirement 
is two years out of seven 
in the event that those criteria arent met notes the united amp 
babson investment report a bostonbased advisory service the 
status of an activity is judged on a casebycase basis since the 
circumstances and facts of each are unique 
among the yardsticks that can be applied is the venture 
operated in a businesslike manner with a substantial amount of 
expertise expenditure of time and effort and diligent 
recordkeeping 
does it hold out the prospect of some reasonable return on 
investment is there a practical basis for hope that assets used in 
the activity will increase in value 
and conversely does it involve spending a lot of time in 
pursuits that are recognized as sources of recreation and personal 
enjoyment can the money it brings in make a real difference in 
your personal financial affairs 
while none of these tests alone would qualify an activity as a 
hobby the general picture that evolved from all the tests would 
united amp babson says 
with all the effort that has been devoted to defining the 
difference between hobby and business the verdict often comes down 
to a judgment call 
rest assured that the authorities are not hesitant to make such 
rulings consider the case cited recently by the accounting firm 
of laventhol amp horwath in philadelphia of a telephone company 
worker who moonlighted in a directmarketing business 
the first year the worker claimed business revenues of 981 and 
deductible expenses of 23000 the next year he listed revenues of 
867 and expenses of 17000 
not a business declared the irs and therefore ineligible for 
the deduction of any expenses that exceeded income a tax court 
judge agreed citing a lack of the requisite profit motive

by the time a recession is officially recognized 
it may have been under way for as long as an entire quarter of a 
year and that presents a real problem for those in charge of 
steering 
it is as has been obversed again and again like trying to 
steer a great ship on the basis of conditions in the channel behind 
it rather than on the traffic and other obstacles in the channel 
ahead 
it leads to a condition where the white house and congress 
which determine fiscal policy and the federal reserve which keeps 
its hands on the levers of monetary affairs decline to use the 
term recession when everyone else does 
both wait for verification from lagging indicators from what 
has already passed rather than from indicators of what lies ahead 
the white house says the economy is growing the latest word 
from the fed is that it hasnt seen certain signs of recession but 
both are reading gauges of what has happened but not of what is 
likely to happen 
in contrast you cant find many privatesector economists who 
arent using the word recession 
market and consumer researcher albert sindlinger says the 
recession is already 10 months old investment counselor russell 
redenbaugh says that if we werent in one before the budget 
agreement we are in one after it 
redenbaugh partner and director of cooke amp beiler inc of 
philadelphia reasons this way 
1 it was made posible by the increase in social security taxes 
that began january 1 
2 it was made more likely by the energy shock associated with 
the tensions in the middle east 
3 it was made inevitable by the current round of tax increases 
economists for government and economists for the private sector 
use the same economic reports to reach their conclusions but 
government workers tend to be less inclined to stick out their 
necks and peer into the future 
privatesector economists often use their own studies one of 
these a monthly and quarterly survey of about 2000 small 
businesses by the national federation of independent business 
tells how confident business people are 
that confidence level to be released next monday is likely to 
reach a 109year low making it quite easy to conclude that a 
recession already is under way to be announced later by the 
government statisticians 
some private economists also discount and revise the official 
figures in fact a survey of business economists earlier this year 
showed a growing number of them do not believe some of the 
governments figures are reliable 
sindlinger whose own surveys of household buying power have a 
30year history related some of his misgivings in his regular 
report to clients this week here are two of them 
how can the commerce department say that wages in salaries in 
september grew 583 percent over a year earlier when the labor 
department said that weekly earnings in the same month grew only 4 
percent 
if septembers retail sales as announced by the commerce 
department were only 09 percent above last year how can the same 
department claim that september consumer spending was a relatively 
strong 685 percent higher 
alan cymrot now a consultant but a former real estate executive 
who bought and sold billions of dollars of real estate has a 
simple formula for those who want to reach their own conclusions 
about the economy 
first he said you must recognize that the american economy is 
driven by the consumer not by business and government and what 
drives the consumer wages do and what is happening to wages he 
asks 
he suggests that you might look at the latest statement from the 
bureau of labor statistics among other things it shows that 
580000 factory jobs have been lost since january 1989 175000 of 
them in the past three months 
in short your own employment condition or that of your 
neighbors might be as good an indicator as those belated official 
recession announcements

some american church leaders say the movie 
industry is pulling a deceptive ruse on the public making the bad 
look good by labeling the ugly with a pretty name 
such is the general assessment by a broad range of churches 
protestant eastern orthodox and roman catholic of the new system 
under which previously xrated movies now are rated nc17 
terming the change by the motion picture association of america 
a surrender to sexually exploitative material officials of the 
us catholic conference and the national council of churches said 
it is an arrogant and illadvised decision which deeply 
affects the public good it was made in isolation without public 
consultation the change is neither in the public interest nor in 
the best interest of the industry 
changing the name of the x category does not change the 
nature of the material 
southern baptists the largest denomination not in the council 
also endorsed the joint protest the rev richard d land head of 
that denominations socialconcerns agency said 
the change has all the appearances of watering down an 
effective wall that helped people stay away from pornographic 
materials 
religious publications contended the change camouflages the 
nature of the formerly x category so movie theaters would be 
more apt to show such films 
it gives moviemakers a respectable category for their 
excesses says the rev james m wall editor of the ecumenical 
weekly the christian century the restraint is removed 
wall a movie buff and chairman of the national council of 
churches media ethics and advocacy committee said the change 
basically is about what kind of world our children will live 
in 
the catholic messenger diocesan weekly in davenport iowa says 
the marketplace now has more freedom than it had two weeks ago to 
disturb your childrens growth 
the editorial adds that films of sickening violence and the 
debased or irreponsibile or glamorized fantasy use of sex will 
now be much more widely distributed and shown 
the church critics arent advocating censorship or government 
curbs on films warning that the change itself will provide 
ammunition for thoe who already are calling for regulation of 
the media 
that is unfortunate because a voluntary system of 
selfregulation that skirts constitutional concerns yet affords at 
least a minimum of protection to the public is workable the 
interchurch statement says 
the movie industry contends that the x rating has come to be 
understood as indicating only pornographic films and thus has 
downgraded some serious adult films of artistic merit 
most theater chains dont show xrated films and most newspapers 
wont take advertising for them some newspapers such as the 
birmingham ala news extended the advertising ban to nc17 
films 
smut is still smut the news editorialized 
in the new system films considered of some merit but whose 
sexual or violence portrayals exceed limits for an r rating are 
to be given the new nc17 rating meaning no children under 17 
are to be admitted 
the r or restricted rating meaning admission of youngsters 
only if accompanied by a parent is continued with explanations 
provided on why a film is placed in that category such as its 
depiction of sexual activity violence profanity drug use or 
suicide 
however no explanations will be given for nc17 films 
the motion picture association said they would continue to be 
evaluated as xrated films have been in the past that is on the 
basis that most parents would agree such films should not be 
viewed by youngsters 
wall says poor enforcement policies of theaters indicate the 
nc17 age restriction wont be effective already he writes r 
pictures are easy for 13yearolds to see with or without their 
parents 
james arnold a movie critic for many catholic publications 
says much depends on theaters enforcing the specified restrictions 
but their track record is not encouraging 
the first movie to get the new nc17 rating henry and june 
features lovemaking between two women 
in the new situation ted baehr publisher of atlantabased 
movieguide was organizing a conference in washington nov 16 of 
religious and other groups to promote communitybased rating boards 
for movies 
he said such boards are frightening to film industry officials 
the joint protestantcatholic statement suggested similar steps 
urging local congregations and others in each community to 
monitor closely enforcement of restrictions for the newly 
contrived nc17 rating and others 
members of the association of theater owners were asked to to 
refuse to book nc17 movies and newspapers were asked to reject ads 
for such movies

its not easy getting to jose zamoras house 
he and his neighbors prefer it that way 
they are among about 400 people living in a migrant camp that 
resembles a small city of makeshift homes assembled from sheet 
metal cardboard plastic and plywood 
the camps residents are legal and illegal aliens mostly from 
mexico who try to get work as day laborers at private construction 
firms or at large commercial nurseries nearby 
the camp which residents call rancho de los diablos or devils 
ranch is tucked away in a canyon near expensive homes in the 
fairbanks ranch area the only road leading to it is a 3mile 
bumpy dirt trail its not easy to slip into this little community 
unnoticed 
life here in this ranch is very tranquil said zamora a 
32yearold mustached and muscular man from the state of michoacan 
in mexicos interior 
a metal chain and lock are used to protect his habitat although 
in most cases it would be easier getting into some of the houses 
by slicing through the cardboard walls 
but no one has to worry about that residents said 
we live pretty much in peace no one bothers anybody here 
everybody minds their own business zamora said as he sat in his 
hut which has two makeshift beds a nightstand a chair and a few 
odds and ends 
he like his neighbors came to the united states in search of 
jobs their stories mirror each others most left families behind 
and any excess money they earn is sent home 
there is not much work in my town and so i decided to come 
here said selso quiroz a 19yearold recent arrival from the 
mexican state of oaxaca he says hell work at anything 
my mother and father didnt want to let me come but then they 
said that i can take care of myself i miss them a lot he said 
as tears welled in his eyes 
even though immigration officials know the location of the camp 
it rarely is raided agents say they dont have the manpower to 
sweep it frequently 
this migrant camp is unlike many of the others the residents 
are squatters but not really the owner of the land has allowed 
migrants to stay on the property free of charge as long as they 
keep the place clean 
a halfdozen portable toilets are strategically placed in the 
camp which runs about 300 feet on either side of a trickling creek 
for about half a mile 
a 5000gallon tank of water is trucked in regularly residents 
ferry the water back to their shacks in 5gallon buckets 
one of the only problems in the camp residents say is that 
trash builds up on one side and is infrequently cleared away 
although many residents cook their meals in small campfires just 
outside their huts gloria torres recently joined her husband at 
the camp and opened up a small restaurant in the middle of the 
settlement she sells beefbeanandrice dinners for 3 a plate 
business has been good she said recently as she took a 
break her stove is an upright 55gallon drum that burns wood 
placed in an opening of the barrel 
catering trucks frequently station themselves at the camp 
selling burritos sandwiches juices soft drinks and beer 
residents can even run up a tab until payday 
there are recreational areas including a small soccer field 
basketball court and volleyball net 
on certain weekends a swap meet is held where dealers sell 
portable tape players cassettes jewelry shoes and clothing 
the little community even had a mayor once but residents say he 
returned to mexico a few months ago and a successor has not yet 
assumed the role 
some residents also are given english lessons twice a week by 
volunteers 
i really want to learn english because i like it and maybe 
someday i can get a job here said 6yearold nancy torres the 
daughter of the restaurant owner

give up pleasures for a better afterlife hsing yun teaches how to 
achieve peace in a busy industrial society 
hsing yun has called on many world and religious leaders who 
avoid visiting diplomatically isolated taiwan to the taiwan press 
he is the islands super diplomat 
the monks hsi lai temple near los angeles has given refuge to 
several dissidents who fled china after the june 1989 crackdown on 
the prodemocracy movement earlier this year xu jiatun chinas 
top diplomat in hong kong stayed at the temple after abruptly

disciples donations and bank loans to build fo kuang shan or 
mountain of buddhas light into a complex of temples schools

glittering temples and a bronze buddha 120 feet tall surrounded by 
480 smaller ones at its feet

there has been no war along this boundary since 
the united states intervened in mexicos revolution more than 70 
years ago but that does not mean all is peaceful this first in a 
twopart series on immigration problems at the californiamexico 
border looks at violence along the worlds busiest border crossing 
 
</TEXT>

oscar lopez medina sat atop a hill 
moments after slipping into the united states through a broken 
fence he surveyed the rough terrain on the horizon keeping an eye 
on us border patrol vehicles cruising below him 
lopez a 22yearold from the mexican state of guerrero was 
waiting for darkness to fall so he could continue his illegal entry 
into the united states 
there was a time when lopez journey would have been easy but 
no longer the san ysidrotijuana crossing has become the busiest 
legal and illegal border entry point in the world also one of the 
most violent 
the canyons separating san ysidro calif and tijuana mexico 
are full of bandits rapists and killers who prey on undocumented 
workers making their way north to cities like san diego los 
angeles and san francisco 
eleven aliens have been killed along this 14mile section of the 
border in 1990 with the most recent victim a teenager shot by a 
border patrol agent who claimed the boy had initiated a rock 
attack 
hundreds more have been robbed raped and beaten by bandits who 
also strip the aliens of their clothes and cut off their hair 
the violence has prompted police to supplement their patrols 
with swat officers and border patrol agents to install dozens of 
floodlights to illuminate the oncedark canyons 
it also has resulted in legislation to increase the 800man 
border patrol force in san diego and sparked calls by a grassroots 
group to revamp the 1986 immigration reform and control act which 
gave amnesty to some aliens and included employer sanctions 
but the illegal aliens continue to cross by the hundreds of 
thousands and the violence against them continues not only at the 
border but in the california communities where they look for work 
i have heard that it is dangerous to cross but what can i 
do lopez said i need to cross to go find a job so i can send 
money back home if i make it this time maybe i can bring my 
family next year 
authorities say that most of the violence against illegal aliens 
is perpetrated by mexican nationals who wait in the brush attack 
their victims and cross back into tijuana but migrant advocates 
say the increased vigilance by border patrol and swat officers will 
make the area even more violent 
the lights that they put up will work for a little bit but 
the migrants and bandits are just moving to places where there are 
no lights said roberto martinez who tracks border issues for 
the american friends service committee 
its futile and the violence will continue he said 
border patrol officials say the violence on the california line 
is higher than in other sections of the 2000mile usmexico 
border because of the number of people crossing among them more 
women and children 
but border patrol spokesman ted swofford says that because of 
increased patrols the violence by bandits has decreased in recent 
months 
the bandits are still out there but the incidents of 
robberies rapes and pillaging have gone down significantly he 
said 
meanwhile the number of arrests of illegal aliens has been 
increasing slowly after declining when the immigration act was 
enacted four years ago swofford said 
for every illegal alien arrested officials have said about 
three get away those who do eventually end up looking for day 
laborer jobs making low wages that still are more than they can 
make back in mexico 
during the day people wanting to cross into the united states 
begin arriving at various locations along the border one of the 
most popular spots in recent months has been a hilltop west of the 
legal port of entry 
some wait in the hot sun while vendors standing under blue 
plastic tarps sell cold drinks food and sometimes even clothing 
the migrants watch as border patrol vehicles scurry about a 
halfmile below them slowly the migrants make their way into the 
bushes and brush as they try to zigzag their way with the help of 
a smuggler to interstate 5 and their road north 
as darkness falls those at the top of the hill make a rush 
after first surveying the land to find the best route and then 
trying to remember it at night 
some get through but others are caught by the border patrol 
attacked by bandits lurking in the brush or like 80 people in the 
past four years killed while trying to cross busy highways 
border patrol officers say they too are the victims of 
violence so far this year agents have been assaulted 217 times 
according to agency records 
most of the rockthrowing incidents are diversionary tactics 
instituted by the smugglers themselves to get the agents attention 
so others can come help him and then they create a hole 
somewhere swofford said 
to protect themselves many of the border patrol vehicles along 
the border have been transformed into war wagons with metal 
grills covering windshields and windows to protect them from the 
rocks 
but migrant advocates including attorney marco lopez said that 
the border patrol agents frequently instigate trouble for 
instance in one incident last year a border patrol agent shouted 
obscenities through his cars pa system at mexicans on the other 
side of the border 
the officers themselves make it more violent said lopez 
who frequently represents victims of police or border patrol 
shootings its a violent area and sometimes they are justified 
in using force but in some cases they are not 
yet assistant chief manny guaderrama who oversees the san diego 
police departments border crimes intervention unit says officers 
are saving lives 
these officers do not provoke violence they have received 
special firearms training and they are real cool under fire under 
stress and they are not going to be provoked into jumping into 
anything that shouldnt take place guaderrama said 
the unit was formed after a similar one the border crime 
prevention unit was disbanded in 1989 after 26 people were shot in 
a fiveyear period the bcpu was a cooperative program with the 
border patrol now police and border patrol officers work 
separately 
us officials also have been trying to work with tijuana police 
and baja california officials to set up a communications network 
that will help in responding to border crimes 
our national capitals are too far away to impress upon them 
the problems we have here said baja california gov ernesto 
ruffo during a tour of the border recently we need to work 
together more closely to clear up some of these problems so we can 
catch the bad guys 
added san diego county supervisor brian bilbray who was with 
ruffo this problem is like a toothache you ignore it until it 
gets bad now we have a situation that people on both sides of the 
border can agree on preserving human life

how good can you be if youre one of the 
lowestrated shows on primetime tv 
very good if youre against the law the drama starring 
michael okeefe as a maddog kickeminthecrutches boston lawyer 
that very nearly died this fall at the tail of fox broadcasting 
cos sunday lineup 
it seems that maybe 10 oclock on sunday night is not the best 
time for this show daniel blatt a former practicing attorney 
said with magnificent understatement just three weeks after taking 
over as executive producer 
in seasontodate viewership against the law ranked 97th 
beating only the fox documentary series american chronicles and 
a few other fox shows now off the air 
the shows protagonist simon macheath is a lessthanheroic 
figure his courtroom tactics are nothing short of contempt he 
opened the pilot episode for example jailed for contempt then 
addressed the jury using a zucchini to simulate a tender portion of 
his male clients damaged anatomy 
macheath is inherently someone who understands the nature of 
the way the system works okeefe said 
youre going to have to play their game get better at it and 
punch wherever you can punch in order to make your points because 
if you dont you just run the risk of being another statistic 
 
if youre going to win in a system like that youre going to 
have to just pull out all the stops we might bend the 
verisimilitude of the courtroom in order to make a point or two 
about what happens but most of the lawyers i know say right on 
 
critical reaction to the show has been mixed some tv wrters 
liked it very much others not at all 
and audiences didnt know what to make of it 
older viewers already had migrated from fox to sunday night 
movies on abc cbs and nbc foxs hip younger audience coming 
into the show after two solid hours of kinky comedies hadnt a 
clue 
i think thats hurting us okeefe said on nov 2 i think 
that these comedies that are leading into us are not necessarily 
the audience thats going to be interested in our show 
theres another reason okeefe said 
fox will be the first to tell you that they havent promoted 
the show he said they have four shows that they promote in 
order to ensure the success of their network married with 
children in living color the simpsons and americas most 
wanted thats their bread and butter 
the initial thrust that the networks have is over okeefe 
said fox can begin to promote some of their smaller shows and 
shift their schedules to adjust in whatever change theyre going to 
be making 
on monday nov 5 the ax almost fell 
fox told the associated press the show would go into hiatus 
with a relaunch sometime after the first of the year maybe 
even in the spring when fox has had good luck with replacement 
shows 
overnight fox changed its mind and against the law won a 
reprieve 
against the law would replace the lowrated police drama 
dea in the 9 pm est friday night slot behind the 
realitybased americas most wanted crime show said peter 
chernin president of fox entertainment group weve always been 
big believers in the show chernin said i think it was just a 
feeling that friday at 9 pm it had a better chance 
dea will return later this season and comic strip live 
slides into the vacated sunday night slot chernin said 
on friday nights against the law will compete with 
youngerskewing comedies on abc and nbc and cbs olderskewing 
over my dead body 
finally against the law gets the chance to compete on its 
own 
the show was in trouble early in the season signaled when 
series cocreator david manson departed politely as executive 
producer citing creative differences with fox executives on 
the direction the show 
fox which sees itself very much as the outsider television 
company had wanted a show about another an antiestablishment 
rebel manson said shortly before his departure 
what they felt was that a lot of the legal shows tend to be a 
little staid and stuffy he said we wanted to be a little more 
irreverent a little more sardonic and a lot more theatrical 
blatt the new executive producer said his mandate is not to 
change the direction or tone of the show 
what i hope to try to do is to create realistic situations 
he said and place into those situations a lawyer who because of 
his strong beliefs is willing to push the envelope as far as he can 
to protect his clients 
blatt also has retained an old friend harvard law school 
professor gary bellow as legal consultant to the show 
this pleases okeefe the son of a law school professor and the 
brother of a lawyer and a law school student 
bellows a really serious national litigator okeefe said 
he travels all over the country litigating cases accrediting law 
schools and advising inept actors about the nature of trial 
advocacy 
at the same time however okeefe believes that the shows 
strength still will be to find the drama of the law and show the 
absurdity of the system 
people took us to task on certain issues he said i dont 
think were infallible in any means artisticially legally were 
certainly worthy of criticism but the power of the show is 
undeniable for those who have found it and watch it 
and if they give us the chance to accrue the audience theyre 
going to have like a critical and commercial success on their 
hands then whatre they going to do

with bigmoney deals scarcer than a lizards 
smile prudentialbache securities inc is putting frowns on the 
faces of its investment bankers 
in the latest example of wall streets shrinkage sources said 
prudentialbache plans to lay off twothirds of its investment 
banking professionals other firms have made cuts in the 
oncelucrative area recently though not as large 
the layoff sword hangs over almost all investment firms and 
wall street recruiters report an uptick in calls from anxious 
executives but many professionals fear leaving one firm for an 
unsure fate elsewhere 
the gloom is so widespread theyre not sure about going 
someplace theyre unfamiliar with said howard gabler president 
of gz stephens inc an executive recruiting firm 
industry powerhouse morgan stanley amp co last week said it was 
reducing its investment banking force by 6 percent shearson lehman 
brothers inc and painewebber inc also recently laid off 
investment bankers 
investment banking was the growth area of the 1980s financing 
mergers and acquisitions and raising capital for companies 
first boston corp is expected to lay off banking professionals 
in coming weeks as part of a broad retrenchment an executive who 
asked not to be named confirmed that the firm reduced its 
operations and information services staff by 50 employees on 
monday 
true qualty people will be set loose gabler said in past 
cuts the best people were still employed six months from now i 
dont know whether that will be the case 
employment industrywide has dived 17 percent to 216000 at the 
end of june from 262000 in october 1987 according to the 
securities industry association the reductions place the industry 
at 1985 levels still about 55 percent above total employment in 
1980 
prudentialbache a unit of prudential insurance co of america 
on tuesday confirmed it was abandoning a fouryear effort to become 
an investment banking power drastically reducing the size and 
focus of the division 
in a statement prudentialbache did not specify the size of the 
cuts but sources at the firm who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said about 120 of 180 investment banking professionals would be 
laid off additionally an undetermined number of the divisions 
100 support personnel are to be axed 
prudentialbache chairman george ball said in a memo to 
employees last week that slumping business argues for a smaller 
leaner crew moving forward that will focus on specific industries 
where the firm has succeeded in the past he said the investment 
banking division lost money last year and thus far in 1990 
ball blamed the problems partly on the divisions lack of an 
established client base with business down across the board firms 
with longstanding clients are more likely to survive the industrys 
recession 
solid investment banking deals continue to be scarcer than a 
lizards smile ball said in another recent memo the fault 
isnt our bankers its environmental 
he said the overall industry is no better as individual 
investors and money management institutions are afraid to commit 
money business stinks ball said when the vacation season 
ended investors seemed to stay on the beach 
prudentialbache spent more than 110 million strengthening 
investment banking to expand on its power as a retail brokerage 
but the expansion bid stumbled 
the firms investment banking division was ninth on wall street 
based on market share for underwriting activity so far this year 
according to idd information services prudentialbache ropped to 
13th in fees from corporate investment banking this year down from 
ninth in 1986 
cuts at the firm which lost 51 million last year also are 
expected in other divisions including risk arbitrage which 
involves speculative trading in the stocks of potential takeover 
targets another business that has faded

the citys victorious effort to keep wall 
streets commodities markets from abandoning new york for new 
jersey could help induce other financial industry giants to stay 
analysts said 
but city officials said companies shouldnt assume that a 
package of 145 million in land tax breaks and other incentives 
given to the four commodities exchanges would be routine for every 
company that threatens to leave new york 
the decision tuesday by the exchanges comes during a 3yearold 
financial industry recession and general economic malaise that has 
resulted in tens of thousands of layoffs in new york in recent 
months 
had they lost this case it would have made holding on to some 
others much more difficult said hyman grossman a managing 
director of standard amp poors corp which is reviewing the citys 
credit rating these things seem to go in waves and they feed on 
each other 
several financial firms are contemplating whether to stay in 
manhattan after their leases expire in the mid1990s one of major 
concern is top wall street firm morgan stanley amp co which has 
examined sites in connecticut and met with city officials on 
tuesday to discuss its plans 
with a budget crisis and gloomy economic forecast analysts said 
the city can ill afford to lose large players in the critical 
financial industry already painewebber inc and merrill lynch amp 
co have relocated some departments across the hudson river in new 
jersey 
securities and commodities industry employment was 136900 in 
september down more than 15 percent from its peak of more than 
161000 before the stock market crashed in october 1987 
in contrast to the rest of the industry the four exchanges 
the commodity exchange the coffee sugar and cocoa exchange the 
new york mercantile exchange and the new york cotton exchange 
have grown sizably since the crash 
the city faced losing nearly 12000 jobs and 13 billion a year 
in goods services and salaries generated by the industry which 
has been straining to expand in order to compete with rival 
exchanges in chicago and elsewhere employment is projected to soar 
to up to 23500 by the year 2000 
under the deal new york state and city will provide 145 
million in incentives for the exchanges to relocate from cramped 
quarters at the world trade center to a new building to be 
constructed on an empty lot nearby to be completed by mid1994 
the new site will triple the size of the exchanges total space to 
12 million square feet 
the exchanges will receive 82 million in capital from the city 
and state while the city will own the land and building the 
exchanges also will get 32 million in real estate tax abatements 
spread over 25 years lowcost power and some sales and mortgage 
tax abatements 
by keeping the exchanges though the city and state retain 165 
million a year in tax revenues sally hernandezpinero deputy 
mayor for finance and economics said the city expects to recoup 
the incentives within three and a half years 
she said the incentives package would not be a guarantee for 
other financial industry firms considering leaving new york you

the site at the harborside financial center in jersey city 
nj was just one subway stop from new yorks financial district 
and offered a bigger trading floor 100000 square feet compared 
with 75000 at the manhattan site 
despite a strong financial offer by jersey city officials said 
the exchanges 120year history in new yorks financial industry 
was a deciding factor 
new york is the financial capital of the world and if the 
deals were comparable we belonged here commodity exchange

the gap between the european 
communitys plan to cut farmers subsidies and demands by the 
united states and other major farm exporters threatens to stall 
talks to overhaul world trade 
an official of the 14nation cairns group of major agriculture 
exporting countries called the ec proposal very disappointing 
its a minimalist position said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
after 10 hours of bargaining tuesday ec agriculture and trade 
ministers agreed to a proposal for a 30 percent cut in subsidies 
for major crops over 10 years beginning in 1986 some reductions 
have already been made 
with the proposal the ec will become the final major trade 
partner to submit an offer to the trade talks a fouryear effort 
by more than 100 countries to lower international trade barriers 
the united states has proposed 75 percent cuts in farm income 
supports and 90 percent reductions in export subsidies over a 
10year period beginning in 1991 
the ec proposal does not cut export subisidies which make it 
easier for europeans to sell their more expensive goods on world 
markets 
the ministers who had failed in six previous attempts worked 
under intense international pressure to come up with an offer 
argentina one of the cairns countries had threatened to walk 
out of the broader uruguay round of trade talks if the ec did not 
make a proposal soon other nations were seen moving in that 
direction 
the united states and other agricultureexporting countries 
regard farming as the key to success in the talks which cover 15 
areas ranging from textiles telecommunications and services like 
banking the uruguay round held under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade is scheduled to end with a final 
set of meetings next month 
ec officials fended off criticism that their proposal falls 
short 
its a good solid and sound proposal said ray macsharry 
the top ec farm official 
he said the community plan was more realistic than the far 
deeper cuts suggested by the united states and others he called on 
the other countries to make equally realistic offers 
what i would say to the other partners is match this before 
you argue with it macsharry said 
italian trade minister renato ruggiero said it would be a 
grave error on the part of our partners to judge that the position 
of the community is not a position of great openness and 
ambition 
last month us trade representative carla hills had dismissed 
the trading blocs proposal as inadequate if we used that 30 
percent figure the united states could raise its levels of support 
and protection she said in geneva 
tuesdays agreement ended a nearly monthlong impasse on the ec 
bargaining position 
british agriculture minister john gummer said the communitys 
drawnout discussions showed its trading partners that further cuts 
would be very hard 
it is clear from the negotiations that the european community 
does find reductions in support extremely difficult he told 
reporters 
france and germany had prevented agreement on an ec proposal by 
insisting on a series of guarantees that the cuts would not be too 
severe on farmers 
in the end the ministers adopted a list of assurances that 
promised not only to compensate farmers for income losses but also 
to make sure that imported goods could not be sold more cheaply 
than homegrown products 
the agreement also pledged to limit the impact of the reductions 
on poor regions of the community and to soften proposed cuts in 
olive oil and other products widely grown in mediterranian 
countries

columbia savings amp loan posted a 
352 million loss for the third quarter indicating further 
hemorrhaging at what was once the nations most profitable thrift 
the collapse of the nations junk bond market helped bring 
columbias losses to 14 billion for the last five quarters the 
loss for the third quarter amounted to 1683 a share in the first 
nine months of the year columbia had a loss of 7818 million or 
3837 a share 
columbias junk bond collection once estimated at 4 billion 
is now worth slightly more than half that amount 
the thrifts latest loss reported tuesday further increases 
the ultimate cost to taxpayers should columbia fail and be seized 
by the government 
experts have projected that taxpayers would be forced to pay 
between 500 million and 1 billion to cover the savings and loans 
federally insured deposits 
normally columbia would have been seized long ago but 
regulators have been working with thrift management to sell its 
junk bonds privately so the government might escape being saddled 
with them 
in the third quarter the market value of columbias bonds 
plunged by 226 million a drop that columbia chief executive 
edward harshfield called unprecedented harshfield stressed that 
the thrift has sufficient cash to meet depositors demands 
because of the huge numbers of companies that have defaulted on 
the risky highyield junk bonds their market value has been 
severely diminished

striking daily news workers have pressured a 
black journalists organization into rescinding its offer to 
provide the newspapers management with a list of potential 
replacement workers 
the national association of black journalists which had agreed 
to sell its list for 400 withdrew the offer tuesday 
meanwhile in brooklyn a grocery store was firebombed early 
today and the owner said he recently had received threats not to 
sell the daily news officials said 
the fire set off by a molotov cocktail caused extensive damage 
to the store and slightly injured three firefighters said fire 
department spokesman lt frank martinez 
an incendiary device was thrown into the same store friday but 
caused no damage said sgt edward burns a police spokesman the 
owner salah zamzemi told police he had received threats and had 
not been selling the newspaper according to burns 
no suspects have been found in either incident burns said 
dozens of local newsstand owners say they have received warnings 
not to carry the daily news at least one newsstand has been 
firebombed 
the decision by the black journalists group was announced by 
its president thomas morgan after striking workers held three 
news conferences sent him a telegram and telephoned him 
there was a perception that this was seen as furthering 
managements position that was never our intention morgan said 
we still feel our members have the right to make up their minds 
about this issue 
the news had sought to buy membership lists from the black 
journalists group the national association of hispanic journalists 
and the asianamerican journalists association representatives of 
the two other groups said they refused 
we understand why the journalists associations might not want 
to offer even the appearance of taking sides in the dispute said 
james willse editor of the news 
the first of 2100 workers in nine unions struck the news on 
oct 25 over what they said were unfair labor practices 
union members at the news whose normal circulation of 109 
million made it the nations thirdlargest metropolitan daily had 
been working without contracts since march 30

a heavy tax liability may prompt the sale of the 
late william s paleys 8 percent stake in the media giant cbs 
inc a published report said today 
the wall street journal said a sale seems likely because the 
paley estate valued at about 550 million must raise 190 million 
to cover tax obligations 
a sale of such a large block of cbs stock could rekindle 
speculation about a takeover of cbs which has long been the 
subject of such rumors 
paley the longtime chairman of cbs who built the company over 
60 years died last month much of his estate including 19 million 
shares of cbs stock valued at nearly 300 million is to be divided 
among his six children 
but the journal said people familiar with the situation said the 
paley estates executors may take a vote next week on whether to 
sell the cbs holdings 
we will probably sell that whole block to pay the bills the 
story quoted someone identified only as a person with knowledge of 
the estates finances 
a sale would mean the paley family would cease owning any part 
of the company paley founded in 1928 and could put a large chunk of 
cbs stock into the hands of a single buyer the story said 
cbs president and chief executive laurence a tisch controls 
loews corp and its 249 percent stake in cbs and analysts say his 
holdings is likely to insure that no unfriendly takeover of cbs 
could occur 
at the same time analysts feel tisch is unlikely to expand his 
stake in the company becaus of federal regulations that govern a 
change of control of the company 
cbs currently enjoys an exemption from rules barring owning tv 
and radio properties in the same market but that exemption would 
be lost if a new owner would acquire a 25 percent stake in the 
company 
company executives say privately that tisch is committed to 
improving cbs performance in the primetime tv ratings and that he 
is not likely to sell his stake until he accomplishes that task 
media analysts note that the depressed state of media stocks 
uncertainty over whether the major tv networks will be allowed to 
have a financial stake in more of the programming that they run and 
the prospect of a continuing weak advertising environment make it 
an inopportune time for a sale

premier li peng indicated willingness wednesday 
to give foreign companies a role in developing chinas 
mostpromising oilfield so far closed to foreign involvement 
the official xinhua news agency said li made the statement 
during a meeting with the president of japans mitsubishi corp 
shinroku morohashi 
morohashi said that mitsubishi has a great interest in 
expanding economic cooperation with china especially in the 
electric power oil chemicals and transport industries and 
personnel training xinhua reported 
morohashi specifically mentioned the tarim basin in northwestern 
chinas xinjiang uygur autonomous region saying mitsubishi is 
ready to participate in oil development there xinhua said 
li responded by saying these items hold great potential for 
cooperation xinhua reported he said he hoped that the two 
sides would not only cooperate in new and big projects but also in 
the technical transformation of chinas old enterprises 
a mitsubishi spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said li gave a very good impression that arrangements could be 
worked out for joint projects in the tarim basin but he said the 
officials did not discuss details or a possible timetable 
testing has indicated that the 560000squarekilometer tarim 
basin is rich in oil and natural gas deposits the official china 
daily said the region is very likely to become the countrys 
major oil and natural gas production center 
the newspaper said experts estimate the tarim basin has 12 
billion tons of oil and gas reserves 
china previously has allowed foreign involvement in offshore 
drilling and exploration of small onshore deposits in the south 
but has been very protective of the tarim basin holdings said 
edward chow spokesman for the usbased chevron oil 
he said several foreign companies are interested in oil 
development in xinjiang province but they insist on arrangements 
that would give them equity in the tarim basin oilfield if it 
eventually can support commercial projects 
chinese officials have refused to allow such arrangements 
because they want to control the natural resources of the tarim 
basin oil industry experts say 
chow said a foreign company willing to provide services and 
technology without demanding equity in the tarim basin fields would 
have the inside track in dealing with the chinese 
a lot of companies are interested but they want different 
ground rules chow said

cfampi steel corp and nine subsidiaries 
filed petitions for reorganization wednesday under chapter 11 of 
the us bankruptcy code 
frank yaklich jr president and chief executive officer said 
the company will continue to operate during reorganization 
cfampi baseed in pueblo is a major producer of steel products 
for energy transportation and agricultural markets 
we filed chapter 11 to resolve some financial problems he 
said this action was taken only after all other options had been 
exhausted i want our employees customers shareholders and 
suppliers all to know that cfampi is a survivor and that we are 
confident cfampi will emerge from this new challenge a stronger 
better company yaklich said 
the companys move toward bankruptcy protection began after it 
was unable in september to make a 123 million payment on its 
pension plan an underfunded liability estimated at about 140 
million since then it has missed an october quarterly payment of 
18 million 
a chapter 11 filing gives a company a reprieve from its bills 
including such things as pension plan payments while working out a 
way to stay in business 
the company blamed a series of outside economic problems that 
occurred at the same time including a deterioration in the energy 
industry in 1982 and 1983 that led to a downsizing of the company 
the company said the downsizing dramatically increased the 
number of retirees and reduced its ability to fund the plan 
cfampi said it will seek to terminate the plan in the future the 
company said if the plan is terminated obligations to current and 
future retirees would become the responsibility of the pension 
benefit guaranty corp the government agency that insures private 
pension funds

currencies like the lira mark or franc could go 
the way of communism in europe 
a plan adopted by the big european industrialized countries 
would create a single currency controlled by a common central bank 
as part of a move toward monetary and economic unity in the 
continent 
the city europes largest financial center wants in on the 
deal but prime minister margaret thatcher opposes the current 
proposal and that upsets some city economists and businessmen who 
worry they could be left in the cold 
london is considered an anchor in the global trading day which 
starts in tokyo and ends in new york 
but already the center of gravity of the european financial 
system is shifting away from us towards paris and frankfurt and 
the city is rather nervous about this said alan budd a barclays 
bank economist 
experts say resisting moves toward currency union would erode 
britains largest industry financial services account for nearly 
20 percent of the gross domestic product and support 12 percent of 
the nations jobs 
socalled invisible trade including banking finance 
insurance and business services earned more than half of britains 
foreign earnings of nearly 390 billion last year 
kenneth wright a director of the british invisible exports 
council said were worried 
currency union has emerged as the focus of a longrunning 
deeply divisive debate within the governing conservative party over 
britains role in the 12nation european community 
at a summit meeting in rome last month 11 of the leaders voted 
to begin the second stage of european monetary union on jan 1 
1994 that stage includes the establishment of a european central 
bank followed by the creation of a single currency 
britain recently fulfilled its commitment to the first stage by 
entering the ecs exchange rate mechanism under the mechanism 
britains pound sterling is allowed to fluctuate no more than 6 
percent from an agreedupon exchange rate 
but mrs thatcher voted no to a commitment to stage two saying 
it was premature to set a date when the community still hasnt 
decided exactly what the second stage will entail 
the fact that the 11 other members of the community are 
spearheading the emu move ahead means the city ought to be part 
of it sir michael butler chairman of hambros bank ltd said 
being left out certainly would have adverse effects he 
said 
a committee made up of 18 city heavyweights and chaired by 
butler has agreed unanimously that britain should play a full part 
in the creation of emu and its operation 
wright said the city backs a plan advanced by mrs thatcher and 
chancellor john major for a hard ecu a european currency unit 
that would be used as an alternative 13th currency 
that plan developed by butler and a colleague envisions the 
common currency evolving into a single currency after some years 
but if european leaders decide on one new currency to replace 
the existing 12 right away that would be acceptable to his 
industry wright said 
the majority of the city does want to be a part of monetary 
union he stressed 
butler sees little sentiment in the financial district to 
support mrs thatchers reluctance to join a european central bank 
or to abolish the pound sterling 
londons preeminence as a financial center already faces rising 
competition and the increasing economic focus on the continent 
doesnt help 
commanding the attention these days are the planned creation of 
a paneuropean trade barrierfree marketplace of 320 million 
consumers by the end of 1992 the unification of already 
economically dominant germany and the rebuilding of eastern 
europe 
because londons stock market and other financial services are 
better automated more sophisticated and less regulated than in 
other capitals the city now handles more foreign exchange bond 
and share trading than any other european city 
london also is the center of european banking with more than 
500 banks the home of the worlds largest insurance and shipping 
markets and a major commodities center 
monetary union would radically alter the financial services 
industry in europe there would no longer be trading for example 
between italian lire and german marks bonds would be issued in the 
single currency and europe would have a uniform interest rate 
if britain stands aside wright said the city would have to 
find ways to compete as an outsider but many players would simply 
move to the continent butler said 
an obvious effect of being an outsider would be to raise the 
citys operating costs wright said transactions would have to be 
converted into pounds adding the cost of commissions and the delay 
of additional paperwork 
players also would have to cope with any differences in the 
regulations of the bank of england and the european central bank 
nonetheless at least one expert believes britain could flourish 
as an offshore financial center for a unified continent 
noting switzerlands success as a financial center outside the 
ec private economic consultant tim congdon said it isnt at all 
the case that if britain refuses to take part in emu that the 
city would become a backwater 
he said he believes britain could compete from the outside by 
continuing to offer more relaxed bank cash reserve requirements and 
higher interest rates

the longawaited agreement by european community 
ministers on farm subsidies improved the mood among negotiators 
wednesday at vital world trade talks but not by much 
it keeps the talks alive although only just said a source 
at the general agreement on tariffs and trade which is sponsoring 
the uruguay round of trade negotiations 
the ecs submission of its offer to cut farm subsidies by 30 
percent seems to open the way for genuine hard bargaining in the 
talks which are due to finish in less than a month 
we hope things can now change we hope that we can make 
progress in the next few weeks brazilian ambassador rubens 
ricupero said in an interview 
but wide rifts loom in other key sectors attempts to reduce 
trade restrictions on textiles are fraught with the most problems 
talks on new rules on services have run into late hurdles and 
negotiators are struggling to find common ground in other areas 
ministers are scheduled to meet dec 37 to agree on a package 
of accords covering 15 sectors draft texts are due by nov 23 
the talks launched in uruguay in 1986 are the most ambitious 
attempt ever to liberalize global commerce and boost world economic 
growth if they fail analysts expect a surge in protectionism and 
damaging trade wars 
the talks have not been smooth particularly those in 
agriculture argentina which has threatened to walk out if 
tradedistorting subsidies are not slashed dismissed the ec offer 
even before it was announced 
officials from the united states and australia also termed the 
ec proposal unacceptable the united states and other farm 
productexporting nations want 90 percent cuts in export subsidies 
and 75 percent cuts in import barriers and internal supports 
gatt directorgeneral arthur dunkel starts toplevel discussions 
on agriculture thursday but these will merely determine whether 
countries will be prepared to negotiate on the ec offer according 
to one source 
however another source said there was very very guarded 
satisfaction that the ec had issued a proposal at all thus 
enabling talks to resume in other areas 
trade in textiles will also be the subject of secret 
negotiations conducted by dunkel at gatt headquarters on lake 
geneva 
although there is consensus that existing restrictions on trade 
in textiles should be phased out there is no agreement on how 
quickly 
developing countries want rapid action they accuse 
industrialized nations under pressure from powerful domestic 
textile lobbies of lacking political will in pushing the 
negotiations forward 
talks to help liberalize the 600 billion annual trade in 
services have also hit snags realizing that some industries may 
lose longstanding benefits the united states and to a lesser 
extent the ec have started pressing for exemptions to the planned 
rules especially in shipping aviation and telecommunications 
other difficult areas include duties against dumping the 
practice of unloading goods on foreign markets at lower prices than 
theyre sold domestically

the dollar ended mostly weaker in europe today 
hitting new postwar lows against the german mark and swiss franc 
amid concerns over the us economy and the election results 
gold prices were higher in generally light european trading 
supported by the weaker dollar and news about the middle east 
crisis gold is considered a safehaven investment in times of 
political uncertainty 
with the us economy continuing its slide the currency markets 
expect the federal reserve to ease interest rates in an effort to 
stimulate business activity lower us interest rates make the 
dollar less appealing to foreign investors 
dealers said the dollars losses were also fueled by news that 
democrats gained in state and congressional elections on tuesday 
democratic economic policies are perceived to be more likely to 
lead to higher inflation which erodes purchasing power and could 
making the dollar worth less

backlot where warren beatty flirted with madonna in dick tracy 
michael j husto 40 of tujunga was booked for investigation 
of arson and held in lieu of 1 million bail in the 
multimilliondollar fire said deputy rich erickson of the los

he was on duty when the fire started and after questioning he 
was arrested early today at the studio the deputy said we 
wont disclose a possible motive 
huston is an employee of burns international security services 
which is under contract by universal he had been on the job one 
month said dan slusser general manager of universal city studios 
the john landis movie oscar a production of the walt disney 
co and starring actor sylvester stallone was the only film 
shooting on the backlot at the time of the fire said slusser 
actual filming had stopped for the day before the fire began and 
stallone was not present 
we lost the entire set and are going to shut down for a week 
to 10 days we have to build new york street somewhere said 
oscar publicist spooky stevens we also lost 21 vintage cars 
the camera equipment props every bit of wardrobe 
the blaze damaged the studio tours king kong attraction which 
features a 37foot mechanical gorilla that appears to shake 
tramloads of tourists 
hundreds of firefighters backed by waterdropping helicopters 
put out the windblown flames about three hours after the fire broke 
out at the 420acre studio hollywoods biggest and longestrunning 
movie factory universal studios is visited by millions of tourists 
each year 
it roared through the sets like a wildfire its like a 
blowtorch when the wind pushes the fire up against these 
structures said los angeles county battalion chief al bennett 
most of the damage was to the sunbaked wooden facades along the 
route of the studio tour the third most popular tourist attraction 
in the nation 
a lot of the streets are pretty well destroyed and are going 
to have to be rebuilt bennett said 
among outdoor sets destroyed or damaged were new york street 
where parts of the sting were filmed brownstone street and 
courthouse square where michael j fox rode his jetpowered 
skateboard in back to the future part ii the dick tracy 
set also was gutted county fire inspector jim gandee said 
but it was business as usual today with the first tour tram 
leaving on schedule at 930 am said studio publicist joan 
bullard she said about 20 percent of the 420acre property was 
burned and estimated damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
we are extremely disappointed to have lost history bullard 
said 
but she said only one attraction or amusementparklike 
feature of the tour was damaged king kong the mechanical part 
of that works but there was water damage and we are checking the 
structural integrity of the building bullard said 
fire officials said the earthquake ride also was damaged but it 
worked normally today 
the cause of the fire was not immediately known one firefighter 
was slightly injured 
studio executives toured the 630 million theme park today to 
assess the damage 
everything looked like charcoal briquets said rusty 
gilligan who lives near the back lot it was just a wreck 
the flames fanned by winds gusting up to 50 mph were doused as 
they crept up to two film vaults the universal film library which 
includes et the extraterrestrial jaws and twins is 
worth hundreds of millions 
the film library is vital to acquisition talks between 
matsushita electrical industrial co and mca inc universals 
parent matsushita has been discussing a multibilliondollar buyout 
of mca for several months 
the studio nestled in the hollywood hills 10 miles from downtown 
los angeles features a sevenhour journey through the backlot and 
includes a guided tram tour that takes viewers into sets and a 
simulated earthquake 
about 200 universal employees and about 160 people at two 
restaurants on the studio grounds were evacuated after the fire 
broke out at 718 pm 
we really had a fire storm its a miracle that some 
firefighters didnt get seriously hurt freeman said 
at the nearby universal hilton where the californian republican 
party had its election night headquarters traffic tieups caused 
by the fire prevented some gop supporters from reaching the hotel 
the fire is not the first to strike universal in 1987 a stage 
used for the 1959 epic spartacus erupted in flames damage was 
put at 25 million 
universal studios founded by carl laemmle opened in 1915 it 
did not gain recognition until the 1920s when it produced several 
nowclassic silent films including the phantom of the opera 
and the hunchback of notre dame 
universal is also home to such film classics as psycho 
jaws out of africa and to kill a mockingbird 
current tv shows shot at universal include major dad

soybean futures prices rebounded from eightmonth 
lows wednesday on the chicago board of trade amid speculation the 
soviet union is in the market of us soybeans and soybean meal 
grain futures closed narrowly mixed 
soybeans opened slightly higher following news reports the 
soviet union might have bought 200000 metric tons of south 
american soybean meal earlier in the week 
speculation of soviet interest in us soybeans mounted as 
commercial grain dealers including cargill inc became large 
buyers of soybean futures contracts analysts said 
slack export sales of soybeans and soymeal have been factors in 
the soybean markets recent decline which included a drop on 
tuesday to 575 a bushel the lowest daily settlement of a 
nearmonth contract since midmarch 
buying interest in soybeans was limited by expectations that the 
agriculture department will significantly increase its us soybean 
crop estimate in a report due thursday 
a survey of private grain analysts yielded average estimates of 
184 billion bushels for the 1990 soybean crop and 798 billion 
bushels of corn compared with last months usda projections of 182 
billion bushels of soybeans and 8 billion bushels of corn 
at the close wheat futures were cent lower to cent higher 
with the contract for december delivery at 265 a bushel corn 
was cent lower to 1 cent higher with december at 230 a bushel 
oats were 1 cent higher across the board with december at 121 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents higher with november at 
582 a bushel

oil prices shot up nearly 3 per barrel 
wednesday after british prime minister margaret thatcher warned 
that war could be near in the persian gulf 
the surge gained momentum when a confidante of egyptian 
president hosni mubarak said the countdown for confrontation had 
begun resurrecting anxiety among oil traders that the flow of 
petroleum supplies would face disruptions 
traders were also responding to reports that secretary of state 
james a baker iii had given iraqi president saddam hussein an 
ultimatum for vacating kuwait though baker denied the reports 
light sweet crude closed 268 higher at 3531 per barrel for 
december delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
oil had opened 28 cents lower at 3235 a barrel then moved ahead 
by more than 3 to the days high of 3545 before settling back 
contracts for delivery in later months all moved higher many by 
the daily limit imposed by the exchange of 150 a barrel 
mrs thatchers saberrattling was directed at saddam and came 
as a new session of the parliament got under way 
the implacable message of this house must be either he gets 
out of kuwait soon or we and our allies will remove him by force 
and he will go down to defeat with all the consequences mrs 
thatcher said he has been warned 
the markets rallied on thatchers comments said thomas p 
blakeslee an energy analyst with pegasus econometric group inc 
in hoboken nj 
the foreign reports on baker also pushed up prices as did the 
advance release of an editorial to be published thursday by makram 
mohamed ahmed editor of the weekly al mussawar magazine and a 
close associate of mubarak 
it seems like we are now entering the countdown for war which 
has become inevitable ahmed wrote it was not immediately clear 
whether this was his personal interpretation of the crisis or the 
view of the egyptian government 
regardless the escalating words of war on wednesday injected 
new life into a crude market that had been sluggish for more than a 
week 
its the whole rhetoric for the whole day said brendan 
dolan a broker with dean witter reynolds inc it doesnt look 
good right now all signs are pointing to a confrontation 
other traders cited perceptions that any attack involving us 
forces would occur after tuesdays elections 
refined petroleum product futures and natural gas also jumped 
higher wednesday 
home heating oil shot up 633 cents to 9271 cents a gallon on 
december delivery contracts with all later contracts higher 
unleaded gasoline rose 344 cents to 9119 cents a gallon on 
december delivery contracts with all later contracts moving up by

usfampg corp slashed its dividend and announced 
a 75 million costcutting program wednesday on the heels of a 15 
million thirdquarter loss a move cited by one analyst as good 
news for the diversified financial services company 
usfampg said it cut its quarterly common stock dividend to 25 
cents a share effective jan 31 1991 down from 73 cents a share 
the company also said its chairman chief executive and 
president jack moseley 59 was retiring early a successor for 
moseley who has served in those posts since 1981 has been found 
and will be announced in several weeks the company said 
the extended duration of the present trough in the property 
and casualty market and the economic uncertainty resulting from a 
general business downturn required these extraordinary actions 
the board announced 
the baltimorebased company which focuses on property casualty 
and life insurance said the moves were designed to conserve 
capital and make the company more competitive 
john bailey a stock analyst with the washington brokerage house 
ferris baker watts said the dividend cut was expected but the 
austerity program was not 
this is a positive step because its decisive action to deal 
with a difficult situation bailey said i think the jury is 
still out on whether it will be effective 
except for the fourth quarter of 1989 usfampg had not earned 
enough to pay its dividend since the beginning of 1989 bailey 
said that hurt its ability to write new insurance coverage because 
it drained capital he said 
insurance premiums move cyclically with prices declining as 
more insurers enter the market and compete for business once 
prices drop low enough however the weaker insurers are weeded out 
and prices begin to rise bailey said 
usfampg is in a situation that when that upswing in prices 
happens they might not be able to take advantage of it he said 
with the moves they take today they improve their position to 
take advantage of rising prices 
usfampg said it would cut 75 million through layoffs and 
attrition at all levels and in all segments usfampg spokeswoman 
kerrie burchdeluca said layoffs and other costcutting measures 
would not be announced until after the new chairman takes over 
for the third quarter the company said it lost 15 million or 
22 cents a share compared with a net loss of 17 million or 25 
cents a share for the same period a year earlier revenue in the 
quarter rose to 115 billion from 114 billion a year earlier 
for the first nine months usfampg earned 410 million or 35 
cents a share up from 15 million or 3 cents a share a year ago 
revenue was 342 billion for the first nine months of 1990 from 
341 billion a year earlier 
usfampg reported a 5 million loss in its financial services 
segment and a 48 percent decline in its equity portfolio which 
comprises 13 percent of its 111 billion in invested assets 
usfampg also said it had put aside 18 million in its real estate 
loan loss reserve fund money used to cover nonperforming loans 
compared with 10 million in the same period last year usfampg 
which has 139 billion in total assets said it has a 1 billion 
real estate portfolio including 490 million in participating 
mortgage loans 
usfampg stock fell 10 percent tuesday on the new york stock 
exchange amid speculation about a dividend cut closing at 1225 
it fell again wednesday to 11625

easing polands severe housing shortage is the 
idea behind a program that sent polish tradesmen here for handson 
experience with construction equipment 
the program sponsored by the cocacola co the aflcio and the 
us labor department stems from the governments encouragement of 
american efforts to help eastern europe shift to a freemarket 
economy 
as part of the program 10 workers from poland have spent two 
months working sidebyside in chicago with five american experts 
in ironworking bricklaying carpentry electrical work and 
plumbing 
they will return to poland at the end of the week to put their 
new skills to work 
outside warsaw in the small city of praga they will teach 
their new skills to other laborers at a new center being 
established by the labor department and the aflcio 
the center scheduled to open at the end of the year will be 
outfitted with equipment provided by several us companies 
cocacola is giving 150000 to pay for the 10 workers salaries 
for two years 
this is important because it will help improve the standard of 
living in poland said mirek napiorkowski a 38yearold plumber 
from the warsaw area who is participating 
at present some families have waited as long as 30 years for 
an apartment napiorkowski said wednesday through an interpreter 
he and eight other workers selected by polands solidarity union 
arrived in chicago in early september and joined polishspeaking 
american workers selected by unions affiliated with the aflcio 
they worked on construction projects throughout the chicago 
area selected as the training site because of its large polish 
population said michael semrau an assistant vice president at 
cocacola 
housing is scarce in poland due to a lack of materials and a 
work ethic shaped by nearly 50 years of communist rule said ray 
robertson general vice president for the iron workers union 
many families live in cramped flats with relatives waiting 
years for their name to be called from a waiting list for housing 
he said 
robertson who visited poland in may with union leaders said 
workers there told him their motto had been pretend to work for 
pretend wages 
when we were there in may it was like stepping back 4550 
years he said wednesday there were apartment buildings that 
were started in 1981 and still not completed 
many polish construction practices are considered backward by 
american standards said electrician ziggy kaminski a native pole 
who lives in suburban chicago and is helping train the visitors 
unlike the united states where electric wiring is hidden inside 
narrow pipes installed between walls they have open wiring just 
installed inside the walls which is unsafe and doesnt look too 
good kaminski said 
a lot of methods the poles learned were completely new to 
them he said 
also new to the poles was labor relations american style 
we feel there is respect among the various trades as well as 
between worker and superintendent said marion polinski a 
35yearold warsaw plumber 
everyone treats everyone else as a human being not as number 
therefore it enhances their production polinski said 
semrau said the program also will benefit cocacola by providing 
skilled workers for new bottling plants it plans to open in poland

a canadian board on wednesday rejected a proposal to settle a 
free trade dispute between lobstermen in the united states and 
canada 
canadian fishermen are allowed to keep and sell smaller lobsters 
than their us counterparts representatives of the us and 
canadian lobster industries recently had proposed increasing the 
minimum size of lobsters taken along canadas atlantic coast to the 
us level of 3 inches 
the proposal also called for creating a joint uscanadian 
committee to discuss lobster management issues and for both 
countries to work together to promote and market lobsters 
but on wednesday canadian trade minister john crosbie announced 
in ottawa that the countrys federal cabinet had rejected the 
proposed settlement 
john kearney a spokesman for the maritime fishermens union in 
yarmouth nova scotia hailed the decision 
we have no biological reason in canada for increasing our 
minimum size he said we have a whole range of management and 
regulatory measures that are nonexistent in the united 
states 
but lobster industry officials from maine predicted a worsening 
of relations between the two countries because of the decision 
for them to pull out of it means theres going to be more 
bickering and fighting among all the various factions of the 
industry said william anderson a lobsterman from lubec and 
chairman of the states lobster advisory council 
to us fishermen the dispute over size is much more than 
academic because they compete against canadian lobstermen who sell 
the majority of their catch in the united states 
its a big deal because so many lobsters fit into that size 
range lobsters that are just over that minimum measure make up 
the majority of the catch said david dow executive director of 
the maine lobster institute a scientific and educational 
organization that fosters cooperation in the lobster industry 
at the urging of us lobstermen president bush signed 
legislation last december banning the import of live canadian 
lobsters that are smaller than the minimum us size 
ottawa contended the new law violated the uscanada free trade 
agreement and would cost the industry 30 million of its 180 
million live lobster industry but an international panel ruled in 
late may that the us law did not violate the pact 
the proposal rejected wednesday called for increasing the 
minimum size of lobsters taken along canadas atlantic coast to the 
us level of 3 inches from the crustaceans eye socket to the 
edge of its body where the tail begins 
currently canada has a range of minimum sizes from 2 inches to 
3 316 inches depending on where the lobsters are caught 
some canadian lobster industry officials were upset by their 
countrys decision the nations largest lobster exporter 
clearwater fine foods of suburban bedford nova scotia has long 
supported raising size limits for what it says are conservation 
reasons 
there is no competent biologist who advises other than the 
desirability of raising size imits company spokesman doug 
robinson told canadian press on wednesday 
the bottom line is most lobsters now caught are immature they 
have not spawned he said

the wall street journal reported a sale of the stock seems 
likely partly because the paley estate valued at about 500 
million must raise 190 million to cover tax obligations 
pat gallagher executive director of the william s paley 
foundation and one of six executors of the paley estate said he 
could not confirm the tax liability figure but called suggestions 
the stock may be sold pure speculation 
cbs stock closed up 50 cents at 15862 on the new york stock 
exchange wednesday it traded as high as 162 earlier in the day 
paley longtime chairman of cbs died last month much of his 
estate including 19 million shares of cbs stock valued at nearly 
300 million is to be divided among his six children 
but the journal quoted unidentified people familiar with the 
situation as saying the paley estates executors may vote next week 
on whether to sell the cbs holdings 
we will probably sell that whole block to pay the bills one 
of the people described as knowledgable about the estates 
finances was quoted as saying in the journal account 
arthur liman another executor of the paley estate said the 
executors have made no decisions on how to handle the estates tax 
liability 
he said the executors meet regularly but that no special 
meeting has been set yet on what to do with the cbs stock 
gallagher noted that the estate also includes numerous other 
securities and investments including artwork and real estate that 
could be used to satisfy any tax obligations 
cbs spokesman george schweitzer said even if the stock were 
sold it would not be something that could affect control of cbs 
cbs president and chief executive laurence a tisch controls 
loews corp and its 249 percent stake in cbs that stake combined 
with stock held by employees and investors who support tisch 
effectively blocks any unwelcome bids for control of the company 
media analysts say 
state takeover laws in new york where cbs is based require an 
unfriendly bid to win the support of twothirds of a companys 
common stock 
tisch has de facto control of cbs said john reidy who 
follows the media business for smith barney harris upham amp co 
company executives say privately that tisch is committed to 
improving cbs performance in the primetime television audience 
ratings where it trails nbc and he is unlikely to sell if he ever 
does before accomplishing that 
the depressed state of media stocks might make them seem 
atractive investments but media analysts say the low stock values 
stem from weak advertising revenues and restrictions that limit tv 
networks financial stakes in the programming they carry making it 
an inopportune time for a takeover

the eastern airlines bankruptcy judge 
overstepped his authority when he blocked machinists from engaging 
in violent and disruptive strike tactics a federal judge ruled 
wednesday 
us district judge leonard b sand of manhattan vacated an 
injunction that had barred certain strike activity by the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
sand ruled that the order could have been issued by a federal or 
state judge but not by a bankruptcy judge 
he said the bankruptcy order violated the 1932 norrislaguardia 
act which mandates that a party involved in a labor dispute cannot 
be granted an injunction until reasonable efforts are made to 
settle differences through mediation or arbitration 
eastern filed for voluntary bankruptcy several days after the 
machinists unions went on strike in march 1989 
the injunction by us bankruptcy judge burton lifland 
specifically barred machinists from disrupting easterns activities 
by shouting holding mass pickets that blocked traffic vandalizing 
property or assaulting nonunion workers 
nothing in this opinion should be taken to be condonation of 
any unlawful acts committed by strikers at different airports 
around the united states sand said in a 23page decision 
eastern is free to seek other forms of remedies in federal court 
and all types of relief in state court 
lifland had issued the injunction after holding an extensive 
hearing about violent strike tactics at airports in new york and 
georgia 
at la guardia airport in new york machinists discouraged 
passengers from flying with the airline and tried to block 
nonunion employees from reporting to work according to the 
decision 
other strikers flooded bathrooms in the eastern terminal and 
sabotaged luggage conveyer belts with glue it said 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock said the airline planned to appeal 
sands ruling 
repeated calls to the union headquarters in washington were not 
answered
