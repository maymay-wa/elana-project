president mengistu haile mariam 
marked the 14th anniversary of ethiopias marxist revolution monday 
with a brief address devoted to the nations longstanding civil war 
in the north 
government troops and civilians mobilized since the conflict 
intensified in march are presently engaged in a bitter fight 
mengistu told the thousands of people packed into the capitals 
downtown revolution square 
his forces claim to have repulsed insurgencies in its 
northernmost province eritrea and eritreas southern neighbor 
tigray where ethiopia says it has retaken all major cities and 
towns since the rebels overran the region in april and may 
no major engagements have been reported with the separatist 
eritrean peoples liberation front since the government in may said 
its forces had foiled rebel attempts to take the strategic city of 
keren 56 miles northwest of the provincial capital of asmara 
however mengistu said the rebels were sabotaging and 
endangering the lives of all citizens and hampering the development 
of public and private institutiones 
the task ahead is clearly an arduous one he said in his 
20minute address 
the eritrean guerrillas have been fighting a separatist battle 
for 27 years in africas longest civil war in tigray the tigray 
peoples liberation front took up arms 14 years ago demanding 
greater autohomy for their region 
mengistu inherited the insurgencies when he and a clique of 
military men dethroned emperor haile selassie in 1974 and replaced 
the emperors 44year feudal reign with a marxist government 
one day before last years anniversary of the revolution the 
provisional military government which had ruled since the 
revolution was replaced by a peoples democratic republic which has 
a popularly elected legislature however power still sits with 
mengistu who has ruled ethiopia since feb 12 1977 
in his speech mengistu also referred to ethiopias unusually 
good rains this year and expressed confidence that if the wet 
weather continues the nation will in a short time be free of 
food shortages which have made us the butt of an unhealthy 
comment 
the horn of africa nation suffers chronic droughts which in 
198485 led to a famine that killed an estimated 1 million people 
and sparked the largest international relief effort in history 
rains failed again in 1987 causing widespread crop failures that 
threatened an estimated 32 million people with starvation in 
eritrea and tigray

japan said it will lift its sanctions against 
communist north korea on friday the day before the summer olympics 
open in seoul south korea in the friendly and generous spirit 
appropriate to a festival of peace 
the decision was announced tuesday a day after an opposition 
leader returning from north korea said the pyongyang government was 
willing to free two japanese seamen detained for more than four 
years on spying charges 
tsuruo yamaguchi secretarygeneral of the japan socialist 
party said north korean leaders wanted to improve north 
koreanjapanese relations 
the relations were ruptured when tokyo imposed the sanctions 
early this year after pyongyangs alleged bombing of a south korean 
passenger flight near burma north korea denied involvement in the 
disaster which killed all 115 people aboard the aircraft last 
november 
japanese sanctions included restrictions on contact between 
japanese and north korean officials 
since that time domestic and foreign interest in preventing 
the recurrence of terrorism has reached an unprecedentedly high 
level indicating that the aim of showing japans firm attitude 
against terrorism has been achieved the chief cabinet secretary 
keizo obuchi said in a statement following a cabinet meeting 
tuesday morning 
obuchi said japan will lift the sanctions from the viewpoint 
that the games may be conducted with the utmost possible relaxation 
of tension and in the friendly and generous spirit appropriate to a 
festival of peace 
japan is a major ally of prowestern south korea and maintains 
no official diplomatic ties with north korea japan has sought help 
from third parties including the international red cross and 
china in winning the freedom of isamu beniko and yoshio kuriura 
north korea detained the two seamen in 1983 on unspecified 
espionage charges

a businessman is leaping to fill the gap 
created by dropping supplies of bullfrogs whose legs are consumed 
as a cripsy delicacy in the south 
bruce maghan was almost hopping in anticipation monday of an 
experimental program to raise the big hopping amphibians 
its not really even off the ground yet but were pretty 
excited the owner of stillashak institutional sea products said 
in a telephone interview from pascagoula on the gulf coast 
if you look what has been done in this state for the shrimp 
oyster striped bass and redfish industies theres no reason it 
cant be done for frog legs maghan said 
maghan said that three years ago he was paying 215 to 220 a 
pound for frog legs the price is now about 406 per pound 
i have been quoted as much as 5 to 510 that goes to show 
you that the market is way up three years ago i was getting about 
six to eight pair of legs to the pound now its about four to six 
pairs per pound 
but we are also looking at the remnants of supplies and those 
are depleting fast he said 
maghan said in 198687 more than 86 million pounds of frog 
legs came into the united states from india and bangladesh he said 
the market could be as much as 10 million pounds 
but india and bangladesh have put a fiveyear moratorium on such 
exports he said 
they the bullfrogs are wild over there and they have taken 
so many of them that the insect problem has increased so they 
arent shipping any more 
but i believe there is no reason why florida georgia 
alabama louisiana and mississippi cant raise all the frogs we 
need he said 
maghan said the adult frogs eat insects but hes trying to come 
up with a feed that will increase their size and growth 
he plans to start with tadpoles and raise them all the way to 
adults 
it is a long process maghan said it is not something we 
expect to do overnight we expect to raise the critters in a pond 
but everything else is still up in the air

both accidents were blamed on pilot error experts say hard 
evidence rarely exists to show pilots erred because they were tired 
the problem with fatigue is its not a bent piece of metal 
its not a liquid that can be analyzed in the laboratory said 
dr stanley mohler a former faa official who heads aerospace 
medicine at wright state university 
government and airline officials acknowledge theyve heard tales 
of pilots napping in flight and of mistakes attributed to 
sleepiness but they play down such reports 
there isnt evidence that there is a fatigue problem said 
walt coleman spokesman for the air transport association a trade 
group representing the major airlines 
t allan mcartor administrator of the federal aviation 
administration says more research is needed into the effects of 
long flights on the circadian system or biological clock but he 
denies a safety problem 
theres no evidence that shows it makes flying any more 
hazardous mcartor said 
some 600 accounts of missed approaches near misses and near 
tragedies blamed on fatigue show up in voluntary pilot reports 
filed with the air safety reporting system an office run by nasa 
for pilots who want to confess to mistakes and report risky 
conditions without fear of retribution 
enough reports were filed by crews for commuter airlines and air 
taxis that the asrs sent a memo to the faa in may identifying 
recurring pilot deviations directly attributable to fatigue and 
cockpit workload 
the big chunk that we have perceived out of this information 
is that fatigue is a real issue that needs to be addressed said 
bill reynard who runs the reporting system 
even though the reports are protected by anonymity and are not 
investigated by the asrs reynard believes they are truthful 
it is absolutely positively valid that these numbers are 
real he said our analysts have been in aviation for 20 to 30 
years they are very good at spotting a ringer 
the reports provide a litany of horror stories 
in february 1987 the copilot of a crosscountry jumbo jet 
already descending into boston looks up from his coffee cup to see 
the captain asleep at the controls 
i think we need to look at the world of the pilot and see what 
more hours and labor unrest is doing he writes 
the next month a large airliner from los angeles to baltimore 
sinks 4000 feet below its assigned altitude coming close enough 
to another plane to set off alarms at the air traffic control 
center 
i do not believe it would have occurred to a rested crew 
writes a crewmember noting he flew all night to cleveland then 
continued to baltimore into the morning sun duty regulations 
do not in any way address the debilitating effects of flying all 
night and especially of continuing to work into the morning hours 
last november the copilot of another large jet begins a 
takeoff roll from fort lauderdale without setting the flaps an 
error then already suspected in the northwest dc9 crash in detroit 
that had killed 154 people three months earlier 
cockpit warning horns sound and takeoff is aborted in the 
detroit crash the horns failed to sound 
it is quite sobering to consider that the combination of 
fatigue and distractions could so easily cause a breakdown in my 
own cockpit discipline writes the copilot who had flown for 
three days with little sleep 
complacency was not a factor he writes simple fatigue 
was the culprit 
that incident affords a good look at the shadowy effects of 
fatigue planes dont crash because pilots are tired say the 
experts fatigue becomes a killer only when something else 
equipment or the weather goes wrong as well 
if for example the fort lauderdale flights warning horns had 
failed as they did in detroit the tired pilots oversight could 
have been fatal in the detroit crash there was no evidence 
fatigue played a role 
on paper faa flight rules seem favorable to pilots domestic 
pilots are limited to eight hours flight time a day overseas 
pilots fly no more than 12 all pilots must get at least eight 
hours of rest between flight sequences 
however the regulations count only scheduled flight time not 
the hours spent on the ground between flights so scheduled 
turnarounds and unscheduled delays can push a crews day up to 16 
hours 
scheduling agreements between airlines and pilots once kept 
flight hours well below federal standards but concessions to 
management have become commonplace amid the fierce competition 
brought on by deregulation 
john mazor spokesman for the airline pilots association said 
that 10 years ago at the start of deregulation the typical 
contract limited flight time to a maximum of 75 to 80 hours per 
month today he says its 8085 hours 
continental pilots who lost their contract when the company 
reorganized in 1983 now fly 20 percent more hours a month the 
company says its flight hours are still well under the industry 
average 
our work rules remove the antiproductivity aspects to 
allow reasonable productivity said spokesman bruce hicks 
northwest pilots complain their company has interpreted 
regulations to allow international crews flying home to take on 
additional domestic flights adding up to four flight hours to 
their day northwest citing ongoing negotiations with the pilots 
declined to comment 
when united airlines acquired pan americans pacific routes in 
1986 its pilots faced extended flight hours and reduced crew size 
on the longer routes a separate contract added a day of work each 
month 
the pan am guys had a cushy job but the company fell on hard 
times said john ferg uniteds director of flight operations 
were trying to strike a balance between whats fair and 
equitable for the pilots and whats economical 
many pilots interviewed complain the scales are tipped too far 
toward economics at the expense of safety 
ive got 400 people in that airplane and i take it very 
seriously said a united 747 pilot its a responsibility and 
you know this isnt good for the passengers

asians are keeping a close eye on an immigration 
debate in australia to see if it will mean a slow down in the flow 
of asian emigrants into the country some asians say they see signs 
of racism 
several asian newspapers have published editorials reminding 
australia of its growing economic links with asian countries 
the outcome of the intense immigration debate now under way in 
australia will either confirm or confound the view asians hold that 
a strong undercurrent of racism exists in the lucky country 
the conservative englishlanguage south china morning post of hong 
kong said 
while australia was founded on british values the facts today 
are that politically and economically the country cannot always 
look west 
in australia a growing influx of asian migrants is in the 
background of a debate over immigration rules and multiculturalism 
a policy that encourages migrants to keep cultural links with 
their homelands 
john howard leader of australias opposition liberal party 
says immigration from asia should be slowed in the interests of 
social harmony and that immigrants should embrace the 
englishspeaking majoritys anglosaxon cultural values 
i am not saying i would end asian immigration he said 
but what i am saying is that it is a legitimate concern of any 
community and any government to say that it is imposing social 
tensions and that it is imposing a lack of social cohesion 
the government has proposed legislation that would prohibit the 
use of race or ethnic origins as criteria for judging potential 
immigrants acceptability howard who heads a twoparty national 
opposition is against the bill but has lost support recently in 
parliament 
prime minister bob hawke of the labor party has vowed to fight 
any move to restrict asian immigration and says he would maintain a 
policy of nondiscrimination even if he thought it would mean 
losing an election 
australia a continent with only 16 million people near asias 
huge population of 3 billion is an attractive destination for 
emigrants it is called lucky because of its rich resources and 
comfortable climate 
the australian bureau of statistics says the number of asian 
immigrants climbed by onethird in the past year out of 116430 
immigrants between january and november 1987 47450 were asians 
compared with 36360 in the same period in 1986 australia has 
taken in 100000 vietnamese since 1975 when the indochina war 
ended and has a growing chinese community 
emigration counselors in several asian countries list australia 
as attractive for its climate proximity and educational 
opportunities for children increasing numbers of asians with 
capital and business experience are snowing interest in emigrating 
to australia 
in taiwan australia now surpassed canada and the united states 
as the top choice of emigrants 
people here barely knew anything about australia three years 
ago said david chang manager of taiwans queter international 
company which handles emigration applications to australia but 
emigrating to australia has become a fad now 
chang said he understood why australia had doubled the capital 
requirement for business emigrants to 500000 australian dollars 
410000 in the past year 
australia no longer needs foreign capital and personnel now as 
much as before it is only natural that it closes the door a bit 
in hong kong where emigration is on the upswing due to 
nervousness over chinas taking sovereignty of the british colony 
in 1997 australia is the second most popular destination after 
canada 
janet sekavs regional migration director in australias 
consulate in hong kong said 6431 filipinos emigrated to australia 
in 1986 compared with 5140 from hong kong and 5032 from malaysia 
chan kawai editor of the emigrant hong kongs magazine on 
emigration said he thought the number of emigration applications 
would remain high even if australia imposes new curbs 
australia is strange chan said it is in asia but it does 
not treat itself as an asian country it is a multiracial country 
and economically it should have the potential to accept more 
people 
susie tse migration service manager of price waterhouse 
emigration consultancy in hong kong said it would be racist if 
australia refuses asians but from my nine years experience in 
australia i have not felt any racism and am not sure if it is just 
overexaggeration by the press 
the fiercest reaction has come from a malaysian newspaper the 
star in kuala lumpur where editor vk chin wrote in a recent 
column that australians he described as racists make asian 
immigrants feel inadequate insecure and even subhuman 
based on the statements of some of these pillars of the 
australian political establishment it would appear that inside 
every liberal senator or member of parliament is a racist 
struggling to get out chin wrote 
australia may be a big wideopen country but it is in danger 
of being led by smallminded people with petty prejudices and 
attitudes more suited to the victorian age

for years republican james jeffords 
vermonts lone member of the us house has enjoyed the backing of 
many state democrats two years ago he even won reelection with 
both the gop and democratic nominations 
this year though as jeffords seeks the seat of retiring us 
sen robert stafford rvt his popularity among democrats is 
being used against him by gop challenger michael griffes who calls 
himself the real republican in the race 
griffes and jeffords will face off next tuesday in vermonts 
republican primary the winner will face democrat william gray a 
former us attorney in the november election gray is unopposed 
in tuesdays democratic primary 
jeffords is the clear favorite in the primary but his support 
of democratic initiatives over the years has angered many of the 
gop faithful including former fourterm gov richard snelling who 
donated 1000 to the griffes campaign 
jim jeffords while he clearly has provided a long service to 
vermont has not in my opinion been very often mindful of the 
fact that he gets his nominations from the republican party said 
snelling himself considered a moderate to liberal 
while snelling was willing to give money to griffes he withheld 
his formal endorsement saying the 35yearold political newcomer 
had not sufficiently established his credentials 
and that is clearly griffes weak point while jeffords 54 has 
lived his life in vermont and served as a state senator attorney 
general and member of the us house griffes had lived in the 
state only a year or so in the 1970s before returning here this 
spring to challenge jeffords 
he served in the navy and then worked for grumman corp a major 
defense contractor in washington he said he decided to move back 
to vermont to challenge jeffords when the congressman was the only 
republican in the house last fall to vote for a 12 billion 
deficitreduction measure backed by the democratic leadership on a 
crucial 206205 vote 
that vote was only one of the many times jeffords has broken 
party ranks in 1981 he was the sole house republican to vote 
against president reagans taxcut package in 1987 jeffords had 
the secondhighest antireagan voting record among republicans in 
the house as analyzed by congressional quarterly magazine he 
opposed the president on 71 percent of the key votes 
when you get to the point where you start making decisions or 
doing things based upon political expedience youve worn out your 
usefulness as someone who can really help said jeffords who 
says he makes his decisions on whats best for vermonters not on 
whats best for the republicans 
griffes campaigns by saying that jeffords should be honest and 
seek the democratic nomination my record will be more like bob 
staffords and not like house speaker jim wrights says griffes 
a reference to vermonts retiring republican senator and the 
democratic speaker of the house 
jeffords is considered the strong favorite in the november 
election should he win the primary because of his strong 
democratic support 
the republican primary for the us senate is one of three 
statewide contests that will be decided tuesday 
with jeffords giving up his house seat four democrats and two 
republicans are seeking their respective party nominations the two 
winners will be joined on the november ballot by burlington mayor 
bernard sanders a socialist who is running a strong independent 
campaign for the house seat and candidates representing the 
liberty union the libertarian party and the small is beautiful 
party 
former lt gov peter smith is favored to win the republican 
congressional race while the democratic race featuring former 
secretary of state james guest house majority leader paul poirier 
senate president pro tem peter welch and university of vermont 
professor dolores sandoval is considered wide open 
gov madeleine kunin seeking her third term is unopposed in 
tuesdays primary as is her republican challenger state rep

buffalo graze 
nonchalantly near flaming trees but people are not reacting so 
coolly and residents once worried about losing business to forest 
fires now fear losing their homes 
fire has destroyed buildings around the old faithful geyser and 
has threatened tourist towns on the periphery of the countrys 
first national park 
the montana towns of cooke city and silver gate outside the 
parks northeast entrance were evacuted twice last week jardine 
mont near the northern gate was evacuated saturday 
firefighters saved cooke city and silver gate but only by 
burning thousands of acres of forest to remove fuel from the fires 
path the socalled backfires left the oncepicturesque towns 
flanked by black skeletal trees 
all we can do is herd it around improvements and 
structures and dont get anybody killed said bob martines a 
structure protection officer in cooke city 
the 22 millionacre park dedicated in 1872 attracts more than 
2 million visitors a year who marvel at geysers and hot springs 
mountain scenery and wild animals 
but tourists have stayed away in droves this summer and 
residents of tourismdependent towns around the park have 
complained bitterly about the park services initial reluctance to 
respond to the fires 
a guy gets really bitter when it keeps dragging on and on and 
on said david klatt of cooke city who spent spent three days in 
a motel room outside of town last week waiting out an evacuation 
in this summer of heat and drought yellowstone is suffering the 
worst fires in at least 200 years 
forest fires have charred more than 1 million acres in 
yellowstone and in the surrounding national forests and parks in 
montana wyoming and idaho 
each day firefighters pray for rain but at park headquarters 
near mammoth hot springs this is the thirddriest summer on record 
only 16 inches of rain fell at mammoth in june july and august 
onethird the normal rainfall 
it was also the hottest summer on record with temperatures 
steaming an average of 5 degrees above normal the weather service 
said 
though other areas are hard hit yellowstone is the top concern 
of federal officials of 250 million spent so far on fighting 
fires 78 million has gone toward efforts around the park said 
the boise interagency fire center which coordinates firefighting 
in the west 
since 1972 park officials have allowed lightningsparked fires 
to burn 
in the past 16 years we had 140 fires that burned 33000 
acres that averages about 240 acres apiece before they went out on 
their own said john varley chief of the parks research 
division 
the fires help cleanse the pine forest they clear deadwood 
create new meadows for forage release nutrients for new plants and 
free the pines seeds from their cones 
a cool wet spring lulled park officials into believing this 
summer would be no different but the heat and low humidity left 
the forest more parched than kilndried lumber 
by july 15 when the park service decided to start fighting the 
fires it was too late to stop them 
fire crew boss john borton has battled forest fires in the west 
for 18 years but the blaze he had been fighting and sleeping near 
for 25 nights was something new 
this is the edge of a fire that goes back 50 miles he said 
its as out of control as it was six weeks ago this is the most 
extreme fire behavior that just about any of us has ever seen

among the portraits of former florida 
senate presidents hanging in the chamber its easy to pick out 
dempsey barron hes the one riding the horse 
the panhandle lawyerrancher who friends and foes alike call 
one of the most powerful men in florida government exercises his 
authority exactly like the godfather a former colleague says 
but that era is coming to an end the 66yearold auburnhaired 
red barron was narrowly defeated in the democratic primary on 
tuesday he lost to vince bruner a fort walton beach lawyer born a 
year after barron was first elected to the legislature 32 years ago 
a conservative democrat barron served as senate president in 
197576 once ordering thengov reubin askew to stay out of the 
upper chamber although in much more colorful words 
since then he has served almost continuously as chairman of the 
senate rules committee giving him control over the legislative 
calendar and makeorbreak authority over bills 
hes really one of a kind said allen morris historian and 
former clerk of the state house ive been here since 1941 and 
really cant think of anybody who compares to him 
his departure will reorganize the thinking in the senate 
morris said the senators no longer will have to puzzle over wat 
dempsey thinks of each bill 
in his successful primary challenge bruner cited barrons 
support of a tax increase and claimed barron failed to pay 
attention to constituent needs and was too cozy to state business 
interests 
his challenge was aided by feminists angered that barron helped 
kill the equal rights amendment and by trial lawyers who opposed 
barrons efforts on behalf of insurance companies many of them 
represented by his law firm to limit the size of verdicts in 
negligence suits 
he was the architect of the defeat of the equal rights 
amendment in florida said molly yard president of the national 
organization for women good riddance i think we helped to dig 
his grave 
as a result of barrons departure some colleagues have been 
predicting a more partisan and open senate and reforms to reduce 
the virtually dictatorial power of the leadership 
barron exercised his power exactly like the godfather said 
former democratic sen roberta fox his ability to do that was 
seductive not in a sexual sense but he had a truly seductive 
personality 
the power was wielded with little regard to party labels and 
party loyalty 
when unable to get his way in democratic caucuses he forged 
coalitions between conservatives in his own party or 
dempseycrats and republicans he angered democrat leaders by 
throwing his support to republican candidates for national and 
statewide office including bob martinez in his successful run for 
governor in 1986 
republicans did much of the mourning over his loss 
im shocked im sick said tommy thomas a former state 
republican party chairman 
we knew he was in a tight race said brian ballard chief of 
operations for martinez but we all thought he would make it 
because hes dempsey hes the red barron and hes supposed to 
pull out 
but the democratic state chairman charles whitehead had little 
sympathy sen barron lost the race when he and bob martinez rode 
their horses together and put their arms around each other at the 
bonifay rodeo two years ago whitehead said he alienated all 
the democrats in the area by doing that 
and it turns out martinez and barron joined together to give 
us the biggest tax increase we ever had 
bruner had hammered barron usually a steadfast opponent of 
taxes any taxes for his support of floridas illfated 1 
billionayear services tax the tax was repealed in the wake of 
stiff opposition last year but the governor and barron wound up 
accepting an even bigger increase in the general sales tax 
barron said he has no regrets and plans to spend more time at 
his ranches in the florida panhandle and wyoming 
im a pretty private person and im going to live my life with 
my friends and move down the road he said my cattle are in 
good shape im going to go up and cut hay ive enjoyed the 
ride shed no tears for me

american savings amp loan became the industrys 
biggest financial basket case by abandoning conservative ways and 
some worry that a 2 billion federal bailout doesnt do enough to 
force a return to conservatism 
as details of the federal home loan bank boards blueprint for 
reviving the nations secondlargest thrift trickle out analysts 
legislators and competitors are sounding calls for caution 
some fret over the planned transfer of american to the 
aggressive bass investment group and suggestions that the revived 
company could be allowed to venture beyond the standard sampl 
business of home loans and savings accounts 
others recall what they see as regulatory inaction during the 
companys fouryear slide toward receivership a slide most blame 
on aggressive management toorapid growth and risky real estate 
loans 
american savings amp loan association with headquarters in 
stockton and 186 branches throughout california was seized by the 
bank board tuesday as a prelude to turning it over to the robert m 
bass group of fort worth texas bass will pump 550 million cash 
into the insolvent thrift and the bank board has committed 2 
billion in cash and promissory notes over the next decade 
american continues to operate its parent company financial 
corp of america in irvine calif announced plans to file a 
federal bankruptcy petition 
americans problems predate the 1983 joining of state savings amp 
loan and american savings amp loan the merger gave the company its 
present form 
state under chairman robert knapp was known for making loans 
on commercial real estate ventures and developments spurned by 
other sampls american was a virtual opposite with a large branch 
network and a portfolio of conservative home loans and savings 
accounts on which it paid relatively low interest 
regulators already keeping an eye on state believed that the 
merger which created what was then the nations biggest sampl would 
stabilize knapps company 
but american grew rapidly under knapp in part by making loans 
with fixed interest rates a strategy that has come back to haunt 
american in periods of rising rates 
in the summer of 1984 bank board analysts were warning that 
loans made by american and the old state savings on real estate had 
been made without adequate analysis of the true value of the 
properties 
institutional investors were quietly withdrawing deposits amid a 
flurry of news reports about loan problems at american 
a real depositor run began in 1984 after the securities and 
exchange commission forced american to restate its secondquarter 
results to account for losses on mortgagebacked securities 
turning a 31 million profit into a 107 million loss 
losses from the run eventually were tallied at 6 billion in 
august 1984 knapp was forced out by the bank board and replaced by 
william popejoy 
popejoy who had once been president of the old american 
savings proceeded to cut costs laying off 1500 workers and 
selling 475 company cars and five jets 
management added to the companys reserve against bad loans to 
the point where the reserve stood at more than 12 billion as of 
june 30 
but after a period of shrinking american popejoy concluded the 
only way to save the company was to expand adding branches and 
buying securities backed by mortgages with fixed interest rates 
thats counter to an industry trend in recent years to issue 
mortgages with adjustable rates to protect the lender against 
rising interest rates 
competitors have pressed the bank board to rein in american 
concerned that a big rescue would drive up their required payments 
to the industrys governmentrun insurance fund the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp 
stockholders have accused popejoy of failing to disclose the 
extent of the companys problems with bad loans and foreclosed real 
estate 
critics also have focused on a provision of the bailout that 
would allow american to engage in merchant banking something 
beyond traditional sampl business 
at a us house banking committee hearing thursday bank board 
chairman danny wall seeking to allay fears american could venture 
onto risky ground disclosed restrictions on the proposed merchant 
banking operation 
the merchant bank would be limited to 15 billion in assets and 
would be barred from direct real estate investment or development 
it would be barred from investing in gambling activities 
foreign firms precious metals commodities futures and options 
and the bank board would have the right to step in to stop 
activities it deems too risky

frantic growth and modernization rub 
shoulders with ancient tradition in a constant blur of old and new 
in this vibrant city site of the 1988 olympics 
seoul home to 10 million people is the crown jewel in the 
economic miracle that turned south korea from one of the worlds 
poorest nations into an economic powerhouse in just three decades 
the city also symbolizes how little some things have changed 
traditional ways of life exist alongside relentless expansion and 
slums and poverty mix with prosperous suburbs and wealth 
seoul is a city of contrasts one moment you are facing the 
forefront of the 20th century and then you turn around and see a 
scene out of the middle ages said one foreign resident 
gleaming skyscrapers and hordes of business workers in suits and 
dresses blanket the commercial districts but just a few blocks 
away are tiny dirty workshops where laborers work at a frantic 
pace for subsistence wages 
seoul is ringed with row after row of apartment buildings that 
house the growing middle classes the city is also dotted with 
slums where up to 10 people live in a single room without plumbing 
dazzling new department stores in the center of seoul show off 
the latest fashions and electronic goods families dress up to shop 
and eat hamburgers or pizza at western restaurants and american 
fastfood chains 
just a few blocks away is ancient namdaemun market where stall 
holders hawk their goods to throngs of people packed into the 
narrow streets roadside vendors offer rice dog meat squid and 
other foods that have been staples for centuries 
but modern values and habits appear to be prevailing nearly 
everyone dresses in western clothing and some mothers complain that 
their children prefer hamburgers to rice 
divorce rates are climbing and dating has become commonplace 
families save to buy cars and appliances for increasingly western 
lifestyles 
seoul devastated during the korean war in the early 1950s and 
largely rebuilt has few ancient or traditional korean buildings 
the pace in seoul often is frantic workers routinely put in 
10hour shifts and work half days on saturdays office workers stay 
at their desks to avoid being the first to leave at the end of the 
day 
children are inculcated with traditional confucian values to 
revere their elders obey orders and work hard 
we want foreigners to see how much our country has attained 
we are proud our country has done so well said businessman lee 
jongik 
but older koreans say the younger generation is not so mindful 
of the need to work and take weeklong vacations and other unheard 
of indulgences 
these young koreans are very different they want everything 
and dont listen to their elders said a senior journalist who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
many things have been neglected in seoul to concentrate on 
expanding the economy as quickly as possible pollution has been 
allowed to go largely unchecked so business can flourish the city 
has few parks or other recreational facilities 
we need more time to become one of the developed countries we 
are still developing said businessman lee 
south koreans hope the olympics will cement its prosperity and 
modernization they say there will be more time and money to fix 
problems that have been neglected 
korea can go worldwide through the olympics said kim 
chulyong a shopkeeper 
the olympics are portrayed as a national mission and ordinary 
people talk seriously about their duty to help ensure the games are 
a success 
the olympics have spread into almost every aspect of life the 
symbol of the olympic movement five interlocked circles is 
stamped on everything from milk cartons and television logos to 
each seoul subway car 
the no 1 games the no 1 people proclaim the subway signs

presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari is 
tough and highly disciplined despite his modest demeanor qualities 
he will need to govern mexico for the next six years 
salinas 40 faces protracted economic problems that affect 
mexicos relationship with the united states and a vocal opposition 
that still questions whether his mandate was won fairly 
given the circumstances he is going to have to be a great 
president because otherwise the problems of the country will become 
enormously complicated said manuel camacho solis a close 
colleague and general secretary of the governing institutional 
revolutionary party 
an illustration of one lingering problem was the vote saturday 
by the chamber of deputies to certify salinas july 6 election as 
president virtually all votes came from the governing party 
called the pri for its spanish initials 
the opposition which held the pri to 507 percent of the 
official vote the lowest since pri took power in 1929 maintains 
the presidency was won by fraud 
salinas was the chief architect of an economic austerity program 
that rescued this nation of 85 million people from near bankruptcy 
and has cut its record 159 percent inflation for 1987 by half this 
year still his policies remain unpopular because workers have 
lost half their buying power 
the united states and mexico share a 2000mile border and 
bilateral issues include mexicos 104 billion debt drug 
trafficking and immigration if mexicos economy gets worse many 
mexicans are likely to vote with their feet by moving north 
salinas also will have to deal with a party that is struggling 
to adapt to a more democratic environment many of his ideas for 
decentralizing the economy and reduce the role of the state are 
unpopular with politicians used to wielding unquestioned power 
salinas like his three predecessors rose in the bureaucracy 
and has no previous experience in elective office although he grew 
up with politics his father was a former commerce minister his 
mother an economist active in party politics 
born in mexico city salinas lived in the village of tetla in 
central mexico while researching his doctoral thesis on the 
connection between government spending and political power 
salinas holds two masters degrees and one doctorate from 
harvard university where his father also attended he speaks 
fluent english 
after graduation salinas advanced quickly in government 
catching the eye of miguel de la madrid and becoming budget 
secretary when de la madrid became president in 1982 
hes very comprehensive in the sense that he seems to have a 
computer in his head to manage many problems at once said otto 
granados information secretary of the pri 
another associate said salinas likes to be informed on 
everything and as president may have to learn to let go of 
things more 
salinas has had to fight the image that he is a technocrat 
without political experience his public comments are unrevealing 
he lacks charisma and is often depicted in local cartoons as a 
mouse because of his baldness big ears and mustache 
but associates say he is forceful and demanding requiring work 
be done well and promptly 
when he proposes something he attains it said one 
associate noting that salinas decided to learn tennis about three 
years ago and has since become a good amateur player 
salinas who won a silver medal in an equestrian event at the 
pan american games in 1971 also runs three or four times a week 
he married cecilia occelli after a sevenyear engagement that 
began while they were students 
he was very serious but at the same time jovial mrs 
salinas said this year 
salinas doesnt smoke drinks only socially and spends any free 
time with his wife and their three children associates said

firefighters took 
advantage of chilly damp weather monday to strengthen lines around 
fires that have ravaged nearly 1 million acres inside the park but 
hot dry weather was predicted by midweek 
its a sleeping giant now denny bungarz a fire incident 
commander said during a briefing monday we want to tie it down 
so when it wakes up it cant run on us 
fire activity was limited monday after a weekend of showers and 
light snow the first significant precipitation since spring 
that gave firefighters a needed break from high wind and 
temperatures that let fires grow by thousands of acres per day last 
week 
the fires inside the 22millionacre park had burned 939270 
acres as of monday 
temperatures remained in the 40s in the park monday keeping 
humidity levels at up to 50 percent but the weather was expected 
to begin clearing tuesday and temperatures were to reach 70 degrees 
by wednesday drying the area once again 
the cool wet weekend also helped firefighters in surrounding 
areas of montana idaho and wyoming and in colorado and utah 
where a 15700acre fire was declared under control monday 
were more optimistic this morning than we have been for some 
weeks said bill baden forest service director at the 
interagency fire center in boise idaho with the moisture we 
have on the fires now its cooled them down to where we can in and 
work them directly 
the center which coordinates forest fire suppression calls 
this the worst forest fire season in 30 years 
forests and brush also burned in washington where a 400acre 
fire that apparently began from an illegal campfire in an alpine 
area of olympic national park had crews from three states fighting 
it and a fire in californias gold rush country in the sierra 
nevada forced most of the 4500 residents of lake wildwood to 
evacuate for a second time monday 
in oregon a fastmoving fire broke out in dry grass and timber 
in the willamette national forest and sheriffs deputies warned 
residents about six miles southeast of oakridge to be ready to 
evacuate the fire quickly burned 1000 acres in rolling hills 10 
to 15 miles southeast of oakridge forest spokeswoman lorette 
laferriere said 
baden said there 28 fires still out of control in the west that 
had charred 18 million acres 
the favorable weather allowed yellowstone officials to open all 
roads through the park monday except its northeastern entrance 
leading to cooke city mont the route inside the park from 
mammoth hot springs to canyon and tower and craig pass 
about 1000 marines from camp pendleton calif were to reach 
yellowstone on wednesday and thursday to help firefighters while 
some of the first soldiers sent to yellowstone from fort lewis 
wash were not to be released until at least saturday 
well have lots of people here so maybe we can nail this 
thing bungarz said 
although moisture helped slow the advance of the flames with 
little growth recorded during the weekend it would probably dry 
out quickly bungarz said he added however none of the fires 
would make major progress until the area is thoroughly dried 
wed have to have a heck of a lot of rain to put the fire 
out said fire information officer jim payne on the 31500acre 
red bench fire at glacier national park in montana youre 
talking numbers of inches of rain 
despite the return of warmer weather the arrival of autumn 
weather with lower temperatures and shorter days had officials 
optimistic the fires would no longer make major advances 
we still expect fire activity but it wont be as intense or 
as much or as fast as it has been in the past said fire 
information officer sonya capek the days are getting shorter so 
the burning period is getting shorter 
north of the park in montana gov ted schwinden canceled his 
sweeping ban on all recreational activities in the states 
fireravaged countryside because of the weekend weather 
about 1000 firefighters got the day off monday in montana 
because up to a foot of snow fell on the eastern half of the 
247000acre cnyon creek fire north of helena said fire 
information officer jane weber they were taken to a national guard 
facility to warm up and dry out their clothes 
more than 100 residents evacuated from scattered homes cabins 
and ranches along the fires eastern front were returning to the 
region by sunday and monday she added 
also in montana the hellroaring creek fire that had charred 
81900 acres and moved into yellowstone was contained sunday said 
information officer chris comstock

boris smyslovsky an anticommunist 
former russian general whose world war ii unit fought with hitlers 
troops against the red army has died at age 91 
maj gen smyslovsky who then called himself arthur holmston 
led a 6000man contingent known as the first russian national army 
of the german wehrmacht 
at the end of world war ii he and 500 remaining soldiers 
managed to reach neutral liechtenstein where staunchly 
anticommunist prince franz josef ii granted them political asylum 
death notices published in liechtenstein newspapers said he died 
in the capital vaduz last monday and was buried thursday the 
masscirculation swiss newspaper sonntagsblick reported his death 
sunday 
once an officer in the russian imperial guards smyslosvky went 
into polish and german exile after fighting the bolsheviks in the 
civil war after hitler invaded russia in 1941 he became the first 
russian to command a russian unit fighting for the germans on the 
eastern front 
in a 1985 interview with the associated press he said his goal 
was to end communism in the soviet union and get rid of stalin but 
he said he was not a nazi 
i thought that the germans would be the only ones who could 
defeat the soviets and that the allies then would defeat the 
exhausted germans he said 
what the germans did was horrible hitler corrupted their 
souls he said but the soviets destroyed a whole nation 
russia 
smyslovsky said volunteers from among soviet prisoners of war 
formed the bulk of his army with the rest made up of prewar exiles 
like himself 
when the eastern front collapsed the unit fled westward and was 
decimated by fighting 
but smyslovsky and his men still heavily armed marched through 
austria and crossed into liechtenstein on may 3 1945 
among them was grand duke vladimir cyrillovich heir to the 
russian throne whom the soldiers had picked up in austria 
the group encountered no resistance from swiss border patrols 
guarding the tiny principality between austria and switzerland 
which dissolved its army in 1868 the russians were disarmed and 
granted political asylum 
a soviet repatriation commission later interviewed smyslovskys 
men and almost half of them agreed to return 
we have never heard from them again smyslovsky told ap 
most of the rest went into exile in argentina including 
smyslovsky but in 1975 he returned to liechtenstein with his wife 
irene who survives him

will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with the media 
by historians republican bush said it certainly is what i 
will strive for during my tenure as president 
the reagan administration has come under frequent criticism for 
limiting access to information

his comments on his plans with a charge that the reaganbush 
administration has waged an assault on the freedom of information 
act with every weapon in its arsenal 
dukakis said he has a proven record of accessibility to 
reporters and would continue on that course as president 
throughout my public career ive believed in a free press and 
my record shows ive practiced that belief he said as 
president i would hope to continue this pattern of accessibility 
to the white house press corps giving them and me the opportunity 
to utilize our first amendment freedoms

q as president what sort of tone would you set regarding 
openness in government access to government information and 
freedom of information 
a within the limits of national security government should be 
open to scrutiny by the media and the public ours is a democracy 
where goverment must be accountable to the people the 
informationgathering process from a news conference to the 
freedom of information act is vital and essential to our system of 
democracy 
q what kind of relationship do you think youve had with the 
media during your public career how would you seek to improve it 
if at all 
a i think i have had a good relationship with the media as 
president i hope that i will be able to spend more time talking 
with smaller groups of reporters i enjoy a good give and take and 
that kind of format allows me to get to know reporters a little 
better and them to know me not only will this benefit reporters 
but more importantly such free exchange will ultimately benefit 
the general public as well 
q throughout history presidents have had a variety of 
relationships with the media are there any styles you would 
emulate are there any you would avoid when it comes time to write 
the history of your relations with the media what will it say 
a with the media the congress or the public it would be a 
mistake to attempt to be something or someone youre not so warts 
and all what you see is what youll get 
i hope words like accessible candid honest and 
fair will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with 
the media by historians it certainly is what i will strive for 
during my tenure as president 
q how frequently would you meet with reporters how would you 
conduct press conferences how often would you hold press 
conferences would you make any changes in the way president reagan 
has done his press conferences 
a there are a number of ways to communicate with both the media 
and the public press conferences are one important way and they 
would certainly be central to my effort to ensure accessibility in 
my administration oneonone and group interviews satellite 
interviews with regional media national televised addresses are 
other examples of methods that a president can and should use to 
provide the media with opportunities to discuss administration 
policies and programs 
my goal would be to get the right mix of all of the options 
available to guarantee an open administration realistically you 
cant put a number on any of the working parts of an open approach 
to accessibility but you can make and keep a commitment to the 
goal itself 
q more specifically what message will you send to your 
executive agencies regarding freedom of information requests 
a my message will be simple obey the law 
q heres a chance to offer some contructive criticism what 
things would you most like to change about the news media what 
should the nations media do differently to better serve the public 
interest 
a accuracy and fairness are the name of the game the media 
goes to great lengths to be accurate it needs to go to the same 
lengths to be fair while it is often necessary to use unnamed 
sources in gathering information for a story it puts the validity 
of a story at a disadvantage i hope the news media would rely as 
little as possible on this approach to information gathering and 
reporting

q what sort of individual do you see putting in the job of 
white house spokesperson how much access would the spokesman have 
to administration thinking and information do you condone larry 
speakes practice of manufacturing quotes 
a the job of white house press secretary is one of the toughest 
in any administration and a number of qualities are important a 
press secretary must be honest ethical steady candid with both 
the media and the president and experienced with an understanding 
of the media and its needs a sense of humor doesnt hurt either 
if access is important to reporters it is absolutely vital to a 
press secretary i understand that to function effectively a 
press secretary must have a firsthand knowledge of a presidents 
policies and positions 
finally on the third question no 
q how much access do you believe reporters ought to have to the 
white house staff how free would your staff be to talk on the 
record to reporters 
a the bush administration will be an open one that doesnt 
mean every staff member will be authorized to serve as an 
administration spokesman or interpreter of events and policies the 
best interests of the government media and public arent observed 
by the confusion and misinformation that usually results from that 
kind of policy 
not in every instance but in most if something cant be said on 
the record its probably better left unsaid 
q what would be your policy on allowing media coverage of 
military actions a la grenada do you support the pool approach 
worked out and used in the persian gulf exercises or do you 
believe reporters and photographers ought to have even freer access 
to military operations 
a certainly the public has a right to know the details of 
military operations in an appropriate time frame and in a way that 
does not risk national security the current relationship between 
the military and the press is workable and i support it but that 
safety of the troops and the success of the mission must be 
paramount and i will risk neither

freedom of information for the past eight years the 
reaganbush administration has waged an assault on the freedom of 
information act foia with every weapon in its arsenal executive 
orders budget cuts fee guidelines and legislative proposals 
their objective is clear to gut a statute whose fundamental 
premise is that american citizens have the right to know about the 
activities of their own government 
the current administration claims that complying with the foia 
is too timeconsuming too expensive and too bothersome these are 
excuses for government secrecy and they could serve as a cloak for 
incompetence mismanagement illegality or corruption 
as president i will implement the foia in the spirit which 
congress intended from vietnam to watergate to irancontra we 
americans have learned what happens when government operates in 
secrecy accountable to no one a dukakis administration will treat 
requesters of information as clients not as burdens for only in 
an atmosphere of the fullest possible disclosure can the american 
people retain confidence in their government 
relations with the press throughout my public career ive 
believed in a free press and my record shows ive practiced that 
belief as governor for nearly 10 years i have been accessible to 
state house reporters several times a week i enjoy the spirited 
give and take of news conferences and the vigorous exchange of an 
interview more important i understand and appreciate the role of 
the news media in a free society as laid out two centuries ago in 
the bill of rights to the constitution 
as president i would hope to continue this pattern of 
accessibility to the white house press corps giving them and me 
the opportunity to utilize our first amendment freedoms

the dispute between iran and iraq over 
sovereignty of the palmfringed shattalarab waterway which 
threatens to snarl their peace talks in geneva dates back more 
than 400 years 
although irans islamic revolution was the catalyst for the 
8yearold persian gulf war the battle for control of the 
125milelong waterway was also one of the major causes 
over the last four centuries the waterway has figured in at 
least 25 wars 
the shatt the traditional southern boundary between the two 
ancient antagonists is also the historical racial and religious 
divide between the arabs in the west and the persians in the east 
they even call it by different names to the arabs its the 
shattalarab or river of the arabs the name used on most maps 
to the iranians its the arvand rud or river 
iraq claims a 1975 agreement that put the border down the middle 
of the waterway is null and void iran which gained most from the 
treaty insists it is still valid 
apart from its political significance the waterway formed by 
the confluence of the euphrates and tigris rivers is also 
economically important to both countries particularly iraq 
the shatt is iraqs only outlet to the gulf west of the shatts 
estuary it only has 10 miles of coastline 
its major port of basra heavily damaged during the war and 
closed since the start of the conflict depends for its existence 
on the shatt 
iran has a 1400mile coastline running all the way down the 
gulf to the arabian sea but it needs the shatt for its oil export 
route from abadan 
its big port of khorammshahr north of abadan also lies on the 
waterway as does the iranian naval base at khosrowabad the kharg 
island oil terminal through which 90 percent of irans oil exports 
passes lies only 30 miles south of the shatt estuary 
the economic importance of the waterway for tehran diminished 
during the war when the iranians boosted trade and oil exports 
through other gulf ports and installations 
the sovereignty dispute has spawned at least 20 often ambigious 
treaties since 1847 that did little to settle it 
lord palmerston britains prime minister from 1855 to 1865 
considered the problem was so complex that only the superpowers of 
the day britain and russia could solve it by arbitrarily imposing 
a settlement 
the earliest specific boundary agreement to have a historical 
validity was the treaty of erzerum signed in 1847 which gave 
control of the shatt to the ottomans 
the british and russians helped arrange another border pact in 
constantinople in 1913 which upheld the principle of freedom of 
navigation by all nations but drew the boundary down the eastern 
iranian bank 
iraq which emerged from the breakup of the ottoman empire in 
1918 based its subsequent claims of sovereignty on that 1913 
accord 
the iranians moving into the modern age under shah reza 
pahlavi flexed their muscles by disputing the status quo they 
rejected the 1847 treaty and demanded that the boundary lay down 
the middle of the waterway 
a 1937 treaty confirmed iraqi sovereignty although the iranians 
got some territorial concessions the treaty rankled them for the 
next three decades 
in 1960 the iranians appointed their own river pilots iraq 
retaliated by forcing the closure of abadan by then a vital oil 
outlet 
but in 1969 as the shah built up irans navy in his drive to 
make iran the dominant power in the gulf he abrogated the 1937 
treaty and sent his gunboats into the waterway 
he also backed kurdish separatists in northern iraq in their war 
against baghdad for an autonomous homeland 
the rebellion seriously weakened the iraqi government and in 
march 1975 thenvice president saddam hussein was forced to sign 
the algiers treaty in 1975 with the shah 
iraq conceded the border ran down the deepwater channel in the 
middle of the shatt in return iran cut off aid to the kurds 
saddam considered the loss of iraqi sovereignty over the shatt a 
humiliation on sept 17 1980 amid border skirmishes with the new 
fundamentalist regime in tehran saddam by then iraqs president 
ripped up the treaty five days later he invaded iran

protesters stoned the motorcade of 
president augusto pinochet sunday during a campaign tour on the 
15th anniversary of the military coup he led that ousted the 
government of marxist president salvador allende 
in the coastal resort of vina del mar thousands of leftists 
battled riot police following a memorial service at the grave of 
allende who perished in the coup 
witnesses said at four protesters suffered bullet wounds when 
pinochets bodyguards opened fire after the presidents motorcade 
was stoned in cerro navia a workingclass suburb north of santiato 
police did not report any injuries or arrests in cerro navia but 
said 142 people were arrested in vina del mar when militants tried 
to march from the cemetery into the city center 
pinochet the only candidate in next months presidential 
referendum was booed by hundreds of people when he arrived in 
cerro navia 
many hurled rocks at his motorcade according to radio 
cooperativa the broadcast said pinochets bodyguards fired shots 
into the air and vehicles in the motorcade drove around barricades 
of burning tires 
radio cooperativa said no one was seriously hurt but some people 
were hit by rocks and had minor injuries 
reporters at the scene said four people were struck by bullets 
and two manuel romero and orieta valvez were in serious condition 
with stomach wounds 
earlier sunday in a speech marking the sept 111973 overthrow 
of allende pinochet addressed an audience of 3000 people in a 
government office building among those present were pinochets 
fellow armed forces commanders and the 16member cabinet 
we will triumph in the upcoming challenge the 72yearold 
president said 
outside thousands of supporters rallied noisily on the street 
they waved red white and blue chilean flags and banners promoting 
a yes vote in the referendum 
an estimated 5000 people attended the memorial service for 
allende in vina del mar 75 northwest of santiago 
after the service thousands of leftists began a march from the 
suburban cemetery to the downtown area and were blocked by helmeted 
riot police fighting broke out about five blocks from the cemetery 
and police used tear gas clubs and water cannon to disperse the 
demonstrators but running street battles continued for nearly three 
hours 
reporters said several people were arrested and some 
demonstrators were injured but no figures were given by police 
in his speech pinochet indicated the estimated 300 foreign 
observers expected to observe the presidential plebiscite might get 
a cool reception we forcefully repudiate those foreigners who 
try to intervene in our internal affairs he said 
in the plebiscite we will give the world a new lesson in 
democracy he said 
pinochet in military uniform with the presidential sash across 
his chest spoke in his yearly stateofthenation address on the 
anniversary of the coup 
i am ready to give the last breath of life to my country he 
said 
if the voters approve the referendum pinochet will remain as 
president until 1997 
pinochet boasted of social and economic achievements by his 
administration but added despite the spectacular advances 
achieved theres much left to do 
in a bid for votes pinochet announced special bonuses for 
public employees and retirees no details were given 
the retirees party an association of pensioners opposed to 
pinochet called the bonus offer a scheme for votes 
you cant buy consciences with money said the partys 
president juan torres 
shortly before the president arrived at the government building 
for his speech police bomb experts were summoned to deactivate a 
device from a car authorities said contained 155 pounds of 
explosives the car was parked across the street from the main 
entrance to the building 
an anonymous caller told a foreign news agency by telephone the 
car contained explosives he did not identify himself as belonging 
to any particular group 
a police communique said the explosion would have caused 
numerous deaths and injuries among the multitude awaiting the 
presidents arrival 
in the oct 5 vote chileans will decide if pinochet will 
receive an eightyear term in march if a majority rejects the 
proposal open elections will be held in one year and pinochet will 
hand power over to the winner in 1990 
win or lose congressional elections will be held in 1990 for 
the first time since the legislature was disbanded aftert the coup 
but congress will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980 
constitution that gives the military autonomy and a powerful 
supervisory role in national affairs 
in his 55minute speech pinochet said his new government would 
be democratic while providing safeguards against international 
marxism which he said had subjected the country to a constant 
and indiscriminate agression 
the government has said it will not recognize foreigners who 
come to observe the vote a group of excongressmen opposed to 
pinochet has said it expects at least 300 foreigners many of them 
officials in their countries to come as observers

senate supporters of the textile and apparel 
industries are going into this week determined to break their 
opponents grip on import restraint legislation and send the bill 
to the house once and for all 
business is business sen ernest f hollings dsc 
declared friday as the senate approved the bill 5732 business 
is not fair its no use crying and moaning about fairness weve 
got to do something 
the bill designed to limit foreign competition to selected us 
industries would freeze this years textile and apparel imports at 
1987 levels and limit growth to 1 percent annually from then on 
imports of nonrubber footwear would be capped at 1987 levels 
with no increases in market share for foreign manufacturers allowed 
supporters say it would save american jobs while critics counter 
that it would raise prices narrow consumer choices and throw a 
wrench into the gears of international trade 
the house also plans action this week on the drug issue 
including debate on proposals to fine users 10000 and prod states 
to cancel their drivers licenses the senate meanwhile must 
decide what to do with a 140 billion social programs spending bill 
that has become snarled in the abortion issue 
the reagan administration is vowing an allout effort to block 
the textile bill even if it means an electioneve battle to 
sustain a presidential veto 
opponents of the bill managed to keep it bottled up in the 
senate over the weekend even though it already has won approval 
a second vote is needed to send the measure to the house which 
already has passed a similar bill and must now vote upon senate 
changes in the legislation 
the opponents threatened to filibuster the second vote and it 
appeared that the senate would not be able to wash its hands of the 
bill until tuesday or even later but there is no question that 
supporters will eventually get the bill to the house and this 
weeks dispute mainly represents a mopping up action 
the drug bill before the house would add another 2 billion on 
top of the 39 billion now being spent annually by the federal 
government on antidrug efforts in addition to debating whether to 
penalize drug users the house will try to decide whether to keep 
in the bill a sevenday waiting period for handgun purchasers 
an amendment being offered by rep bill mccollum rfla would 
drop the waiting period in favor of a voluntary system under which 
dealers could check by phone or other means on whether a wouldbe 
gun buyer had ever been convicted of a felony 
the drug bill appears headed for a vote thursday or friday 
those favoring a harsh crackdown succeeded last week in 
attaching provisions calling for a federal death penalty no 
government benefits for twiceconvicted users and court use of 
evidence seized illegally if police obtained it while acting in 
good faith 
this week rep mickey edwards rokla will propose civil 
penalties of up to 10000 per violation against those possessing 
even small personal use amounts of marijuana cocaine and 
other drugs 
rep glenn m anderson dcalif is pushing a proposal to 
provide up to 125 million over three years to states that order 
drivers license suspensions or revocations for convicted drug 
users mccollum has a variant that would dock states some of their 
federal highway money unless they adopted the penalty 
senators passed the social spending bill with an expansion of 
the medicaid program to cover abortions for rape and incest 
victims but the house on friday refused to accept that provision 
in the labor education and health and human services spending 
bill 
the house this week also is expected to pass an insider trading 
bill that for the first time would clear the way for fining 
securities firms for violations committed by their employees 
maximum jail terms for insider trading would be increased from 
five to 10 years and maximum criminal fines would go from 50000 
to 25 million per violation for companies and from 100000 to 
1 million for individuals 
the senate foreign relations committee plans a vote wednesday on 
a bill that would impose harsh sanctions on south africa 
similar to a housepassed bill it would end virtually all us 
investment in south africa and trade with that country because of 
its apartheid policy of racial segregation but prospects for the 
measure on the senate floor appear dim with only a few weeks 
remaining before adjournment

colleges and universities are losing interest 
in literature language and history but americans are showing a 
remarkable blossoming of interest in cultural events spending 
more money on them than on sports events a government report says 
the report by lynne v cheney chairwoman of the national 
endowment for the humanities says the high cost of education may 
be causing more students to avoid liberal arts subjects in favor of 
courses that will give them a moneymaking career 
while the number of bachelors degrees awarded increased 88 
percent in the past two decades degrees in the humanities dropped 
33 percent said her report released sunday foreign language 
majors were down 29 percent english majors 33 percent philosophy 
majors 35 percent and history majors 43 percent it said 
the 73page report ordered by congress says too many colleges 
are neglecting the achievements of western culture while requiring 
ethnic courses treating literary masterpieces as political 
documents stressing publishing rather than teaching and dealing 
in topics so specialized that they have little meaning outside the 
academic world 
the report says museums libraries educational tv stations 
state humanities councils and private historical societies provide 
so much education that they have become a kind of parallel 
school reaching millions of people outside college campuses 
the remarkable blossoming of the humanities in the public 
sphere is one of the least noted though most important cultural 
developments of the last few decades writes mrs cheney 
the 140 million endowment she has headed since may 1986 
provides grants to scholars colleges museums libraries and other 
institutions to promote the humanities 
citing a variety of sources the report gives several examples 
of increased public interest in the humanities including record 
high book sales a doubling of the number of historical 
organizations in 20 years to nearly 10000 and a 660 percent 
increase in visitors to the national gallery of art in washington 
since 1957 
americans who spent twice as much on sports events as on 
cultural endeavors 20 years ago are now spending more on culture 
34 billion compared with 31 billion for sports in 1986 said a 
news release accompanying the report it gave no details on how the 
figures were obtained or what cultural events were included 
the report says that while some have argued that television is 
the enemy of books people are actually both watching television 
and reading with book sales up 400 percent since television was 
rare 40 years ago 
mrs cheney credits television with increasing the sale of some 
books which have been the basis for popular dramas or subjects of 
discussion on educational television shows 
in assessing the academic approach to the humanities the report 
says viewing humanities texts as though they were primarily 
political documents is the most noticeable trend in academic study 
of the humanities today truth and beauty and excellence are 
regarded as irrelevant questions of intellectual aesthetic 
quality dismissed 
the report says western tradition is rich and creative but many 
colleges are abandoning courses that teach it 
the report says a course in great western literature is under 
attack at columbia university in new york while mount holyoke 
college in massachusetts and the university of wisconsin at madison 
require ethnic or third world courses but have no western 
civilization requirements 
the humanities are about more than politics about more than 
social power the report says what gives them their abiding 
worth are truths that pass beyond time and circumstance truths 
that transcending accidents of class race and gender speak to 
us all 
the report humanities in america resulted from several 
meetings of advisory panels and regional groups formed by the 
endowment it follows a 1986 report american memory which 
detailed how little high school students know about western 
history literature and culture

when it comes to abortion george bush and 
michael dukakis agree on one thing each man says he personally 
does not favor the controversial procedure 
but beyond their personal feelings the republican and 
democratic presidential nominees have staked out opposite stands on 
whether abortion should be legal and whether the government should 
pay for the operation for poor women 
bush favors a constitutional amendment to overturn the 1973 
supreme court decision roe vs wade that legalized abortion he 
favors outlawing all abortions except in cases of rape incest or 
to save the life of the mother he opposes medicaid funding of 
abortions for poor women except to save the womans life 
dukakis as a legislator and governor of massachusetts has been 
a resolute supporter of womens legal right to choose abortion as 
well as governmentfunding of the operation for the poor 
antiabortion pickets are a common sight at rallies for dukakis 
and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas just as they 
hounded the democrats ticket of walter mondale and geraldine 
ferraro in 1984 
prior to becoming ronald reagans running mate in 1980 bush 
opposed a constitutional amendment to overturn legalized abortion 
he once supported federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or 
incest as well as to save the mothers life 
asked in 1984 why he changed his position bush replied there 
has been i have to make a confession an evolution in my 
position theres been 15 million abortions since 1973 and i dont 
take that lightly 
while bush has altered his stand on the issue others in the 
republican party remain prochoice including the vice presidents 
campaign cochairman rep lynn martin rill recently bush said 
his opposition to abortion is not a stand that he expects everyone 
in his party has to share 
questioned about martins position during a campaign stop in 
illinois on friday bush said i have a lot of key supporters who 
agree with lynn and a lot that agree with me he added whos 
going to have a litmus test that everybody has to agree with 
everybody on every single issue 
asked about the hardline stand against abortion in the 
republican platform bush said the platform states the position 
of the platform but nobody in our party takes a litmus test that 
says that everybody has to agree on every issue i expect the 
democrats could say the same thing 
dukakis has been called a proabortion zealot by dr jc 
willke president of the national right to life committee the 
groups legislative director douglas johnson said dukakis says 
hes personally opposed but he wants to subsidize it on demand 
he pointed to dukakis sponsoring of a bill in 1970 to legalize 
abortion in massachusetts and later as governor his vetoes of 
several bills with restrictions on abortion funding 
facing a strident antiabortion protest in a chicago suburb 
tuesday dukakis said while i dont favor abortion or think its 
a good thing i happen to think that in the last analysis its up 
to the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious 
beliefs to make that decision 
we should not brand women as criminals for making that 
decision i think thats what most americans believe and its 
certainly what the supreme court has held said dukakis 
bush in his acceptance speech at the republican national 
convention in new orleans aug 18 said is it right to believe 
in the sanctity of life and protect the lives of innocent children 
my opponent says no but i say yes weve got to change from 
abortion to adoption 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said there is a stark stark difference 
between the two candidates and between the two parties platforms 
on abortion 
the democrats terse platform without mentioning the word 
abortion says the right of reproductive choice should be 
guaranteed regardless of ability to pay 
the gop platform contains antiabortion language in several 
sections including a plank that declares the unborn child has a 
fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed 
it endorses both a human life amendment and legislation to extend 
the 14th amendments protections to the unborn 
bentsen has said he too personally opposes abortion and does 
not favor federal funding except in cases of rape incest or to 
save the mothers life but the national right to life committee 
and the national abortion rights action league both agree that 
bentsen has usually voted against restrictions on abortion funding 
and against constitutional amendments to ban abortion 
bentsen was absent july 27 when the senate voted 7319 to allow 
medicaid funding of abortions in promptly reported cases of rape or 
incest 
the house on a 216166 vote friday refused to go along with 
the senate move which would be the first liberalization of 
medicaid abortion funding in seven years the senate may take up 
the issue early this week 
bushs running mate sen dan quayle of indiana voted with that 
senate majority july 27 but naral says he was among many 
antichoice senators who voted for the amendment only as an 
alternative to accepting even fewer restrictions on medicaid 
funding 
quayle is rated highly by the antiabortion groups and lowly by 
naral quayle says he generally opposes abortion except to save the 
mothers life 
activists on both sides agree the next president is likely to 
make several appointments to the supreme court that could sway the 
tribunals ruling on abortion 
the current court has four justices who generally support the 
1973 roe vs wade decision four who have been critical of it and 
one the newest member anthony kennedy whose views are not yet 
clear 
my biggest concern is the next presidents role in appointing 
at least three supreme court justices if not more said 
michelman whose organization helped defeat president reagans 
nomination of robert bork to the supreme court bork had criticized 
roe vs wade 
johnson said on inauguration day next january therell be 
three proabortion justices over 80 years of age 
a human life amendment is a long ways down the road he 
said but if the democrats capture the white house dukakis could 
appoint a proabortion majority for years to come

a preliminary review by the agriculture 
department of this summers barge traffic on droughtreduced rivers 
shows some of the huge problems that have plagued the movement of 
grain from inland farm points into export shipping channels 
in midjune low water levels on the lower mississippi and ohio 
rivers began to stall barges at choke points for more than a day 
by the end of the month stoppages were a regular occurrence 
reduced load size smaller tows and lengthened transit times 
have dropped the capacity of the mississippi river system by at 
least 50 percent the report said difficult navigation and 
increased travel time add to costs especially for fuel and labor 
which normally account for about 35 percent of total operating 
costs 
overall according to a recent industry study barge operators 
could lose as much as 200 million this year 
the smaller river flow forced gyrations in barge rates the 
report said even before the droughts full effect rates were 
going higher because of greater demand in the first five months 
they averaged nearly a fourth more than in the same januarymay 
period of 1987 
in the first two weeks of june barge rates jumped 4 percent 
from the end of may by the end of june rates had nearly tripled 
this increase was shortlived the report said in the 
first week of july rates fell to about 125 percent above the end 
of may and by months end had returned to predrought levels 
by the first week of august rates from peoria ill to export 
points at new orleans la averaged 685 per ton up 12 percent 
from a year earlier 
the decline in rates after the first week of july resulted 
from a sharp reduction in demand for barge service the report 
said as export volume shrank and producers held stocks in 
anticipation of higher prices shipments of grain and soybeans in 
june fell 16 percent from may and in july dropped 37 percent from 
may 
according to the new outlook report by the departments economic 
research service the higher transportation costs and reduced 
capacity sharply boosted prices of corn delivered by barge to 
louisianas gulf ports 
between june 17 and june 23 corn prices rose from 331 to 
332 per bushel to a range of 363 to 366 per bushel the 
report said 
these ports account for about 50 percent of us grain exports 
and receive 70 percent of the grain chiefly corn by barge the 
report said similar price increases are anticipated in the 
poultry producing areas of the southeast barges normally carry 
about a third of the grain shipped to these states 
trucks are not an alternative to barges for moving grain the 
report said a fully loaded barge holds 1500 tons of grain or 
about 35 truck loads a milelong truck convoy bumpertobumper 
would replace fewer than 2 barges 
one day 1760 barges were stacked above greenville miss 
287 miles from new orleans the report said grain in these 
barges would have filled a line of trucks 755 miles long

a forecast by the agriculture department that 
the cash receipts of farmers are likely to increase this year 
despite huge production losses due to drought has put economists to 
work explaining why 
cash receipts or the gross from sales of crops and livestock 
are expected to rise 5 billion to 9 billion this year from 1987 
says the departments economic research service in 1980 another 
drought year farm cash receipts climbed nearly 8 billion 
since droughts have an impact on production why dont cash 
receipts decline 
one reason is that the prices of droughtaffected commodities 
tend to increase more than production falls raising the total 
value of the crop the agency says in a new outlook report 
another reason is that marketing does not drop as much as 
production because stocks inventories are sold to make up the 
harvest shortfall 
the economists say the demand for farm commodities is inelastic 
meaning that a 1 percent decline in production for example leads 
to a price increase greater than 1 percent 
some farmers may benefit from the higher prices those in 
areas with adequate rainfall those who irrigate and those with 
large unsold stocks of previous years crops the report said 
however higher cash receipts nationally do not imply that all 
farmers are better off because of the drought 
the report added many farmers will suffer large declines in 
cash receipts if their individual production falls by much more 
than prices rise farmers in droughtstricken areas without large 
stocks of unsold crops from previous years have little to fall back 
on

honey bees are famous for pollinating crops 
but an agriculture department scientist says the bees dont work 
hard enough when it comes to hybrid cotton plants 
gerald m loper a plant physiologist at the carl hayden bee 
research center tucson ariz said theres something about cotton 
pollen that bees dont like 
they will spend 20 minutes meticulously combing the pollen off 
their bodies before returning to their hives he said and thats 
time lost from their job of pollinating cotton plants 
bees are needed to pollinate hybrid strains of cotton by 
carrying pollen from male to female plants which produce the 
hybrid seed regular cotton does its own pollinating without the 
help of bees 
the hybrid strains have a potential for boosting cotton yields 
by as much as 25 percent and producing long fiber for specialty 
markets loper said in a recent report if only the bees would work 
harder 
india and mexico grow hybrid cotton but rely on hand labor for 
pollination to produce seeds labor costs and import restrictions 
on foreign cotton seed have put pressure on the honey bee to do the 
job in the united states loper said

a drug enforcement administration official 
created a stir last week with a formal recommendation to his agency 
chief that marijuana be made legal for limited medical uses but 
any changes are still years away 
the opinion by administrative law judge francis l young 
amounted to a ringing endorsement of certain benefits from smoking 
pot mainly to help cancer patients tolerate highly toxic 
chemotherapy 
moreover he concluded that federal law gives officials no 
choice but to change the way they classify the ancient weed to do 
otherwise he wrote would be to act in an unreasonable 
arbitrary and capricious manner 
that is the legal jargon for the criterion courts use to decide 
whether administrators are acting within the laws they administer 
or are imposing their own desires 
at the same time however youngs decision took tacit note of 
political realities that left even those strongly favoring his 
position doubtful that changes are likely for several years 
laurence o mckinney president of a small company called 
cannabis corp of america in cambridge mass and a petitioner in 
the case was jubilant with the decision because he believes there 
will be an eventual financial bonanza for his company 
the key word is eventual 
mckinney said in a telephone interview that he is not optimistic 
the dea administrator will accept the law judges finding and 
predicted it will take at least two years before he and other 
petitioners can get federal courts to order the finding implemented 
then he acknowledged the matter would have to go to the food 
and drug administration a process he said probably would take at 
least two more years 
there would be a certain irony in the fda being instructed by 
courts to deal with marijuana 
young noted in his opinion that the agency is looking at a 
synthetically formed new drug when it operates under the federal 
food drug and cosmetic act that gives it regulatory authority 
the marijuana plant is anything but a new drug young wrote 
uncontroverted evidence in this record indicates that marijuana 
was being used therapeutically by mankind 2000 years before the 
birth of christ 
to say it would be a voyage in uncharted regulatory waters for 
the fda to regulate marijuana would be an understatement the 
question is not before the agency now and efforts to get three 
separate and normally helpful fda officials to discuss the issue 
even informally were unsuccessful 
young noted in his decision that the question is politically 
touchy 
the judge realizes that strong emotions are aroused on both 
sides of any discussion concerning the use of marijuana young 
wrote nonetheless it is essential for this agency and its 
administrator calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of 
record correctly apply the law and act accordingly 
he continued there are those who in all sincerity argue 
that the transfer of marijuana to schedule ii will send a signal 
that marijuana is ok generally for recreational use this 
argument is specious it presents no valid reason for refraining 
from taking an action required by law in light of the evidence 
and the evidence he said clearly shows that smoking marijuana 
helps many cancer patients tolerate their treatment 
his recommendation is that marijuana be moved from schedule i 
strictly illegal except in research to schedule ii whereby it 
could be prescribed by physicians but only under the same tightly 
controlled conditions that apply to such drugs as morphine and 
cocaine 
his 69page opinion summing up a 15volume record is replete 
with testimony from physicians patients and relatives that 
marijuana counters the nausea and vomiting that can be so severe in 
some patients it causes them to abandon potentially livesaving 
treatment 
young concluded that marijuana cigarettes are superior in many 
cases to synthetic capsules containing the active chemical present 
in the plant attempting to orally administer the synthetic thc 
capsule to a vomiting patient presents obvious problems he said 
it is vomited right back up before it can have any effect 
having concluded that the marijuana plant meets the first 
criterion of having a legitimate medical use young went on to 
address safety issues 
in strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods 
we commonly consume he said for example eating 10 raw 
potatoes can result in a toxic response by comparison it is 
physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death

the latest allegations of wrongdoing on wall 
street are boosting efforts in the house to toughen penalties for 
insider trading but the senates desire to see an unrelated 
banking law enacted could derail the effort 
the house is scheduled to begin debate tuesday and vote 
wednesday on an insider trading bill sponsored by reps edward j 
markey dmass and john d dingell dmich it would double the 
maximum jail term for criminal convictions on insider trading 
charges and increase fines fivefold for firms and tenfold for 
individuals 
markey at a meeting friday of his energy and commerce 
subcommittee on finance predicted that the filing of government 
charges earlier in the week against drexel burnham lambert inc 
would prod congress to quick action 
drexel and the chief of its junk bond unit michael milken are 
named by the securities and exchange commission in a wideranging 
civil complaint alleging insider trading fraud and other 
violations 
these allegations should propel insider trading reforms 
into law by the end of this year markey said we will not 
permit the rich and greedy to treat our nations financial markets 
as little toys to be played with and manipulated for private 
amusement and profiteering 
the legislation passed the energy and commerce committee a month 
ago many in the senate also favor it but the bill faces an 
uncertain future there 
senate banking committee chairman william proxmire dwis in a 
telephone interview friday raised the possibility of linking 
senate passage of the insider trading legislation to house action 
on a senatepassed bill giving banks new powers to underwrite 
securities 
proxmire said he is conferring with other senators on his 
committee and has made no decision about linkage but added we 
want to hold all our options open 
the banking bill which passed the senate on a 942 vote more 
than five months ago would be the most comprehensive restructuring 
of the financial system since the depressionera glasssteagall act 
barred banks from most securities business 
a bill much less favorable to banks than the senate measure 
passed the house banking committee earlier this summer on a 3120 
vote and must go through dingells committee before it gets to the 
house floor 
dingell in an interview broadcast sunday by abc news business 
world predicted insider trading legislation would pass congress 
this year but said of the banking bill thats going to take 
longer if i have any say 
however proxmire argues that linking the banking bill to the 
insider trading measure would enhance the chances of both passing 
before congress adjourns early next month 
i think they should help each other he said theres no 
reason why a banking bill with strong support in the senate and 
in the house banking committee will not bring strong support to 
insider trading legislation 
the house insider trading bill would 
increase the maximum jail term for criminal insider trading 
from five years to 10 years 
boost the maximum criminal fine from 500000 for firms and 
100000 for individuals to 25 million for firms and 1 million 
for individuals 
make it possible for securities firms to be fined for 
violations by their employees in cases where the firm knew or 
recklessly disregarded the facts 
authorize the sec to pay a bounty to whistleblowers who give 
information to authorities 
give investors who lost money by trading in the same securities 
as insider traders the right to sue inside traders for damages 
grant new powers to the sec to cooperate with foreign countries 
investigating insider trading cases that involve us citizens the 
idea is to encourage other nations to grant similar reciprocal aid 
to the sec 
late in july the senate banking committee passed much narrower 
insider trading legislation including only the provisions on 
international cooperation 
last september as part of a corporate takeover bill that failed 
to get through the full senate the banking committee approved 
increased fines and jail terms for insider trading

to george bush the current occupant of the 
white house is blessed with a great sense of humor if you like 
jokes and stuff whats more hes not scary

president reagan during an impromptu lunch with two fifth graders 
he plucked at random from a crowd at a downtown rally in pekin ill

president to dine with him at the red hen restaurant he ordered a 
chicken sandwich for himself and hot dogs for his two young lunch

brent said he hoped to watch the games on television bush said 
he had just been to a sendoff in disneyland for us olympic 
athletes headed for seoul korea an event he said he enjoyed 
immensely 
bush asked if either one lived on a farm 
john said he did one with horses and cows and that in fact his 
mother had just gotten a bad bruise in a riding accident on a 
really crazy horse 
she was very lucky the horse didnt fall on top of her bush 
observed recalling the rodeo accident that claimed the life of 
commerce secretary malcolm baldrige in 1987 
brent then got his question in whats the president like 
hes a good guy hes got a sense of humor if you like jokes 
and stuff hes very very nice not scary a guy you can talk 
to bush said 
some guys you can relax with and some you cant he added 
but the two fifth graders themselves were anything but relaxed 
not only were they eating lunch with the vice president in front of 
an imposing troop of photographers and reporters but so much time 
had elapsed that they feared being stranded they had come to town 
on a school field trip 
how will you get back bush himself wondered i dont 
know john responded glumly 
somebody ought to tell them the teachers that theyre 
here bush told an aide 
the veep assured the two boys hed make sure they got home

another meal another place 
it was los angeles the end of a day that began with a campaign 
appearance at a fish packing plant in san diego and the vice 
president was in a romantic mood as he dined alone with barbara 
his wife of 43 years 
i looked over at her and said bar you mean a lot to me 
to which the vice president playfully told reporters traveling 
with him on air force two mrs bush responded may i tell you 
something 
i said anything she said fish spilled on your red tie 
look sweetie 43 years im talking emotion bush quoted 
himself were talking family values here bush continued 
there was an understanding between us at that very moment that 
transcended the skeptical look on the waiters face it was a 
special moment there 
once in a while you luck into something like that on the 
campaign trail

when bush presided over the sendoff of us olympic athletes at 
disneyland his staff took pains to make sure that the vice 
president was not standing directly alongside goofy mickey mouse 
or other wellrecognizable disney characters 
they didnt want the inevitable photo of such a pairing to fall 
into the wrong hands 
when reporters observed to bush that he appeared to be keeping 
his distance from mickey mouse the vice president responded i 
was only one down from the damn guy 
however bush said that he was rattled by one of the three 
little pigs he just kept staring at me with this expression 
bush said making a funny face 
my word of honor i looked over there and said its not the 
mouse thats bothering me and he the pig kept he kepthis

what may have been the worst natural disaster ever to strike the 
nations northeast swept in unexpectedly a halfcentury ago this 
month a great hurricane that claimed as many as 700 lives by some 
accounts 
born a few days earlier in a tropical depression the great 
storm roared out of the atlantic on sept 21 1938 crossed long 
island leaving a swath of disaster and crashed north into new 
england 
the storm gave no warning blasting a region where such weather 
furies are rare and usually fairly weak by the time they arrive 
coming before the era of satellite observations and rapid 
electronic communications there was none of the advance notice so 
common today 
it was the worst natural disaster ever to strike the 
northeastern united states says weather historian david m 
ludlum in the magazine weatherwise 
the storm snuffed out the lives of some 700 unsuspecting 
people and injured thousands more it destroyed or badly damaged 
20000 homes summer cottages and farm buildings as well as 26000 
cars and nearly 6000 boats ludlum says 
historians knew of a major new england hurricane in 1815 but 
since then the giant tropical storms had generally only brushed 
that part of the nation concentrating their fury on the south 
so neither meteorologists nor residents of the region were 
prepared for the speed direction and intensity of the 1938 storm 
those of us who were in the 1938 hurricane remember how it 
took us by surprise like the bombing of pearl harbor it was 
totally unexpected reported howard e smith jr in his book 
killer weather 
like many tropical storms this hurricane meandered near florida 
for several days before curving to the north arriving off cape 
hatteras nc about 830 am on sept 21 
suddenly it set out on a speedy trip up the coast 
to the north it was a warm autumn day with no danger in the 
forecast 
the weather bureau in washington issued a storm warning for the 
northeast at 10 am but by then the hurricane was already surging 
northward 
broadcast warnings were delayed in some areas because many radio 
stations were carrying a live speech by german dictator adolf 
hitler at the time 
by 330 pm the whole force of the hurricane smashed against 
long island new york the empire state building was lost to sight 
as swirling silversheeted clouds driven by 120 mile per hour 
winds engulfed and swayed it to and fro reported jay robert nash 
in the book darkest hours 
wind gusts would be recorded at 186 miles per hour before the 
storm was over along the island beach houses of the rich and 
famous collapsed and were swept away 
after blasting clear large expanses of long island the storm 
surged across the narrow sound into connecticut then headed north 
to batter hartford springfield and even blast portions of vermont 
and upstate new york disastrous flooding was reported in central 
connecticut and massachusetts 
the worst damage was reported along the coasts though with 
stormwhipped waves estimated at 20 to 30 feet in height the 
waters of narragansett bay were driven into providence bringing 
normal life to a halt 
coming at a time of already high tide the storm wiped out small 
beach resorts in connecticut and rhode island 
what i saw that day will stay in my mind forever whenever 
before i had looked at the horizon it had been a straight line 
not that day gigantic waves moved along the horizon like the teeth 
of some titanic chain saw wrote smith who viewed the storm as a 
youth in rockport mass 
along the storm track whole groves of trees were mowed down by 
the wind an estimated 275 million trees being destroyed according 
to ludlum heavy rains swept the land and power lines were down 
nearly everywhere 
by nightfall on this day of the autumn equinox eastern long 
island and practically all of new england with the exception of 
maine lay stunned from the hurricanes blow ludlum wrote 
his estimate of 700 killed and 1500 to 2000 seriously injured 
helps illustrate the confusion generated by the storm for nash 
reports the fatalities at 494 plus 100 missing and never found 
while smith estimates the dead at 680 
even with the better forecasting that today would give warning 
of the storms approach the potential for disaster remains 
if such a storm should hit today losses could be much 
higher ludlum warns 
there has been a large increase in both summer and yearround 
populations in these areas while property values have risen 
astronomically this is particularly true along the shore and 
should a fullfledged hurricane hit during the vacation season 
when beaches and roads are packed the potential for disaster would 
be appalling

cardinal john oconnor who has been the target 
of protests by homosexuals condemned recent attacks of gays as the 
work of utterly stupid people 
i wish i had language strong enough to condemn this kind of 
cruelty oconnor said at st patricks cathedral before his 
sermon sunday 
anyone who performs such actions in the belief that he or she 
is in some way helping society is utterly stupid said the head 
of the new york archdioces anyone who does such a thing thinking 
it is justified by church teaching about homosexual behavior is 
grossly ignorant of what the church actually teaches 
the cardinal specifically mentioned an aug 22 incident in which 
two men walking on manhattans upper west side were surrounded and 
beaten by a group of teenage boys shouting antihomosexual 
epithets one of the two men was stabbed three times and remains 
hospitalized 
these actions were so brutal that they could have resulted in 
murder oconnor said 
for more than a year a group of gay catholics has picketed 
outside the cathedral once a month to protest what they see as 
discrimination against homosexuals by the roman catholic church 
the leader of one gay rights group thomas b stoddard 
executive director of the lambda legal defense and education fund 
on sunday called oconnors statement an important step 
forward

swarms of mountain pine beetles are cutting a 
deadly swath through the west creating fuel for forest fires as 
they kill huge dense plots of trees from montana to new mexico and 
colorado to california 
the insect about the size of a big pinhead destroys about 2 
million acres of timber a year nationwide 
last year it ravaged 24 million acres with more than half of 
that 14 million acres on the eastern side of the cascade range 
in oregon the year before 34 million acres were wiped out 
by comparison wildfires have consumed nearly 38 million acres 
this year an area larger than connecticut 
basically what weve had is a tidal wave rolling down to the 
south says dave bridgwater an entomologist at the us forest 
services regional office in portland 
the wave has been rolling through an area of lodgepole pine 
on the eastern slope of the cascades in central oregon though it 
prefers lodgepole the beetle also attacks more valuable pine 
species such as ponderosa sugar western white and whitebark 
the result is large parcels of dead trees that amount to a 
tinderbox 
about 4000 acres of dead lodgepole helped fuel a fire that 
consumed more than 11000 acres in the deschutes national forest 
this summer 
beetlekilled forest land also was a factor in the massive 
forest fires in yellowstone national park said tom hofacker an 
entomologist at the forest services national headquarters in 
rosslyn va 
the lodgepole pine forest is regenerated through these 
fires said hofacker in another 80 to 100 years it gets killed 
again by the mountain pine beetle ten to 15 years after that the 
trees start falling down and the stage is set for another fire 
russ mitchell an entomologist in bend uses a chisel designed 
for cracking open human skulls on the autopsy table to dig into the 
bark of lodgepole pines that are as good as dead 
i wish i could talk to these things he said uncovering a 
male beetle burrowing under the bark toward a female 
though the tree still looked green and healthy it will be red 
and dead by next spring overwhelmed by hordes of insects and the 
accompanying fungus that finishes off the trees 
one tree will be selected by what you might call pioneer 
beetles said mitchell the females pick the tree out 
trees weakened by a lack of water emit a gas that the beetles 
can smell bridgwater said the insects also are attracted to the 
biggest trees in the area leaving smaller trees alone 
once the beetle starts boring into bark it puts out a 
pheromone or odor that attracts other beetles 
thousands of beetles bore into the tree enough to overcome the 
trees main line of defense which is to push the beetles out with 
heavy flows of sap 
when the beetle has mated it will begin to put out another 
odor said mitchell it says this place is full 
beetles will move on to another tree within three years they 
can move through an entire stand 
what actually kills the trees is the fungus whose spores ride 
along on the beetles back 
researchers are looking at pheromones as a way of managing the 
beetles mitchell said 
packets of the this place is full pheromone could be tacked 
up to protect trees in campgrounds and seed orchards and packets 
of the come on in pheromone could be placed nearby in a stand 
slated for logging he said 
besides firewood the dead lodgepole is gaining popularity as a 
source of paper pulp because dead chips are lighter than green ones 
i think its pretty sure that by the year 2000 most of the 
lodgepole pine in oregon will be dead whether it is harvested or 
not said ed blaydon a marketing specialist for the four 
national forests in southeastern oregon

evan mechams name is not on the ballot but the 
ousted governors conservative spirit looms over tuesdays primary 
as several of his backers challenge moderate republican legislators 
who voted to impeach or convict him 
the primary one of six around the country tuesday marks 
arizonas first election since the traumatic political upheaval of 
last spring in which the republicancontrolled house voted to 
impeach mecham and the gopcontrolled senate convicted him of 
obstructing justice and misusing funds 
the senate votes removed him from office and automatically 
installed democrat rose mofford the longtime secretary of state 
to serve in his place until 1990 the senate declined to bar mecham 
from ever running for office again 
after his ouster mecham forecast a revolution at the ballot 
box but he hasnt predicted any casualty figures in the current 
primaries and neither has anyone else 
the former governor insists that those who keep talking about 
the mecham factor are trying to divert the attention of the 
voters from the real issue record tax and spending increases 
that were passed after his ouster to bail the state out of a 
deficit 
its lets throw enough mud at mecham and make him the target 
so that we will change the issues from the voting records of the 
incumbents he said 
mecham a perennial political outsider won the governorship on 
his fifth try in 1986 in a threeway race his strengths included a 
getoutthevote campaign that mobilized his many ultraconservative 
supporters and a series of tabloids that attacked his opponents 
in the current election mechams forward arizona political 
action committee has not distributed cash to candidates and has 
handed out only a handful of formal endorsements but it has 
conducted research and training for an unknown number of candidates 
mecham says he will support whoever wins the gop primary but 
many republican lawmakers fear his followers may simply refuse to 
vote for them in november even if they survive the primary in a 
number of swing districts that could hand the seat over to the 
democrats 
it has not been easy to determine the exact number of primaries 
in which loyalty to mecham seems to be a main issue nine gop 
senators and 26 representatives face at least one primary opponent 
but not all of the incumbents voted against mecham and not all of 
the challengers are promecham 
house members run in pairs with voters in each district allowed 
to vote for two candidates 
among those facing primary challengers are the chief legislative 
architects of impeachment republicans like house speaker joe lane 
and house judiciary chairman jim skelly 
lane will appear on the gop ballot along with gerald patton who 
says he would like to serve with lane and two candidates who have 
mechams endorsement lloyd fenn and warren shumaker lane is 
asking his supporters to cast just one vote instead of two and to 
cast that vote for him 
two former mecham aides ron bellus and ted humes are running 
for the legislature humes is unopposed for the gop nod to run 
against democratic senate incumbent lela alston bellus is battling 
moderate leo corbet for the gop nod to succeed retiring republican 
sen tony west an antimechamite 
on friday mecham endorsed challengers dean ellsworth and greg 
roberds over house republicans mark killian and bill mundell in the 
mesa area even though killian voted against impeachment after a 
tearful speech castigating mecham mundell voted for impeachment 
here are highlights of other primaries tuesday 
minnesota both gop sen david durenberger and his likely 
democratic opponent state attorney general hubert h humphrey iii 
face minor opposition from within their parties 
new hampshire republican rep judd gregg is favored to win the 
nomination for governor to succeed john sununu who is retiring 
democrat paul mceachern has no primary opposition 
vermont rep jim jeffords faces conservative michael griffes 
for the gop nomination for the seat of retiring republican sen 
robert stafford william gray is the unopposed democratic nominee 
utah democrats craig s oliver and robert w stringham both 
seek the nomination to oppose threeterm republican rep howard c 
nielson 
wisconsin milwaukee bucks owner herbert kohl and former gov 
anthony earl are among four democrats seeking the nomination for 
the seat of retiring democratic sen william proxmire on the 
republican side state senate minority leader susan engeleiter 
faces stephen b king former chairman of the state gop

president augusto pinochets motorcade 
was stoned during a campaign tour on the 15th anniversary of the 
bloody military coup he led that ousted the elected government of 
president salvador allende 
in the coastal resort of vina del mar on sunday nearly 5000 
protesters battled riot police following the largest ever memorial 
service at the grave of allende who perished in the coup 
reporters said gen pinochets bodyguards opened fire after his 
motorcade was stoned in cerro navia a workingclass suburb north 
of santiago they said at least four protesters suffered bullet 
wounds 
police did not report any injuries or arrests in cerro navia 
but said 142 people were arrested in vina del mar when people tried 
to march from the cemetery into the resorts center 
pinochet the only candidate in next months presidential 
referendum was booed by hundreds of people when he arrived in 
cerro navia 
many hurled rocks at his motorcade and pinochets bodyguards 
fired shots into the air as vehicles maneuvered around barricades 
of burning tires 
reporters at the scene said at least four people were struck by 
bullets and two were hospitalized in serious condition with stomach 
wounds 
on sunday night demonstrations against the military government 
pinochet has led since the coup spread to the northern santiago 
suburbs of lo prado pudahuel quinta normal renca and conchalii 
where protesters raised barricades of burning tires no injuries 
were reported 
earlier in the day in a nationally televised speech marking the 
sept 11 1973 overthrow of allende pinochet addressed an 
audience of 3000 people in a government office building 
i am ready to give my last breath to my country he said 
pinochet said chileans were morally bound to support his sole 
candidacy in an oct 5 presidential referendum that if approved 
would give him eight more years of rule 
the 72yearold army commander said citizens face a choice in 
the yesorno ballot between consolidating the democratic society 
contemplated in the countrys constitution or destroying 15 years 
of patriotic labor for chile 
if a majority vote against his continued rule an open election 
will be held next year and he will hand power over to the winner in 
1990 
whether pinochet wins or loses the vote elections for a 
congress are planned for 1990 but the legislature will be 
virtually powerless to amend an 8yearold constitution that gives 
the armed forces freedom from civilian control and a role in 
national policymaking 
pinochet said his new government would be fully democratic 
all sectors will be present he said 
but he attacked those who do not recognize the political 
system in effect aligning themselves with totalitarian groups a 
coalition of 16 parties from the political centerright to the 
socialist left are campaigning actively for his defeat in the 
referendum 
a leader of the opposition coalition genaro arriagada called 
pinochets speech mediocre 
pinochet must be judged by his merciless exercise of power 
and not by his words he said 
a government press office statement said police found and 
deactivated a time bomb in a car across from the building where 
pinochet spoke 
the statement did not explain how the car and its contents 
avoided earlier discovery by police who had combed the area 
intensively and were seen to be towing away other cars hours 
beforehand 
in vina del mar 75 miles northwest of santiago police used 
tear gas water cannon and nightsticks to break up the nearly 5000 
demonstrators who tried to march through the streets after the 
tribute to allende a marxist 
reporters saw a few demonstrators injured including a young man 
bleeding from the head after being clubbed by two policemen 
authorities did not report any injuries but said 142 people were 
detained 
according to the government allende shot himself in the head 
with a carbine as the presidential palace was in flames and under 
attack by troops allende had declared he would not allow himself 
to be deposed and taken out of the palace alive and the military 
version is accepted by most chileans and historians 
the military government had barred the placing of a tombstone to 
mark allendes grave but on sunday there was a small marble plaque 
from the socialist party 
during the graveside ceremony many mourners wept after hearing 
a recording of allendes last speech to the nation people in the 
crowd chanted we can feel it we can feel it allende is here

portauprince haiti ap police and soldiers made no attempt 
to intercede as thugs with guns knives and machetes attacked 
parishioners at a mass said by an outspoken opponent of haitis 
military rulers 
at least three people were killed in sundays massacre said a 
foreign journalist who escaped and radio reports said 60 were 
wounded some witnesses said as many as a dozen people were killed 
shielded by supporters the rev jeanbertrand aristide escaped 
uninjured 
after the attack gangs of armed men roamed the capitals 
deserted streets stoning two radio stations and the headquarters 
of two political parties opposed to the government of lt gen 
henri namphy 
men fired shots about outside one of the stations roman 
catholicrun radio soleil which went off the air after being 
pelted by rocks 
a catholic priest and a former senate candidate blamed the 
government for the attack which preceded a planned sunday protest 
against namphys voiding of haitis popularly approved constitution 
attacks on civilians by armed thugs accused of support from the 
military are not uncommon in the 2 years since the duvalier family 
dictatorship ended on nov 29 1987 armed thugs and soldiers 
killed at least 34 voters in thwarting independently run nationwide 
elections 
on sunday aristide had just begun 9 am mass when a group of 
men started stoning the church said the foreign journalist who 
was attending 
then men shouting communists communists burst into the 
church slashing and hacking mercilessly at men women and children 
as they fled the church in panic the journalist said 
they started shooting people beating them and stabbing and 
slashing them she told the associated press in a telephone call 
to new york they stabbed a woman who was pregnant they stabbed 
another man who ran outside the church he died some people were 
shot another witness saw a pregnant woman shot in the abdomen 
soldiers at a compound across the street watched the violent 
attack but did not intervene 
asked for official government reaction frantz lubin director 
of information for the military government responded no comment 
before all the facts have been gathered 
some witnesses said about a dozen people were killed but the 
bodies could not be removed before the attackers set the building 
on fire and torched cars parked out front some said they saw the 
assailants remove bodies from the churchyard 
radio stations reported 60 were treated for wounds 
estimates of the number of people in the church ranged from 600 
to 1600 
a witness in the churchs nearby health center said he watched 
as about 300 men fell into formation and marched to the entrance of 
the church compound and stoned the courtyard and the church before 
a gang of them rushed inside 
the witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity 
the crusade for the constitution committee headed by the 
political opposition had urged haitians to dress in white sunday 
to protest namphys voiding of the constitution in july 
the relationship between the crusade and the massacre is 
obvious said the rev antoine adrien a catholic priest there 
is a campaign to bring the country back to the duvalier days to 
reestablish a reign of terror to prevent the people from 
organizing for their welfare 
paul latortue a former senate candidate said he was sure the 
church attack was the work of the government and its supporters 
they have wanted to kill aristide for a long time he said 
in san juan where he teaches economics at the university of puerto 
rico it is significant that the government tried to do this 
today a day of protest 
aristide who in sermons has compared haitis army rulers to 
savages and satan is one of the most popular figures among this 
caribbean nations poor masses and has been the target of several 
assassination attempts 
his modest cementblock st jean bosco church inside a 
compound in the la saline slum is regularly packed with supporters 
aristide has never called for an armed uprising but has 
repeatedly advocated the overthrow of the military government by 
what he calls active nonviolent struggle 
namphy returned to power in a coup june 19 after four months of 
civilian rule under president leslie manigat namphy ruled for two 
years before that as head of a junta after president jeanclaude 
duvalier fled to exile in france on feb 7 1986 
the constitution was approved by more than 99 percent of the 
voters in a march 29 1987 referendum it is considered the most 
liberal in the countrys 184year history and prohibited duvalier 
supporters from running for office for 10 years

the mother of a firstgrader said gesturing toward st pauls an 
elemantary school cited by the us department of education as 
exemplary 
the baptist woman said she is impressed by the structured 
education offered by parochial schools 
because of its educational failure the 32000student public 
school system in this city across the hudson river from new york 
city has been targeted for the first attempt by any state to seize 
control of a major urban school district 
the districts graduation rate is 20 percent 
twentyfive percent of its students pass new jerseys mandatory 
proficiency exam compared with 50 percent of students in other 
urban districts statewide 80 percent of students pass all three 
sections of the test 
state officials say the poor records mostly result from 
political patronage 
state education commissioner saul cooperman began legal action 
in may to take control of the citys schools jersey city officials 
have taken the matter before state administrative law judge kenneth 
springer hearings before springer are expected to last into 
january 
the earliest the state could take control is may 1989 and 
appeals could delay that 
in contrast the citys 27 roman catholic schools have a high 
graduation rate and send at least 75 percent of their graduates to 
fouryear colleges said the rev thomas mcdade the newark 
archdioceses associate vicar for education 
jersey citys catholic schools are educating more noncatholics 
than ever and even turning away applicants mcdade said of the 
districts 11000 students last year 21 percent were 
noncatholics in some schools the percentage was as high as 85 
percent 
theres much more discipline much more structure in the 
catholic schools said brenda hall a lutheran who sent her son 
garrick to his first day of school at st pauls last week 
i wanted him to get a good foundation she said i think 
its pretty much common knowledge about the jersey city public 
school system 
an independent auditors report on the public schools found 
the school climate is not conducive to learning as facilities 
are poorly maintained and discipline is lacking principals are not 
in control of their buildings and students and teachers are often 
not found where they are assigned and not focused on instructional 
purposes 
parents groups have complained of drug use and rampant 
absenteeism 
the catholic school seems to look for results and the public 
school seems to look for excuses said city councilman tom hart 
a critic of the school board 
jersey city public schools are providing the first test of a law 
enacted in january giving new jersey broad powers to take over 
chronically troubled schools 
if the state wins the legal battle it can abolish the local 
board of education fire top administrators and appoint a state 
superintendent to operate the district for five years 
david pikus a lawyer for the city board of education said many 
problems date to a prior administration mayor anthony cucci has 
objected to the takeover saying the new law unfairly targets 
poorer districts that face insurmountable social problems and get 
inadequate state aid 
local school officials say a third of the districts students 
come from singleparent families and that hundreds more live in 
shelters for the homeless many students come from homes in which 
english is not the primary language 
but like the public schools the catholic schools reflect 
jersey citys ethnic diversity mcdade said among those enrolled 
at the parochial schools are hispanic black haitian portuguese 
arab egyptian filipino italian indian chinese and american 
indian students 
the average cost to teach each public school student amounts to 
6300 a year hart said tuition for parochial school students 
averages about 1600 officials said

thad mitchell the youngest pilot to 
fly coast to coast solo says hes ready for another challenge 
we were thinking about maybe crossing the atlantic on my 17th 
birthday mitchell said sunday afternoon shortly after completing 
his flight from san diego to jacksonville 
we were just kidding around mitchell who turned 16 on 
saturday added quickly 
the pensacola teenager landed his singleengine mooney 201 at 
jacksonville international airport less than 24 hours after leaving 
san diego 
i wasnt nervous at all if i got into trouble i could have 
just landed said mitchell who made refueling stops in el paso 
texas and lafayette la 
the trip made him the first pilot of any age to make his first 
solo flight a transcontinental trip according to the national 
aeronautics association which sanctioned the undertaking 
mitchell is two years away from being licensed to fly with 
instruments and must rely on visual flight rules because of that 
he said he cannot fly through clouds 
we flew through some pretty heavy rain in some parts and then 
flew around a lot of clouds he said i had to dodge them that 
was really fun 
flying ahead of mitchell in a twinengine piper were his father 
mark billy hattaway his flight instructor for nearly four years 
and dick bennett of pensacola aviation 
thad said he stayed alert by carefully following his progress on 
maps 
i used to think from here to jacksonville was a pretty long 
flight he said but the trip seemed very short 
younger pilots have flown across the country with instructors 
but federal regulations prohibit solo flights until the age of 16 
mitchell has logged 100 hours of flying time and flew across 
country with another pilot when he was 13

a man ranked the wealthiest 
in the world runs this tiny oilrich moslem kingdom and diplomats 
report little dissent from people unencumbered by income taxes 
medical payments or tuition fees 
king sultan hassanal bolkiah rules the enclave on the 
northeastern tip of borneo from his 1788room palace earlier this 
month fortune magazine called him the richest man in the world 
worth 25 billion 
citizens of this southeast asian nation do not appear to object 
to the kings rule because he spreads some of the money around 
they the people are well looked after with free education 
medical treatment cheap housing good pensions and any one doing 
well in his studies can easily get a university education abroad at 
the governments expense said one diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
he said there are no beggars and about half the workforce is 
employed by the government the per capita income is estimated at 
about 18000 one of the highest in the world according to 
bankers and diplomats 
all the money comes from oil and gas which brunei exports 
mainly to japan 
a brunei government official said recently that 1986 exports 
amounted to 203 billion 99 percent of it oil and gas imports 
for the same year totaled 785 million in cars foodstuffs and 
other goods 
the nation about the size of delaware covers just 2226 square 
miles much of which is not suitable for cultivation an 
agricultural officer said 
without daily newspapers the nations 227000 people get their 
news mainly through staterun radio television brunei and some 
government publications 
an official in the planning unit said malays form the majority 
of bruneis population but there are also about 60000 chinese and 
other nonmalays 
about 87000 people are employed and of these 28000 are foreign 
workers including foreign maids doctors lawyers engineers 
accountants and others 
brunei has no elected parliament and sultan bolkiah rules the 
nation with the help of a cabinet comprising two of his brothers 
and about seven other people 
the 41yearold monarch who studied in neighboring malaysia 
before a stint at the british military academy in sandhurst 
england in 1966 was crowned the 29th king of brunei in 1967 by 
his father sir omar ali saifuddin who abdicated in favor of his 
son 
the king loves polo and has about 200 argentine polo ponies 
some of which are kept in airconditioned stables he has two wives 
and six children 
in the 14th and 15th century brunei was a large empire 
stretching from the northern philippines to most parts of borneo 
but when the colonialists came brunei shrank brunei became a 
british protectorate in 1906 and won its independence on dec 31 
1983 
the country has no income tax gasoline is cheap and there are 
no major taxes on cars which are imported from japan and 
elsewhere diplomats estimate foreign reserves at 20 billion 
the king has powers to detain and hold without trial anyone 
deemed to be a threat to the security of the nation on july 14 
the government released 34 such detainees leaving just six still 
in custody 
diplomats say there appears to be no longterm threat to 
bruneis economy as the 120000 barrels of oil being pumped daily 
is expected to last well into the next century 
brunei is officially known as brunei darusalam 
darusalam means abode of peace and there is indeed peace 
here said a diplomat who added they could have added 
prosperity to it

a letter attributed to a west german 
hostage by a beirut newspaper says the man expects to be freed 
monday by his proiranian shiite moslem captors 
to the government of the federal republic of germany i should 
be freed on monday said the nineline letter attributed to 
rudolf cordes and published monday on the front page of the 
independent newspaper annahar 
there was no way to authenticate either that the handwriting was 
that of cordes who has been held for 20 months or that the 
statement was indeed from his captors 
the quote about his release was the only one that could be fully 
understood from the handwritten letter other phrases many words 
of which were illegible said please inform my family and 
urged please help the hostages 
it was not clear if he was indicating he is being held with 
other hostages 
it also was unclear whether the letter was an attempt to 
influence the ongoing trial in west germany of a lebanese shiite 
moslem mohammed ali hamadi who is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in 1987 after 
explosives were found in his luggage his older brother abbas was 
convicted by a west german court in april of complicity in the 
kidnappings of cordes and west german businessman alfred schmidt in 
a bid to free mohammed 
abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison schmidt kidnapped 
seven days before cordes jan 17 1987 abduction was released in 
september 1987 
another hamadi brother abdulhadi hamadi is believed to head 
the holy warriors for freedom which claimed responsibility for the 
kidapping of cordes 55 beirut manager for hoechst ag one of west 
germanys largest chemical companies 
abdulhadi is also chief of the security apparatus of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
other proiranian shiite moslem extremist groups all believed 
to be linked to one another claim they are holding 17 other 
foreigners including nine americans 
the hostage held the longest is american terry anderson who was 
abducted march 16 1985 
annahar said the letter was delivered to its west beirut 
offices at dawn monday along with an arabic statement signed by 
the holy warriors for freedom 
the arabiclanguage statement said the germanlanguage letter 
was written by cordes 
the sevenline arabic statement said 
we would like to inform those concerned that new developments 
toward the release of the west german cordes will be announced 
within the coming 48 hours therefore a representative of 
syrian president hafez assad and the west german ambassador are 
requested to come to the beaurivage hotel within this period 
the beaurivage hotel in the seaside ramlet albaida district is 
close to the command headquarters of syrian troops in charge of 
west beiruts security 
there was no explanation for the discrepancy for the monday 
release mentioned in the german letter and the 48hour period in 
the arabic release

some gulf coast residents needed little more 
than brooms and rakes to clean up after hurricane florence came 
ashore and fizzled into a tropical storm but forecasters kept a 
wary eye on hurricane gilbert in the caribbean 
we got off very easy on this one gov buddy roemers 
spokesman jeff cowart said sunday night it just happened to be 
a very weak storm and all the parishes involved were very well 
prepared 
a preliminary report from the office of emergency preparedness 
indicated no areas would qualify for federal assistance cowart 
said 
residents many of whom have returned home after other 
hurricanes to find major damage for the most part had only to 
clean downed tree limbs and blown debris after florence came ashore 
saturday 
no lives were lost to the storm officials said 
we were very lucky on this one and well prepared were just 
hoping gilbert doesnt head this way now cowart said 
gilbert churned westward toward jamaica today after skirting the 
southern coasts of puerto rico haiti and the dominican republic 
heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused 
flooding in the dominican republic on sunday night there were no 
immediate reports of casualties 
we should know within about 72 hours whether its going to be 
a major threat to the united states or not said national 
hurricane center meteorologist martin nelson were trying not to 
think about it hitting the united states yet thats a long way 
down the road 
in delacroix la a levee broke during florence cowart said 
but was repaired by saturday afternoon and water was being pumped 
out of the area 
the list of storm damage for the most part included downed trees 
and power lines utility companies estimated 100000 people lost 
power because of the storm service was restored by saturday night 
flooding as a result of the hurricane was limited to 
floodprone areas cowart said it wasnt bad anywhere at 
the worst id say maybe 2 feet of water was in some places he 
said 
roemer who cut short a trip to japan because of the hurricane 
was briefed on storm damage sunday cowart said 
cowart said 27500 people were evacuated from lowlying homes 
but had all returned by saturday night

storm it turned out to be a small one which was fine with us but 
we were ready for it either way he said 
florence hit on the anniversary of hurricane betsy a killer 
storm that devastated southern louisiana 23 years ago since then 
officials say the state has beefed up the levee systems that 
protect low areas from flooding and instituted sound evacuation and

dozen other people were beaten or knifed at a rapmusic concert in 
this new york city suburb say officials who are contemplating a 
ban on such events 
knives and pistols were apparently smuggled inside nassau 
veterans memorial coliseum before saturday nights violence even 
though the 10000 people who attended jam 88 had to pass

condition early today at nassau county medical center 
detective sgt john nolan described the gang as organized 
it looked like these men had a discipline a leader and a 
plan and they carried it out with some precision nolan said 
the plan involved surrounding the mugging victim and stabbing him 
so the thief could get away nolan said 
the man who was slain 19yearold julio fuentes of new york 
city was stabbed once in the chest shortly after he entered the 
colisuem 
he was with his girlfriend geiger said he resisted and 
he was stabbed in his upper chest

solidarity advisors say roundtable talks 
with communist authorities may not get off the ground unless the 
government shows it is willing in principle to reinstate the 
independent labor movement 
on sunday a group of intellectuals and artists met with 
solidarity chairman lech walesa to endorse his participation in the 
talksthe roughly 60 advisors calling themselves the council on 
poland also demanded the immediate legalization of solidarity 
the government promised the talks on jointly solving polands 
economic and social crises in exchange for an end to a nearly 
threeweek strike wave and a mediator said sunday that the 
discussions could begin this week 
a resolution adopted by the the advisors said the most 
important condition for the beginning of a true dialogue between 
the civil opposition and the authorities is the legalization of 
solidarity and the immediate implementation of pluralism 
the labor unrest that began in midaugust and ended sept 3 
posed the most serious threat to the government since it suppressed 
solidarity with a 1981 military crackdown authorities had promised 
walesa in talks aug 31 that they would discuss legalizing 
solidarity if he persuaded workers to end their occupation strikes 
we are extending our full support in negotiations concerning 
this issue to the founder of solidarity sundays resolution 
said referring to walesa 
no date has been set for the talks with authorities but andrzej 
stelmachowski the law professor who has been acting as a mediator 
in arranging the meetings said they could begin this week 
union advisers said the talks might not get anywhere unless 
there is evidence authorities are willing in principle to legalize 
solidarity 
no roundtable talks make sense unless at their first stage 
or even in the preparatory stage the authorities intentions are 
made credible by some form of recognition of solidaritys right 
to function legally piotr konopka a walesa aide told reporters 
solidarity hopes for some signal on the governments willingness 
to recognize solidarity during a preparatory meeting to be held 
with officials before the roundtable talks several solidarity 
advisers said 
sundays session was part of a twoday solidarity conference in 
the northern port of gdansk 
about 100 people gathered after sunday mass in a room at st 
brygidas roman catholic church which serves as the headquarters 
of the solidarity leadership 
walesa joined intellectuals workers and regional solidarity 
leaders for the session chaired by bronislaw geremek a historian 
and one of walesas closest advisers included in the group of 
writers actors and scholars were filmmaker andrzej wajda catholic 
newspaper editor jerzy turowicz and former head of the journalists 
union stefan bratkowski 
a spokesman for the group author edmund osmanczyk told 
reporters during a break in the discussions by means of 
recognizing pluralism we might finally become a normal state where 
a majority of citizens control the ruling minority like elsewhere 
in the world 
at the mass earlier the rev henryk jankowski spoke to a 
congregation of 5000 solidarity supporters stressing the need for 
unity in polish society as the talks begin 
today there is a chance for roundtable talks and we cannot 
waste it he said in his sermon just the opposite we have to 
break down all the barriers cast in solid concrete to get there 
and sit at that table 
zbigniew romaszewski a solidarity activist from warsaw who 
monitors human rights abuses in poland for the union said before 
sundays meeting that the mood was optimistic he said solidarity 
was more active and better organized than it has been in years 
the union federation was banned the year after martial law was 
imposed in 1981

problems of distributing relief 
materials to millions of stricken people and combating the rapid 
spread of disease plagued this flooded nation today despite steady 
declines in river levels 
president hussain muhammad ershad told a news conference his 
government has been trying to reach an estimated 30 million to 40 
million people who were either marooned by the floods or in need of 
food and medical assistance 
the flooding that started june 13 has claimed 866 lives 
according to the government daily reports by dhaka newspapers put 
the death toll at 1647 
the number of known diarrhea cases in the country continued to 
rise with the governments health control center reporting more 
than 211000 cases nationwide however the progovernment 
newspaper bangladesh times today quoted relief officials as saying 
the number exceeded 300000 
ershad said 130 people were known to have died of diarrhea he 
said he was unaware of any cholera cases but doctors and 
newspapers said cholera has been diagnosed in patients who drank 
floodcontaminated water 
about 5 percent of the patients admitted to the international 
center for diarrheal disease research in dhaka had contracted 
cholera according to a doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
when asked about cholera at his news conference ershad said 
i have no reports of cholera but i will check up 
both illnesses have similar symptoms but cholera is more 
serious and verified through laboratory tests 
the doctor said 550 people suffering from diarrhea or cholera 
had been admitted to the diarrhea center since sunday last month 
the center averaged 155 patients a day he said the current 
percentage of cholera cases was normal even during nonflood 
periods 
cholera is endemic in bangladesh he said 
asked about the possibility of illness escalating as the flood 
waters receded ershad said the fear of having an epidemic is 
already there 
he noted that his country has only 8000 doctors in a country 
with a population of 110 million that is a ratio of 13750 per 
doctor compared with one doctor per 5000 in india and one per 780 
in the united states 
ershad said estimates indicate 35 million tons of grain have 
been destroyed by the floods 20 percent of the grain needed to 
feed the country this year 
ershad said foreign pledges for flood relief have reached about 
280 million he said the rebuilding of roads washed away by the 
floods would require at least that amount 
about half the aid offered so far has come from the united 
states which has pledged nearly 150 million in wheat wheat seeds 
and cash for emergency airlift assistance as well as contributions 
to international agencies such as save the children care and world 
vision relief and development 
an american c5a galaxy trasnport plane arrived in dhaka today 
carrying water tanks and purification units and plastic sheeting to 
be used for temporary shelters 
the floodwaters have covered threefourths of bangladesh 
according to ershad 
for centuries the people of bangladesh have lived with floods 
but never before have the rivers unleased such fury on her 
people the president said 
the flood control center said today that all major rivers were 
falling but remain above flood level 
the brahmaputra dropped 8 inches at some stations since sunday 
the smaller buriganga which has flooded about half of dhaka 
dropped 2 inches during the same period 
the flood situation in the country is steadily improving 
said one control center official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
on sunday ershad called for water experts from india china 
nepal and bangladesh to meet to discuss floodcontrol in the 
region which is hit by annual monsoons from june through september 
ershad told a gathering in the northern township of grudaspur 
that bangladesh did not have the expertise nor resources to tackle 
the problem alone

president reagan inspected fire damage in yellowstone national 
park 
the most important thing is to concentrate our efforts on 
getting these fires under control and then out hodel said 
sunday the old policy has to be reviewed and altered 
the 16yearold policy allows fires ignited naturally to burn 
within wilderness areas and national parks unless they endanger 
people or property wildfires on conventional national forest or 
rangelands are fought with available resources he said 
in that time 16000 fires have burned a total of about 30000 
acres in the park hodel said about 900000 acres of yellowstone

battalions 1200 men from camp pendleton calif and two army 
battalions would be dispatched to the firelines the pentagon has 
already sent 2300 army soldiers to help hardpressed fire crews 
so by the end of next week we will see a doubled 
representation by the military in this effort taft said 
some critics of the letitburn guidelines including sen 
malcolm wallop rwyo have called for the resignation of national 
park service director william mott for adhering to the policy 
rep richard stallings didaho has called for an immediate 
and sweeping reevaluation by congress of the park services

president pw botha embarked 
today on his first summitlevel mission into black africa flying 
to marxistruled mozambique for talks with a government that has 
blamed its woes on south africa 
after meeting with president joaquim chissano of mozambique near 
a south africanassisted hydroelectric project botha was to 
continue on to malawi for talks tuesday with president hastings 
kamuzu banda malawi is the only african state maintaining full 
diplomatic ties with whiteruled south africa 
botha and chissano were expected to discuss a mutual 
nonaggression treaty signed between the two countries in 1984 
the treaty lapsed in 1985 when mozambique produced evidence that 
south africa violated it by continuing to assist the mozambique 
national resistance rebel movement which began an insurgency two 
years after independence from portugal in 1975 
the war combined with drought has left millions of mozambicans 
homeless and short of food 
many western governments including the united states have 
increased aid to mozambique and endorse its contention that the 
rebels receive covert logistical and communications aid from south 
africa 
south africa insists it no longer aids the rebels and botha is 
expected to try to convince chissano to mute the allegations 
botha whose plane departed from an air force base at pretoria 
was accompanied by his defense minister gen magnus malan and 
foreign minister pik botha chissanos delegation which left 
maputo for the northwestern town of songo early today included 
three cabinet ministers and two military commanders according to 
the mozambican news agency aim 
in the past year as part of an effort to improve its regional 
image south africa has expanded its trade mission in maputo and 
pursued economic development possibilities in mozambique 
the two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at 
rehabilitating cahora basso the giant hydroelectric project in the 
northern wartorn province of tete so that south africa can 
purchase electricity 
the rebels repeatedly have sabotaged power lines leading from 
cahora basso to south africa 
even when their relations were badly strained mozambique and 
south africa maintained extensive ties tens of thousands of 
mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in south africa 
and maputos electricity is supplied by south africa 
botha during his 10 years in power has had few chances to 
travel in black africa in 1986 he was one of numerous dignitaries 
who attended the coronation of swazilands king mswati iii and in 
1987 he made a secret visit to south african troops fighting in 
angola 
he had hoped to visit brazzaville congo earlier this year in 
conjunction with peace talks on angola and southwest africa or 
namibia but angolas cuban allies reportedly threatened to scuttle 
the talks if he went

officials from the city justice department 
and the naacp will meet with a federal judge this week to finetune 
a desegregation plan that emerged as the city teetered toward the 
edge of bankruptcy 
the conference comes after two councilmen changed their minds 
and voted early saturday to accept the judges plan following a 
series of noisy and emotional city council meetings 
they switched after lawyers from the city and the national 
association for the advancement of colored people agreed on a 
compromise housing plan the councilmen hope us district judge 
leonard sand will accept 
fines imposed by sand on the city reached 1 million a day on 
friday forcing the layoffs of hundreds of workers that would have 
taken effect saturday had the councilmen remained defiant 
now the fines and layoffs are on hold 
sand told lawyers for the city the federal government and the 
naacp to gather wednesday to go over the alternative plan 
sand could accept the new plan or again order the city to abide 
by his original order 
sand had called for 200 units of lowincome public housing on a 
number of sites scattered throughout mainly white neighborhoods and 
800 units of middleincome subsidized housing scattered throughout 
yonkers 
the city council had agreed to the original plan earlier this 
year and the city agreed in a consent decree to follow it but 
officials disagreed on how it should be implemented 
the new citynaacp proposal would substitute two new housing 
sites for one of the original seven mix some lowincome units with 
more expensive ones substantially alter the style and mix of the 
housing rehabilitate some existing housing and create a new 
organization to manage the housing 
there is a sense of hope said the rev darryl george after 
preaching sunday morning to his predominantly black congregation at 
the messiah baptist church we have crossed the first hurdle yet 
we have a healing process that is still occurring 
we have to take an active role now and make sure this plan 
does work said peter chema a councilman who was called a 
snake by a resident after he switched his vote 
but the alternative plan has its detractors 
what were doing is creating slums said henry spallone one 
of two councilmen who voted no saturday after we put the 
first one in and it starts to deteriorate like all public housing 
does were going to have a multitude of problems 
spallone said the councils action probably reduced the value 
of every house in yonkers by a minimum of 50000 and as much as 
100000 
gov mario cuomo said he would appoint a task force and sen 
daniel patrick moynihan promised to arrange a meeting between city 
officials and the secretary of housing and urban development 
mayor nicholas wasicsko said saturdays vote was a watershed 
because it meant the council would now work with the court none 
of us are comfortable with the courts plan he said but the 
court imposed it because the council refused to get involved 
nicholas longo the other councilman who changed his vote said 
the impending layoffs transformed the mounting fines from the 
abstract into reality 
wasicsko said he ran into an east yonkers resident who had been 
a vehement opponent of the housing plan the other day he was 
standing in front of his house knee deep in garbage he says 
its time for integration 
wasicskos mother a library clerk was among those who was to 
be laid off 
the justice department filed the desegregation lawsuit in 1980 
and was joined by the naacp and three years ago sand ordered an 
end to segregated housing and schools in yonkers 
on aug 2 he had found the city of 194000 in contempt of court 
for the councils refusal to carry out a housing desegregation 
order it approved earlier this year

about 150 disciples of indian guru 
bhagwan shree rajneesh spent the weekend taking a final look at the 
isolated central oregon ranch that served as the sects showplace 
rancho rajneesh 64000 acres of sagebrushdotted hills on the 
high desert will be sold at auction next month it had been for 
sale for 28 million but fell under foreclosure proceedings by 
connecticut general life insurance co 
its such a beautiful place such a peaceful place and this 
planet has no use for it said swami prem niren the american 
lawyer who serves as rajneeshs ambassador to the united states 
nobody wants to put the resources into even using it for what 
its already been built for a great big meditation center 
the commune incorporated as rajneeshpuram on part of the ranch 
was home to thousands of redclad disciples from 1981 to 1985 they 
toiled 12hour days and showered rajneesh with jewels and rolls 
royces that he used for daily drives past lines of singing 
clapping followers 
the commune disbanded in 1985 after the guru pleaded guilty to 
federal immigration charges under a plea agreement he received a 
suspended 10year sentence paid a 400000 fine and agreed not to 
return to the united states for five years without the written 
permission of the us attorney general 
rajneesh 56 returned to pune india where he carries on his 
meditation teachings as the selfdescribed guru of the rich 
the family reunion and picnic drew about 150 west coast 
disciples who endured the perilous gravel road into the ranch to 
tour the abandoned buildings and reminisce about the communes 
heyday 
the reunion happened by itself niren said some people 
wanted to come here and be here while its still possible 
the gathering was closed to the public except for a news 
conference sunday at which niren reiterated accusations that the 
us government destroyed the commune and poisoned rajneesh after 
he was arrested niren acknowledged however that he had no 
evidence of such a crime 
the news conference followed an emotional singing and meditation 
session outside the house where the guru lived 
tears streamed down the faces of several disciples as niren 
recalled the turbulence that marked the communes downfall 
he criticized the reign of ma anand sheela rajneeshs personal 
secretary who is in federal prison 
shes just another powerhungry politician niren said 
among those on hand for the news conference was wasco county 
judge william hulse who said he came to the reunion when offered a 
ride by the county sheriff sheela was convicted of assault for 
handing hulse a glass of poisoned water 
i didnt want the people out here to think i was going to rub 
it in hulse said

yoko ono says a new biographys portrayal of her 
late husband john lennon as a violent schizophrenic drug addict 
is akin to a second murder 
its like john has been assassinated twice she said in 
todays new york post i thought of picassos wife who committed 
suicide but id never do that because of sean she added 
referring to her and lennons son 
but the author of the lives of john lennon arthur goldman 
said in an interview in todays new york times that he was sticking 
by the claims he made in the best seller 
if you were to encounter the real john lennon and live with 
him for six months i think you would be very disgusted goldman 
said 
the former beatle who was killed in front of his manhattan 
apartment building on dec 8 1980 did not have anorexia or 
dyslexia as the book claims ono said 
these are very serious diseases and fortunately john did not 
have any of them she said but its not fair to laugh at all 
the people in the world who suffer from these diseases 
she also took issue with goldmans claim that lennon had an 
affair with beatles manager brian epstein 
i was his wife and i just know he wasnt homosexual she 
told the post i can say that for certain but if he was bisexual 
there was no reason he couldnt have told me beause we didnt think 
there was anything wrong about that 
she acknowledged that both she and lennon used drugs at one 
time but said they both had conquered it 
sean lennon 12 called the book outlandish 
at first i thought it was very serious but then i realized 
it was just a big joke he told the post 
in the times interview goldman admitted making some factual 
errors in the book but maintained there were no errors on which 
a great deal turns like the interpretation of an episode or a 
major point 
ono told the times i think the book is trash its not even 
good reading 
she planned to offer a rebuttal to the book using excerpts from 
lennon interview tapes as well as comments from julian lennon and 
others on wednesday night on a new york city radio station

the us environmental protection agency should 
change its approach and concentrate on early detection and 
prevention of new pollution say more than 40 scientists according 
to a report published today 
the critical report scheduled to be released in washington this 
week says the agencys focus on cleaning up known pollution is 
inadequate for coping with modern environmental problems the 
boston globe reported in todays editions 
the report was commissioned 17 months ago by lee thomas the 
epas chief administrator 
we really dont know how environmental changes are affecting 
natural systems said alvin alm a former top epa official who 
directed the report alm now is president of alliance technologies 
in bedford mass 
there are really dire consequences were worrying about small 
problems now compared with the potential global impact of these 
changes he said 
alm said the epa desperately needs a longterm research and 
development program that takes into account consequences of 
problems such as global warming 
the report calls for an early detective system for environmental 
problems and for the creation of an environmental research 
institute that would be financed by the epa but operated by a 
university or other independent contractor 
it also recommends making the position of assistant 
administrator of epa for research and development a civil service 
job 
the job has been held by political appointees since epa was 
formed in 1970 and no one has served more than three years since 
then the globe said 
dr ellen silbergeld of the environmental defense fund a 
citizens advocacy group and one of those making the report said 
she and others involved have doubts about a new institute 
the epa has a dismal record at managing research both 
internal and external she said 
the report says that despite the epas original charter to 
take a longterm view of human health and environmental quality 
epa has had to devote a larger and larger share of its budget to 
the support of nearterm regulatory development required by 
environmental law 
the report also said the agency should maintain the clean air 
and clean waters programs mandated by congress

matabeleland did not find true peace the civilian population 
continued to suffer from guerrilla warfare and other forms of 
violence 
the pope celebrated mass at ascot race course on an altar 
festooned with white madonna lilies many in the crowd of 50000 
waited at the race track six hours for the mass 
the pope began the mass speaking in sindebele the tribal 
language of the ndebele of matabeleland

sensitive part of his threeday trip to zimbabwe which began 
saturday the pope is to travel on to the blackgoverned countries 
of botswana lesotho swaziland and mozambique during his 10day 
tour of southern africa 
before the mass john paul was welcomed by bishop henry karlen

clashed after karlen accused government troops of atrocities 
involving hundreds of civilians in matabeleland 
mugabe denied the allegations and accused the bishop of siding 
with rebels 
the people of matabeleland have suffered much during the 
liberation war karlen said in his welcoming speech the blood 
of 10 missionary martyrs of the diocese of bulawayo has flowed into 
the soil of this area may this blood bear abundant fruit 
until recently matabeleland was the center of a tribalbased 
insurgency that began shortly after zimbabwe gained independence in

the rebels and government troops among them the 10 catholic 
missionaries

matabeleland diocese on april 19 hours after the government 
announced a general amnesty for rebels the government said 113 
rebels surrendered under the amnesty and that there have been no 
rebelrelated killings since 
the amnesty came four months after mugabe and nkomo formerly 
his chief political rival signed a unity accord

sevenyear war that led to whiteruled rhodesia becoming 
blackruled zimbabwe 
mugabe a member of the shona tribe that accounts for 70 percent

proving that time heals all wounds a 
lawman presided when this gold rush town paid tribute to black 
bart the old west stagecoach robber famed for his calling card 
poems 
about 2500 people turned out during the weekend for a parade 
barbecue and dance to celebrate the release of the gentleman 
bandit from san quentin prison 100 years ago 
bill claudino a california highway patrol officer was the 
parade chairman 
some people might think it is a little odd to pay so much 
attention to a stagecoach robber but black bart really was quite a 
dapper thief claudino said 
black bart was the alias of charles e bolles who robbed 28 
stages between 1875 to 1883 before he was caught and served five 
years in prison 
he was released on jan 21 1888 but because januarys weather 
is foul here the celebration was postponed until saturday 
san andreas the seat of calaveras county laid claim to the end 
of the black bart legend because it sent him to san quentin 
a handkerchief and two shirt cuffs dropped during a stage holdup 
at nearby copperopolis was traced by laundry mark to boles who 
lived in san francisco when captured he was wearing a derby 
diamond jewelry a gold watch and twirling a cane 
black bart became known for the poems he left behind at 
robberies all signed in the same manner the first of several was 
scribbled on the back of a freight waybill 
ive labored long and hard for bread 
for honor and for riches 
but on my corns too long youve tread 
you finehaired sons of bitches 
below was the signature black bart the po8 
bolles was never reported seen again after he left prison

weekend as part of a cutback that eliminates eastern service to 14 
cities and drops the carriers workforce to 30000 
less than four years ago eastern had 42000 workers 
were back on death watch again said katherine ferer a 
vice chair of the transport workers union representing flight 
attendants 
eastern officials acknowledge the cuts are painful but said 
something had to be done 
the fact is we have lost over a billion dollars in this 
decade said robin matell the companys chief spokesman we 
have to take prudent although admittedly painful measures 
union leaders say laying off employees will drive up labor costs 
per flight because the lesssenior workers being laid off were paid 
less than those who remain 
the last thing you want to do in the airline industry is 
downsize said charles e bryan president of district 100 of the 
machinists easterns largest union with nearly 12000 workers 
many of the costs are fixed and the breakeven yield goes way 
up its a loselose proposition that just feeds on itself 
of the 4000 jobs eliminated 1500 were nonunion positions 
including management and clerical some 500 pilots positions are 
being eliminated without layoffs by having pilots clear backlogs of 
vacation time and some 400 flight attendants are taking 
onetosixmonth leaves of absence the company said 
a few hundred more flight attendants mechanics baggage 
handlers and ramp agents are taking early retirement or simply 
quit eastern said 
eastern is 25 billion in debt and its cash reserves dwindled 
from 560 million to 420 million in the quarter ending june 30 
president phil bakes said eastern was cutting out moneylosing 
western routes and its kansas city hub along with some sluggish 
caribbean routes the company estimates the new cuts will save 100 
million a year 
the houstonbased texas air corp chaired by frank lorenzo 
took over eastern two years ago 
easterns unions will make arguments against the layoffs later 
this month in the district court of appeals in washington which 
allowed eastern to go ahead with the layoffs after it posted a 47 
million bond to pay back salaries if workers are later ordered 
reinstated

more than 1000 primary and secondary 
school students fasted today as thousands of demonstrators marched 
through rangoon to press for an interim government to lead burma to 
democracy 
key opposition leaders jointly rejected the governments plan to 
hold a general election and reiterated demands for an interim 
government staterun radio rangoon said the state council met with 
the newly formed commission on elections to work out polling 
details naming ba htay as commission chairman 
the students age 10 to 17 began the 36hour fast sunday at the 
rangoon general hospital compound the students held up banners and 
shouted give us democracy and give us interim government 
they said their fast would end tonight 
meanwhile many thousands of studentled demonstrators marched 
through the capital to press for an interim government and 
multiparty democracy 
more soldiers were seen on the streets today but they did not 
interfere with the protesters who dispersed peacefully 
president maung maung has rejected the call for an interim 
government but saturday he bowed to weeks of nationwide protests 
and announced the ruling party would hold the first multiparty 
general election since 1960 
parliament on sunday authorized the government to amend the 
constitution to permit a multiparty system and hold the election in 
as little as six weeks 
but the demonstrators clearly remain skeptical of the promise 
and the protests have continued 
burma scholars note the present constitution is designed to 
support singleparty rule and would have to be virtually scrapped 
rather than amended to permit multiparty elections 
burma expert josef silverstein contacted by the associated 
press from bangkok thailand said the constitution gives the 
president and central government great power and enshrines the 
rigid party policies known as the burmese way to socialism 
said another burma specialist bertil linter of bangkok its 
impossible to hold elections within the present constitution 
opposition leaders aung gyi former defense minister tin oo and 
aung san suu kyi issued their demand for an interim government in a 
letter to maung maung it was the first joint statement from the 
three opposition leaders 
none of the three have specified who should be in the interim 
government saying only it should comprise people outside the 
ruling burma socialist program party who are acceptable to all 
the people they also have not said if they would be willing to 
serve in a transition government 
since the government has lost the confidence of the nation 
people will have no confidence in the general elections to be held 
by the governmentappointed election supervision commission the 
statement said 
it said when an interim government is formed striking public 
employees will return to work burma will regain normal economic 
activity and general elections would be organized 
parliament set a target date of three months for the holding of 
the multiparty elections but empowered the government to make it 
earlier or later if necessary 
it also appointed an election commission comprised of three 
retired civil servants a retired army brigadier general and a 
former member of parliament the men all over 70 years of age are 
generally regarded as neutral 
at least four are not members of the ruling party 
the last multiparty elections were in 1960 the elected 
government of prime minister u nu was overthrown in a 1962 coup led 
by gen ne win 
over the next 26 years ne win and the military crushed dissent 
and pursued rigid socialist policies that made resourcerich burma 
one of the worlds poorest nations 
economic woes the past year have fueled nationwide protests in 
which hundreds were killed the protests forced the resignations of 
ne win on july 23 and successor sein lwin aug 12 
maung maung took power aug 19 as the countrys first civilian 
leader since 1962 
maung maung has called for an end to the prodemocracy strikes 
and warned that lawlessness and destruction of public property must 
end immediately 
he called for immediate removal of administrations set up by 
buddhist monks and students in towns nationwide where central 
government control has disintegrated

oral roberts university medical students say 
they feel betrayed by the cancellation of a scholarship program 
funded after evangelist oral roberts said god would end his life 
unless he raised 8 million 
although the television preacherfaith healer said the donations 
would fund full scholarships for medical students at oral roberts 
university those scholarships turned out to be loans 
new students at the tulsa okla school have been told the 
university has canceled the scholarship program for them 
students also complained roberts has pressured them to keep 
quiet about their dissatisfaction the los angeles times reported 
in todays editions 
several students said that at the semesters opening chapel 
service roberts told them not to grumble warning keep your 
cottonpickin mouth shut 
roberts on his tv programs and in letters to donors this year 
has insisted he never promised the medical students anything beyond 
one years help officials in roberts ministry and the medical 
school declined requests for comment 
during last years 8 million fundraising drive roberts 
repeatedly said the donations would fund full scholarships for 
medical students 
but the fouryear scholarships turned out to require students to 
work as medical missionaries for four years after graduation to 
repay the 93500 in scholarship funds 
the contract also said oru makes no promise or warranty 
whatsoever that additional medical school scholarship loans will be 
made in future years future years is not defined 
in a memo feb 1 however the medical school students were 
informed by assistant dean milton c olsen that the healing team 
scholarship loan program would be canceled at the end of the 
198788 academic year 
students who stayed in the medical school for the next three 
years would have to pay as much as 71000 those who transferred 
were told they would have to pay back the money they had already 
received at 18 percent interest 
the restated loan agreement also prohibits students from 
borrowing from any source other than oru except with written 
approval of president oral roberts and the board of regents 
at least 25 returning students have sought legal advice 
regarding the new document twelve have transferred and about half 
of the 85 who received scholarships in past years have refused to 
sign the new contract 
the more than 8 million raised in last years drive was not 
just for the students but for the cost of operating the medical 
school for one year oral roberts and his son richard said on the 
richard roberts live television program in march 
jack hayford pastor of the church on the way in the los angeles 
and a member of the schools board of regents said he thought the 
students should be grateful for any attempt to continue the 
scholarships 
a small group of med students feels theres been some kind of 
a breach of trust hayford said in a technical sense 
perhaps 
jerry collins the orlando fla racetrack owner whose 13 
million gift pushed roberts over the 8 million goal just before 
the march 31 1987 deadline said the medical school was a 
financial failure from the start 
they needed cash flow and i never thought the money would be 
exclusively for the med students he said 
regarding roberts fundraising pitch collins said i dont 
approve of whats happening there but im for helping education

american rabbi herman dicker says hes bringing a 
message of hope to east germanys tiny and isolated jewish 
community but he says hed like to see the communist government do 
more for them 
dicker conducted a rosh hashana service for about 200 jews 
sunday evening as part of his twoweek stay in east berlin for the 
high holidays rosh hashana is the jewish new year the countrys 
practicing jews estimated to number between 450 and 600 have no 
permanent rabbi 
they east german jews are somewhat isolated the new york 
rabbi told the associated press i want to give them a feeling 
they belong to a group im bringing a message of hope 
while dicker says he believes that things are loosening up 
there is still more east germany could do for jews an 
improvement is possible the 74yearold rabbi said in the 
interview in front of the temple of peace synagogue the only 
synagogue still in use in east berlin 
there is a recognition on the part of the officials that they 
can do more than they have done in the past dicker said when 
asked about jewish life in east germany things could be better 
he did not specify what improvements are needed 
while emphasizing that part of his stay would include a spirit 
of criticism he said he did not wish to become embroiled in a 
political dispute and said he had been well received 
he is in east berlin under an agreement worked out between east 
germany and the world jewish congress for the high holidays 
edgar m bronfman president of the congress said in july that 
after years of pressure there is a good chance that east 
germany would agree this fall to pay reparations to holocaust 
survivors 
an estimated 6 million jews died during adolf hitlers third 
reich and until now east germany has refused to pay reparations 
east germany has agreed to restore a second east berlin 
synagogue that has fallen into disrepair 
dicker now a research librarian at the jewish theological 
seminary in new york was born in hungary and was educated in 
berlin until 1936 when he was forced to flee by the nazis he 
served as a chaplain with the us army in world war ii and 
participated in the liberation of a number of concentration camps 
including mauthausen in austria 
dicker said he would be a little sad to leave east berlins 
jews a majority of them elderly people who survived the holocaust 
my ambition is great but my effectiveness will be limited 
he said noting that sundays service was his first in a communist 
country 
the world jewish congress is searching for a rabbi to serve in 
east germany on what it calls a longterm appointment 
dicker said he hopes the congress can find a such a rabbi 
however he added that finding a rabbi would be difficult the 
person would have to be part of schiller and goethe but also be 
horrified by hitler

the pilot of a twa jetliner 
hijacked to beirut in 1985 testified today that mohammed ali hamadi 
fired the shot that killed us navy diver robert sethem 
but under questioning by defense lawyers capt john testrake 
said he did not actually see hamadi pull the trigger and he said 
either of the two hijackers could have led stethem to a cabin door 
where he was shot 
it was my recollection that the most violent of the two men 
was in the companion way i was in extreme stress and not taking 
notes of these details its only recollection testrake said 
testrake testified he believed hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem 
who is on trial on charges of air piracy and murder was the most 
violent of the two hijackers 
the pilot said he had a chance to get a closer look at defendant 
during a court recess after the break he told the court 
i want to make an important statement i did say before 
that one of the two hijackers appeared to do more of the 
communicating and the other more of the violence 
and looking at this man now i was struck that this man fit 
the second of the two descriptions that this is the man who i 
recall had stood in the forward entryway and shot stethem 
under questioning however testrake said he could not recall if 
hamadi or the other hijacker was with stethem at the time of the 
shooting 
hamadi has acknowledged being one of the hijackers but denied 
killing stethem of waldorf md if convicted hamadi faces life 
imprisoment 
testrake of richmond mo was at the controls of flight 847 
when it was hijacked june 14 1985 the flight from athens to rome 
was diverted to beirut and 39 americans were held hostage for 17 
days 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in 1987 after 
explosives were found in his luggage 
his brother abdulhadi hamadi is believed to head the holy 
warriors for freedom which claimed responsibility for the jan 17 
1987 kidnapping of rudolf cordes 55 beirut manager for the 
hoechst ag chemical company 
in beirut today a letter attributed to cordes said the hostage 
expected to be freed today and linked his fate with mohammed 
hamadi the germanlanguage letter which could not be 
authenticated said please inform my family but please do 
everything regarding mohammed please help the hostagetakers 
expect something especially now that i am freed 
however a statement accompanying the later and signed by the 
holy warriors for freedom spoke of a 48hour release period the 
discrepancy could not be explained 
a third hamadi brother abbas was convicted by a west german 
court in april of complicity in the kidnappings of cordes and west 
german engineer alfred schmidt in a bid to free mohammed 
abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison schmidt was released 
a year ago in what the holy warriors for freedom called a goodwill 
gesture 
also today testrake described the moments after takeoff from 
athens airport 
about five minutes after takeoff i turned off the seatbelt 
light almost immediately after that we began to hear strange 
noises that came from behind the cockpit bulkhead i asked the 
copilot to check 
he said the copilot looked through a peephole in the cockpit 
door and told him we have been hijacked 
testrake said the copilot had seen a man brandishing a 
chromeplated pistol 
he said the men kicked violently at the door breaking a panel 
at the bottom then burst into the cockpit carrying the pistol and 
two hand grenades 
testrake said he was not beaten but that his flight engineer 
benjamin c zimmermann of cascade idaho was repeatedly struck 
with the pistol 
blood was coming from his head and from his shirt testrake 
said 
he said the hijackers beat the engineer and passengers even 
after the hijackers demands to fly to beirut were met 
there was no reason for any of the beating because we were 
complying with their demands testrake testified

george bush said today that frederic v malek 
was without one ounce of bigotry or prejudice even though he 
resigned from the republican national committee because of a report 
that he tallied the number of jews in a federal agency for 
president nixon in the early 1970s 
reporters shouted questions about maleks departure as the vice 
president embarked on a fivestate tour including major industrial 
centers he said he stood by a statement he issued sunday and 
expressed similar sentiments in a conversation with malek 
i know this man and i know him to be without one ounce of 
bigotry or prejudice in his makeup bush said 
malek who had been deputy chairman of the republican national 
committee since aug 19 had admitted compiling the data in 1971 
but denied sunday he had any part in the demotion of government 
employees because of their religious affiliation he said he 
resigned in order to keep the campaign focused on the issues 
in a separate statement bush said i respect fred maleks 
decision i know him to be a most honorable man without a trace of 
bigotry in his makeup i condemn any vestiges of antisemitism 
prejudice or bigotry and so i believe does fred malek 
the washington post story and the resignation follow a report 
last week that members of an ethnic coalition for bush were 
associated with antisemitic and fascistic activities 
a cochairman jerome brentar resigned after disclosures he was 
active in the defense of john demjanjuk a former ohio autoworker 
convicted in israel of being a nazi death camp guard the 
washington jewish week also reported that brentar denied the 
existence of the holocaust 
the moral clock is ticking for the bush campaign rep 
charles e schumer dny said sunday noting that jews around 
the country were preparing to celebrate rosh hashana the jewish 
new year 
how can we trust george bush to be a friend of israel he 
asked 
malek a harvard business school graduate known for his 
management abilities was chosen by bush late in april to run the 
republican national convention 
before the convention bush announced that he would place malek 
in the rnc position at the same time bush spurned chairman frank 
fahrenkopfs offer to resign the move however gave bush greater 
control of the party 
i think malek going up there will maximize coordination 
between the campaign and the important functions of the rnc bush 
said at the time 
the committee voted in malek the day after the convention in new 
orleans 
the post reported sunday that former president nixon had ordered 
malek in 1971 to investigate what was described in notes as a 
jewish cabal at the bureau of labor statistics 
at the time malek was nixons white house personnel chief and 
had been assigned to evaluate the bls staff because nixon thought 
the bureau was interpreting unemployment data in an unfavorable 
light 
on july 27 1971 malek reported to hr haldeman nixons chief 
of staff that 13 of 35 top bls officials were jewish post 
reporters found the memo last week in the archives of nixons 
presidency 
less than two months after maleks memo to haldeman two senior 
officials who were jewish were moved to less visible positions in 
the labor department they were peter henle then chief economist 
for bls and harold goldstein then director of current employment 
analysis 
in his statement sunday malek said referring to the demotion 
of anyone for religious reasons i find that kind of action or 
even the suggestion that i engaged peripherally in that kind of 
effort to be morally wrong and totally out of bounds 
malek who worked as a senior executive for the marriott corp 
came to washington with the nixon administration 
while with the administration in 1972 malek oversaw a program 
of redirecting federal grants to benefit nixons reelection 
efforts

a us military court began hearings 
today to determine whether a navy captain should be courtmartialed 
for failing to rescue vietnamese refugees who said they ate human 
flesh to survive at sea 
capt alexander g balian was relieved as skipper of the uss 
dubuque last month vietnamese refugees said they resorted to murder 
and cannibalism after the navy ship refused to take them aboard in 
the south china sea in june 
the vietnamese eventually were rescued by fishermen and are in a 
refugee camp on the philippine island of palawan 
todays proceedings at subic bay naval base were a preliminary 
session and were adjourned for two weeks to allow balian to prepare 
his defense according to navy spokesman lt cmdr kevin mukri 
the hearing which is the first step leading to a possible 
courtmartial was conducted by cmdr j e halvorson a circuit 
military judge mukri said he gave no other details 
balian faces charges of wrongfully failing to render 
appropriate assistance to the refugees and of dereliction of duty 
by not properly investigating the refugees condition 
navy officials decided to begin proceedings against balian 48 
after he refused to appear at an admirals mast a closeddoor 
session during which an admiral serves as the only judge sources 
in washington said 
the dubuque an amphibious landing ship was sailing toward the 
persian gulf on june 9 when it encountered a boat filled with 
vietnamese refugees in the south china sea the navy said the 
dubuque gave the refugees several hundred pounds of food and water 
and navigational aids but did not take them aboard because balian 
judged their boat to be seaworthy 
the refugees told philippine and united nations officials that 
after encountering the american ship they drifted for weeks and 
many of them starved 
philippine and us officials quoted the survivors as saying 
they killed and ate three of their companions after being turned 
away by the dubuque they said they also ate two other companions 
who had starved 
only 52 of the 109 vietnamese survived the 37day crossing they 
said they encountered the dubuque 19 days after they left vietnam

predominantly protestant province and unite it with the mainly 
roman catholic irish republic sixtynine people have died in 
northern ireland so far this year in sectarian violence

scores of religious fundamentalists are 
heeding an authors predictions that a prelude to christs second 
coming is near and some are selling their worldly goods to prepare 
for the end of the world 
the rapture is expected to strike before sunset tuesday 
according to the book 88 reasons why the rapture will be in 
1988 which was written by former nasa rocket engineer edgar c 
wisenant 
he used mathematical calculations and biblical interpretations 
to pinpoint the event to the 48 hours of this years jewish new 
year 40 years and 120 days after israel became a nation on may 
14 1948 
according to his book millions of the faithful will be 
suddenly silently called to heaven this week and global disasters 
will follow 
in west virginia a minister reported a baptism boom and in ohio 
a retired firefighter spent 3700 for a newspaper ad to tell 
people that jesus christ will return this week to take believers to 
heaven 
ed koval said the cost of the ad in the blade of toledo was a 
pittance because if this is true and it does come to pass whats 
money anyway 
most religious leaders say there is no evidence to support 
claims that the rapture will occur this week 
randy thompson director of the christian studies center in new 
haven conn said the rapture appeals mainly to fundamentalist 
christians who interpret the bible as the literal word of god 
its just a sign of the times people are looking for 
reassurance that its going to happen said dr es hanrahan 
dean of the college of science at marshall university in 
huntington w va 
rabbi victor urecki of bnai jacob a conservative jewish 
synagogue in charleston wva said he was being swamped with 
calls from christians as rosh hashana neared 
ive been telling people who call that ill see them 
tuesday he said im not too worried about it 
but some christians are taking it seriously and are selling off 
their valuables in anticipation that they will soon be in the 
kingdom of god 
durham nc television station wtvd reported that several 
residents last week put their cars and a boat up for sale in 
anticipation of the event 
many preachers talked about the rapture in their sunday sermons 
will it happen im not a datesetter but im not a fool 
either said the rev max allman of peoples memorial christian 
church in burlington nc who urged worshippers to check out 
their priorities 
allman pastor of peoples memorial said the event had created a 
revival at his church with attendance doubling in recent weeks to 
more than 700 at sunday and 350 at weeknight services 
this has made them people understand that in a flash this 
could all be over he said 
the lord is coming back im looking at it about any time 
now said jerry mclamb 37 of coats nc he said he and workers

impassioned speech in 1810 urging his peasant congregation in the 
city of dolores to take up arms against spanish monarchs who had 
ruled mexico for more than three centuries

sal lopez 74 whose parents immigrated from mexico in 1921 has 
organized the parade for the past 25 years and has attended twice 
as many 
when the parade was first organized it was nothing but a 
bunch of brewing companies that put a couple of mexican flags on 
their trucks and drove down first street but as the mexican 
population here increases the parade gets bigger and bigger he 
said 
authorities estimated 100000 people turned out in the 
predominately hispanic community of east los angeles 
the parade featured indian dancers in glistening silver and gold 
robes with anklets of dried nuts that could be heard rattling above 
the sound of the trumpets and guitars of mariachis 
men thrust their fists in the air and shouted viva la 
independencia as military bands marched by and fans swooned over 
the singing group menudo and such mexican movie stars as parade 
grand marshal richard iniquez 
mexican beauty queens smiled at the crowd from colorful 30foot 
floats

a us destroyer rescued three 
shipwrecked fishermen and was searching for a fourth after their 
two small craft foundered in rough seas in the gulf of oman 
american naval sources said today 
a navy official said the destroyer john hancock had just 
finished escorting two uschartered cargo vessels out of the 
persian gulf when its patrol helicopter spotted the fishermen 
clinging to pieces of wreckage 
the fishermen were two pakistanis and a united arab emirates 
citizen all from the emirates port of fujairah 
the three men were quoted as saying one of their craft was 
swamped in the heavy seas and the second sank after trying to come 
to its rescue 
the missing man was another emirates citizen said the navy 
official who asked not to be identified 
the 7800ton john hancock based at mayport fla is one of 
five us warships scheduled to leave the gulf within the next two 
weeks all will be replaced by ships now on their way to the gulf 
it was the second reported rescue of fishermen by a us warship 
in the past month in august the missile cruiser vincennes picked 
up eight iranians who had been adrift for eight days in the gulf of 
oman they later were repatriated 
the vincennes which on july 3 mistakenly shot down an iranian 
jetliner killing all 290 aboard left the gulf region sunday for 
its home port of san diego calif a week after it was originally 
scheduled to leave us officials said 
the departure of the vincennes represents the first us force 
reduction in the gulf from 27 to 26 warships since the 
iraniraq ceasefire took effect aug 20 us navy sources 
confirmed that there were no plans to replace the 9600ton aegis 
cruiser 
navy sources who demanded anonymity said the vincennes was 
ordered to delay its departure after an arab gulf country objected 
to the vincennes being pulled out while the iraniraq ceasefire 
talks in geneva remained stalled 
the sources declined to identify the arab government or say why 
the vincennes was leaving now the geneva talks have continued to 
show no significant progress 
us officials in washington said the vincennes was being 
withdrawn because its longrange radar and weapons capability is 
no longer needed there 
as the latest us navyescorted tanker convoy reached kuwait 
overnight that countrys top tanker official said the ceasefire 
in the 8yearold war does not mean an end to its reliance on us 
and other foreign flags to protect its ships 
kuwaiti tankers will continue to sail under us soviet and 
british flags the reflagging is a purely economic policy and has 
nothing to do with the war abdelfattah albader chairman of 
the staterun kuwait oil tanker co was quoted as saying in an 
interview with the newspaper alwatan 
the united states britain and the soviet union have all 
reflagged vessels and protected kuwaiti shipping from iranian 
attack in the gulf during the past year 
one of the 11 usflagged kuwaiti tankers the 46723ton 
carrier gas princess arrived in kuwait overnight escorted by the 
us missile frigate nicholas it was the 63rd such convoy this 
year and the 85th since the reflagging began in july 1987

spokesman for metra the chicagoarea commuter rail agency that 
buys service from campnw 
all the trains are running on time knapton said 
fridays evening rush hour was disrupted by a oneday strike of 
the 2600 members of the united transportation union the strike

service to resume 
the campnw serves about 41000 commuters in suburban chicago and 
has freight operations in 10 states 
railroad officials were forced to scramble to put together train 
crews because about half the campnw conductors failed to report for

a windwhipped fire that destroyed 
13 homes and burned pleasure boats on a lake forced residents of 
this affluent gold rush country town to evacuate a second time 
today 
the fire was fanned by 30 mph gusts and fueled by droughtdry 
bush wood roofs and propane tanks which exploded like small bombs 
said state department of forestry spokesman charlie jakobs flames 
destroyed 20 to 30 structures including 13 homes 
the fire laid down a little during the night but picked up 
this morning he said of the blaze in the sierra nevada foothills 
more than 1220 federal state and local firefighters were on 
the fire lines today in one of californias most scenic and 
historic areas jakobs said 
residents of this mountain town of 4500 people 45 miles 
northeast of sacramento and the tiny town of rough and ready were 
evacuated sunday and highway 49 was closed 
they were allowed to begin returning home this morning but were 
ordered evacuated again later 
nevada county officials declared a state of emergency 
initiating a process to make the county eligible for more state and 
federal assistance 
most schools in the area were closed thick smoke made it unsafe 
to operate school buses and the red cross needed some schools for 
evacuation centers 
a firefighter suffered minor hand burns when flames engulfed his 
bulldozer forcing him to wrap himself in an asbestos blanket and 
take refuge under his vehicle 
meanwhile a new fire broke out less than a half mile from the 
main blaze and burned 700 acres by early today said erin connelly 
spokeswoman for the us forest service she estimated the overall 
acreage at 12000 
the main fire which began sunday morning along highway 49 about 
30 miles northwest of nevada city was apparently caused by an 
illegal burn of debris said us forest service spokeswoman ann 
dow 
before their evacuation weary sootsmeared homeowners used 
chain saws and hoses in an effort to keep the fire from spreading 
were ready to leave if we have to but until then well stay 
and help out resident gary hultquist 41 said sunday night as 
he helped hose down a neighbors burning house everything you 
got could go up in flames 
some made sure families and animals were safe then returned to 
battle the blaze after nightfall as hot spots glowed in the hills 
nobody expected it to come in fast like this said mike 
fitzgerald 38 said as he cut down a large smoldering tree in his 
yard 
he looked sadly at a neighbors house that had caught fire and 
burned as flames hopscotched through the area 
god what a heartache it wasnt that nice a house it was 
just a house but it was their home fitzgerald said 
firefighter bernie paul 31 suffered hand burns after fire 
swept over his bulldozer 
i thought i was done for more than once paul said it 
feels good to be alive 
the fire burned southwest straddling highway 29 and crossing 
the south fork of the yuba river 
when it reached lake wildwood it skipped through the community 
burning yards and oak trees between large houses some valued at 1 
million 
in some places flames reached the lake igniting marina 
railings several boats and a dock or platform in the water 
its scary it started a long ways away but came in in a 
snap said hultquist snapping his fingers 
many homes on the north side of the lake were saved partly 
because firefighters or residents hosed them down some of the 
fleeing homeowners who formed a slow fivemilelong line of 
traffic out of the area left sprinklers running in yards or on 
roofs 
evacuees were taken to several schools and other temporary 
shelters in nevada city and grass valley both about 10 miles east 
of lake wildwood pets and livestock were transported to the nevada 
county fairgrounds in nevada city state department of forestry 
spokesman paul alford said 
firefighters on sunday were hampered by steep terrain 
temperatures in the upper 80s and 40mph gusts 
the wind is our biggest enemy out here today jakobs said 
we had a solid front of fire about a halfmile long moving at a 
rapid rate through dense brush and timber 
the wind drove smoke and ash into downtown sacramento 
the fire also knocked out power to about 10000 customers 
pacific gas and electric co said

michael dukakis promised a foreign policy 
today that would restore respect for american leadership in a 
changing world and declared that republican rival george bush had 
failed in combating trade deficits terrorism and drug trafficking 
the democratic nominee began a threeday campaign trip focusing 
on national security defense and foreign affairs three areas in 
which he has vulnerable to attack by his republican rival 
his aides said dukakis planned to deal with ussoviet 
relations in chicago on tuesday and with military policy in 
washington on wednesday 
in a speech today at a union hall in philadelphia the 
massachusetts governor said his three key points would be a strong 
domestic economy that would bolster the us position in world 
trade unwavering opposition to terrorism and an expanded effort to 
halt international drug trafficking 
in each of these three areas george bush has failed 
dukakis said in prepared remarks i want to beat our foreign 
competitors hes willing to settle for second best i want to 
crack down on terrorism he knuckled under to the ayatollah i want 
a real war on drugs his answer to drug kingpins like noriega is j 
danforth quayle 
dukakis criticized bushs role in a long list of reagan 
administration policies ranging from the irancontra affair to 
cutbacks in federal funds for state and local drug programs and 
support for gen manuel noriega the panamanian leader who is under 
us indictment for alleged drug trafficking 
why havent you explained to the american people to our 
parents and children to our law enforcement officers and to 
victims of drugrelated crimes why the united states government 
had general noriega on its payroll dukakis asked 
what kind of judgment is this dukakis asked what kind of 
priorities are these what kind of strategy for restoring respect 
for america and protecting our national security can we expect from 
mr bush my friends we need answers and we need better 
leadership from the next president than we are going to get from 
george bush 
he accused the reagan administration of yielding control of 
americas economic future to bankers in tokyo and bonn he 
promised to enforce the new trade law encourage better 
labormanagement relations and help business invest in new 
technology and research 
the primary foreign policy objective of the dukakis 
administration can be stated very simply to restore respect for 
american leadership in a changing world dukakis said 
he promised a strong military a growing economy and strong 
and decisive leadership that understands and knows how to cope with 
change 
from philadelphia dukakis was heading to ohio to visit a 
general electric plant in cincinnati which builds jet engines for 
the stealth bomber which dukakis supports 
the three states on the governors current campaign swing 
account for 72 electoral college votes or more than a quarter of 
the 270 votes needed to elect the next president 
during the weekend dukakis met with democratic congressional 
experts on defense matters to prepare for his trip after their 
sunday meeting they criticized president reagan for vetoing a 
defense spending bill that won broad bipartisan support in 
congress and had the backing of several administration officials 
what you see here is an example of the way were going to make 
national security policy beginning in january 1989 dukakis said 
with a president and a congress that work together 
dukakis and the congressmen accused reagan of vetoing the bill 
to give gop nominee george bush fodder for his attempts to 
characterize dukakis as naive on defense issues 
the vice presidents political team said lets play political 
football with the nations defense said former presidential 
candidate sen albert gore jr of tennessee i think its 
outrageous 
among those at dukakis side were sen sam nunn of georgia and 
rep les aspin of wisconsin chairmen of the senate and house armed 
services committees respectively 
nunn aspin and several others at the meeting agreed that bush 
has been successful in painting dukakis as weak on defense but said 
they expected the democratic nominee to counter those efforts 
successfully this week

shivering firefighters 
rejoiced as snow eased their battle against blazes that have 
blackened more than 1 million acres but a forecast for warm dry 
weather kept them on guard 
i just love it it means we might get to go home earlier 
firefighter john massey said sunday as snow dusted much of 
yellowstone national park 
three to 4 inches fell in areas south of mammoth hot springs 
humidity was as high as 90 percent and temperatures in the mid30s 
combined with winds of up to 30 mph for a wind chill index of 19 
degrees 
things for the short term are better here park spokeswoman 
amy vanderbilt said 
were more optimistic this morning than we have been for some 
weeks said bill baden forest service director at the 
interagency fire center in boise idaho in an interview today on 
cbs this morning the center coordinates forest fire fighting 
nationwide 
in the sierra nevada foothills of california a windwhipped 
fire that began sunday charred 12000 acres of brush and timber 
destroyed 13 homes and seven to 17 other structures and forced 
residents of lake wildwood calif a town of 4500 to evacuate 
today for a second time 
about 1200 firefighters fought the blaze today in the historic 
gold rush country said california department of forestry spokesman 
charlie jakobs at one point flames engulfed a bulldozer forcing 
its operator to wrap himself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge 
under his vehicle he suffered minor burns 
light snow and low temperatures also helped firefighters in 
idaho and rain and cooler weather slowed fires in colorado 
in northwest oregon officials closed millions of acres of 
stateprotected forests in an effort to curb the number of fires 
caused by human carelessness 
in montana crews took advantage of the cool weather to carve 
lines around a forest fire north of yellowstone and another that 
has scorched more than 30000 acres in and around glacier national 
park near the canadian border 
at glacier two firefighters were injured when a tree fell 
across the back of an open truck carrying crews to a 30400acre 
fire officials said 
at yellowstone the light snow had firefighters shivering around 
propane heaters sunday night fire managers joked thatfears before 
the weekend of another black saturday when fires on saturday 
aug 20 sent blazes roaring across 150000 acres melted when 
white sunday arrived 
firefighters were pulled off the lines sunday when the chill set 
in 
our hoses were freezing up as fast as we put them out said 
wayne jones a fire crew chief from bushnell fla 
todays forecast was almost as good as sundays weather a 
chance of rain or snow temperatures no higher than the 50s and 
light winds 
but by tuesday a drying trend is expected with temperatures 
climbing back into the 60s and 70s 
in five or six days we could be back in a more severe weather 
situation baden said 
firefighters took advantage of sundays good weather to shore up 
their defenses against the wildfires which have blackened about 
900000 of yellowstones 22 million acres since june in what 
firefighters call the worst fire season in the west in 30 years 
the weather allowed park officials to reopen the west entrance 
and the road from there to old faithful and madison junction north 
of the famed geyser the rest of the park remained closed to 
visitors 
residents of park headquarters at mammoth were allowed to return 
home but were told to be ready for another evacuation if flames 
from a 263400acre fire threatens the area again 
a 328100acre fire in the parks northeast quadrant expanded 
significantly combining with an 87500acre fire but weather 
conditions helped firefighting crews enabling them to attack the 
blaze directly 
lower temperatures raise humidity and the moisture is soaked up 
by tinderdry trees said joe halliday chief naturalist for 
yellowstones west district 
the wood will be less likely to burn although the fire 
shouldnt have much trouble halliday said 
basically with this cold front thats moved in its going to 
put us kind of in a holding pattern said park spokeswoman marty 
tobias 
cabinet officials who toured yellowstone national park over the 
weekend on president reagans orders said the fires must be 
extinguished and said the policy of letting naturally ignited 
wildfires in national parks and wilderness areas burn unless they 
threaten property or people hasnt worked 
the most important thing is to concentrate our efforts on 
getting these fires under control and then out interior 
secretary donald hodel said sunday at the boise interagency fire 
center in idaho which coordinates western firefighting efforts 
the old policy has to be reviewed and altered hodel said 
nobody who has seen it operate this year could say it was a 
success 
hodel was accompanied by agriculture secretary richard lyng and 
deputy defense secretary william h taft iv 
taft said two marine battalions 1200 men from camp 
pendleton calif and two additional army battalions would be sent 
to help fight fires about 2300 army soldiers from fort lewis 
wash have already been dispatched

pope john paul ii preached peace and 
reconciliation monday during an openair mass in matabeleland a 
province where tribal warfare ended only four months ago 
no more training for war the 68yearold pontiff told 
50000 people at ascot horse track in bulawayo the provincial 
capital 
hammer swords into plowshares spears into sickles and nation 
will not lift sword against nation he said 
john paul who is on the first leg of a fivenation 10day 
pilgrimage to southern africa flew to bulawayo from harare 
he was welcomed at the track by bishops in cassocks and african 
drummers dancers and singers dressed in animal skins the pope was 
met at bulawayos heavily guarded airport by joshua nkomo former 
rival of president robert mugabe and now a senior minister in the 
socialist government 
in december nkomo and mugabe signed an accord that merged their 
feuding political parties as a result nearly eight years of 
fighting between armed dissidents loyal to nkomo and government 
troops in matabeleland ended in may 
john paul speaking in english latin and the two main african 
languages of the shona and ndebele tribes lamented that the 
minority ndebele people of matabeleland did not find peace after 
independence from britain april 18 1980 
but he prayed that their newfound peace and reconciliation would 
hold 
it is only eight years since your struggle for national 
independence was brought to an end the pontiff said from a 
redcarpeted rostrum festooned with lilies even after that many 
people in matabeleland did not find true peace the civilian 
population continued to suffer from guerrilla warfare and other 
forms of violence 
before the mass john paul was introduced by swissborn 
matabeleland bishop henry karlen who in 1984 accused troops of 
committing atrocities against the ndebele traditional foes of 
mugabes dominant shona tribe mugabe denounced karlen at the time 
for fabricating the charge and siding with terrorists 
among hundreds of civilians slain in the conflict were 10 
catholic missionaries one of whom was killed on april 19 just 
hours after mugabe announced a general amnesty for rebels as part 
of the accord 
the people of matabeleland have suffered much during the 
liberation war karlen said referring to the sevenyear 
guerrilla war led by separate armies under nkomo and mugabe against 
white minority rule matabeleland continued to suffer after 
independence through drought and violence he added 
the blood of 10 missionary martyrs of the diocese of bulawayo 
has flowed into the soil karlen said may this blood bear 
abundant fruit 
the popes visit to matabeleland came four months after 113 
dissidents left their bush hideouts under the amnesty and there 
have been no reports of rebelrelated violence since then 
under the accord nkomos zimbabwe african peoples union made 
up of the ndebele tribe and mugabes governing zimbabwe african 
national union backed by the shona people will formally merge 
under one banner as a prelude to establishing a oneparty state in 
zimbabwe 
john paul will leave harare on tuesday for neighboring botswana 
the next stop on his pilgrimage through blackruled states 
neighboring racially troubled south africa before returning to the 
vatican the pope will also visit lesotho swaziland and mozambique

winds and torrential rain moved over this capital city today after 
skirting puerto rico haiti and the dominican republic 
there were no immediate reports of casualties telephone 
communications were affected 
right now its actually moving over jamaica said bob 
sheets director of the national hurricane center in miami weve 
already had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip 
it looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that 
island and theyre going to bear the full brunt of this powerful 
hurricane sheets said 
forecasters say gilbert was expected to lash jamaica throughout 
the day and was on track to later strike the cayman islands a 
small british dependency northwest of jamaica 
meanwhile havana radio reported today that 25000 people were 
evacuated from guantanamo province on cubas southeastern coast as 
strong winds fanning out from gilbert began brushing the island 
all jamaicabound flights were canceled at miami international 
airport while flights from grand cayman the main island of the 
threeisland chain arrived packed with frightened travelers 
people were running around in the main lobby of our hotel on 
grand cayman like chickens with their heads cut off said one 
vacationer who was returning home to california through miami 
hurricane warnings were posted for the cayman islands cuba and 
haiti warnings were discontinued for the dominican republic 
all interests in the western caribbean should continue to 
monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane the service 
said adding little change in strength is expected for the next 
several hours as the hurricane moves westward over jamaica 
the associated press caribbean headquarters in san juan puerto 
rico was unable to get phone calls through to kingston where high 
winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital 
overnight toppling trees causing local flooding and littering 
streets with branches 
most jamaicans stayed home boarding up windows in preparation 
for the hurricane some companies broadcast appeals for technicians 
and electricians to report to work 
the weather bureau predicted gilberts center 140 miles 
southeast of kingston before dawn would pass south of kingston and 
hit the southern parish of clarendon 
flash flood warnings were issued for the parishes of portland on 
the northeast and st mary on the north the north coast tourist 
region from montego bay on the west and ocho rios on the east far 
from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains was 
expected only to receive heavy rain 
officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the 
south coast to seek higher ground 
its certainly one of the larger systems weve seen in the 
caribbean for a long time said hal gerrish forecaster at the 
national hurricane center 
forecasters at the center said the eye of gilbert was 140 miles 
southeast of kingston at dawn today maximum sustained winds were 
near 110 mph with tropicalstorm force winds extending up to 250 
miles to the north and 100 miles to the south 
prime minister edward seaga of jamaica alerted all government 
agencies saying sunday night hurricane gilbert appears to be a 
real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and 
hurricane precautions issued by the office of disaster preparedness 
in order to minimize the danger 
forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it 
passed over the ocean after it dumped 5 to 10 inches of rain on the 
dominican republic and haiti which share the island of hispaniola 
we should know within about 72 hours whether its going to be 
a major threat to the united states said martin nelson another 
meteorologist at the center its moving at about 17 mph to the 
west and normally hurricanes take a northward turn after they pass 
central cuba 
cubas official prensa latina news agency said a state of alert 
was declared at midday in the cuban provinces of guantanamo 
holguin santiago de cuba and granma 
in the report from havana received in mexico city prensa latina 
said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on 
national radio and television recommending emergency measures and 
providing information on the storm 
heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused 
flooding in the dominican republic on sunday night as the 
hurricanes center passed just south of the barahona peninsula 
then less than 100 miles from neighboring haiti 
the storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal areas 
of southwestern puerto rico after reaching hurricane strength off 
the islands southeast saturday night 
flights were canceled sunday in the dominican republic where 
civil defense director eugenio cabral reported some flooding in 
parts of the capital of santo domingo and power outages there and

last 24 hours many got the disease by drinking water contaminated 
by raw sewage and flood waters 
a senior doctor who declined to be identified said about 5 
percent of the diarrhea patients have contracted cholera 
president hussain muhammad ershad said the 280 million in aid 
so far promised to his country was not enough even to rebuild roads 
washed away by flood waters that cover threefourths of the country 
he said it was too early to estimate the total amount of funds 
needed 
for centuries the people of bangladesh have lived with floods 
but never before have the rivers unleashed such fury on her 
people the 59yearold former army general told a news 
conference 
the government puts the official death toll at 881 from the 
floods which started june 13 and reached new heights in late 
august the health control center said 138 deaths were from 
diarrhea while the others were caused by drownings houses 
collapsing and snake bites 
daily tallies in dhaka newspapers however put the death toll 
at 1647 without giving a breakdown by category 
a substantial amount of emergency flood relief arrived monday in 
a giant us military cargo plane 
the c5a galaxy contained water purification units water 
storage tanks and 10000 fivegallon water containers 
the plane also brought the deputy us aid director jay f 
morris and doctors from the centers for disease control in 
atlanta water purification specialists and defense department 
transport and logistics specialists 
the international center for diarrheal disease research funded 
primarily by foreign aid said it had admitted 550 patients with 
diarrhea in the past 24 hours compared with an average of 155 
patients a day last month 
the senior doctor who reported the cholera problem said it was 
typical that 5 percent of the diarrhea cases would turn out to be 
cholera 
dhaka newspapers also have reported isolated cholera cases from 
people drinking floodpolluted water 
ershad who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and later 
was elected to the presidency in what his opponents called a rigged 
vote said there are only 8000 doctors in bangladesh a nation of 
110 million people he said 30 million to 40 million people were 
marooned by the flood or in need of help 
he also said the flood had destroyed or damaged 8 million 
houses since the average size of a family in banglasesh is six 
people that would appear to mean that 48 million are homeless up 
from the 25 million reported previously 
 
the flood control center said major rivers were receding monday 
in the north and west but rising slightly in the south as flood 
waters approached the bay of bengal 
the ganges river which enters bangladesh from india fell by 
threefourths of an inch at the western monitoring station of 
gualnanda but remained 19 inches above flood level at the southern 
monitoring station of bhagakul the ganges rose onethird of an 
inch to about 30 inches above flood stage 
ershad said 53 of the countrys 64 districts have been affected 
by the flood 
the united states pledged about 154 million worth of aid to 
bangladesh for flood relief but a large portion of this was 
already in the pipeline to bangladesh and is being released early 
for example the allocation of aid included 60 million in food 
grains already planned for release in the coming 12 months 
embassy officials speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
were unable to say how much of the 154 million of aid was actually 
new before the flood the united states had allotted about 131 
million worth of aid to bangladesh which is one of the worlds 
largest aid recipients 
aid promised to bangladesh by foreign donors before the flood 
stood at 2 billion for the current year

democrat michael dukakis declared today that george bush has 
failed in three critical foreign policy tests while republican 
bush took a new shot at dukakis on military policy 
bush also defended frederic v malek his adviser who abruptly 
left a top republican party post sunday after a news story saying 
he counted the number of jews in a federal agency for 
thenpresident nixon in 1971 
dukakis in philadelphia said the three key points of his 
national security policy would be a solid domestic economy making 
the united states strong in international trade unwavering 
opposition to terrorism and a steppedup effort to halt 
international drug trafficking 
in each of these three areas george bush has failed 
dukakis told a crowd of about 250 people in a union hall i want 
to beat our foreign competitors hes willing to settle for second 
best i want to crack down on terrorism he knuckled under to the 
ayatollah i want a real war on drugs his answer to drug kingpins 
like noriega is j danforth quayle 
general manuel antonio noriega is the panamanian leader charged 
in us federal court with drug violations quayle is bushs vice 
presidential running mate 
bush meanwhile said in washington that dukakis would lean on 
international organizations too much rather than take action as the 
reagan administration did in grenada in attacking libya and in 
escorting ships through the persian gulf 
we cannot abdicate our responsibility for leadership bush 
said in washington before leaving on a campaign trip to new jersey 
the midwest and california 
at a street rally in the heavily cuban neighborhood of union 
city nj where he was preceded by salsa music and chants of 
viva bush the vice president declared that america has 
economic power and im not going to let them take it away from 
you 
bush was introduced by gov thomas h kean who struck an 
emotional nerve among the cuban exiles when he said that every 
time a dictatorship has threatened democracy george bush has been 
there 
bush also named a 13member national security panel including 
former secretaries of state henry a kissinger and alexander haig 
as well as zbigniew brzezinski who was former president carters 
national security adviser 
brzezinski said he was proud to have served carter a democrat 
but of the two current presidential candidates republican bush is 
the one who can best fashion an effective bipartisan foreign 
policy 
bush was asked by reporters about malek who resigned as deputy 
chairman of the republican national committee after a report sunday 
in the washington post that he compiled figures on the number of 
jews in highranking positions in the bureau of labor statistics 
during the nixon administration 
i know this man and i know him to be without one ounce of 
bigotry or prejudice in his makeup bush said 
notes that are part of the presidential archives refer to 
nixons search for a jewish cabal that he thought was using 
unemployment data to put him in an unfavorable light malek 
acknowledged compiling the figures but said he thought nixons 
notions were nonsense and that he had nothing to do with 
subsequent demotion of two jewish officials in the bureau 
the report was the second in a week suggesting that people 
connected with the bush campaign engaged in activities that were 
either overtly antisemitic or could be construed that way 
malek who was nixons personnel chief at the time issued a 
statement with the announcement of his resignation sunday saying he 
didnt want publicity about his actions for nixon to jeopardize the 
bush campaign 
the resignation deprives bush at least temporarily of direct 
control over the national party during the fall campaign 
maleks resignation followed the departure last week of jerome 
brentar as cochairman of bushs campaign organization for ethnic 
groups brentar a cleveland travel agent had been an active 
defender of ohio autoworker john demjanjuk who was extradited and 
convicted in israel of being a nazi war criminal 
last week the washington jewish week newspaper reported that 
brentar was active in groups that denied the existence of the 
holocaust and that he had made antisemitic statements the report 
named several members of bushs ethnic coalition who had ties to 
fascistic and antisemitic groups 
what at first seemed to be a few unsettling errors in judgment 
in the bush campaign now seems to be growing into a pattern of 
astonishing insensitivity that is totally inappropriate for an 
american presidential campaign rep charles e schumer dny 
said sunday in a statement 
dukakis who has taken a more aggressive stance in recent days 
spoke sunday with congressional leaders in boston about his image 
on national security and foreign policy issues and promised to 
restate my positions forcefully this week 
among the nearly dozen members of congress who attended the 
meeting were sen sam nunn of georgia chairman of the senate armed 
services committee rep les aspin of wisconsin nunns counterpart 
in the house and former presidential candidate sen albert gore 
jr of tennessee 
dukakis acknowledged after the meeting that he had some 
differences with leading defense spokesmen of his party most of 
whom are more hardline but promised a consensusoriented approach 
to setting pentagon priorities 
what you see here is an example of the way were going to make 
national security policy beginning in january 1989 dukakis said 
with a president and a congress that work together 
dukakis has undergone repeated criticism from the bush campaign 
which claims he seeks unilateral disarmament and last week 
dukakis appeared to change his position on star wars which he 
previously described as a fantasy by saying he would support 
research on the spacebased defense program

a former janitor has fought for nearly nine 
years since his acquittal on rape charges to get his old job back 
at the university of pittsburgh and to get a speedy resolution of 
his case in state courts 
the guys going to be dead and buried by the time this is 
resolved attorney robert kane said 
arthur robinson 62 was fired from his janitors job on aug 
10 1979 after a woman charged that he raped her two months 
earlier 
robinson who had no criminal record was acquitted in december 
1979 but he was not given his job back even though he had worked 
at the university for 14 years 
he sued charging his firing was unjustified he also filed a 
complaint with the city human relations commission charging the 
university with race discrimination robinson is black 
a common pleas court jury in 1982 ordered robinsons 
reinstatement and awarded him nearly 125000 after the university 
appealed robinson settled the case in 1985 for 15000 and 
attorneys fees 
meanwhile the city human relations commission ordered 
robinsons reinstatement with back pay in march 1984 
the university appealed that decision too but common pleas 
court officials apparently lost robinsons file delaying a trial 
until december 1987 when judge robert a doyle affirmed the 
commissions ruling 
the university appealed again to commonwealth court on jan 8 
commonwealth court officials failed to get doyle to forward 
robinsons files until last friday when a judge from that court 
ordered doyle to send the information 
robert prorok attorney for the university said the case has 
been appealed because there was no racial discrimination against 
robinson 
the universitys basis for discharging robinson was an 
investigation that in their judgment concluded that he committed 
the rape we sincerely believe that race had absolutely nothing to 
do with his dismissal he said 
the fact that someone is acquitted in a criminal case doesnt 
necessarily mean he didnt commit the crime prorok said 
robinsons wife odessa said her husband hasnt worked since 
1979 he said the family has lived on social security welfare a 
small pension and a newspaper route 
i believe god in his own time will clear this up she said 
but it looks as if somebody somewhere came between us and the 
lord

rumors of devil worship and child abduction 
have spread like wildfire across a large section of eastern 
kentucky stumping police who have fielded thousands of telephone 
calls from terrified residents 
this is the first time to my knowledge that a rumor of this 
nature has gotten to this proportion said elijah hollon a 
laurel county sheriffs deputy this one seems like its carrying 
on much more than anything ive ever seen before 
it got wild here jackson mayor frank noble said you 
could have brought a bunch of guns in here and made a fortune he 
said he understood that one department store had sold out of guns 
a survey of sheriffs offices police departments and kentucky 
state police posts found satanic rumors have spread into at least 
25 eastern kentucky counties since late july 
in most cases the rumors hold that satan worshipers are looking 
for blond blueeyed children to kill in a sacrifice to the devil 
some versions say the satanic followers must round up several 
children to sacrifice before halloween 
all the law enforcement officials surveyed last week said they 
believed the stories were false most agencies reported 
investigating and finding no supporting evidence 
hollon and other officers said they believed the stories started 
in breathitt county where a grave robbery was discovered july 18 
two juveniles and four adults were charged in connection with the 
grave desecration 
noble who also is jacksons police chief said officers found a 
pentacle or fivepointed star on the floor of a mobile home the 
defendants are alleged to have used for satanic ceremonies the 
words satan rules were inscribed outside a circle around the 
star symbol he said 
at each point of the star officers discovered a drop of what 
was believed to be blood noble said videotapes and books on the 
occult were confiscated from the trailer on aug 15 he said 
many residents wrongly believed that police were withholding 
information about the grave robbery and possible satanic 
connections noble said 
at first we couldnt even calm people down he said until 
we got the trailer we couldnt come right out and say they were 
devil worshiping

a longlost sketch in pen and ink 
owned by george washington has been placed in the first presidents 
mount vernon estate after a man found it among the belongings of an 
elderly neighbor 
chester norback 85 a former appliance salesman said in 1975 
he noticed an old sketch in a neighbors home in killingworth 
which is 20 miles east of new haven the sketch about 20 by 16 
inches is of a huge stone prison being demolished 
the neighbor allen carswell acquired the sketch about 40 years 
earlier from a brooklyn ny warehouse norwell said 
norback said carswells wife dorothy showed him a 1958 new 
york times clipping that included a photograph of the sketch the 
caption said the sketch was entitled destruction of the 
bastille and explained that it was a gift from lafayette to 
washington 
the sketchs whereabouts had been unknown since its sale at 
auction in 1891 the story said 
norback said that in 1984 when dorothy carswell had been a 
widow for five years she gave norback power of attorney handed 
him the key to her home and asked him to help her into a nursing 
home 
norback found the sketch and hid it under his bed 
a month later mrs carswell died for a period of time there 
wasnt a person in the world but myself who knew about that 
picture norback said 
norback sent a note to mount vernon saying in part if you 
are still searching for this picture i think i can help you 
christine meadows mount vernons curator called norback almost 
immediately 
mrs carswell bequeathed her 400000 estate to the shriners 
hospitals for crippled children and to the masonic charity 
foundation of connecticut 
the charities at first expected to keep the sketch appraised at 
20000 but a letter norback sent each together with mount 
vernons interest and the necessary legal releases moved both 
organizations to loan the treasure to the virginia estate 
that painting belonged to mount vernon and the country

concerned about having the device in his office 
the way i look at it its been sitting around being used as a 
doorstop for maybe 40 years or more and nothing has happened yet 
he said 
personnel from fort mccoy picked up the device and brought it to 
the southern wisconsin fort 
mary binder public affairs officer at fort mccoy said monday 
it was destroyed at the fort she said it was a world war ii navy 
antiaircraft projectile 
asked if the device could have exploded during the years it 
served as a doorstop she said it was designed to be shot from 
aircraft and several things had to be done to it before it would go 
off 
but she noted the device still had explosives in it and things 
have been known to go off

processors handling the alligators killed 
in floridas first gator season in two decades say they are working 
overtime to keep up with successful hunters 
weve been working until 2 or 3 in the morning every night 
said kenneth geiger who runs one of 29 facilities in florida that 
skin and butcher alligators theyre stacking up like cordwood 
less than halfway through the monthlong hunt which began sept 
1 and was authorized because of the proliferation of the 
alligators several hunters are near the quota of 15 each the hunt 
is monitored by the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
but the 238 licensed hunters are not required to file records until 
two weeks after the hunt ends 
we wont know anything about numbers until after the 
harvest said scott ball public information specialist with the 
commission we kept a tally the first day and we counted at 
least 131 gators 
if each hunter bags the quota 3450 alligators will be killed 
the commission has estimated about 2600 alligators would be killed 
weve been going literally 24 hours a day said go parrot 
a processor near bushnell weve probably done about 50 or 60 
since the season started 
it takes us about an hour a foot and weve done 200 feet of 
gator and boxed 750 pounds of meat said barry holdridge the 
chief processor at hooks alligator product in davie if every 
hunter gets their quota we will be up to our eyes in gator 
a licensed processor will sometimes buy the whole alligator for 
30 to 50 a foot other hunters pay a processing fee and get back 
the meat and hide

a san francisco stock analyst who began 
giving gifts to his ozark hometown almost two years ago with the 
donation of a 3 million trust has delivered another bonanza 
david delarue last week gave bolivar 300000 to put toward 
development of a civic center and new city hall 
bolivar mayor joe lemmon said the gift came so unexpectedly that 
no plans were drawn up yet for the civic center but he said 
104000 was spent thursday to buy property for the new center the 
rest of the money will be used to build the civic center after 
matching funds are raised 
a civic center has been discussed here for years but we 
havent had the funds lemmon said 
in december 1986 delarue established a 3 million trust fund 
that he said was a gesture of thanks to the community where he grew 
up 
the trust benefits the city polk county and various public 
agencies recipients received an initial interest payment of 
150000 this year and expect to receive annual payments of 
240000 until 2100 when the principal will be given to the city 
delarue said he keeps track of what is going on in bolivar 
through old friends who still live in the town of about 6000 
people 30 miles north of springfield 
he said he learned about two weeks ago that a 22acre plot of 
land near the central square was available through an estate sale 
and immediately thought of buying it for the city 
there was no planning delarue said monday in a telephone 
interview from his san francisco home its probably the citys 
last chance to find such a nice piece of property close to 
downtown i mainly thought they needed a community hall or 
community center 
the mayor was delighted we never know what to expect from 
delarue he said we love it

attendance at the sixteenth street 
baptist church has declined dramatically in the 25 years since 
dynamite killed four black girls but the pastor says its 
membership is worldwide in spirit 
sixteenth street is not a local church sept 15 1963 made 
sure of that said the rev james e young it is in the truest 
sense the peoples church 
the church which is marking the 25th anniversary of the bombing 
this week nearly filled its 1500 seats regularly in the 1940s and 
1950s and became a rallying point for civil rights demonstrators 
who filled it in the 1960s 
now it has about 100 members the church has suffered common 
urban church problems such as members moving away from downtown 
at sundays service which opened the weeks anniversary 
observance program the balcony was empty as were many pews on the 
main floor and visitors outnumbered members when asked to stand 
that didnt look so good as far as the church itself was 
concerned said james l lowe a deacon and member of the church 
for 60 years lowe who plays the clarinet and saxophone is the 
lone member of the church orchestra which once had 20 musicians 
lowe said the churchs role during the civil rights movement 
while making it a landmark did not please all the members 
we suffered a great deal because we had so many threats coming 
into the church said lowe 
the church was formed in 1873 and the building designed by a 
black architect and built by a black contractor was erected in 
1906 the bombing heavily damaged the basement area where the girls 
were killed but the damage was not as severe elsewhere in the 
building a white man robert edward chambliss was convicted of 
murder in the explosion 
young said the media coverage of the 25th anniversary may help 
bring more people to the church 
our hope is that there will be some benefits to the whole 
community including members of sixteenth street baptist church 
he said 
we are hoping that we will get the attendance up said 
william m parker chairman of the churchs board of trustees and a 
member since 1965 that would help us a lot

that show could live it was a decision widely expected i met with 
the staff on friday afternoon nbc news president michael g 
gartner said monday 
for gartner a newspaper editor and executive who took over as 
head of the news division in july it was a quick introduction to 
the realities of television programming 
sure its hard he said youd much rather be meeting with 
the staff and launching something rather than killing something 
but the show didnt have the support of advertisers didnt have 
the support of affiliates and didnt have support of the audience 
as i told somebody one out of three would have been nice 
gartner said he now has sort of finished the process of 
layoffs that began after last years efficiency appraisal the 
layoffs have involved approximately 400 news division employees

a solid majority of political challengers but 
less than onethird of incumbents say television and radio stations 
should be required to give house and senate candidates free air 
time says a report on the role of media in congressional campaigns 
the report by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics 
said a requirement that included more time for debates would make 
an overall lid on campaign spending much more palatable even to 
incumbents 
beyond the 30second spot was based on a survey of 141 house 
and 40 senate incumbents and challengers who ran in 1986 they were 
asked how they used electronic media and how they might want to 
change the laws affecting political broadcasting 
half of the 181 candidates surveyed spent more money on 
commercial television than on direct mail radio or newspaper ads 
only 127 percent of the candidates tried to buy air time longer 
than 30 or 60 seconds 
among incumbents 295 percent favored requiring broadcasters to 
provide free media time while 609 percent of challengers 
supported the idea some 40 percent of the incumbents and 75 
percent of the challengers said any free media arrangement should 
include mandated debate time for congressional candidates 
if congress were to pass a free media requirement the center 
found 549 percent of those surveyed said they would accept a 
limit on overall campaign spending that included 48 percent of the 
incumbents running for reelection 
based on these and other findings the center made a number of 
recommendations aimed at providing free and lowercost media 
exposure to senate and house candidates 
no one of these changes can entirely replace the ubiquitous 
30second commercial or drastically reduce the cost of 
campaigns the study said but taken together the center 
believes that these proposals would make significant contributions 
to the american electoral system 
first and foremost the center said congress should require 
television stations to run two hours of special programming about 
house races and two hours about senate races each election season 
programs would have to be at least five minutes long the time 
could be turned over to candidates or the stations could produce 
the material themselves no station would have to cover all the 
elections in its market 
the center also recommended that the equal opportunities rule 
which forces broadcasters to give competing candidates comparable 
air time be changed to apply to only major party and strong 
thirdparty candidates 
if one candidate declines to debate the center said under some 
circumstances the other should be given air time alone without 
triggering equaltime rules 
in addition the center recommended that candidates receive 30 
percent discounts on air time that cannot be preempted by 
higherpaying advertisers this was prompted by findings that 
although candidates are entitled by law to discount rates they 
arent using them 
candidates are inclined to pay higher rates to ensure that 
their ads are not preempted the study said overall 542 
percent of candidates preferred to purchase higher priced 
nonpreemptible advertising time rather than lower cost 
preemptible time

lt gov sb woo claimed victory today 
in delawares democratic senate primary saying state officials had 
discovered vote counting errors that he says reversed the results 
of the election 
challenger samuel beard had been declared the winner of 
saturdays primary woo had conceded the race 
paul t hart adminsitrative director of the department of 
elections for new castle county said today a keypunch operator 
made a mistake that gave beard 2800 more votes than he received 
when this correction is made woo will instead win by six 
votes woo said in a press release 
but hart said i have no idea who is ahead 
the unofficial tally had given beard 22418 votes to woos 
19624 the revised results would give beard only 19618 votes to 
woos 19624 
the final numbers however could change because votes from nine 
precincts still must be counted woo also said he believes 
additional absentee ballots will be counted 
i have no idea how it happened but i am satisfied in my own 
mind that it was human error hart said today 
beard campaign manager nathan siegel had no comment 
sam doesnt think it is appropriate until the results are 
completed he said sam wants to have the most accurate and 
clear count there is 
the vote discrepancy came in the 23rd representative district in 
new castle county where there about 280 registered democrats in 
that district however beards total was tallied at 2828 votes 
when he actually received only 28 votes elections officials said 
a recount is expected 
the new castle county board of elections meets tonight to count 
ballots from the nine precincts new castle county includes the 
city of wilmington 
the winner of the primary will run against incumbent sen 
william roth jr rdel in the november general election 
woo had conceded the race saturday night saying i always said 
it was a tough way to earn a living 
woo a 51yearold physics professor at the university of 
delaware was elected lieutenant governor four years ago in his 
first bid for elected office 
the lieutenant governor who will leave his post in january had 
been considered a shooin for reelection but chose instead to run 
for the senate 
beard had been heavily outspent by woo a native of shanghai 
china who enjoyed the financial backing of chineseamericans from 
across the nation 
beard 49 had the backing of most democratic organization 
leaders and labor 
beard who has served as chairman for job creation commissions 
under the last four presidents said his experience in public 
service helped in the campaign 
the senate race was the only statewide competition on the 
ballot roth seeking a fourth sixyear term is running unopposed

many eastford residents consider 
themselves country folks so town officials decided they could cope 
with the bull that came out of the closet 
a castiron bull on a weather vane was hidden in a closet for 
more than 15 years because one official thought it looked too much 
like well a bull an anatomically correct bull 
first selectman james whitehouse found the weather vane last 
spring and had it mounted on the town office building 
this is country not the middle of the city whitehouse said 
officials say robert p willis chairman of the committee in 
charge of building a new town hall in 1969 chided the contractor 
for not including a free weather vane 
in due time a package arrived and was found to contain the 
indicator but a member of the board of selectmen took one look and 
said oh thats just too too much edwin w cooper 90 wrote 
recently in a local newspaper 
the unidentified selectman who no longer lives in connecticut 
thought the weather vane would offend some people said cooper who 
retired this summer as the selectmens clerk 
he thought it was too explicit cooper said up close 
its very apparent its a bull 
so the bull went into the closet

your grandmother always knew chicken soup 
could cure a lot of ills and now holyoke hospital is set to take 
grandmas place 
lowsodium lowfat frozen chicken noodle and vegetable beef 
soups were a natural outgrowth of the hospitals 2yearold frozen 
meal program for patients on restricted diets said patrick 
ascolese food services manager 
when we started we figured we would be satisfied if we were 
able to sell 400 meals a month ascolese said now we are 
selling 400 meals a week and we have some customers that drive more 
than 100 miles oneway just to buy them 
many commercial canned or dried soups contain hundreds of 
milligrams of sodium holyoke hospitals frozen just what the 
doctor ordered soup contains just 22 milligrams ascolese said 
the typical restricted diet for a patient with high blood 
pressure or heart trouble limits sodium intake to 1000 milligrams 
a day so if they have a bowl of commercial soup for lunch they 
have pretty much used up the sodium allotment for the day 
hospitals in miami and san francisco also have soups on their 
takeout menus 
holyoke began testmarketing its soup monday soups are packaged 
in 7ounce microwaveable containers that sell for 65 cents apiece 
the takeout food program was initially aimed at recently 
released patients on restricted diets but customers also have 
included the elderly and younger people trying to lose weight or 
avoid preservatives ascolese said

who had visited the university ms harris estimated at least 200 
more people will be sickened by rubeola measles 
its generally four times as high as the initial outbreak

people were advised not to go on campus until they have been 
immunized

immunizations for the illness were first started are generally 
considered to be immune to rubeola measles 
the disease strikes victims at first with a red rash that begins 
on the face and chest and persists for about three days the 
disease can be fatal according to the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
there were four people who died last year in the united states

scientists say a device that releases lime into 
streams to combat the effect of acid rain appears to be reducing 
acidity for two to three miles downstream 
the question that remains is whether more fish eggs will survive 
if we can improve streams for several years we can allow the 
remnant species to improve or at least to maintain itself dr 
ronald klauda a johns hopkins university senior fisheries 
biologist told the baltimore sun in a story published monday 
this spring hopkins scientists began testing the idea of adding 
lime to neutralize acid rain in maryland streams 
the idea was an extension of work done in the northeast and 
canada where government officials have fought acid rain by liming 
acidic lakes but buffering running water in a stream requires a 
new technology one on which experiments have just begun in this 
country 
if followup tests to the hopkins work prove conclusive the 
scientists say liming could be a temporary solution to streams 
affected greatly by increased acidity 
the device is called a lime doser a large round concrete 
structure that perches on the edge of a stream 
when it rains the doser sends measured amounts of a calcium and 
water mixture into the stream making the stream more hospitable 
for fish 
two lime dosers were placed in maryland streams in 1986 they 
were computerpowered and cost about 40000 each too expensive 
for maryland to use in great numbers 
but the new lime doser placed on stocketts run in the patuxent 
river is a new design that doesnt rely on a computer this 
version costing 10000 to 15000 is the first to be put in a 
stream in the united states klauda said 
in some cases the fish larvae below the doser had a 
significantly higher survival rate but in other cases it was only 
marginally better klauda said 
we dont know if they make a clearcut difference in the 
survival of eggs and larvae he said 
it might well turn out that for a few key streams still in 
good shape or for streams that are trying to be restored this 
approach would work said michael hirshfield director of the 
chesapeake bay research and monitoring division of the maryland 
department of natural resources which helped fund klaudas 
research with living lakes a notforprofit group funded by 
utility companies 
a survey last year found that at least 10 percent of the states 
rivers have acid levels that kill fish larvae under laboratory 
conditions

around the city this summer and miles of beaches in new york and 
new jersey were closed for days after needles and other forms of 
waste washed up 
last week the first doctor was arrested in manhattan on charges 
of improperly disposing of medical waste 
the growing problem of illegally disposed of medical waste

smoke from the forest fires in yellowstone national park has 
drifted as far as the east coast turning sunsets a fiery red and 
even affecting the weather 
the setting sun had a kind of an eerie appearance said 
allan morrison of the national weather service in chicago about 
1200 miles east of the fires the hazy smoke made the sun look 
like a big glowing red ball it was a very red color which 
made it spectacular in that regard 
the smoke was trapped in an upper atmospheric trough about 
15000 to 20000 feet up and was carried by wind over the great 
lakes toward the east coast and out to sea said meteorologist joe 
harrison of the weather service in new york city 
the thin layer of smoke passed over the new york area sunday 
dimming the sun to a reddishorange and lowering temperatures 
between 5 and 10 degrees harrison said 
the only effect were having is its interfering with the 
radiation of the sun said robert a armbrust an airquality 
engineer with the new york state department of environmental 
conservation 
boston still had a thin transparent layer of haze monday said 
weather service meteorologist tom emerson 
usually smoke from large fires is dispersed and is not 
noticeable so far away harrison said 
because the smoke was so high up the smell was not noticeable 
on the ground and it did not contribute to air pollution he added 
pilots reported seeing the smoke layer over chicago when they 
climbed to cruising altitudes of 30000 and 40000 feet but no 
visibility problems were reported 
however visibility was a problem closer to the fires in 
western south dakota about 400 miles east of the blazes 
visibility has been as low as half a mile and foresters warned 
that would hinder detection of local forest fires 
most of the smoke over chicago cleared out over the weekend when 
a front moved in morrison said 
this should be the end of it at least for now harrison 
said in new york 
its a strange phenomenon he added it happens 
occasionally with volcanoes they spew smoke and it gets trapped in 
a particular layer of the atmosphere and it can go all around the 
globe

support of the protesters and the military said it would shoot 
demonstrators spreading a report that two armed forces commanders 
had threatened to join the protest 
gen saw maung burmas defense minister and armed forces chief 
of staff said in a nationwide broadcast monday night that the 
public and military should support the governments plan to 
supervise multiparty elections soon

demonstrate freely to avoid possible misunderstandings amidst 
various attempts to discredit the armed forces by way of spreading 
false rumors propaganda and exaggerations 
many thousands of studentled demonstrators marched through the 
capital shouting demands for an interim government and multiparty 
democracy at least five separate groups were counted and 
estimates of the total number of protesters ranged from 10000 to 
more than 100000

transition to democracy 
opposition leaders aung gyi former defense minister tin oo and 
aung san suu kyi listed their demands in a letter to maung maung a 
copy was given to the associated press the government did not 
immediately respond to the letter 
none of the opposition leaders have specified who should be in 
the interim government saying only it should comprise people 
outside the ruling burma socialist program party and who are 
acceptable to all the people they also have not said if they 
would be willing to serve in a transitional government 
since the government has lost the confidence of the nation 
people will have no confidence in the general elections to be held 
by the governmentappointed election supervision commission it 
said 
we therefore demand the immediate formation of an interim 
government to rebuild the economy revive the administrative 
machinery reestablish democracy and hold general elections it

government 
but on saturday he bowed to weeks of nationwide protests and 
announced that the ruling party would relinquish its 26year

the fast which last 36 hours ended monday night 
staterun radio rangoon said demonstrators were spreading false 
rumors that two senior commanders threatened to attack government 
buildings if authorities did not agree by tuesday to form an 
interim government 
the threat was contained in unsigned mimeographed leaflets 
distributed in rangoon that purportedly were issued by the navys 
vice chief rear adm maung maung khin and the air forces vice 
chief maj gen tin tun 
this evening false propaganda was spread through the 
distribution of leaflets by cars and through announcements by 
loudspeakers on the main streets of rangoon city the broadcast 
said 
the defense forces can no longer tolerate this and will open

police said monday they were baffled by 
the disappearance of a 7yearold girl who was discovered missing 
from her bedroom saturday 
authorities were trying to determine whether jaclyn dowaliby was 
abducted by a relative kidnapped or had met with foul play 
police said it was unlikely that she ran away 
jaclyn was last seen about 11 pm friday when her mother 
cindy checked her bedroom the girls adoptive father david 
dowaliby discovered her missing at about 8 am the next morning 
when he checked her bedroom police said dowaliby also discovered a 
basement window in the house was broken and the front door of the 
home was ajar 
we havent ruled out anything at this time because weve just 
got a lot of unanswered questions said capt john bittin of the 
police force in this suburb south of chicago 
bittin added the fact that there was nothing disturbed in the 
house no signs of violent struggle nobody heard anything that 
brings to mind questions bittin said 
he said the case differs from a typical kidnapping theyre 
not a wealthy family there havent been any calls or notes asking 
for ransom he said 
meanwhile fbi agents have determined that the girls imprisoned 
father had nothing to do with the disappearance 
james guess the childs natural father was questioned sunday 
by fbi agents in florida where he is in prison and expressed 
shock about jaclyns disappearance bittin said 
he was totally shocked he was totally unaware of anything 
that had happened bittin said based on statements from guess 
the fbi has decided that he had nothing to do with it the 
captain said 
bittin said he did not know why guess was imprisoned a 
spokesman for the fbi did not immediately return telephone calls 
fbi agents planned interviews monday with relatives of the 
natural father 
also monday local and state police continued their footsearch 
in wooded areas near the girls home a canine unit was used to 
search a nearby field but found no clues 
he said there was no reason to suspect foul play other than 
the fact that we havent been able to locate her unfortunately 
the possibilty is always there for that but we dont have any 
proof one way or the other 
jaclyn was described by police as being about 4 feet tall and 
weighing about 60 pounds she has shoulderlength brown hair and

city councilman hosea williams need not be 
suspended from office over his weapons indictment since the charge 
does not involve his performance in office a special panel 
reported monday to the governor 
gov joe frank harris appointed the panel last month after 
williams indictment on a felony weapons charge which stemmed from 
an incident in march at hartsfield atlanta international airport 
security officers found a handgun in williams briefcase as he 
passed through a checkpoint the charge was later made a felony 
after williams was cited as a habitual violator he has a string of 
traffic violations 
a 1984 state law provides for the governor to appoint a 
threemember panel to investigate the cases of public officials 
under indictment the panel recommends whether suspension from 
office is in order 
attorney general michael bowers previously said such a panel was 
not required in williams case since his indictment did not 
involve his official duties but harris disagreed 
the panel composed of bowers augusta city councilman gerald 
woods and columbus city councilman aj mcclung voted unanimously 
monday against recommending that harris suspend williams 
bowers said the panel found the indictment did not relate to 
or adversely impact the administration of his office or the 
rights and interests of the public 
williams a veteran civil rights activist has said he routinely 
carries a gun for protection he explained the airport incident by 
saying he had removed the gun from his car and put it in his 
briefcase then forgot to leave it behind before heading for his 
flight 
at the time williams was cited and allowed to make his plane 
clayton county officers later arrested williams on the felony 
charge

the air 
the national weather service reported heavy damage to kingstons

the conspiracy trial of former beauty queen bess 
myerson doesnt begin until wednesday but the rush to get press 
credentials for the highly publicized divorcefixing case began 
early monday very early 
william cohen a researcher for the los angeles times showed up 
at 2 am and found two guys already on line outside the courthouse 
the early birds recent graduates from dartmouth and columbia 
were holding a place for a reporter for the magazine vanity fair 
said cohen 
it was actually very funny said cohen himself a recent 
columbia graduate there we were in the middle of the night 
three ivy league grads standing around telling jokes and waiting to 
get in 
within hours they were joined by a dozen more placeholders 
sketch artists reporters and writers seeking the 19 remaining 
seats allotted to the news media in the tiny courtroom where the 
trial will be held 
none of us slept well for two days over the weekend worrying 
about it said richard tomlinson a courtroom artist for wnywtv 
who got to the federal courthouse in lower manhattan at 445 am 
the trip downtown turned into a nightmare for tomlinson who got 
stuck at an unattended subway exit that wasnt supposed to open 
until 7 am eventually two subway workers came out of the dark 
with lanterns and freed him 
the object of the news media anxiety is what may be one of new 
yorks most sensational criminal trials in years 
miss myerson a former miss america and onetime city cultural 
affairs commissioner is charged with giving a city job to the 
daughter of the judge presiding over her boyfriends divorce in a 
bid to lighten his alimony and child support load 
jury selection is to begin wednesday for the trial of miss 
myerson her boyfriend carl andy capasso and the divorce 
judge former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 
the three are charged with mail fraud and conspiracy for an 
alleged scheme to fix capassos 1985 divorce miss myerson also is 
charged with obstruction of justice 
seating is limited because no large courtroom was available at 
the 31story federal courthouse 
the larger courtrooms had already been scheduled months in 
advance for other trials explained clifford p kirsch the chief 
nonjudicial administrator of the courthouse 
despite an informal request by reporters to find something 
bigger us district judge john keenan elected to stay in his 
regular courtroom which only seats about 50 spectators 
kirsch set aside about 30 seats for the news media 11 for the 
resident courthouse press corps and the remaining 19 for artists 
and reporters on a firstcome firstserved basis 
the judge made a combination of such strictures that it was 
designed to limit all but the most determined complained daily 
news artist joe papin the fourth artist on line who arrived at 6 
am 
there were seats for six artists and ruth pollack of wpixtv 
was the seventh artist on line 
however because i got there seconds after the sixth artist 
and i was the last artist on line officials made an exception 
and gave her a pass 
all of the passes were handed out by 9 am 
out of luck and on the growing waiting list were such news 
organizations as usa today cable news network and national public 
radio

been laid here that will help the united states and the world 
respond to this threat said stafford who chaired the 
environment committee when republicans controlled the senate from 
1981 to 1987

procommunist record the oakland tribune reported monday 
the newspaper said the fbi had furnished it with 231 pages of 
files on burton some of them heavily censored and withheld nearly 
400 pages in response to a freedom of information act request 
submitted 27 months ago 
burton represented san francisco in the state assembly from 1956 
until his election to the us house in 1964 and remained a 
congressman until his death in 1983 the fbi files cover 1953 to 
1971 the tribune said 
among other things the files show that the fbi tried to block 
appointment of a burton aide as san francisco postmaster kept 
director j edgar hoover informed of details of burtons 
activities and compiled unflattering information about the 
congressmans family the newspaper said 
fbi spokesman bill carter said monday he was unaware of the 
files and could not comment but said the fbi has since come under 
new guidelines 
now if a member of congress has committed or is conspiring to 
commit some violation of the law certainly we would have an 
investigation but not otherwise carter said 
assemblyman john burton the congressmans brother said he had 
not seen the files but called the report more proof of hoovers 
paranoia he used to see communists under his bed 
the files say johnson inquired about burtons background in 1964 
and was sent a series of documents from the fbi the next year the 
documents referred repeatedly to burtons association with the 
national lawyers guild and criticized his attempt to scrap 
loyalty oaths for lawmakers and his opposition to the house 
unamerican activities committee the tribune said 
also in 1964 burton traveled to mississippi to observe the 
search for three missing civil rights workers later found murdered 
thenassistant fbi director cartha deloach recommended that agents 
on the scene receive burton politely but tell him nothing about the 
investigation the newspaper said 
a december 1965 memo from the fbis san francisco field office 
recommended that in light of burtons very questionable 
background hoover oppose appointment of the congressmans 
administrative assistant lim p lee as san franciscos postmaster 
the field office urged that damaging information on lee be 
forwarded to the white house lee was appointed however and 
served as postmaster for 14 years 
the dossier also cites instances in which burton criticized 
statements by hoover 
after hoover in 1969 called the rev martin luther king jr 
the most notorious liar in america burton approached the fbis 
chief san francisco agent at a party in a very belligerent 
manner and said hoovers statement had been offbase the 
agent said in a memo to hoover 
also in 1969 the files quote burton attacking as disparaging to 
chineseamericans a statement by hoover that some chineseamericans 
would assist red china in supplying needed material for 
espionage or promoting red chinese propaganda 
an unnamed fbi official said in a report that burton was a 
longtime apologist for communist china and recommended that the 
fbi set him straight about the communist menace

vice president george bush won endorsements 
monday from former national security advisers to presidents nixon 
ford and carter as he assembled a bipartisan team of advisers on 
foreign policy and defense issues 
zbigniew brzezinski the most prominent democrat on the 
13member panel told reporters he was proud to have served carter 
but said bush rather than democratic nominee michael dukakis 
can best fashion an effective bipartisan foreign policy 
said brzezinski he is not a novice in that critical area of 
public policy on which our national survival depends 
bush took the occasion to accuse dukakis of tending to rely on 
the united nations and other international bodies to resolve 
foreign crises we cannot abdicate our responsibility for 
leadership he said 
the panel also includes henry kissinger national security 
adviser to nixon and secretary of state under ford and brent 
scowcroft who was fords national security adviser 
others named to the largely republican panel were former 
secretary of state alexander haig former ambassador anne 
armstrong former white house chief of staff howard baker melvin 
laird and donald rumsfeld former secretaries of defense sens 
jesse helms rnc nancy kassebaum rkan and richard lugar 
rind former sen john tower rtexas and retired adm elmo r 
zumwalt jr former chief of naval operations 
brzezinskis endorsement of bush was not unexpected said 
mark gearan a spokesman at dukakis campaign headquarters in boston 
we will be watching to see whether mr brzezinski will be 
drafting speeches for george bush on the foreign policy of jimmy 
carter said gearan alluding to repeated gop attacks on carters 
tenure 
on monday dukakis delivered the first of three major campaign 
speeches this week that are intended to counter republican 
allegations that he is weak on defense and naive about foreign 
affairs 
the primary foreign policy objective of the dukakis 
administration can be stated very simply to restore respect for 
american leadership in a changing world dukakis told a campaign 
rally in philadelphia 
he accused bush of failed leadership in combating terrorism 
drug trafficking and us deficits in world trade 
dukakis has no formal advisory panel of national security 
experts for his campaign madeleine albright has been his chief 
foreign affairs adviser for the past year 
in addition to ms albright who served in the carter white 
house and is a professor at georgetown university dukakis receives 
advice on those issues from sen sam nunn dga rep les aspin 
dwis and a trio from the kennedy school of government at harvard 
university they are joseph nye graham allison and albert 
carnesdale 
kissinger said in a statement he had read everything i could 
find on foreign and national security policy uttered by gov 
dukakis which is admittedly a skimpy body of work 
i am convinced that his views on national security are 
incompatible with a strong america his approach to eastwest 
relations would undermine our ability to move the soviet union 
toward more responsible behavior and his view of international 
affairs would keep us from shaping the new world decades of 
dedication have brought into view kissinger said 
scowcroft told the same news conference that dukakis is 
without experience in foreign affairs and his penchant for 
multilateral diplomacy fails to recognize the vital role of dynamic 
us leadership in moving regional conflicts toward resolutions 
compatible with us interests

prospects for this years grain harvest in the 
soviet union have deteriorated somewhat because of a drop in some 
yields the agriculture department said monday 
the soviet crop is now expected to produce about 205 million 
metric tons a reduction of 5 million tons from projections a month 
ago officials said the lowered estimate was based primarily on 
early yield results released by the soviets and on the sept 7 
disclosure on moscow television that the grain harvest would be 
less than expected 
reduced production estimates included barley 475 million tons 
down 3 million tons from the august forecast rye 165 million 
tons down 1 million and oats 165 million down 1 million 
the soviet union also is expected to boost grain imports further 
to about 27 million tons in 198889 an increase of 2 million tons 
from indications last month but still short of the 32 million tons 
imported in 198788 
over the past month numerous reports have been received of 
ussr grain purchases breaking the lull in soviet grain buying 
activity that had prevailed since last spring the report said 
the bulk of the recent purchases have been coarse grains such as 
corn although reports have also indicated wheat sales by some of 
the major suppliers

president pw botha of south africa 
on his first summitlevel mission into black africa met monday 
with leaders of mozambiques marxist government which has blamed 
much of its woes on bothas nation 
president joaquim chissano of mozambique shook hands with botha 
at an airfield welcoming ceremony then took him on a tour by jeep 
of the nearby cahora bassa hydroelectric project before a twohour 
meeting 
afterward botha said he invited chissano to visit south africa 
and the two leaders issued a joint communique affirming their 
support for regional cooperation they said committees would be 
formed to deal with issues such as trade economic development and 
migrant labor 
south africa has signed an agreement to help rehabilitate the 
cahora bassa project in the northwestern province of tete the 
power line leading to south africa from the dam near songo has been 
sabotaged repeatedly by guerrillas which mozambique claims are 
aided by bothas security forces 
chissano said botha gave assurances that south africa was not 
helping the rebels 
botha was to go to malawi later for talks tuesday with president 
hastings kamuzu banda malawi is the only african state that has 
full diplomatic ties with south africa 
under apartheid south africas 5 million whites have 
established a racially segregated society and the 26 million blacks 
have no vote in national affairs 
botha and chissano were to discuss a mutual nonaggression 
treaty signed by their countries in 1984 
the treaty lapsed in 1985 when mozambique produced evidence that 
south africa violated the agreement by continuing to assist the 
mozambique national resistance or renamo that guerrilla movement 
began an insurgency two years after mozambique won independence 
from portugal in 1975 
the civil war combined with drought has left millions of 
mozambicans homeless and hungry 
many western governments including the united states have 
increased aid to mozambique and support its claim that the rebels 
receive covert logistical and communications aid from south africa 
south africa insists it no longer helps the rebels and botha 
was expected to attempt to persuade chissano to mute the 
allegations 
botha was accompanied on his trip by his defense minister gen 
magnus malan and foreign minister pik botha chissanos delegation 
which left the capital of maputo for songo early today included 
three cabinet ministers and two military commanders according to 
the mozambican news agency aim 
as part of an effort to improve its regional image south africa 
has in the past year expanded its trade mission in maputo and 
pursued economic development possibilities in mozambique 
the two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at 
rehabilitating the cahora bassa project in tete so south africa can 
purchase power 
the rebels repeatedly have sabotaged power lines leading from 
cahora bassa to south africa 
even when their relations were badly strained mozambique and 
south africa maintained extensive ties tens of thousands of 
mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in south africa 
and maputos electricity is supplied by south africa 
during his 10 years in power botha has had few chances to 
travel in black africa in 1986 he was one of numerous dignitaries 
who attended the coronation of swazilands king mswati iii and in 
1987 he made a secret visit to south african troops fighting in 
angola 
he had hoped to visit brazzaville congo earlier this year in 
conjunction with peace talks on angola and southwest africa or 
namibia but angolas cuban allies reportedly threatened to scuttle 
the talks if he came

a minister went on trial monday on 
charges of beheading a handyman and burning down his church in an 
alleged attempt to assume a new identity and disappear with 50000 
in church money 
jury selection is expected to take most of the week in the 
firstdegree murder and arson trial of the rev john david terry 
who faces the death penalty if convicted 
terry may take the witness stand to break his yearlong silence 
in the decapitation of james c matheny 
the slaying and fire on june 15 1987 at emmanuel church of 
christ pentecostal oneness stunned terrys parishioners some have 
stuck by him since mathenys body was found rolled up in a scorched 
carpet 
two days before this happened we would have given him our last 
dime said marsha brown 30 who with others in the 40member 
congregation has been attending weekly services in a borrowed 
building in nearby gallatin i dont feel personally betrayed 
more let down than anything else 
about half the members have stopped attending services she said 
im sad for him i guess im a little bitter but you have to 
keep the love of god no matter what said marlane mcclanahan 35 
who has not been attending services held by the current pastor the 
rev wayne cole 
mrs brown mrs mcclanahan and other church members said terry 
43 was wellliked and respected during his nearly 20 years as 
their preacher terry had befriended matheny who was the 
exhusband of a church member and had been in trouble with the law 
police initially thought it was terrys body firefighters 
discovered in the carpet because terrys belt and other articles of 
clothing were found on the body the head and lower part of the 
right arm had been severed with butcherlike precision and matheny 
initially was suspected of killing terry until medical examiners 
identified the body 
terry who had worked parttime as a supermarket butcher to earn 
extra money showed up at his lawyers office two days after the 
fire his lawyers have since turned over to authorities a map of a 
marina where they said the head and arm could be found though a 
search begun last week was halted sunday after divers came up 
emptyhanded 
the divers cant see anything they can only feel its zero 
visibiliy in lake barkley said stewart county sheriff david 
hicks 
a birth certificate drivers license post office box and the 
title to a motorcycle like the one seen whizzing away from the fire 
have turned up in the name of a man dead since 1951 court 
documents show terrys picture was on the drivers license that 
bore the dead mans name 
neither terrys lawyer nor the prosecution would discuss details 
the case terry is not charged in connection with the money taken 
from the church 
teresa matheny 32 was divorced from the victim but said the 
two were close to a reconciliation mrs matheny who lives in 
nashville stopped attending church services soon after her 
husbands body was found 
i loved him very much she said 
mrs matheny said the slaying and arrest of terry have been 
difficult for the 4yearold son she and matheny had its been 
real hard for him to understand she said 
members of the denomination formed in the early 1930s believe in 
faith healing and sometimes practice such rituals as foot washing 
and talking in tongues 
terrys former parishioners are looking ahead to the 
thanksgiving opening of a new church under construction on the 
other side of town from their old meeting place 
he was a friend said virginia howard 63 another church 
member we had known him since he was a boy our children and he 
grew up together there wasnt anything ever bad about the boy he 
just did good things were amazed that someone weve known and 
never knew anything bad against is guilty of this

israel is seeking diplomatic immunity for 47 
staff members of its military procurement office in new york but 
has been unable to win state department consent after months of 
intermittent talks us officials said monday 
the officials said the office has been investigated for 
involvement in two cases of illegal export of american military 
technology but they could not confirm a published report that the 
justice department and the fbi oppose the israeli request because 
of law enforcement considerations 
according to the officials who insisted on anonymity majority 
sentiment at the state department appeared to be in support of the 
israeli request 
they said that members of an egyptian military procurement 
office in washington have been given diplomatic immunity and they 
noted that an egyptian military officer who worked at the office 
was arrested by us authorities earlier this year in an alleged 
plot to smuggle missile components to egypt 
the officer was freed after claiming diplomatic immunity and has 
since returned to egypt 
israel is seeking a limited form of diplomatic immunity known as 
consular immunity for the 47 israelis in new york this would 
provide protection only for activities directly connected to a 
persons official functions not for all crimes 
but according to officials quoted in mondays editions of the 
washington post this would be sufficient to shield from us 
prosecution a foreign national suspected of involvement in the 
illegal export of us military technology 
responding to the post story alon liel the israeli foreign 
ministry spokesman in jerusalem said israel has been trying for 18 
months to get diplomatic status for dozens of israeli 
representatives of various ministries including defense economics 
and tourism 
liel said so far washington has refused because these officials 
are not working out of the israeli embassy in washington 
we are not only speaking about the guys in the military 
purchasing office liel said it also includes people from the 
ministries of tourism and economics these people have been sent 
over by the state of israel and they are not given full diplomatic 
status its a matter of principle 
according to to post the israeli request poses legal and 
diplomatic problems about how the us government should deal 
with purchasing office employees suspected of seeking to smuggle 
american military technology out of the country 
the post said the fbi and the justice department are opposed to 
the israeli request 
the newspaper said the justice department in july 1986 sought to 
investigate eight israelis in new york suspected of the illegal 
export of machinery needed to manufacture cluster bombs the 
department concluded last spring that it lacked sufficient evidence 
for criminal prosecution 
another case last november involved a connecticut company that 
paid fines of 750000 for violating us export laws by smuggling 
equipment and technology to israel for the manufacture of 
chromeplated cannon barrels the post said the exact role of the 
israeli purchasing office was never made clear

some exhibits in the childrens section of the 
lincoln park zoo are so flawed youngsters cant even see the 
animals despite a 25 million renovation zoo officials said 
the main problems are in the new outdoor otter and raccoon 
exhibits where a naturallooking rock wall was built as a safety 
barrier to separate the children from the animals said edward 
uhlir director of engineering for the district 
none of the kids can see over the boulders said susan 
fisheryellen who recently took her 3yearold daughter to the zoo 
i saw 20 or 30 kids climbing on those boulders ms 
fisheryellen said 
no question there are sightline problems for little kids 
said zoo director lester fisher im 6foot1 i can look in but 
if i were 4 feet i couldnt you just had to get down on your 
knees and know this isnt workable 
zoo officials want the architectural firm that designed the 
exhibits hammond beeby amp babka to correct the problems 
the architects said the plans were approved by the park 
district which owns and operates the zoo and by the lincoln park 
zoological society a private nonprofit group that helped fund 
the renovation 
neither the architects nor the zoo knew how much the changes 
would cost

legislation is on its way to president reagan 
providing money to buy the last privately held land on a texas 
island that is a wintering ground for the worlds only surviving 
flock of whooping cranes that breeds in the wild 
the interior department appropriations bill passed last week by 
congress provides 55 million for the purchase of 5017 acres at 
the southern tip of matagorda island officials say 
the purchase will be the governments third and final 
acquisition from the texas nature conservancy bringing the 
federally owned tract on the gulf coast barrier island to 11502 
acres 
with the growth of the flock over the past four decades the 
whooping cranes have had to search for new wintering grounds away 
from their traditional winter home on nearby aransas national 
wildlife refuge 
bruce thompson in charge of texas nongame and endangered 
species program said as many as 150 whooping cranes are expected 
to make the journey this fall from northwest territories canada 
to texas last year 132 cranes wintered around the aransas refuge 
with two others ending up elsewhere in texas 
another flock of about 20 cranes winters in new mexico and 
summers in idaho but thompson said those cranes have not yet 
reproduced in the wild a flock of about 40 is kept in captivity at 
the patuxent wildlife refuge in maryland

more than 500 federal savings institution 
regulators have been illegally exempted from government salary 
limits according to a congressional report released monday 
the general accounting office in a report for sen david pryor 
dark said employees of three subsidiaries of the federal home 
loan bank board are in fact federal employees and should be 
subject to civil service pay classifications the top civil service 
salary is 75500 a year 
the bank board which regulates the nations 3000 savings 
associations has set up the three subsidiaries since 1972 in two 
of the cases specifically to get around salary limits top 
executives of the subsidiaries are paid sixfigure salaries 
the office of regulatory activities was created in 1986 as the 
office of regulatory policy oversight and supervision or orpos 
to formulate regulations and to oversee sampl examiners that work for 
the 12 district federal home loan banks it has 146 employees 
the district banks serve as a central banking system for the 
savings and loan industry and are outside of the federal 
bureaucracy but the gao said regulatory office employees took over 
functions previously conducted by the board itself and should be 
considered part of the federal government 
a second subsidiary the federal asset disposition association 
was set up in 1985 to dispose of billions in dollars of loans and 
foreclosed real estate from failed sampls it is the largest of the 
three with 313 employees 
its president gerald p carmen is a former head of the general 
services administration which manages government property and a 
former political fund raiser for president reagan he is paid 
150000 a year 
the third entity the office of finance has 52 employees and 
was formed in 1972 to oversee the issuance of debt to fund the bank 
board and the district banks 
we believe the bank board acted improperly in creating orpos 
the office of finance and fada as entities whose employees are not 
subject to the salary limitations milton j socolar special 
assistant to the comptroller general said in a letter to pryor 
according to bank board officials the effects of forcing the 
three subsidiary agencies to abide by the salary caps is 
potentially devastating analysts in part blame the sampl industrys 
problems on the inability of the bank board in the early 1980s to 
pay enough to attract experienced examiners 
by placing the examiners outside of salary caps the bank board 
has been able to build up its staff in part by hiring examiners 
away from other banking agencies 
the report for pryor chairman of the federal services post 
office and civil service subcommittee of the senate governmental 
affairs committee is the latest blow against fada which has been 
criticized by members of congress as both too slow and too 
expensive 
banking legislation approved by the house banking committee 
earlier this summer would abolish fada forcing the bank boards 
insurance fund to reassume the disposition agencys 
responsibilities 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board said agency 
officials believe it will take court or congressional action to 
enforce the gao findings he contended that if the findings were 
enforced many of the employees would be hired away by big 
accounting firms and financial institutions 
we feel its important that we keep and retain these people to 
lose that kind of talent particularly in the regulatory area 
would be devastating he said 
hoyle said about a dozen of the 500 employees in the three 
subsidiaries are paid more than the top salary within the federal 
civil service 
pryor in a statement released with the report also complained 
that the three subsidiary agencies are exempt from federal conflict 
of interest and procurement rules 
something is drastically wrong we have created a 
monstrous bureaucracy with almost no oversight by the congress 
he said these officials dont seem to have to comply with 
federal conflict of interest laws or federal salary caps yet they 
have the decision of life or death over hundreds of these 
institutions

schools public buildings and 
factories closed monday across argentina as the 35millionmember 
organized labor movement held a 24hour strike 
the strike set to end at midnight was called to protest police 
actions at an antigovernment rally friday in front of government 
house in which 113 people including 37 policemen were injured 
government officials said the police moved in friday to stop 
fighting between rival union groups labor leaders denied that and 
accused the police of brutality 
mondays strike was the 13th organized by the general labor 
confederation since the elected government of president raul 
alfonsin was installed in december 1983 ending nearly eight years 
of military rule 
the union federation had rejected a government request to call 
off the strike and alfonsins centrist administration pledged over 
the weekend to protect anyone who wanted to work monday 
no violence was reported 
guards were posted at public buildings supervisors ran the 
subways in buenos aires and owners of taxis and innercity buses 
were encouraged to take shifts behind the wheel when most drivers 
failed to show up for work 
the general labor confederation backed by the opposition 
peronist party organized last fridays rally and an 8hour general 
strike to protest alfonsins economic policies 
inflation registered 440 percent over the last 12 months with 
unemployment and underemployment at a combined 14 percent near 
14year highs real personal incomes have declined for three 
straight years 
the labor federation claims that an antiinflation plan alfonsin 
implemented last month does not allow workers wages to keep pace 
with increases in the cost of living

the pilot of a twa jetliner 
hijacked by arab terrorists in 1985 testified monday that mohammed 
ali hamadi took pleasure in torturing the passengers and fired the 
shot that killed an american sailor 
capt john testrake who commanded the plane during the ordeal 
told the court he believed hamadi was the more violent of two 
hijackers who invaded the jetliners cabin and later killed robert 
stethem a us navy diver 
but under questioning by defense lawyers testrake said he did 
not actually see hamadi pull the trigger 
in a related development in lebanon shiite moslem kidnappers 
freed west german hostage rudolf cordes at midnight monday after 
declaring that they were ending his 20month ordeal in response to 
syrian and iranian intervention a lebanese government official 
said in beirut 
a statement purporting to come from cordes kidnappers said 
earlier that iran and president hazef assad of syria guaranteed 
that the problem of mohammed hamadi and his brother abbas also 
jailed in west germany on terrorist charges will be resolved 
abbas hamadi was convicted of complicity in kidnapping cordes 
and another west german in beirut to try to force the west german 
government to free his younger brother the other german alfred 
schmidt was released earlier 
mohammed hamadi is charged with murder and air piracy he has 
admitted being one of the hijackers but has denied killing 
stethem the athenstorome flight was hijacked june 14 1985 it 
was flown to beirut where stethem was killed and 39 americans 
were held hostage for 17 days 
testrake testified had testified earlier that either of two 
hijackers could have led stethem to a cabin door where he was shot 
but after a recess testrake told the court he had a chance to get 
a closer look at hamadi 
i want to make an important statement testrake said i 
did say before that one of the two hijackers appeared to do more 
of the communicating and the other more of the violence 
he said it appeared that one of the hijackers hamadi 
enjoyed beating the passengers more to inflict violence 
looking at this man now i was struck that this is the man 
who i recall had stood in the forward entry way and shot stethem 
asked if both hijackers had dragged stethem to the doorway 
testrake said it could have been but as i said before i am 
recalling from memory 
it was my recollection that the most violent of the two men 
was in the companionway i was in extreme stress and not taking 
notes of these details its only recollection he added 
the plane landed in beirut was refueled and flew to algiers 
it took on fuel and returned to beirut where stethem was slain and 
39 other passengers were taken off the boeing 747 and held hostage 
after the plane landed in beirut the second time testrake told 
the court one of the hijackers talked to the airport tower in 
arabic 
i could tell the hijacker was becoming more and more agitated 
he began screaming into the radio at this time he turned toward 
his accomplice and screamed what appeared to be an order the 
pilot said 
the forward cabin door was open i saw the other hijacker push 
stethem out the doorway then i heard a single shot testrake 
told the court 
after testrake finished his testimony the judge asked hamadi if 
he had anything to say he replied through an interpreter there 
are some things that are being lied about here he did not 
elaborate 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in 1987 after 
explosives were found in his luggage 
testrake said he first realized there was trouble aboard flight 
847 when he heard banging noises from behind the cockpit door 
shortly after the plane took off from athens there was knocking 
and also strong kicking at the door 
he said the copilot looked through a peephole in the cockpit 
door and exclaimed we have been hijacked testrake said 
copilot philip maresca of salt lake city saw a man brandishing a 
chromeplated pistol 
at that moment our purser called over the intercom and said 
they the passengers were being mishandled not wishing them to be 
mishandled i directed my flight engineer to open the door the 
pilot testified 
he said the men burst into the cockpit armed with the pistol and 
two hand grenades testrake said he was not beaten but that his 
flight engineer benjamin c zimmermann of cascade idaho was 
repeatedly struck with the pistol on the head and shoulders 
blood was coming from his head and from his shirt said 
testrake 
he said the hijackers continued to beat the engineer and 
passengers even after the hijackers demands to fly to beirut were 
met 
there was no reason for any of the beating because we were 
complying with their demands testrake told the court 
the pilot who lives in richmond mo said he believed the men 
had been trained well for the mission and that they were familiar 
with the cockpit 
last week two former hostages also told the court that the 
hijackers including hamadi brutally beat passengers before 
stethem was killed 
american kurt carlson testified that he believed hamadi was the 
leader of the hijackers because he was giving the orders 
carlson testified that he was also beaten by the hijackers

three mortar shells were fired monday at 
the parliament building deepening the crisis caused by the 
stalemate among christians moslems and leftists in selecting a new 
president 
hours later house speaker hussein husseini announced that 
legislators would be summoned to meet sept 22 for another attempt 
to elect a successor to christian president amin gemayel 
police said there were no casualties from three 60mm mortar 
shells that exploded at 645 am around the twostory parliament 
building known as villa mansour the building is in the nomans 
land between predominantly moslem west beirut and christian east 
beirut 
it was the first attack on villa mansour in two years 
police said one shell hit the entrance of villa mansour and the 
other two exploded near army and police checkpoints guarding 
approaches to the building 
they said no group claimed responsibility and they did not know 
if the attack was linked to the electoral deadlock 
rightwing christians and moslem and leftist factions backed by 
syria quickly blamed the others for the shelling 
legislators had met aug 18 in an attempt to elect a successor 
to gemayel whose sixyear term expires sept 23 but some 
christians boycotted the session and there was not a quorum 
meaning the selection could not proceed 
under the constitution the president cannot seek a second 
consecutive term 
the boycotting christians opposed the main candidate 
syrianbacked former president suleiman franjieh a maronite 
christian 
by tradition lebanons president is a christian the prime 
minister a sunni moslem and the speaker of the house a shiite 
moslem 
failure to elect a new president would leave a political vacuum 
that many fear could reignite the civil war that has been mostly 
dormant for 18 months 
it could not be determined if husseinis announcement of a new 
electoral session indicated an agreement between moslems and 
christians on a consensus candidate 
husseini said the sept 22 session will be held in the old 
parliament building in the moslem sectors battlescarred place de 
letoile 
legislators have used villa mansour for parliamentary sessions 
since they were forced out of the place de letoile in 1976 in the 
early days of the civil war 
husseini did not say if he changed the venue for the session 
because of mondays mortar attack 
the syrians continue to support franjieh 78 president from 
1970 to 1976 
raymond edde a maronite christian who has been living in 
selfimposed exile in paris since 1976 announced his candidacy 
shortly after husseini set the date for the new session 
parliament secretary ihsan abu khalil said edde announced his 
candidacy in a telephone call to husseini from paris 
edde 73 fled to france after three assassination attempts 
against him 
he has been the frontrunner among the two dozen presidential 
aspirants including franjieh in recent public opinion polls 
rightist christians claim that franjieh would turn lebanon into 
a syrian satellite 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 40000 
military personnel in eastern and northern provinces and west and 
south beirut 
franjiehs moslem and leftist backers say the united states and 
israel prevented his election because he advocates an unconditional 
withdrawal by the israelis from their selfdesignated security 
zone in southern lebanon 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 and established the buffer zone 
after withdrawing most of its army in 1985

the environmental protection agency must focus 
on preventing pollution instead of concentrating on cleaning up 
existing problems with an end of pipe strategy a report 
provided monday recommended 
to help carry through such a change the agencys research 
budget should be increased by about 375 million a year roughly 
doubled said a committee of the agencys science advisory board 
in the report 
the study was made available by agency officials monday after an 
article about it appeared in the boston globe 
the committee was responding to a request for advice from epa 
administrator lee m thomas who the report said sensed that 
epas immediate regulatory needs were driving its research and 
development efforts while longerterm research equally important 
to achieving epas overall risk reduction goals was being 
neglected 
al alm former deputy administrator of epa and chairman of the 
highlevel advisory committee said in an interview that thomas was 
correct 
the problem epa has is its spending most of its rampd dollars 
just putting out legislative fires alm said referring to 
research and development money one of its major problems is to 
look ahead to anticipate problems 
obviously you need technical support for the regulations but 
that has driven virtually all the longterm research away he 
said 
the report said that in the 1970s efforts to control 
automobile industrial and wastewater pollution using federally 
mandated endofpipe controls were sensible targeted relatively 
efficient and reasonably cost effective 
though cleanups have been predicated on the notion that the 
polluter pays and those controls will still be important 
strategy must change the report argued 
for one thing we are discovering environmental contamination 
in our homes eg radon and in the statosphere eg 
chlorofluorocarbons that are not emitted by pipes in the 
traditional sense the report said 
for another thing endofpipe control has too often shifted 
pollution from one place to another for example from water to air 
for toxic pollutants removed from sewage streams by aeration 
techniques 
whenever possible environmental protection efforts first 
should be aimed at minimizing the amount of wastes or pollutants 
generated thus waste reduction at its source for example 
through product design changes industrial process changes or 
material substitution should be a primary objective the report 
said 
alm said he believed many businesses would welcome a vigorous 
program of technology transfer led by epa a program to show 
them how their processes could be changed to generate less waste 
the private sector has an incentive through liability 
questions alm said 
to help keep the need for longterm research in view epa should 
convert the position of assistant administrator for research and 
development from a presidential appointment to a career job the 
report argued 
in the 18 years for epas existence no one has held the job for 
more than three years and no leader has stayed at the agency 
long enough to implement a sustained longterm research 
strategy it said 
ecological research should get more emphasis having taken a 
back seat to research to support regulations aimed at protecting 
human health the report said

an american engineer who was kidnapped in 
lebanon overpowered his captors and escaped to damascus on monday 
with the help of syrian troops lebanon radio and us officials 
said 
a source close to the foreign ministry confirmed the american 
was delivered to the us embassy but he said the engineer was 
rescued by syrian troops who found where he was being held in 
lebanon and overpowered the kidnappers 
the discrepencies in the reports could not immediately be 
reconciled 
all three reports said the engineer was abducted sunday by 
unidentified gunmen in east lebanon after he married a lebanese 
woman 
the us embassy in damascus refused to comment on the story 
but officials in washington identified the engineer as kenneth 
wells and said he works in saudi arabia for litton industries 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said wells 
was taken captive in lebanon as he was leaving his wedding 
reception they said his lebanese bride was detained briefly 
wells subdued his abductors after several hours reached a 
syrian army checkpoint and was escorted to damascus where he was 
turned over to a us embassy official the officials in washington 
said 
the officials said wells mother reportedly lives in tennessee 
according to one published report wells is 25 and his wife samia 
is 32 he is said to hold a black belt in karate 
state department spokesman charles redman who confirmed much of 
the account of wells experience expressed gratitude to syrian 
authorities for their assistance he said the episode underscores 
the dangers american citizens face in lebanon where nine americans 
are held hostage 
the voice of lebanon which is run by rightwing christian 
militias said the bridegroom who excels in karate subdued 
three gunmen who were armed with automatic rifles disarmed them 
and took refuge at a syrian army post the syrians then drove him 
to damascus the radio said the gunmen intercepted the newlyweds a 
few hours after the wedding the radio said 
the syrian source who also demanded anonymity said wells 
traveled to lebanon and married nadia haydar sharafeddine a girl 
whose family lives in baalbek he said wells was kidnapped after 
the wedding near his brides home 
after a long search syrian troops located the couple freed 
them from the gunmen and took them to damascus where foreign 
minister farouk alsharaa turned them over to us charge 
daffaires john craig the source said 
the sharafeddines are a wellknown shiite moslem family in 
baalbek a stronghold of the iranianbacked hezbollah 
hezbollah or party of god is an extremist shiite group that is 
believed to be an umbrella for various factions holding 18 foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
the hostage held the longest is terry a anderson 40 chief

kidnapped march 16 1985

the army and italian gunmaker beretta have 
reached an agreement to suspend deliveries of the militarys new 
9mm pistol for the next three months to deal with a problem of 
unexpected cracking in the guns slide mechanism the service said 
monday 
the latest halt to deliveries the second in nine months will 
last from september through december said lt col john reitz an 
army spokesman by january the army expects beretta to resume 
production and deliveries of the 9mm pistol after making 
modifications to the slide mechanism 
the delay in deliveries was worked out during a meeting aug 17 
between army and beretta officials with the company accepting the 
move at no cost to the government the spokesman said 
the army insisted on changes to the weapons manufacture after 
an incident in july in which a pistol slide cracked unexpectedly 
during training firings and sent fragments back toward the 
shooters chest it was the fourth such cracking incident over the 
past year 
beretta and the army have now agreed the metal pistol slides for 
the gun will have to be forged using an improved heat process to 
ensure their strength and the guns fitted with a device to capture 
any slide that does crack 
it was agreed that august production quantities would be 
accepted without the modified slide and components pending formal 
approval of the engineering change proposal said reitz 
deliveries with the new slide mechanism will resume in january 
1989 
the spokesman said beretta also had agreed to retrofit the 
pistols already delivered with the new mechanisms after completing 
its production run 
the company has so far delivered more than 140000 pistols of an 
order for 316000 
the army first stopped accepting deliveries of the handgun last 
november because of an unexpected cracking problem with the 
pistols frame beretta usa a subsidiary of the italian arms maker 
armi beretta spa subsequently devised a manufacturing solution to 
that problem earlier this year and resumed production 
in the meantime though the army had started investigating why 
slide bolts on the berettas were cracking the first such incident 
occurred late last year 
the latest decision to halt deliveries was reported monday by 
the trade publication defense week and subsequently confirmed 
by army officials 
the washington office of beretta declined immediate comment on 
the matter 
beretta usa which operates a manufacturing plant in accokeek 
md beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide 
9mm guns to replace the militarys venerable colt 45caliber 
pistol the army which has designated the pistol the m9 is 
serving as the executive buying agent for all the services and 
awarded beretta an initial contract worth 75 million 
the latest problems arise at a time when beretta has entered a 
congressionally ordered competition with the massachusetts gunmaker 
smith amp wesson and several other interested american gunmakers to 
supply the next batch of 9mm pistols 
the american firms had protested the 1985 award to a foreign 
company 
the slide bolt on the beretta is thrown backward after a shot is 
fired as part of the process of chambering a new round army 
officials disclosed last may that beretta had blamed the slide 
failures on the use of special ammunition but that the army was 
not prepared to accept that explanation

hugh hefner founder chairman and chief 
executive officer of playboy enterprises announced monday he wont 
run for reelection to the companys board of directors and is 
passing full command to his daughter 
the company said in a statement that christie hefner is expected 
to be elected to the posts her father holds at a board meeting nov 
10 set to follow playboys 1988 shareholders meeting 
ms hefner 35 now is the companys president chief operating 
officer and vice chairwoman 
i think in terms of the company overall it is a changing of 
the guard a sort of passing the reins along said playboy 
spokeswoman robyn radomski in terms of where the company is now 
its a logical step but hef is still going to be 
editorinchief of the magazine and be involved in major strategic 
decisions 
once ms hefner becomes playboys top board executive the 
companys 62yearold founder will hold the titles of chairman 
emeritus and editorinchief of playboy magazine the company said 
christie has had my full support since she took responsibility 
for the daytoday operations of the company in april of 1982 
hefner said in a statement during this period she has directed 
a restructuring program that has resulted in an overall return to 
profitability 
this change is just another evolutionary step consistent with 
my own personal plans but i do not intend to reduce my commitment 
of time and effort to the success of the company said hefner 
who mortgaged his furniture and invested 600 to publish the first 
issue of playboy in december 1953 
hefner playboys major stockholder is working on his 
autobiography for which the company said it will receive a 
substantial sevenfigure advance from bantam books inc 
ms hefner said in a statement that she would help to continue 
to build the playboy franchise by expanding our licensing and 
television and video buinesses 
the geographic reach of the company also will continue to be 
expanded with new markets such as india and eastern bloc countries 
opening up for playboylicensed products and foreign distribution 
of home video and television programs growing she said 
under ms hefners leadership playboy enterprises closed the 
last of its us key clubs and shed its interests in movie 
theaters modeling and book and record clubs playboy enterprises 
made a 26 million profit in 1988 
dan lee an anaylst with drexel burnahm lambert inc in new 
york said hefner may have wanted to spend less time on business 
because of his plans to marry kimberley conrad 26 playmate of the 
month for january sometime next year hefner has been single since 
his divorce in 1952 
in a business sense christie hefner has largely been running 
the company for the past several years lee said but he owns 
about 80 percent of playboys stock so there wont be any dramatic 
changes

democrat michael dukakis trying to 
counter republican attacks on his defense views made an unusual 
pledge of support monday for the stealth bomber but ran into boos 
from workers at a plant where engines for the airplane are 
manufactured 
a dukakis adviser said afterward he believed there was no 
difference between his position and that of gop rival george bush 
on the bomber 
dukakis visited the large general electric plant outside 
cincinnati after a stop in philadelphia where he charged that bush 
was unforgivably wrong in the irancontra affair and questioned 
whether his opponent has the steadiness required in the oval 
office 
beginning a campaign week devoted largely to defense and foreign 
policy matters dukakis got cheers but also boos and chants of 
bush bush from some in the crowd of 1000 when he spoke inside 
the ge plant he stood in front of military and commercial jet 
engines and referred to the stealth bomber the radarevading 
aircraft that has been shrouded in secrecy during planning and 
early stages of production 
that bomber was started by a democratic administration it was 
supported by the democrats in congress and its going to be 
completed under my administration said dukakis who was 
accompanied by ohio sen john glenn 
dukakis speech was not interrupted by the protesters thanks in 
part to a booming amplification system that allowed him to speak 
easily over the shouts 
many supporters in the crowd chanted duke duke to help 
drown out the dissenters those booing were in a minority 
dukakis unqualified statement of support for the stealth bomber 
appeared to go beyond earlier campaign statements that he supported 
continued research of the project dukakis issues adviser james 
steinberg said dukakis was committed to deployment of the aircraft 
provided it is affordable and it works and said that did not 
represent a change in position 
he says we need it and he intends to deploy it steinberg 
said he asserted i dont believe theres a difference between 
the positions of bush and dukakis on the stealth 
earlier in philadelphia dukakis said that as vice president 
bush had produced only failure in combating drugs cracking down on 
international terrorism and dealing with the imbalance in foreign 
trade 
in each of these three areas george bush has failed 
dukakis said no wonder he doesnt want to debate 
bushs representatives agreed to a tentative schedule for two 
debates in recent days half the four meetings dukakis had sought 
the democratic presidential candidate delivered the first of 
what is to be three defense and national security addresses this 
week to an invited audience of 200 union members and other 
supporters in philadelphia 
dukakis has been stung by weeks of criticism from bush and the 
republicans who have painted him as weak on defense issues and in 
opposition to a range of new weapons systems including virtually 
all proposals for new landbased nuclear weapons press secretary 
dayton duncan said dukakis visit to the ge plant was aimed at 
showing that dukakis is for the stealth bomber despite what his 
opponent has said 
in his philadelphia speech dukakis continued the tougher more 
aggressive stance against bush that he first displayed last week in 
texas although he provided few new specifics about his own 
national security views 
he sharpened his nowfamiliar attack on bush for keeping silent 
when president reagan agreed to sell missiles to iran in exchange 
for the release of us hostages in lebanon 
i dont question george bushs patriotism even though these 
days he seems to be questioning mine dukakis said not for a 
minute but does this man a man who would encourage the president 
of the united states to undermine american interests and prestige 
by selling arms to iran have the judgment and the steadiness 
required in the oval office 
the reference to patriotism was a response to bushs repeated 
digs at dukakis for vetoing a state bill aimed to requiring public 
school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the pledge of 
allegiance dukakis says he was advised the bill was 
unconstitutional 
but dukakis bungled the patriotism line monday saying i 
dont question george bushs terrorism he quickly corrected 
himself 
dukakis focused his criticism of bush on three areas he said 
were crucial to national security and heaped scorn on dan quayle 
the gop vice presidential candidate as unqualifed to oversee the 
governments antidrug efforts as bush had 
i want to beat our foreign competitors he bush is willing 
to settle for second place dukakis said i want to crack down 
on terrorism he knuckled under to the ayatollah i want a real war 
against drugs his answer to drug kingpins like panamanian gen 
manuel antonio noriega is j danforth quayle 
dukakis questioned why the reagan administration proposed sharp 
cuts in federal aid to state and local drug agencies while imports 
of illicit narcotics were soaring 
he demanded that bush explain why the government had friendly 
dealings with noriega despite allegations the panamanian leader 
was involved in drug trafficking and accused the administration of 
blocking a congressional investigation into when and why and how 
much we paid noriega 
quayle campaigning in michigan said dukakis obviously 
doesnt know what hes talking about he said the democrat 
quite obviously doesnt believe that tough law enforcement 
provides a deterrent and he reiterated the tickets call for the 
death penalty for drug kingpins

mayor henry cisneros a leading 
hispanic politician who once was considered a potential vice 
presidential candidate said monday hes been in public service 
long enough and wont seek a fifth term 
its been work and its been fun mostly its been the most 
engrossing and fulfilling thing ive ever done said cisneros 
41 whose term expires next spring 
basically ive been at it for 14 years eight years as mayor 
and six as council member thats a long time to go at full 
throttle he said our country believes that eight years in a 
high office should be enough to get a job done 
presidents serve eight years governors serve eight years and 
eight years is a good round number for a mayor especially this 
one he said 
democratic presidential candidate walter mondale interviewed 
cisneros in 1984 about possibly running on his ticket cisneros 
also has been mentioned frequently as a possible cabinetlevel 
appointee 
last year cisneros said he would not seek a statewide office 
because he wanted to devote time to san antonio projects and to his 
son john paul anthony who was born with a congenital heart defect 
and with stomach abnormalities 
earlier this year cisneros a former president of the national 
league of cities turned down an offer to make a keynote address to 
the democratic national convention 
cisneros who has met pope john paul ii and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev was approached earlier this year by several san 
antonio businessmen about the prospect of forming a firm to handle 
business investments 
the mayors salary is less than 5000 and cisneros with two 
adolescent daughters and an ill infant had supplemented that 
income with lectures columns and speaking engagements 
cisneros said he needs a different job because his two daughters 
are approaching college age and because the medical expenses for 
his son are sure to increase 
today is a little sad for me it has to be cisneros said 
but i expect to wake up tomorrow morning ready to make the most 
of the next eight months same pace same energy same devotion to 
the city until midnight of the day before the next mayor takes 
office 
during his tenure the bilingual charismatic mayor helped 
attract numerous conventions and businesses to the city including 
sea world of texas the largest marine life theme park in the world 
cisneros who won his last two elections overwhelmingly also 
helped attract numerous hispanics to the polls said bob 
brischetto executive director of the southwest voter research 
institute 
he certainly has the charisma to turn out the hispanic vote 
and i think the city contest without him is going to be a different 
contest he said

africa is facing huge debts lagging food 
production and a soaring infant mortality rate despite broad 
economic and social reforms un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said monday 
the un chief speaking at the opening of a twoweek review of 
the un africa recovery program gave a grim prognosis for the 
continent 
among the signs of distress he cited 
infant and child mortality rates are rising and are projected 
to reach 50 million in the period 19852000 in every other world 
region infant and child mortality is rapidly decreasing 
by the year 2010 africas debt will be more than 280 percent 
of its total export income 
per capita income on the continent fell 2 percent in 1986 and 
22 percent in 1987 and today is lower than it was in 1980 
agricultural production improved by 38 percent in 1986 but 
only 11 percent in 1987 despite agricultural policy reforms 
perez de cuellars report marks the midway point of the 
19861990 africa recovery program the result of a special general 
assembly session in may 1986 the first such session to focus on 
one continent 
the program was aimed at helping reverse africas economic 
decline but external problems have blocked substantial progress 
perez de cuellar said 
he said three key problems are africas depressed export 
earnings the cost of repaying its debt and insufficient financing 
every day that passes the debt burden of african countries 
becomes even more excruciating said adebayo adedeji un 
undersecretarygeneral 
although africa paid almost 1 billion a year to the 
international monetary fund in loan costs in 1986 and 1987 
resources fell exports credit declined and loans from the private 
sector were minor the un chiefs report said 
africas debt burden has become one of the most important 
factors constraining recovery and development on the continent and 
unless urgent action is taken the situation will worse said 
perez de cuellar 
africas total external debt is estimated by the un economic 
commission for africa at 218 billion by the end of 1987 almost 
triple the continents export earnings 
a slump in commodity prices has further hurt africas economy 
particulary damaging are the sluggish markets for oil minerals 
cocoa coffee and tea 
these problems largely canceled out any gain that might have 
been produced by the courageous and commendable sacrifices of 
some african governments such as adopting steep currency 
devaluations cutting budget deficits and an turning over some 
public sector functions to the private sector 
in many countries such measures involve social costs and 
political risks perez de cuellar noted 
most african nations have embarked on economic restructuring 
programs about 30 percent of them with the backing of the imf and 
world bank 
most countries are giving greater priority to channeling 
resources to agriculture to improving incentives for farmers to 
making provision for food security and to combating drought and 
decertification the secretarygeneral said 
perez de cuellar urged african nations to continue these 
restructuring programs but cautioned them to ensure that the 
most vulnerable groups in society are protected from adverse 
consequences 
donor countries should show their support for these reforms by 
increasing their aid he said 
perez de cuellar called on industrialized nations to reduce 
their agricultural subsidies on products competing with african 
commodities 
african efforts to pursue and deepen the reform process cannot 
be sustained indefinitely in the face of an adverse external 
environment and without increased support from the international 
community the secretarygeneral said

irans parliament approved 18 ministers 
monday in a vote of confidence for prime minister hussein musavis 
government but rejected three including revolutionary guards 
minister mohsen rafiqdoust tehran radio said 
the twoday debate exposed the deep divisions in the tehran 
hierarchy that had largely been masked by the need for unity during 
the 8yearold war with iraq 
the veto on rafiqdoust underscored the anger over disastrous 
battlefield defeats suffered by iran before it abruptly accepted a 
yearold united nationssponsored ceasefire july 18 these 
setbacks had been blamed on the revolutionary guards 
iran and iraq began observing a truce aug 20 and started 
unmediated peace talks in geneva five days later 
the parliamentary debate which musavi announced in july opened 
sunday amid a deepening rift between hardline revolutionaries 
demanding economic isolationism and tight state control of the 
economy and rivals such as house speaker hashemi rafsanjani who 
seek to open up oilrich iran in the postwar era 
several deputies attacked hardliner musavis economic policies 
while radical legislators loyal to the premier defended his 
administration 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia gave few details of mondays 
session 
but the radio said the 11 ministers of the 21member cabinet who 
were crossexamined by the 270member majlis or parliament 
included interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi oil minister 
alireza aqazadeh heavy industry minister behzad nabavi and 
rafiqdoust 
besides rafiqdoust education and training minister kazem akrami 
and minister of agriculture and rural development abbas zali also 
received a noconfidence vote 
musavi will have to choose three new ministers to replace them 
the fact that other close allies of musavi won the vote of 
confidence indicated that a headon clash between radicals and 
conservatives over irans postwar economic policy has been averted 
at least for now 
musavi prime minister for seven years warned sunday that a 
vote of no confidence in his cabinet would seriously hamper irans 
postwar recovery 
musavi 46 submitted his resignation to president ali khamenei 
on sept 5 saying he believed at least eight of his ministers 
faced noconfidence votes 
khamenei rejected the resignation and ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini the 88yearold revolutionary patriarch publicly rebuked 
musavi for making the surprise move at such a critical juncture 
while iran was negotiating a peace settlement with iraq 
musavi retracted his resignation but complained of 
difficulties in the decisionmaking process in the executive 
an apparent sideswipe at his rivals khamenei and rafsanjani 
khomeinis intervention put off any major political crisis in 
iran but analysts believe the end of the war will bring profound 
changes in iran and that musavi could be among the political 
casualties 
musavi reportedly opposed a truce he opposes allowing foreign 
multinationals back into iran to help with the massive task of 
reconstruction rafsanjani and khamenei favor a more moderate 
course and ending irans selfimposed isolation 
khamenei on monday opened tehrans 14th international trade 
fair in which 36 countries were participating 
some like france were taking part for the first time since the 
1979 islamic revolution toppled the late prowestern shah mohammad 
reza pahlavi 
the official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
cyprus said other foreign participants included the soviet union 
argentina australia switzerland west germany ireland sweden 
japan and south korea 
irna quoted commerce minister abdulhussein vahaji as stressing 
that iran welcomes foreign technological assistance for 
reconstruction projects and said iran now seeks to expand 
commercial links with the rest of the world 
some western analysts have estimated that irans postwar 
reconstruction could cost 40 billion

mikhail s gorbachev in his first public 
appearance after a sixweek vacation ran into crowds complaining 
loudly about food shortages and living conditions monday in the 
siberian city of krasnoyarsk 
the evening television news program vremya led its evening 
program with a report on the kremlin leaders trip to the city 
about 2000 miles east of moscow 
gorbachev had been out of public view since july 30 when he met 
with foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany 
soviet officials said he was on vacation 
gorbachev asked for support for his reform policies as residents 
of krasnoyarsk pressed close to him and complained about lack of 
hot water and long lines for meat sausage and other foods 
the clamor was in marked contrast to the usual orderly scenes of 
gorbachev visits on soviet tv many of the comments and complaints 
were inaudible 
the most important thing is that you believe in our politics 
and in the leadership that is still being formed its still being 
formed at the regional and provincial levels gorbachev said 
he told the residents he was not interested in blind faith but 
in reasoned trust for his policies and the people implementing them 
were on the right path comrades he said no need to get 
lost were on the right path 
the soviet leader blamed both local and national officials for 
failing to develop social services in krasnoyarsk and reiterated 
that he is committed to providing each soviet family with a 
separate apartment by the year 2000 
gorbachev arrived in krasnoyarsk on a special aeroflot plane and 
met with residents near the airport and again near the citys 
central square where he laid a wreath at a monument to soviet 
founder vladimir i lenin 
he defended his tolerance of greater debate and criticism in the 
soviet press and encouragement of cooperatives outside the 
staterun economy 
one woman complained that cooperatives owned by the people who 
run them rather than by the government charge too much for their 
services 
gorbachev agreed that cooperative prices are high but told the 
woman that as more coops are formed competition will drive prices 
down 
gorbachev has encouraged cooperatives to provide goods and 
services that are in short supply in the staterun economy 
a man complained that under his policy of glasnost or greater 
openness the staterun press is free to attack anyone by name 
whether they deserve it or not 
the soviet leader responded we need openness we need 
glasnost but it has to be according to our values according to 
socialism and according to people 
no indication emerged how long gorbachev would remain in 
krasnoyarsk the regional center for an area that takes in 
onetenth of the entire soviet union 
krasnoyarsk also is the site of a soviet radar station that the 
united states says is an obstacle to arms control negotiations 
gorbachev did not discuss the radar site in comments distributed by 
the tass news agency and shown on soviet television

us and soviet observers came to 
this central asian city monday to prepare for the first soviet 
nuclear test monitored by american experts a step toward ratifying 
two longpending arms treaties 
arms negotiator c paul robinson who heads the american 
delegation said it had been a long journey but an even longer 
journey in the mind to reach the point at which the two 
superpowers are willing to share some of their most closely guarded 
technology in the interest of arms control 
robinson spoke before setting off by bus across the steppe to 
the soviet test ground 
an american team of up to 40 specialists has worked at the site 
since april drilling a hole 2100 feet into the earth to plant a 
measuring device the us government calls the most sensitive gauge 
of nuclear explosions 
a test blast to be detonated wednesday is similar to one 
exploded at the us test site on pahute mesa nev on aug 17 
the devices are being set off to allow each side use its own 
testing equipment and compare the results with those of the other 
side to determine the strength of the blast and the accuracy of the 
monitoring techniques 
the joint experiments are expected to lead to us senate 
ratification of two longdormant treaties limiting underground 
nuclear explosions to 150 kilotons still many times more powerful 
than the bomb that devasted hiroshima japan 
a kiloton is the equivalent of the explosion of 1000 tons of 
tnt 
those pacts the threshold nuclear test ban treaty of 1974 and 
a similar accord signed in 1976 to limit peaceful nuclear 
explosions were bypassed by president jimmy carter who pressed 
instead for a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing 
his successor ronald reagan shelved the unratified documents 
claiming the soviets regularly violated their limits without 
permitting onsite verification 
the soviet union unsuccessfully sought for 18 months to cajole 
the united states into joining a soviet moratorium on all nuclear 
tests it abandoned the effort last february and agreed to go along 
with joint verification of tests as a step toward its goal of a 
total ban 
no one thought even a year ago that what is about to happen 
could happen robinson said monday he called the joint 
verification experiment a real triumph of confidencebuilding 
on both sides 
detailed results of last months test have not yet been 
released but us officials speaking on condition they not be 
identified have expressed considerable satisfaction with the 
results 
reports have surfaced that the us measuring gear which the 
united states contends is more accurate than soviet methods showed 
that the american test exceeded the 150kiloton limit 
but officials said monday they regarded that possibility as 
very very unlikely noting that even with its muchheralded 
accuracy the us measuring device can be 30 percent off

israeli troops shot and wounded seven 
palestinians in clashes monday hospital officials said the army 
bolstered security throughout the occupied lands to head off 
violence during the twoday jewish new year 
in hebron on the west bank merchants said they would set up a 
militia of about 25 palestinian guards to replace the citys 
palestinian police officers most of whom quit on orders from 
underground uprising leaders municipal secretary hathem bakri 
reported 
in the west bank city of nablus troop gunfire hit three 
palestinian teenagers including a 14yearold boy who was 
seriously wounded in the abdomen acording to hospital officials 
in the gaza strips jabaliya and shati refugee camps troops 
fired on stonethrowing youths wounding four other hospital 
officials reported 
the army confirmed one casualty and said it was checking the 
others 
elsewhere youths blockaded streets in gaza city set tires 
ablaze and hurled stones at israeli settlers cars witnesses said 
at least 264 palestinians and six israelis have died since 
violence began on dec 8 in lands israel seized from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 mideast war 
the army freed 75 palestinians jailed without trial in a negev 
desert prison camp an army spokesman said it was a humanitarian 
gesture on the occasion of rosh hashana the jewish new year 
that brought to 150 the number of palestinians freed over the 
holiday which began at sundown sunday and lasts through sundown 
tuesday 
about 2500 palestinians are jailed without trial at the desert 
tent prison at ketziot about five miles from the egyptian border 
bakri said hebrons new palestinian guard was the first of its 
kind to be set up in the occupied territories and would be financed 
by hebron business people many of whom suffered breakins after 
most city policemen resigned 
the purpose is to guard markets and businesses because there 
have been a lot of robberies costing merchants hundreds of 
thousands of dollars we need such a body and it was formed on 
popular demand bakri said in an interview 
he said the guards would carry knives clubs and walkietalkies 
but that israeli authorities would not let them carry guns 
uprising leaders have ordered all palestinians who work for the 
israeli military government in the occupied territories including 
police to quit their jobs 
the army reinforced patrols and set up checkpoints on main 
highways throughout the occupied lands 
troops searched palestinian cars at roadblocks outside jericho 
and the kalandia refugee camp in the west bank police spokesman 
rafi levy reported extra troops deployed in arab areas of 
jerusalem but said no clashes occurred

service in the occupied lands israel television said 
secular israelis meanwhile gathered throughout israel for 
picnics in beaches and backyards monday to mark the jewish new 
year while observant jews symbolically cast off their sins by 
throwing the contents of their pockets into springs and streams 
mainly because of the palestinian uprising police deployed 
thousands of officers in israeli cities and urged residents to be 
on the lookout for suspicious objects 
at the ein gedi nature reserve attendance was down markedly 
from last year apparently because many israelis shied away from 
the swing through the west bank necessary to reach the dead sea 
but hotels in the northern port city of haifa were fully booked 
and 120000 visitors were expected at the nearby carmel park over 
the holiday 
tens of thousands of israelis flocked to synagogues to listen to 
rams horns or shofars heralding the new year 5749 rosh 
hashana is both a joyous and solemn holiday during which jews begin 
a 10day period of atonement for sins of the previous year 
most shops and restaurants were closed all public transporation

horror movie hostess elvira queen of the 
macabre on late night tv is accused in a 10 million lawsuit of 
pirating her campy pinup character from another sultry horror 
mistress 
the character was ripped off attorney jan goodman said 
monday 
ms goodman filed a lawsuit in us district court last week on 
behalf of maila vampira nurmi who contends actress cassandra 
elvira peterson infringed upon her trademark public reputation 
and ability to market her lucrative character 
hopefully my client will be fairly compensated and cassandra 
peterson will continue with her character and share the proceeds 
with my client ms goodman said 
miss nurmi created the vampira character in the 1950s combining 
sex appeal humor and death as tv fright movie hostess the lawsuit 
said in 1981 executives at khjtv asked her to revive the 
vampira show 
instead the lawsuit contends miss nurmi was eased out after 
turning over details pertaining to the image and persona of her 
character and miss peterson was installed as host of the 
syndicated the elvira show 
there is no elvira theres only a pirated vampira said 
miss nurmi 65 cassandra peterson slavishly copied my product 
and made a fortune america has been duped 
in addition to miss peterson defendants include khjtv nbc 
productions panacea entertainment and elvira merchandising inc 
khj withheld comment pending receipt of the lawsuit but nbc 
spokesman jay rodriguez said there was nothing indicating 
wrongdoing by nbc productions he said nbc denies violating the 
rights of miss nurmi

republicans were attacking his patriotism using the tactics of the 
latesen joseph r mccarthy

center rally bush said recently the governor of massachusetts 
accused me of mccarthyism

bush made no mention at the rally that five more members of an 
ethnic coalition supporting his campaign had resigned under fire 
however bush told reporters nobodys giving in these people 
left of their own volition were not accusing anybody of anything 
were getting into a very peculiar deal where some people are 
accusing people i dont like it a bit 
earlier in new jersey bush challenged his opponent to say 
whether he supported the reagan administration on military issues 
ranging from the american invasion of grenada to the us attack 
against moammar gadhafis libya 
if my opponent cant answer yes to all these important 
questions then i would submit to you that he has veered outside 
the bipartisan mainstream the vital consensus that has been at the 
heart of americas national security for many many years bush 
said 
on the other hand bush said if dukakis should answer yes 
then the people are entitled to know why he flipflopped and 
perhaps most important of all how will we know he wont change his 
positions again 
returning to the campaign trail after a weekend in washington 
bush hammered dukakis on defense and economic issues while courting 
cubanamerican votes in new jersey 
i have just been told that my opponent is ending his socalled 
stealth candidacy bush said quoting his own description of 
dukakis campaign he commented during a tour of goya foods which 
bills itself as the nations largest privately owned hispanic firm 
bush asked if dukakis still regarded the strategic defense 
initiative as a fantasy as he once said and whether dukakis was 
willing to admit that your support for a nuclear freeze was a 
mistake 
before touring the plant in secaucus bush raised some of the 
same questions in a union city nj speech before a flagwaving 
cubanamerican audience of upwards of 1000 people 
beginning the day bush announced formation of a national 
security advisory task force whose 13 members include former 
secretaries of state henry a kissinger and alexander m haig 
former defense secretaries melvin laird and donald rumsfeld and 
zbigniew brzezinski who was national security adviser to jimmy 
carter 
brzezinski joining bush at a washington news conference said 
that of the two candidates for president bush is not a novice in 
that critical area of public policy on which our national survival 
depends 
bush told his cubanamerican audience i take great personal 
pride in the fact that three of my grandchildren are half mexican 
are hispanic you see my family is doubly blessed we have both 
cultures in my family 
referring to the invasion of grenada which at the time was 
strengthening its ties with cuba and the bombing of libya bush 
said 
and i will really admit that i am having trouble pinning down 
the liberal governor of massachusetts on his defense hes all over 
the field so my question of the day does he support the attack on 
gadhafi that has resulted in less international terror and does he 
support the attack on grenada that has given those people the 
freedom and democracy that sometimes we take for granted 
dukakis foreign policy adviser james steinberg said dukakis 
supported the invasion of grenada for the purpose of rescuing 
students if their lives were threatened he said the reagan 
administrations motivation to invade was clearly more than a 
desire to rescue the students 
steinberg said there was legitimate basis for taking some 
action against libya including action against terrorist camps 
but not bombing the tent where gadhafi was believed to be what 
he does not support is the targeting of a head of state 
steinberg said

republican army badly damaged the home of sir kenneth bloomfield 
head of northern irelands civil service bloomfield 57 his wife 
and a son were not injured but were treated for shock

the outlawed ira had carried out a car bombing on aug 24 only 
150 yards from the site of mondays blast last months explosion 
caused more than 675 million in damage

bloomfield house attack in helens bay county down on the eastern 
outskirts of belfast and said other civil servants in northern 
ireland should resign their posts 
british prime minister margaret thatcher in perth scotland 
said this is the first time we have had a direct bomb attack on 
civil servants working in the northern ireland office and it is a 
matter of great concern to us it just shows the ira are now after 
civilians 
the taxi bombing stirred concern that the ira might be returning 
to the commercial war of the 1970s that devastated the city 
center the mainly roman catholic organization is fighting to drive 
the british from the protestantmajority province and unite it with 
the catholic irish republic 
the bomb went off between two office buildings in donegall

outside said a driver who refused to give his name most of 
us managed to get away but some of my colleagues were hit by flying 
glass 
a second driver also speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he had parked his bus and the passengers got off seconds before the 
bomb exploded 
i saw at least three drivers stagger up the road injured from 
flying glass one of them looked in quite a bad way and they were 
all suffering from shock he said 
all i can remember is the force of the blast i have heard 
explosions before but this one sounded like a really big one he 
said 
police swiftly sealed off the area to keep hundreds of people 
still leaving their offices from getting near the site as 
shattered windows continued to drop shards of glass onto the 
sidewalks 
british and irish officials are scheduled to meet tuesday under 
terms of the 1985 angloirish agreement that give the irish 
government a consultative role in the british province 
the meeting was requested by irish prime minister charles

portauprince haiti ap six people claimed in a radio 
broadcast monday that they took part in a massacre at a roman 
catholic church that left at least five dead and 77 wounded and 
warned that the slaughter was childs play 
the five men and one woman later appeared on telehaiti the 
countrys only private television station in both broadcasts the 
six said the bloody attack sunday was aimed at rev jeanbertrand 
aristide the church pastor and a critic of the military government 
one of the men said in the radio metropole interview broadcast 
monday evening that the people committed the massacre 
we were after father aristide what you saw yesterday was 
childs play in whatever parish father aristide is accepted a 
heap of corpses will attend that mass the man said 
none of the six was identified 
richard widmaier manager of radio metropole said the group 
came to the station monday afternoon and claimed participation in 
the massacre at the church and the stoning later sunday of two 
other radio stations and the headquarters of two opposition leaders 
during the television appearance one of the men said the 
slaughter at st jean bosco church was motivated by an internal 
struggle between aristide and another priest but they did not 
elaborate 
two dozen men with guns and machetes burst into the church 
during a morning mass in the la saline slum and shot stabbed and 
slashed terrified parishioners witnesses said 
witnesses said at least a dozen people were killed aristide 
escaped unhurt and went into hiding 
doctors at the general hospital of the state university reported 
five bodies were in the hospital morgue and 77 parishioners were 
hospitalized 
among those injured were a woman and her infant both skewered 
by the same steel pike while the baby girl was in her mothers 
womb an operation saved mother and child 
franck romain mayor of portauprince said aristide was 
justly punished 
but arnold antonin head of the national network for the defense 
of human rights compared it to attacks on civilians that occurred 
during the rule of dictator francois papa doc duvalier and his 
son jeanclaude 
this act is unprecedented in our history antonin said 
even papa doc did not dare do such a thing penetrate the holy 
precincts of a church and after massacring unarmed worshipers 
burn it down 
dr gerard blot who took part in surgery that saved the baby 
and mother told radio haitiinter the sharpened metal rod 
penetrated the woman below the heart and wounded the baby 
he said 10 others required emergency surgery one for a bullet 
wound and nine who were stabbed by skewers a common homemade 
weapon in haiti 
the rest suffered from various injuries having been shot 
bludgeoned trampled or slashed 
witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said monday they 
spotted portauprince city hall employees among the assailants 
but did not identify them witnesses said police and soldiers 
watched the attack but did nothing to stop it 
romain a former army colonel and police chief during the 
29year duvalier era denied the charge 
if city employees were involved i dont see how i am 
concerned i am not an anarchist i am not someone who preaches 
violence and who sends people out to die as aristide has always 
done romain said 
father aristide has always preached violence he who sows 
the wind reaps the storm radio metropole quoted romain as 
saying 
aristide one of the most popular figures among the poor masses 
in this caribbean nation regularly has preached against army 
atrocities and has led his supporters in street demonstrations 
aristide has been the target of several assassination attempts 
since lt gen henri namphy came to power as head of a threeman 
junta on feb 7 1986 the day jeanclaude duvalier fled into exile 
in france 
romain portauprince mayor until duvaliers ouster returned 
to that office in armyrun elections in january and remained after 
namphy ousted civilian president leslie manigat in a military coup 
in june namphy was head of the military under the duvalier regime 
the mayor was a member of a firing squad in the nov 12 1964 
execution of two survivors of young haiti a group of 
usbased antiduvalier activists who invaded the country romain 
personally shot and killed two group members 
on sunday the forces of law and order stood by and let 
a massacre take place antonin said the radio reports said 
police and soldiers looked on from an army compound across the 
street as 300 assailants stoned the church 
a smaller group of men armed with machetes sticks and guns then 
entered the church and began attacking worshipers 
in washington state department spokeman charles redman 
condemned the police behavior 
in spite of the fact that all of these attacks occurred in 
close proximity to various police and military installations no 
actions were taken by the competent authorites to intervene while 
the attack were taking place redman said monday 
manigat who lives in the united states denounced the incident 
as the work of namphys secret police 
brute force is the principal instrument of those who now 
control the country manigat said from his home in maryland it 
is the same killers of the duvalier time organizing the new

democrat michael dukakis charged monday that an unsteady george 
bush botched his assignments in the battle against drugs and 
terrorism while the republican nominee challenged dukakis to state 
his views on the us strike against libya and invasion of grenada 
bush also scorned presidential rival michael dukakis anew monday 
as a liberal democrat and a cardcarrying member of the 
american civil liberties union 
speaking to a crowd of several thousand people at a shopping 
center rally in alton ill bush referred to a recent charge by 
dukakis that bush had engaged in mccarthyism a reference to the 
vigilante tactics of the late sen joseph r mccarthy 
recently the governor of massachusetts accused me of 
mccarthyism bush said and it was suggested that when i said 
he is a cardcarrying member of the aclu that that was mccarthyism 
when i say hes a liberal that its unfair 
no hes that he sayss hes that hes that 
bush made no mention at the rally that five more members of an 
ethnic coalition supporting his campaign had resigned under fire 
the vice presidents coalition of american nationalities 
lost five of its members when they resigned monday in the wake of 
charges of antisemitism and holocaust revisionism among some of 
its officials 
the controversy arose after washington jewish week reported that 
some of the five had ties to antisemitic pronazi movements and 
apparent neofascist associations 
the resignations came one day after frederic malek a bush 
appointee to the republican national committee stepped down after 
a published report said he tallied the number of jewish employees 
at the bureau of labor statistics while serving in the nixon 
administration 
the most recent poll meanwhile puts dukakis and bush in a 
virtual dead heat among registered voters the cnnusa today poll 
released monday night indicates that 48 percent favor bush to 46 
percent for dukakis 
the survey of 1260 certain voters last week by the gordon black 
corporation had a threepoint margin of error 
dukakis launching a threeday counteroffensive against 
republican charges he would cripple american defense and foreign 
policy told 200 supporters at a union hall in philadelphia that 
bush was disastrously and completely and unforgivably wrong for 
not warning president reagan against selling arms to iran in an 
attempt to free hostages 
later dukakis ran into some boos when he visited a ge plant in 
evendale ohio that makes engines for the stealth bomber he told 
1000 workers that work on the radarevading aircraft began under a 
democratic administration and its going to be completed in my 
administration you can count on it 
but some workers booed and chanted bush bush one sign 
read keep your job vote for bush 
dukakis unqualified statement of support for the stealth bomber 
appeared to go beyond earlier campaign statements that he supported 
continued research on the project dukakis issues adviser james 
steinberg said dukakis was committed to deployment of the aircraft 
provided it is affordable and it works and said that 
represents no change in position 
dukakis said he would restore respect for america which he said 
had been undermined by reaganbush failures to combat terrorism 
come to grips with the trade deficit and stop the avalanche of 
drugs pouring across our borders 
i want to beat our foreign competitors hes willing to settle 
for second best i want to crack down on terrorism he knuckled 
under to the ayatollah i want a real war on drugs his answer to 
drug kingpins like panama leader manuel noriega is j danforth 
quayle dukakis said 
bush at a news conference in washington and later at a rally 
before 1000 flagwaving cubanamericans in union city nj 
cudgeled dukakis on defense and foreign affairs as well as the 
economy 
i will really admit that i am having trouble pinning down the 
liberal governor of massachusetts on his defense bush said in 
new jersey 
bush demanded that dukakis spell out whether he supported the 
1986 us bombing raid on libya and the 1983 invasion to free 
grenada from its cuban masters 
if the answer is no he said dukakis would show himself to have 
veered outside the bipartisan mainstream on national security 
issues he also asked whether dukakis would admit that your 
support for a nuclear freeze was a mistake 
dukakis had his own questions for bush ranging from the 
irancontra affair to why the reagan administration cut funds for 
the coast guard and aid for state and local drug agencies while it 
put general noriega on its payroll noriega is under indictment 
on drug trafficking charges 
what kind of judgment is this dukakis asked what kind of 
priorities are these we need better leadership from the next 
president 
earlier monday bush named a panel of national security advisers 
including former secretaries of state henry a kissinger and 
alexander m haig as well as zbigniew brzezinski who was democrat 
jimmy carters national security adviser 
introducing brzezinski bush said his objective was to shape a 
foreign policy built on the principles of bipartisanship 
realism strength dialogue and engagement 
brzezinski said bush has been tested in the international 
arena and he has a wideranging grasp of international realities 
hes not a novice in that critical area of foreign policy on which 
our national survival depends 
dukakis has opposed the mx and midgetman missiles and has called 
the strategic defense initiative a fantasy although he emphasized 
last week he would continue basic sdi research at a reduced level 
bushs running mate quayle touring a plant and addresing a 
rotary club in kalamazoo mich said that if dukakis wins his 
handll be back in your pocket and the democrats will return us 
once again to those chilling days of no growth under carter 
his counterpart sen lloyd bentsen of texas spent the day in 
washington attending to senate duties

philippines foreign secretary raul manglapus 
that countrys chief negotiator in deadlocked negotiations over the 
future of strategic us bases in the islands is to meet here 
tuesday with senior reagan administration officials 
state department and philippine embassy officials said 
manglapus who arrived in the united states during the weekend 
would talk with gaston sigur assistant secretary of state for 
asian and pacific affairs followed by meetings with secretary of 
state george shultz deputy secretary john c whitehead and defense 
secretary frank carlucci 
on wednesday manglapus was scheduled to open a series of talks 
with congressional leaders and on friday he was to speak at a 
meeting in the state department of the usasia institute 
proposed payments of hundreds of millions of dollars a year 
separated the two governments when manglapus in late july suspended 
an ongoing review in manila of future us use of clark field air 
base subic bay naval station and four smaller installations in the 
philippines 
a report from manila said the philippines had insisted on a 12 
billion annual us payment for use of the bases after the current 
agreement expires in 1991 various reports said the united states 
now paying about 180 million a year offered substantial increases 
that however fell far below the reported demand 
us officials also continued to object to describing us aid 
payments to the philippines as compensation or rent for the bases 
maintaining the arrangement was part of a defense package with many 
mutual advantages they also said the breakoff of the talks was 
temporary the philippines side called it an indefinite breakoff 
because of what manglapus described as an inflexible us position 
manglapus became well known in washington when he lived here in 
exile during the administration of ousted president ferdinand 
marcos before returning to manila to join president corazon 
aquinos government he planned to attend the un general assembly 
starting next week and to meet again with shultz on sept 30 in new 
york the state department said

a controversial program that paid 
potential dropouts to go to class has been revised this year 
because of negative attention it generated school officials said 
monday 
red bank high school received national attention last year when 
it began paying problem students 5 a day or 25 a week to attend 
classes regularly be punctual do their homework and behave 
themselves 
it was picked up by the media as oh my god youre paying 
kids to go to school said principal robert nogueira he said 
the concept was viewed as almost unamerican 
critics said the program was unfair because it paid some 
students to achieve what were minimal requirements for the rest 
and violated the ideal of education being an end in itself 
officials denied the students were being paid to study instead 
they said they were getting needsbased subsidies for improving 
their academic performance and changing their behavior 
national television crews came to the school students were 
interviewed on the radio and newspapers reported on the program 
there seemed to be a lot of hoopla going on about how we were 
doing it said robert lock a work placement coordinator at the 
school who helped draft this years program the attention being 
paid to it was taking away from our time rather than being with the 
young people 
this year potential dropouts will be paid 4 a day for attending 
a onehour program outside regular class hours school officials 
said 
during the hour which may be before or after classes they will 
receive tutoring and help with homework get counseling on their 
attitude toward school and prepare for the state high school 
proficiency tests the test is required in new jersey to receive a 
diploma 
this is fairer because the student has to come in the hour 
before or the hour after school which is a good commitment to 
make lock said we think it will accomplish similar goals but 
not attract the type of attention the other program seemed to 
attract 
students will be required to complete the program requirements 
five days in a row to receive the allornothing weekly payment 
the revised program will be trimmed back considerably with the 
budget slashed from 108000 to 50000 nogueira said the funding 
comes from a federal grant under the job training and partnership 
act 
nogueira said less money was budgeted because not all those 
eligible can be persuaded to participate last year for example 
only 48 of 130 targeted students took part 
an analysis also found the program is not appropriate for 
students with especially high absentee rates or disciplinary 
problems lock said 
despite the controversy officials said the program was a 
success at the end of the school year 70 percent of the 48 
participants had passed the high school proficiency test 
were not suggesting this is the way for everyone to go but we 
do know financial incentives are part of our culture nogueira 
said

britain on monday ordered cubas ambassador and 
third secretary to leave the country because of a shooting incident 
involving the junior diplomat the foreign ministry announced 
no casualties were reported officially and police gave few 
details about gunshots at a building in central london and the 
arrest of third secretary carlos manuel medina perez 
press association britains domestic news agency quoted a 
witness as saying one person who was not identified was wounded 
the daily mail said medina perez opened fire because he believed 
he was being trailed by an assassination squad it did not give 
attribution for its report 
foreign office minister timothy eggar told cuban ambassador 
oscar fernandezmell that he and medina perez must leave britain by 
midnight tuesday 
a vietnamese diplomat left britain sunday expelled for 
brandishing a handgun during a demonstration earlier this month by 
refugees outside the vietnamese embassy 
britain moved quickly against the cubans 
a foreign office statement said we understand from the police 
that at about 430 pm 1130 am edt today monday an incident 
occurred in sussex gardens london w2 when a number of shots were 
fired by a man subsequently identified as a third secretary at the 
cuban embassy 
senor perez has indicated to the police that he fired the 
shots fearing for his own safety 
the statement reported mr eggar said that this incident could 
not under any circumstances be justified the british government 
would not tolerate the use of firearms by diplomats mr eggar said 
that the ambassador must bear the responsibility for this grave 
development 
the only appropriate response was that he must insist that the 
ambassador and senor perez should leave the united kingdom as soon 
as possible but at the latest by midnight tomorrow 
fernandezmell summoned to the foreign office by eggar said 
before going into the meeting i dont know what happened there 
was some trouble in the hall of a mans house some men attacked 
him medina perez but i dont know anything about a gun it was 
just a little problem 
the ambassador made no comment when he left after a 20minute 
meeting 
eggar speaking to reporters later said he told the ambassador 
behavior of the kind that went on this afternoon was simply not 
acceptable 
police headquarters at scotland yard made only a brief report 
it said police were summoned when there were reports of shots 
being fired and when they arrived a foreign male surrendered 
himself and a gun and he was immediately arrested 
it is alleged he fired a number of rounds at persons nearby 
who immediately dispersed 
on arrival at paddington green police station the man claimed 
he was entitled to full diplomatic privilege and once this was 
established he was released the police report said 
press association and the daily mail gave these accounts 
the newspaper said medina perez drew a gun as he stepped from 
his car outside a building where the cuban embassy has an apartment 
in sussex gardens believing men in another auto were about to open 
fire 
he fired at the group who were thought to be arab or 
hispanic the daily mail said the men scattered and the envoy 
fired at one as he ran near a passing bus the men escaped and 
the cuban fled into the block of flats apartments and 
barricaded himself in the official apartment 
it said a diplomatic protection squad arrived from scotland yard 
and cordoned off the area 
two police officers negotiated with the cuban diplomat from an 
adjacent balcony and used a mirror on a pole to look into the 
apartment to see if any other gunmen were inside according to the 
daily mail 
press association said medina perez fired up to five shots at a 
car containing four people it quoted an unidentified witness as 
saying she saw the four run away with one holding a bloodsoaked 
handkerchief to his head 
britain has strict gun laws and most police officers do not 
carry firearms 
the issue of diplomats possessing weapons became extremely 
sensitive after the killing of a policewoman by a gunman firing 
from inside the libyan embassy during a protest demonstration 
outside the embassy in april 1984 after a police siege the 
embassy was closed and diplomatic relations with libya were severed 
vietnamese third secretary khang than nhan was expelled and left 
sunday after he was accused of brandishing a gun during a 
demonstration by vietnamese refugees at the vietnamese embassy on 
sept 4 
the vietnamese ambassador first turned over a toy gun the 
foreign office said but later returned with a real gun and 
apologized for the incident

pakistan also claimed last wednesday to have downed an intruding 
afghan plane after several afghan warplanes were engaged by 
pakistani f16s the ministry also put the scene of the engagement 
then as nawagai but staterun radio kabul called the pakistani 
claim baseless and a lie it challenged pakistan to produce 
the wreckage islamabad failed to do so 
if verified the wednesday and monday claims would make a total 
of six warplanes shot down by pakistan since the guerrilla war in 
afghanistan began 
those include a sovietpiloted su25 warplane which pakistan 
shot down over its territory aug 4 the soviet pilot col 
alexander vladimirovich rudskoi was captured but was handed over 
to the soviet embassy in islamabad on aug 17 
relations between islamabad and kabul have suffered since late 
1979 when soviet troops marched into afghanistan to support 
afghanistans promoscow government thousands of anticommunist 
guerrillas have fought the soviet troops and afghan forces since 
then moscow and kabul accuse pakistan the united states and china 
of aiding the guerrillas militarily

signed the accords as a step toward bringing peace in afghanistan 
earlier monday guerrillas were reported to have taken two key 
border garrisons in southeastern afghanistan in a series of 
communist defeats there guerrillas and western diplomatic sounces 
said the kabul government moved thousands of troops to the 
provincial capital of kandahar to shore up defenses sagging from 
weeks of guerrilla onslaughts 
reports we have received concerning the regimes situation in 
southeastern afghanistan indicate that the position of the regime 
is deteriorating said one western diplomatic source in islamabad 
the sources spoke on the condition of anonymity 
kandahar has long been seen as a key element in the insurgents 
drive to capture provincial capitals as soviet forces withdraw 
the guerrillas claim they overran the border garrison of spin 
boldak after a twomonth siege last friday capturing many weapons 
and large amounts of ammunition 
the following day guerrillas claimed a similar victory farther 
up the border at khair kot in paktika province also a key supply 
route 
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or holy warriors reject 
all offers for a political settlement with the communists they 
have taken two provincial capitals this summer talogan in the 
north and bamyan west of kabul they also briefly held the key 
northern city of kunduz before heavy soviet aerial bombardment 
forced them to flee

defenses to launch a series of blistering rocket attacks in recent 
weeks

six years ago macario galero made 
a modest living by farming coconuts and operating a small food 
shop today he is one of the high graders exploiting a gold 
boom in this small coastal town and has moved up the ladder of 
affluence 
officials estimate that as many as 20000 people are involved in 
gold mining or prospecting here in camarines norte province more 
than 100000 others work the mines in davao del norte province 
northern luzon masbate island and other areas of the philippines 
gold had been mined in camarines norte since before world war 
ii in the hills overlooking the pacific in this town of about 
25000 about 120 miles southeast of manila 
but in december 1952 a mine cavein here killed 56 miners and 
brought a halt to largescale mining operations the towns source 
of livelihood reverted to fishing and coconuts and many young men 
sought work abroad 
in the early 1980s however the rise in the world gold prices 
rekindled interest in mining and triggered a gold rush here and 
other areas of the philippines 
i think it was a gift from god that they found gold here 
said pepito david the town judge because otherwise the people 
would be suffering before gold there was nothing but fishing 
about six major mining corporations including benguet 
consolidated mining corp and abcarparagon mining corp operate 
in paracale and nearby towns 
officials at abcarparagon which employs about 300 people 
declined to give details of their operation but local engineers 
estimate the philippineaustralian joint venture is mining about 
500 tons of ore a day 
in general refiners can extract about 45 grams of gold from 
each ton of ore for a total daily yield from the 500 tons of about 
2250 grams or 7875 ounces at current world prices that much 
gold could fetch around 34000 depending on the quality 
mining sources believe the companys claim includes veins with 
an estimated richness of 14 grams per ton making it one of the 
countrys richest reserves 
but much of the mining here is done by high graders 
independent prospectors who scour the riverbeds and sink deep 
shafts in the hills in hopes of a strike 
although few are getting rich by world standards most are 
earning more than they would by fishing or harvesting coconuts 
galeros operation is typical of the high graders he owns 
the land and finances digging operations in return for a share of 
whatever the prospectors find 
startup costs including tools generators refining equipment 
chemicals and food run from 500 to 1000 mining sources said 
like other high graders galero declined to say how much he 
has earned much of the gold is sold on the black market to avoid 
taxes some miners say they are afraid jealous rivals will jump 
their claims if their profits are made public 
but galero said that in april his crews were mining ore with a 
richness of 15 grams of gold per ton a rich find fifteen grams 
would fetch about 226 at world prices 
some engineers say smallscale high graders in camarines 
norte average up to one gram of gold a day 
miners in davao del norte a larger operation than those in 
camarines norte receive as much as 225 a week more than 10 times 
what a farm worker normally earns in the philippines 
with his profits galero has been able to build a stone house in 
a neighborhood where others live in huts of coconut leaves his 
home includes a color television set and a video luxuries in this 
area 
certainly its meant more money for the people said banker 
frank garcia weve noticed an increase in deposits because 
people are directly benefited by the boom 
at one site atop a jungle ridge south of town about 50 miners 
dig at three shafts each 50 to 100 feet deep and about five feet 
square 
from the base tiny crawlspace tunnels fan out toward 
hopedfor veins miners descend into the pits on makeshift rope 
pulleys working for about an hour before returning to the surface 
for a respite from the heat below 
laborers on the surface haul up the ore in large sacks then 
transfer it to milling stations where the stones are ground 
into powder in gasoline or dieselpowered cylindrical drums 
mercury is added to the powdered ore the gold dust then sticks 
to the mercury and is separated from the ground stone 
gold mining has also spawned a number of other businesses from 
vendors who sell miners soft drinks and fried bananas to jewelry 
smiths who buy gold from middlemen and then sell finished products 
as far away as manila 
most of our inhabitants are engaged in smallscale mining 
nowadays said vice mayor edgar dasco the people are employed 
and the number of business establishments is increasing 
local residents say that so far paracale has been spared the 
ill effects the gold boom has brought to davao del norte these 
include a sharp increase in armed robberies slayings and scores of 
deaths due to caveins 
this is not yet a problem because of family ties and 
religiosity of the people said rev efren sanchez the local 
roman catholic priest 
still he worries about the longterm effects of people getting 
quick money 
when they get money they spend the money sanchez said 
its easy money and they dont think about the future

with the reagan administrations 
contra policy battered the contra rebels and the honduran 
government look to washington to accept responsibility for the 
failed effort to oust the sandinista government in nicaragua 
thousands of contras and their supporters streamed across the 
nicaraguan border in the past four months into base camps in the 
rugged pinecovered honduran mountains the honduran government 
looks warily at a swell of armed foreigners within its borders and 
worries they could become permanent refugees 
these guys have been fighting because the united states has 
given them economic and military aid the honduran foreign 
ministry spokesman eugenio castro said in an interview if the 
united states suddenly pulls the rug the ethical and moral 
responsibility is to take them to the united states 
the contra combatants put the blame for their exodus on the us 
congress which shut off military aid at the end of february 
nonlethal funding approved a month later specified that the 
supplies be distributed within honduras 
the aid has had more negative effects to our troops than the 
sandinistas the sandinistas never forced our troops out of the 
country contra spokesman bosco matamoros said in a telephone 
interview from his washington home 
the contras backed by the united states since their formation 
in 1981 seek the ouster of the sandinistas in nicaragua the 
sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that desposed 
dictator anastasio somoza and gave nicaragua a leftist government 
the rebels claim the peace process started in march with the 
sandinistas has failed they profess a willingness to return to 
battle but say they cannot face the sovietsupplied sandinista army 
without military aid 
the rebels managed last year to stalemate the sevenyear war 
along the nations central spine but they apparently lacked the 
popular support base to obtain food and clothes a fragile truce 
that started with the march peace talks remains in place 
the reagan administration favors renewed military assistance 
but chances remain slim congress will approve it during an election 
year the united states remains vague about its plans for the 
contra fighters and supporters within honduran terrtory 
both the contras and the hondurans express concern about the 
problems here becoming lost in other election issues republican 
presidential candidate george bush favors renewed military aid 
while democratic contender michael dukakis opposes it 
we dont see it in terms of the reagan administration 
contra spokesman matamoros said we consider it in terms of the 
united states we want a clear policy from the united states which 
we have not had 
one solution that the foreign ministrys castro termed as 
absolutely out of the question was the possibility of honduras 
allowing the contras to obtain legal residency 
we cannot we will not take them as residents castro said 
this is a poor country we dont have enough for our own people 
the numbers of contras in eastern honduras vary interior 
minister enrique ortez colindres recently put the figure of 
fighters at 12000 while the rebels said there were about 10000 
the civilians were said to number 5000 to 30000 and ortez 
colindres said as many as 300 more civilians arrive daily 
almost 40000 legal refugees from el salvador nicaragua and 
guatemala live in united nationsrun camps honduras estimates that 
up to 200000 others mostly nicaraguans are in the country 
illegally 
all we can do for the contras and supporters is take them to 
refugee camps and seek help from a third country castro said 
president jose azcona of honduras said recently the contras 
present a serious problem the armed forces expressed their 
concern 
honduras a staunch us ally became the cornerstone for the 
reagan administrations central american policies tens of 
thousands of american troops pass through yearly for military 
manuevers the us central intelligence agency ran the contra 
training and resupply programs from honduran military bases 
honduras in exchange received millions of dollars in us 
economic and military aid although for years the government 
officially denied the presence of the contras 
the issue recently was highlighted apparently with the tacit 
consent of the hondurans by the contras who ferried groups of 
journalists to the remote camps to show the plight of the fighters 
and the civilians 
matamoros said the contras seek military aid and not refuge 
the bottom card is not a green card he said in reference to 
the us immigration card given to resident aliens we are not 
begging to get into a refugee camp or to the united states

american companies are scrambling to 
make sure they are not shut out of the lucrative new market that 
will be formed in western europe in 1992 
thats when the 12 nations of the european economic community 
eec remove the many trade barriers separating them 
were living through a historic period in europe it is all 
happening you ignore it at your peril said eamonn bates 
european community affairs manager for the american chamber of 
commerce in brussels the eec headquarters 
every aspect of doing business in europe is going to change 
in response top us companies are opening special offices 
reviewing business strategies and hiring consultants to get ready 
for the next decade when the eec becomes a single market of 320 
million consumers 
american companies in europe are taking the issue very very 
seriously said walter di pretoro who recently assumed his post 
as senior vice president for eec affairs for honeywell 
many executives say the farreaching changes while spurring 
greater competition should lead to reduced costs and bigger sales 
youre going to operate in a much more difficult 
environment said antonio patron government affairs manager for 
hewlettpackard in geneva but if you play your cards right 
you will benefit substantially 
reagan administration officials though worry that the 
europeans might use their newfound togetherness to try to keep out 
us and other foreign competition 
alfred kingon the us ambassador to the eec said in an 
interview what im afraid of is that when the barriers come 
down the competition among themselves is going to be so great 
that there will be an instinctive protectionist push 
european officials might decide he said all right well open 
it up internally but well have to limit it externally 
they insist it wont happen he said i hope theyre 
right 
community officials dismiss concerns they will create a 
fortress europe in 1992 
these fears are totally unjustified willy de clercq the 
eecs top trade official said in a recent speech 
the idea of the europeanwide market is to reduce the barriers 
that keep goods services people and money from moving freely 
among the 12 eec countries belgium britain denmark france 
germany greece ireland italy luxembourg netherlands portugal 
and spain 
they would put simply become more like the united states where 
people and goods with some exceptions can travel freely from 
state to state 
the europeans have drawn up a list of 285 steps that need to be 
taken to remove physical technical and fiscal obstacles to unity 
their deadline for completing the task is the end of 1992 so far 
92 of the measures have been adopted 
the 1992 pace has quickened dramatically since february when 
european leaders agreed on measures to solve a longstanding 
dispute over the trading blocs budget with their money woes 
apparently out of the way officials have turned their attention to 
fashioning the single market 
many big us companies with strong european ties do not expect 
discriminatory moves against their operations but rather believe 
they stand to gain when the barriers are removed 
john wells external affairs manager at ibms office in paris 
cites such statements by eec chief executive jacques delors as one 
made in an interview with the international herald tribute of 
paris companies working inside the community will continue to be 
welcomed ibm conducts a share of its rampd research and 
development in europe for us ibm is a european company 
we feel zero threat said stephen telegdy director of 
government affairs for dow chemical in brussels we feel we stand 
to gain and have nothing to lose by the european integration 
dow estimates the new europe will mean savings of roughly 50 
million annually from among other things lower transportation 
costs product standardization and simplification of accounting 
procedures 
but reagan administration officials still voice concern about 
americans being kept out 
deputy treasury secretary peter mcpherson recently cautioned the 
eec the creation of a single market that reserves europe for 
europeans would be bad for europe for the united states and for 
the multilateral economic system 
we would find unacceptable he said in a speech in 
washington measures that would limit market access for third 
countries and discriminate against foreign companies already 
established or that wish to establish in the community 
stanley crossick senior partner of campl belmont a 
brusselsbased consulting firm that counts top us companies among 
its clients said to a major us player wellprepared and 
integrated in europe the opportunities appear to exceed the 
threats 
but he added the fortress europe question is of serious 
concern we dont want to hype it up thats a danger but it 
could be a serious issue 
a key concern analysts say is the growing use of 
reciprocity in eec discussions about how much access foreign 
companies will have in sectors such as financial services not yet 
covered by international trade rules 
de clercq said in recent speeches that the test of reciprocity 
would be used when a foreign financial institution asks permission 
to operate in an eec country 
the eec he said will check on a casebycase basis whether 
similar institutions from all member states are given the same 
treatment in the noncommunity country concerned 
if not he continued the authorization procedure will be 
suspended until we have ensured reciprocity by negotiating with the 
noncommunity country concerned 
julian oliver vice president of corporate external affairs for 
american express in london said the reciprocity issue could 
disrupt the financial markets now operating efficiently in europe 
if the community tries to do a lockout he said they risk 
cutting off their noses to spite their face foreign money he 
added could be driven out of the community to offshore banking 
centers 
us officials want the eec to apply a standard of national 
treatment to foreign firms so that us banks and other operations 
will be treated in the new market just like european companies 
us officials also are concerned the community will extend to 
all 12 countries limits that a few have on imports of certain 
products and that it will bow to protectionist demands from special 
interests in fashioning commercial and industrial policies 
this could result in new and greater discrimination in the 
areas for example of right of establishment mergers and 
acquisitions government procurement subsidies local content 
requirements and standards and certification said mcpherson

presidential race draws closer flashy 
computerized graphic at 11 
american television viewers may not be sure how the presidential 
candidates differ but so what with a quick glance at the set 
theyll know whos ahead in the polls 
television news especially at the networks has a fascination 
with the horse race not the horses polls and instant analysis 
clobber indepth issue reporting its easier and quicker to 
deliver that kind of succinct information said abc political 
analyst jeff greenfield 
after all theres only so much you can do in 5 minutes about 
the time the three networks spend each night on the campaign 
what television does well is brief telegenic episodes said 
columnist george will thats why television has traditionally 
had difficulty delivering economic news because you cant take a 
picture of supply and demand 
televisions inability or reluctance to delve into the 
issues isnt new but is it more of a problem this time around 
for the first time in history more than half of all americans 
depend on television as their single source of information 
according to the television information office in a campaign where 
precise contrasts between michael dukakis and george bush may be 
difficult to grasp are charts graphs and 10second sound bites 
enough 
opinion like the electorate is split 
its not even a political campaign anymore where political 
issues are discussed and people analyze the issues said jeff 
cohen director of the media watchdog group fairness and accuracy 
in reporting the coverage reduces us to mindless fans instead of 
active citizens 
william wheatley executive producer of nbc nightly news 
disagrees its a long campaign and with 4 to 6 minutes a night 
you can do a lot of reporting it adds up wheatley said i 
dont think theres any doubt that the viewer gets enough 
information and a good idea of where the candidates stand on the 
issues 
who decides how television covers the election its a tricky 
question television viewers exhibit increasingly shorter attention 
spans and armed with remote controls wont tolerate a moment of 
boredom channels magazine reported in its september issue that a 
majority of 18 to 34yearold viewers with remotes in hand watch 
two or more shows at once 
you could certainly argue that if voters wanted to learn more 
about issues then the macneillehrer newshour would beat out 
brokaw and jennings and rather said robert lichter codirector 
of the center for media and public affairs so a more 
issueoriented news presentation is available on pbs but few 
people take advantage of it the mass of the public is not that 
interested in issues 
if the network research departments came up and said wait a 
second theres a market for issues then youd see more of that 
coverage 
a recent lichter study found that in 1338 reports on this 
years primaries the networks did almost three times as many 
stories on campaign strategy and tactics the horse race than it 
did on campaign issues the horses 
for all practical purposes voters are interested in 
brevity said michael robinson an associate professor of 
government at georgetown university they have always been 
interested in brevity and we have this romantic notion that at 
some point the voters were really actively involved in the process 
they werent 
those people for whom television is 80 percent of their news 
dont want the whole picture said will why are they watching 
television because they are happy with that 
television has traditionally been a reactive rather than a 
proactive or anticipatory medium polls are news strategy sessions 
are news gaffes are news how dukakis and bush plan to deal with 
the deficit well thats something else 
even on nightline where we have much more time than on the 
evening news were going to have a truncated discussion said 
abcs greenfield on the evening news youve got a minute45 to 
do each campaign what youre going to cover is heres what he 
said in 15 seconds heres the latest poll heres their 
strategy 
given the incredible difficulty of covering coherently a 
complicated policy debate it is much easier to take what appears 
to be a quantifiable fact and go to the latest poll

with their currency losing ground rapidly in a 
spiraling inflation peruvians are buying up refrigerators and 
other durable goods not likely to lose value as fast as their paper 
money the inti 
after two years of prosperity peruvians are seeing an economic 
turnaround that is fueling the fastest increase in consumer prices 
ever seen here 
independent economists conservatively estimate that inflation 
will pass 500 percent this year two years ago inflation was 63 
percent 
the country is shipwrecked in a sea of paper money said 
sen enrique chirinos an independent this is a horrifying 
perspective and never known before in our history 
consumer prices shot up 309 percent in july alone 
peruvians are trying to adjust they say they eat less work 
more and worry a lot 
now i have to buy less chicken i use it first for broth and 
then stew its the only way said housewife carmen alegre while 
shopping in limas workingclass la aurora market 
nearby tennis shoes costing 500 intis early last year were 
selling for 3000 intis equivalent to about 25 or half the 
minimum monthly wage 
cigarettes often sold singly because many peruvians cannot 
afford entire packs cost 10 intis each or seven times the january 
price 
analysts are now concerned that perus inflation could boil into 
fourdigit figures next year 
the middle class has begun renting spare rooms tutoring 
knitting and sewing piece work and selling homecooked food such as 
meatfilled empanadas in streetside stands to make ends meet 
but perus poor the vast majority of the population have been 
affected the hardest 
the poorest paid people in peru are earning less money than at 
any time since records have been kept the andean report an 
economic monthly said in july 
an old man begging in the shadow of limas downtown government 
palace complained recently that inflation was making him poorer 
this fills up fast but the intis are worth nothing he said 
jiggling the dirty plastic cup he waves to passersby 
antonio reyes manager of an appliance store said he telephones 
wholesalers every day to get revised prices for the television 
sets stoves and toasters he sells 
but business has been good reyes said noting customers have 
pulled cash from bank accounts where the annual interest is frozen 
at 130 percent to buy durable goods whose value very well could 
rise in an inflation 
the only option a saver has with his money is spend it said 
the news magazine caretas those who do not have the ability to 
save will simply have to seek a second job 
guillermo fernandez 42 a married accountant with three 
children said he recently began moonlighting as a curbside money 
trader on wall street the name given by peruvians to jiron 
ocona a narrow downtown street where thousands of people every day 
now buy dollars as a hedge against inflation 
he said many of his competitors are also professionals seeking 
to supplement inflationpinched incomes with the small but quick 
profits offered by the dollar trade 
analysts say jiron ocona is also a financial barometer and the 
recent stampede for dollars reflects peruvians waning confidence 
in the governments ability to improve economic conditions 
in a recent survey peruvians rated the economy as the no 1 
problem replacing a vicious leftist insurgency that was ranked 
first a year ago 
president alan garcia imposed a ceiling on foreign debt payments 
on taking office three years ago and then used the money owed 
creditors abroad to finance a consumptionbased economic 
reactivation that pulled peru from its worst depression of the 
century 
but heavy government spending with an expected deficit of at 
least 12 percent and a growing shortage of dollar reserves to 
subsidize imports have plunged the nation into recession this year 
manufacturing has fallen sharply while speculation in consumer 
and industrial goods is rampant 
prosperity reflected by wellstocked stores two years ago has 
now been replaced with repeated and prolonged shortages of 
medicines auto parts and basic foods such as milk and sugar 
garcia a populist whose term ends in 1990 recently installed a 
war economy aimed at holding down wage increases while 
allowing prices to rise 
but economists maintain the measures are not sufficent and 
predict inflation will continue to soar 
when inflation hits 500 percent it could very easily get out 
of hand said one leading independent economist alejandro toledo 
this is my biggest concern there will be a very high social 
cost and peru is not a stable country

new york stringent security on the one hand and a trusting 
openness on the other mark the dealing in new yorks exotic diamond 
district barbara mangiameli was an outsider who proved remarkably 
successful in that environment until that day when she was 
murdered and the 500000 in diamonds she had been carrying 
disappeared its a story worthy of a movie plot 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in manhattans traditionbound diamond district 
barbara mangiameli was different a young italianamerican 
catholic woman in an industry dominated by jewish men an outsider 
who went to school for the expertise more often passed down through 
families 
but it is not barbara mangiamelis success in the diamond 
business that its denizens will remember 
mangiameli 33 disappeared feb 4 along with more than 500000 
in diamonds the day after a proposed sale fell through in june 
her body was found in the hudson river she had been bludgeoned to 
death only one of the six missing jewels has been recovered 
she was just an innocent victim says laura hruska 
executive director of the diamond amp jewelry association inc the 
lesson that has to be learned from this is that you have to 
take care of yourself you have to take every precaution 
aside from mangiamelis death there have been three other 
murders this year in the block of midtown bounded by 46th and 47th 
streets and fifth and sixth avenues which is the diamond 
districts heart thats high for a business area says a detective 
a walk down 47th street where goldfilled windows front onto 
rooms crowded with jewelryladen counters suggests the businesss 
inherent risk gems are easily portable readily negotiable highly 
valuable things danger says one dealer is an occupational 
hazard 
but some say something is wrong when a young relatively 
inexperienced unprotected woman is allowed to carry half a million 
dollars worth of jewels to an unknown prospective buyer as is 
customary in the industry mangiameli only had to sign memos to 
receive the diamonds on consignment from a broker with whom shed 
done business before 
this was an enormous deal and way beyond barbaras league 
says debra shapiro mangiamelis friend from childhood if things 
arent changed it can happen again and it will happen again 
</TEXT>

born in brooklyn and raised on long island mangiameli earned a 
twoyear associates degree in business and went to work in 
advertising for more than seven years slim athletic with long 
dark brown hair she is remembered by friends and associates as 
sincere kind familyoriented 
in 1986 she decided to go into the jewelry business 
she was always interested in things like archaeology and gems 
and stones and physics shapiro says 
mangiameli started out selling what are called findings 
jewelry parts and raw metal when her interest turned to diamonds 
she entered the gemological institute of america in june 1987 to 
learn what are known in the trade as the four cs color clarity 
carat weight and cut she emerged an accredited expert in the 
quality of diamonds and other precious stones 
she had met a broker charles fischler who says he became her 
mentor in the diamond business he describes her as a woman of 
simple elegance one who wore little makeup or jewelry her 
eye he says was on the top 
if so she was in the right place last year 80 percent of the 
34 billion in nonindustrial diamonds that entered the united 
states came into new york 
much of the actual diamond dealing is conducted in secure 
offices or in bourses like the diamond dealers club on west 47th 
street there amid hightech security and stateoftheart 
business conveniences backed by three computer systems men in long 
beards lean across narrow tables littered with pieces of white 
waxed paper tweezers in hand and loupe to eye they trade tiny 
crystals potentially worth millions of dollars 
it is a business based in trust deals are sealed and stones 
change hands on just a handshake and the words mazel and brucha 
yiddish for luck and blessing a date of payment is agreed 
upon a memo is signed should one side renege the dispute goes to 
the clubs arbitration 
though she started out in sales and earned money doing 
freelance deals during and after her student days mangiameli 
apparently decided she did not belong in this part of the industry 
when she disappeared she had worked several times on a freelance 
basis verifying gems at christies the auctioneers she was also 
interviewing for a fulltime job in diamond merchandising at 
tiffany amp co 
the women who do make their living dealing in the diamond 
district know well the rules of this exotic world where some very 
orthodox men will put a stone on the counter for them to pick up 
rather than risk touching a woman to whom they arent married 
they are also well acquainted with its dangers 
barbara laufer shapiro 35 runs the retail and wholesale 
jewelry exchange started by her father two years ago her husband 
henry 35 left the store to meet someone who owed him money he 
was carrying about 6000 worth of jewelry his wife said 
henry shapiros body was found in february 1987 in a queens 
swamp he had been shot four times in the head and chest

for most of barbara mangiamelis short time in the business she 
was not confronted by the dangers while in school she began to do 
freelance sales first of finished jewelry later of actual gems 
as time went on fischler said she began to ask for larger and 
more important stones for clients she continued to freelance 
after graduating in december and on feb 1 fischler says 
mangiameli called and said she had a prospective buyer for 
investmentquality diamonds 
at about 530 pm on feb 3 fischler says he put mangiameli 
in a taxi she was to deliver an engagement ring to a customer at 6 
pm and then meet a diplomat from a third world nation who was 
supposedly interested in the diamonds 
the meeting had been arranged through two italian brothers who 
were friends of mangiamelis fischler says she didnt seem overly 
excited he had given her stones worth as much as 250000 before 
when hed heard nothing by midnight fischler said he called 
mangiamelis apartment and she told him the meeting had been 
canceled at the last minute fischler and mangiameli agreed to meet 
at noon the next day when she would return the diamonds and hand 
over 3500 from the sale of the engagement ring 
she called an associate of the brokers around 1130 am and 
said she was on her way she was last reported seen shortly after 
noon in the vestibule of her upper east side building 
no one has been charged in mangiamelis death or the theft of 
the diamonds 
but authorities say the brothers fausto and raoul rivalta were 
arrested on april 11 and charged with interstate transportation of 
stolen property one of the stones and are suspects in 
mangiamelis disappearance 
when mangiamelis body was found june 9 the medical examiners 
office said she had not been dead for very long certainly 
not months but that estimate later was rescinded because of the 
water temperature and other variables according to office 
spokeswoman ellen borakove 
now borakove says were still not prepared to give any 
information out on the timing of the death 
the rivaltas have been held without bail since their arrest and 
face trial sept 26 in manhattan federal court 
the federal complaint against the pair alleges that two weeks 
after mangiameli disappeared fausto rivalta sold a pearshaped 
diamond at a florida pawnshop for 14000 an appraiser identified 
it as one of the six missing gems 
both brothers gave separate videotaped statements to the 
manhattan district attorneys office in march saying they did not 
buy diamonds shown to them on feb 2 by mangiameli 
debra shapiro says that fausto who lived in the same apartment 
building as mangiameli described himself as an interior designer 
assistant us attorney j gilmore childers says that at the time 
of his arrest fausto 33 was on probation on a burglary charge in 
new york and had been arrested several times in italy mostly for 
theftrelated crimes 
shapiro and fischler say they never met raoul rivalta whom 
mangiameli described to fischler as a vice president of the 
brokerage bear stearns amp co inc in an affidavit dated april 28 
raoul 48 described himself as on leave of absence from the 
firm 
but the companys personnel director steve lacoff said raoul 
started as a security guard in april 1984 and worked his way up to 
the post of clerk in the international operations department he 
said he was fired feb 26 for failing to return from vacation 
some people in the diamond district say mangiameli was wrong to 
carry diamonds to meet someone she didnt know yet many dealers 
and brokers carry jewels around and danger is widely regarded as 
inevitable in a business that deals daily in some of the worlds 
most precious objects 
the district contains a heavy presence of uniformed and 
undercover police and private security guards but it isnt always 
enough recent deaths include that of a man who was thrown to the 
ground and struck his head on the sidewalk during a mugging in june 
at one end of the spectrum are colombian criminals who squirt 
their prey with ketchup and commit robbery while the hapless victim 
is trying to clean it up sometimes they end up with 100000 
score and sometimes they end up with someones lunch says 
detective james kennedy of the midtown north precinct 
then there are the soviet emigres who work a more sophisticated 
con finding it easier to set up a deal and get a foot inside the 
door of a jewelry business than the average black kid from 
brooklyn he says 
in such an environment it can take just one mistake to become a 
casualty fischler says mangiameli was smart maybe a little 
naive and thats why she got conned but nobodys perfect 
in the diamond district danger is an occupational hazard in 
the sense that therell always be someone wholl try and put a scam 
on you says henry shapiros widow barbara she too carries 
jewels and takes a different route home every night 
but she says you cant go to work every day thinking that 
someone is out to kill you because then you may as well just stay 
in bed

scaling sheer cliffs sometimes blindfolded is 
not every executives idea of a good time but adventure training 
which matured into a big business in the economic expansion of the 
1980s is here to stay outward bound challenges managers to test 
themselves by taming the wilderness on five continents and dozens 
of competing programs are offering variations on the adventure 
theme 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the cold predawn light of the 
rockies a dozen executives of the champion spark plug co shiver 
into jogging gear 
they wheeze through a 20minute run on a winding pineforest 
trail reluctantly plunge halfnaked into a rushing mountain 
stream and then head off to climb some rocks 
its all in a days work at the colorado outward bound school 
where hardcharging managers learn teamwork in the wild 
over the next five days the sparkplug executives would 
discover gears they never knew they had among their daily feats 
they clawed up a 70foot cliff blindfolded and scaled a 13000foot 
peak posing for photographs at the summit like an everest assault 
team 
in a couple of days ill be back in the office saying wow 
did i do all that stuff says jerry l brasiola manager of 
champions international manufacturing operations 
the executives were sent to outward bound as an experiment by 
champion one of a growing number of companies introducing 
adventure into management training to build camaraderie and 
cultivate leadership 
having come of age in the long economic expansion of the 1980s 
executive training camps have themselves become a growth industry 
with scores of programs attracting thousands of corporate customers 
no longer dismissed as a passing fad the programs have become 
standard operating procedure for many companies 
part of the idea is to confound surprise shock and scare 
managers into breaching preconceived limits and thinking about new 
ways of doing things the programs often are a mixture of seminars 
scout camp serious selfreflection and goodnatured jokes about 
sore muscles 
well give you just enough advance warning about what youll 
do so you wont spend a lot of time worrying about it the 
champion group was told by stephen mccormick head of colorado 
outward bounds professional development program 
the training partly reflects a shift in what companies are 
seeking in a leader they still want scrappy soldiers who arent 
afraid to brawl with rivals to achieve success but they also want 
people with compassion humility vision and willingness to manage 
by consensus not edict 
though its heyday arrived only recently adventure education has 
been around since outward bound first trained british sailors to 
withstand the ordeal of german uboat attacks in world war ii 
today the school offers courses in wilderness settings on five 
continents from himalayan mountaineering to sailing off the coast 
of maine 
outward bound remains by far the largest adventure trainer among 
at least 70 competing programs enrollment has nearly doubled to 
more than 4000 men and women annually over the past few years 
according to donna thompson spokeswoman for outward bound usa 
national headquarters in greenwich conn 
clients range from giants like general electric co to 
entrepreneurs in the pizza business which pay anywhere from 150 
to more than 300 a day to throw people into physical challenges 
theyve never faced before 
most people at these events will say i cant do that and 
most people dont want to try because it scares the hell out of 
them says roy yamahiro a federal express corp vice president 
who helped design the colorado outward bound corporate program 
its the worst thing that can happen in life and business 
he says if youre fearful of taking risks your whole life is 
limited that in a simplistic way is what outward bound does the 
wilderness is a classroom for coming face to face with conquering 
things you cant do 
but some critics contend adventure training can be 
counterproductive and hurt morale especially among workers who may 
be physically disabled 
others say most adventure trainers have no hardcore business 
acumen and dont understand the reality of the work place a few 
wonder how climbing rocks or dangling from ropes will translate 
into higher productivity and profits 
my sense is that its a beginning a first step says warren 
bennis professor of management at the university of south 
california how do you recreate that same environment within the 
company thats the real issue unless the environment is 
supportive and compatible with the kind of lessons you learn in 
outdoor education it can have a backlash or even lower morale 
ironically part of the backlash may be a function of the 
programs popularity they have become so ingrained in some 
corporate cultures the thrill of participation seems to have worn 
thin in the champion group for example some participants balked 
at quitting cigarettes complained about the alcohol ban and vowed 
to gorge themselves on steak and liquor when it was over 
others grumbled about the hard bunks in the schools leadville 
base camp the earlymorning jogs and bonechilling dip in the 
stream which instructors cheerfully describe as an outward bound 
tradition 
still at the end of the champion course many members of the 
group said they had enjoyed it despite blistered feet and altitude 
headaches from the thin mountain air a few had second thoughts 
it depends on the people says kjell karlsen 30yearold 
chief of champions european financial operations you could have 
a 300pound manager who works great in the office but if you stuck 
him out here youd kill him 
although accidents are rare outdoor corporate training programs 
strictly enforce safety partly because of tragedies that have 
befallen executives who venture into the wilderness on their own 
in late july the chief executive officer of new england 
electric system was struck and killed by lightning while 
peakclimbing with his wife in aspen colo about a year ago five 
advertising executives died in a whitewater rafting accident in 
british columbia 
anyone over age 45 on an outward bound course needs a doctors 
permission to participate climbers must wear helmets the schools 
rule no 1 for peak expeditions quit in a thunderstorm and head 
below timberline

many companies have found staff resistance to such programs 
fades when participants discover the joys of conquering physical 
challenges those feelings are carried back to the job and often 
have a profoundly positive impact 
thomas bruggerre head of mentor graphics corp a computer 
concern in beaverton ore decided last year to enroll himself and 
17 subordinates in an outward bound rafting expedition down the 
rogue river in southern oregon he said his goal was to strengthen 
manager relationships within the rapidly expanding company 
i legislated that we were going to do it says bruggerre 
42 no one else wanted to we had people who had never slept 
outside before their idea of roughing it was checking into the 
maui hyatt regency without a reservation 
after a few days the reticence disappeared bruggerre says the 
catalyst was an exercise in which everybody slid down a sheer cliff 
on a rope 
when people got through that it really lifted their 
confidence and experience he says 
there are some failures when a large soda bottler retained 
outward bound to help it absorb managers of a newly acquired 
subsidiary many participants simply followed orders from the 
highestranking member of their group a senior vice president who 
was to be their new boss 
the dynamics dont work sometimes says an outward bound 
instructor who had helped teach that course speaking privately 
this guy was just so autocratic everybody else was afraid of 
him 
despite outward bounds preeminence criticism of its rigid 
spartan philosophy has helped engender the competition some rivals 
claim to offer more flexibility soft beds instead of sleeping 
bags filet mignon instead of freezedried soup 
one example is atlantabased executive adventure inc founded 
about six years ago by robert carr a 38yearold former head of an 
insurance concern who had attended a 15day outward bound course 
sites for executive adventure courses range from the blue ridge 
mountains to floridas amelia island resorts 
about 175 companies have contracted with executive adventure for 
outdoorbased executive training including hewlettpackard co 
wheat first securities days inns of america inc and dominos 
pizza 
the physical nature of our program is such that 99 percent of 
the people can do what we do says james d hickey executive 
adventures sales and marketing director 
weve had groups filled with macho guys who want everything we 
can throw at them including rope courses and rock climbing 
hickey says on the other hand we have some groups who say 
were only going to be with you for a day we dont want to 
sweat thats fine too 
executive ventures group a denverbased consulting concern 
formed by five former outward bound instructors offers companies 
the option of sending people to its rustic colorado springs ranch 
or bringing courses to them by setting up outdoor activities on the 
lawn 
founded a few years ago executive ventures has attracted 
clients that include american cyanamid co arthur young amp co and 
citicorp diners club 
outward bound officials admit their strict policies have driven 
potential clients elsewhere they have turned away company 
executives who reject its alcohol prohibition or want to play golf 
in the afternoon 
there are people who consistently come and say isnt there 
any way we could do outward bound and still stay in a resort 
mccormick says what makes us special is that it isnt an 
ordinary event the one cardinal sin for outward bound would be if 
it were ordinary 
on the other extreme some adventure trainers pride themselves 
on offering even tougher programs the most stressful appears to be 
hell camp a us affiliate of a famous japanese management 
institute kanrisha yosei gakko 
based at the calamigos ranch conference center near malibu 
calif the 13day 2480 hell camp course has been described as a 
mix of marine drill training and samurai warrior school for 
managers 
instructors require students to complete a 25mile night hike 
with a misleading map shout slogans by rote and croon a memorized 
song about salesmanship in a public place to crush their 
inhibitions 
this is where it ties into the samurai by promoting the most 
alert highly skilled and efficient says teresa l abass a hell 
camp graduate and sales representative if a person acquired 
these characteristics theyd be pretty formidable they could not 
be conquered 
but despite newspaper advertisements and considerable publicity 
hell camp has not attracted significant corporate interest most 
students are smallbusiness managers or independent salespeople 
ms abass says acknowledging that our marketing is not right 
many corporate users of adventuretraining consultants have been 
so pleased theyve created inhouse programs federal express for 
example has established its own school in logan utah similar to 
outward bound 
general electric an outward bound client for the past three 
years has adopted some of the schools methods in its executive 
education center in ossining ny the company still frequently 
sends managers to outward bounds threeday sailing courses on 
hurricane island maine 
nevertheless there are no significant studies yet on the 
longterm effects of adventure training some management 
specialists say its too early to draw conclusions 
there are zippo evaluations today because theyre so new 
says denise rousseau a professor of organizational behavior at 
northwestern universitys jl kellogg graduate school of 
management 
even without proven results supporters of these programs say 
they are here to stay moreover they say the relatively modest 
cost makes them less vulnerable to corporate cutbacks in times of 
recession 
in my judgment the smarter more visionary companies would 
abandon outward bound or a similar program only as a lastditch 
measure says arthur levitt chairman of the american stock 
exchange and an outward bound alumnus bettermanaged companies 
now recognize this as an essential tool

when pittsburgh mayor richard s caliguiri died 
may 6 of a rare disease city council president sophie masloff 
assumed the office the 70yearold grandmother projects the image 
of a kindly old lady but as one observer of the pittsburgh 
political scene says underneath there is a kind of toughness 
that occasionally surfaces 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sophie masloff pittsburghs first female 
mayor describes herself as an old jewish grandmother and is 
known to push her homemade chicken soup and cookies on visitors to 
her house 
despite pittsburghs hardball ethnic politics she refuses to be 
one of the boys 
the average ethnic man doesnt believe that women have 
anything on the ball says mrs masloff 70 a democratic 
loyalist for 50 years and a councilwoman for 12 now theyre all 
watching me theyre watching this old jewish grandmother and 
everything i do im going to be suspect 
as president of the city council next in line to succeed the 
mayor she was sworn in may 6 hours after richard s caliguiri 
one of the citys most popular mayors died of a rare disease at 
the age of 56 
she promptly announced she would report to the mayors office by 
8 am every day except tuesdays when i get my hair done 
she wasnt kidding for 20 years the same hairdresser has 
styled mrs masloffs hair every tuesday at 630 am at a downtown 
department store 
one of her first acts as mayor was to demand that several 
neighborhoods be spruced up saying the housewife in her saw the 
need for spring cleaning 
my friends all say thats enough of this old jewish 
grandmother bit but its a fact she says i am a grandmother 
and i am a housewife too i cant say im a 35yearold hotshot 
this is what i am and i just feel that i should acknowledge it 
right at the start 
she also acknowledges holding some oldworld superstitions 
last january for example with city hall abuzz about 
caliguiris illhealth and the forthcoming council president 
selection mrs masloff said that amid the political intrigue she 
was concerned about kay nan horre or the evil eye as 
loosely translated from yiddish 
i fear for a black cat and i dont walk under a ladder she 
says the old folks believed in the evil eye and while i dont 
altogether believe it i dont altogether not believe it 
mrs masloff said some aides feel she would command more respect 
if more people would just call her mayor 
im sophie to everybody she says nobody says mayor and 
nobody says mrs 
government by jewish grandmother may be an asset says michael 
webber duquesne university professor of urban history and a 
specialist on pittsburgh politics 
shes projecting this image that she has of this sort of 
kindly old lady but i think that underneath there is a kind of 
toughness that occasionally surfaces he says 
but councilwoman michelle madoff one of mrs masloffs most 
vocal critics and a political opponent says the mayors image 
hurts women and the city 
on a recent talk show mrs masloff said that if she ever met 
british industrialist brian beazer who was launching a hostile bid 
for pittsburghbased koppers co she would scratch his eyes 
out 
what does it do for the image of women when she says im 
going to scratch his eyes out mrs madoff asks she went on 
and ranted and raved she set the womens movement back 50 years 
mrs masloff later said she was joking when she made the remark 
but mrs madoff says the incident was just one of many gaffes made 
by the mayor 
the mayor chose the theme sophies choice for an antilitter 
campaign saying the slogan was just a catch phrase when critics 
familiar with the novel and the movie of the same name said the 
theme was in poor taste the book told the story of a polish woman 
forced by nazis to choose which of her two children would be killed 
mrs masloff says bringing cable television to the city was her 
greatest achievement as a councilwoman mrs madoff says the mayor 
accomplished little else and rose through the ranks mostly because 
she followed party dictates without question 
the mayors supporters say mrs masloffs loyalty to her 
constituents is her strength 
she goes out of her way to help a lot of people says rita 
wilson kane allegheny countys register of wills no matter what 
anyone calls about in her office she works on every little thing 
that people ask her to do 
mrs madoff announced sept 6 that she would run for mayor mrs 
masloff will be mayor until caliguiris term expires in january 
1990 and she expects to enter the race although she has not yet 
made a formal announcement 
mrs madoff 60 says the similarity between their last names 
has benefited both at election time 
she gets elected and i get elected on each others votes 
mrs madoff says every time im not running people say honey 
i voted for you 
as mayor mrs masloff has adopted caliguiris top priorities of 
cutting the citys 4 percent wage tax and advancing pittsburghs 
transformation from a steelmaking center to a corporate and 
serviceoriented city 
she says it has been difficult to follow caliguiri a friend and 
a political mentor 
he was such a popular mayor she says people expect me to 
be just like him and thats almost impossible im hoping that when 
i walk out of here ill leave behind the same kind of city that 
caliguiri left 
the mayor and her husband jack have been married more than 40 
years and have a daughter linda who has two children 
the youngest of four children of romanian immigrants the former 
sophie freeman grew up in a tenement in the citys hill district 
during the depression 
when she was 16 she graduated from high school and got a job 
taking free college courses at night wherever and whenever she 
could about that time she joined the young democrats along with 
mrs kane 
mrs masloff later worked in the allegheny county commission 
office and then in the county court as a tipstaff an investigator 
and an assistant chief clerk she also served as president of the

the children all suffer from one handicap or 
another but their compassion is unimpaired their friend is dying 
that was all they needed to know to want to make his remaining days 
more livable and it is a question who inspires whom the most 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
deep in thought the dying man gazes 
across the green fields behind his trailer house the only sounds 
are those of summer birds and several puppies yapping in a nearby 
pen ignoring the pair of black bears pacing in their steel 
enclosure 
immobile in his wheelchair mike aria takes a deep breath 
causing the weakened muscles of his neck to bulge slightly it 
takes all his strength just to talk so he chooses his words 
carefully 
aria a 38yearold former animal trainer is dying of als 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis commonly called lou gehrigs disease 
even if i feel completely down in the morning when i see the 
kids im animated a load has been lifted off me he says in 
strained slurred speech a smile covering his face 
the children aria speaks of are 300 handicapped students at 
roosevelt vocation school in lake wales 16 miles south of this 
rural community in central florida 
the 7th through 12thgraders explained principal harold 
maready have learning disabilities emotional problems hearing 
impairment or are mentally handicapped 
what began as a student christmas project in 1985 to help the 
needy maready says became a bond between these afflicted children 
and mike aria 
when they learned that aria was paralyzed from the neck down and 
dying and that he and his wife janice and their 8yearold 
daughter amber existed on 575 a month social security benefits 
they made a decision 
after that christmas it was the kids decision to keep it 
going maready recalls they turned it into an adoption 
through cake and candy sales car washes auctions and 
fundraising the handicapped children have provided aria with a 
motorized wheelchair and an electric pageturner to help him read 
when they learned of arias love for nature they laid pebble 
trails for his wheelchair through his familys 10 acres of 
greenery then they bought lumber and built a ramp so he could 
manipulate his wheelchair in and out of his trailer house last 
year they built an outside bathroom and shower making it easier 
for his wife to help aria bathe 
hes one of my friends said one of the providers donna 
ellzey 18 a senior from bartow who visited aria on vacation i 
feel ive done something real good for somebody when i help him 
another way she helps is by writing a newsletter to keep 
roosevelt students informed of arias activities 
he gives us so much in return by letting these kids be part of 
his life maready says mike teaches the kids that they have 
something to give the world 
mike and janice both from new jersey were high school 
sweethearts 
in her senior year at new york university janice took an 
independent study course at ringling brothers and barnum amp baileys 
circuss clown school in venice fla though joining the circus was 
never an original goal she soon became a featured performer 
after college mike an athletic 210pounder joined her and 
took up training wild animals bears elephants leopards lions 
they were married in 1974 
in 1978 mrs arias brother gil gillespie left his job as a 
schoolteacher and the three of them formed their own act using 
north american black bears and went on tour 
in 1983 aria began to experience an occasional slurring of 
speech then the strength in his hands deteriorated 
that december they told us mike had a motor neuron disease 
causing the muscles to atrophy his wife says theres no known 
cause or cure 
the following year paralysis consumed arias body and their 
circus careers came to an end with two favorite bears and a number 
of dogs from their act they moved here gillespie lives in a small 
trailer in back works in the area as a stage artist and helps 
support the aria family 
mrs aria provides constant care to visitors they appear as 
young lovers 
we were so right to run away and join the circus she 
reflects it was a romantic kind of thing to do 
amber their daughter studied art and sculpture in college and 
a couple of years ago persuaded her father to take up painting she 
had seen him use a pencil held in his mouth to change television 
stations if you can do that why not try painting she asked 
so far he has illustrated two calendars which provide a little 
extra income 
aria is well aware that als is usually terminal after five years 
right now im living on borrowed time he said with 
equanimity but i have my wife daughter brotherinlaw and 
the kids 
those children reinforce me they give me more things to be 
thankful for 
aria pauses to find new energy for a personal observation 
life threw me a curve ball i think i ought to stand in the 
batters box and try to hit it

wolves get a bad rap says a california woman 
who owns three of the animals but dont get any ideas about 
keeping one in your house thats the advice from deborah warrick 
a former professional roller skater and amateur sky diver who 
publishes a magazine for wolf fans among her other endeavors in 
behalf of wolves she says shes a contestant in a mens 
magazines centerfold contest 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
her friends call her the wolf woman 
shes an animal rights activist with a taste for adventure and a 
yen to be a centerfold 
deborah warrick who now publishes her own magazine devoted to 
her favorite canines cringes every time she hears nursery rhymes 
like the three little pigs little red riding hood and 
peter and the wolf 
such tales she says wrongly portray wolves as ravenous beasts 
that prey on little children as in a passage from the famous grimm 
brothers fairy tale 
when she got to the wood she met a wolf but red riding hood 
did not know what a wicked animal he was 
the wolf thought this tender little creature will be a plump 
morsel 
kids are raised fearing wolves and they grow up not caring if 
they are killed says ms warrick who owns three wolves and this 
year began publishing a magazine called wolves and related 
canids 
not all popular wolf stories put the animal in a bad light ms 
warrick says citing the disney films never cry wolf and the 
adventures of natty gann 
but the animals have traditionally had a bad reputation they 
were virtually wiped out in the early part of this century in the 
united states and only now are being reintroduced into the wild 
however ms warrick describes them as basically timid 
opportunistic animals that go for the easiest kill 
id be more afraid of a pit bull or a german shepherd she 
says 
ms warrick 33 became interested in wild animals at an early 
age 
ive always been into exotics she says my parents always 
encouraged that sort of thing and we had pet rattlesnakes and 
raccoons even an 8foot python 
she is no stranger to adventure besides nursing exotic reptiles 
and other wildlife back to health she started an advertising 
agency was an investment counselor performed in professional 
rollerskating shows and was a sky diver until a nearfatal 
accident 
she also was chosen recently as one of 100 contestants in 
playboy magazines 35th anniversary playmate search 
ms warrick hopes to win the 35000 in prize money which she 
says will go toward her efforts in behalf of wolves 
seven years ago ms warrick who lives in the san fernando 
valley and now sells 3d computer graphic systems to the aerospace 
industry was given her first wolf cub 
thats when i realized just how intelligent they are she 
says noting that a wolfs brain is 30 percent larger than that of 
a similarsized dog 
she got around a california law that prohibits people from 
keeping purebred wolves as pets by registering them as dogs but 
wolves she says are not for everyone 
in fact ms warrick uses the magazine to discourage people from 
attempting to raise wolves at home too often they get into the 
wrong hands and either end up put to sleep or in a wolf sanctuary 
they dont make good pets they are a pack animal and will not 
become your house pet she says if they accept you you become 
a part of their pack and must abide by pack rules 
ms warricks three alaskan tundra wolves awesome nova and 
tundra are kept in northern california and colorado because her 
woodland hills home has too little space for them 
the wolves must be kept outdoors in the wild they dig dens 
clearing away twigs rocks and other obstacles to protect their 
cubs 
in a house theyll automatically think its their den and 
theyll pull up the carpeting and drapes to make it safe ms 
warrick says you cant yell at them or strike them because 
youll lose your bond a dog comes back for more but a wolf 
wont 
the magazine which averages 65 pages is published every other 
month from ms warricks home it evolved from hundreds of 
documents sent to her from wolf biologists in such places as 
minnesota and canada a frequent contributor david mech is 
spending the summer on canadas ellesmere island studying arctic 
wolves 
it became such a waste to xerox it all for the wolf owners i 
know that i decided to start the magazine she says breeders 
and dog food manufacturers advertise and so far she has broken 
even by doing the editing typesetting layout and some writing 
herself 
wolves and related canids has 500 subscribers and continues 
to grow ms warrick estimates there are at least 500 wolf or 
hybrid wolfdog owners in california alone 
articles on reintroducing wolves into the united states 
veterinary advice features on wolf owners and lesserknown canids 
make up the bulk of the magazine each issue also contains a 
complete listing of wolf and wildlife organizations 
from 1901 to 1930 the wolf population in the united states was 
virtually wiped out ranchers called it predator control because 
wolves were attacking their livestock 
but warrick says hunters and trappers competed with the wolves 
for other predators virtually eliminating the wolfs basic food 
source 
wolves only kill diseased or weak animals she says 
theyre too cowardly and not strong enough to kill the strong and 
virile its a major misconception 
for wolf cubs to be raised in captivity they must be placed 
with owners before they are 10 days old 
ms warrick who briefly studied veterinary medicine at the 
university of californiadavis and took an animal keeper course at 
the los angeles zoo bottlefed her charges goats milk every three 
hours when they were infants they now eat about five pounds of raw 
meat daily 
they are so loving she says when i go into their pen 
im overcome with licks and jumps they knock me down and walk all 
over me

many research groups are looking at the health 
effects of smoking but harvards unique institute for the study of 
smoking behavior and policy is also looking at other ways to 
persuade some 55 million american smokers to quit looking at the 
deeper meaning of the habit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when smoker professors returned to their 
offices two years ago for the fall semester at harvards john f 
kennedy school of government they discovered they had become 
overnight victims of a coup dashtray 
the schools own institute for the study of smoking behavior and 
policy had struck 
those who chose to puff away inside the buildings now were 
forced to retreat to a small room a smokers purgatory with glass 
walls and hard chairs 
the small wiry man behind it all professor thomas schelling 
himself a reformed smoker was remorseful about the smoking 
section but not for long 
i thought it was cruel and unusual punishment but a student 
said dont be hasty because of it i gave up smoking and so did 
my friend 
everyone knows smoking tobacco is unhealthy but the way in 
which a habit once considered sophisticated was transformed into a 
taboo is the kind of social change schelling as director of the 
smoking institute wants to understand and harness 
schellings mission i want to help smokers he says by 
this he means persuading the 55 million american smokers to stop 
the original emphasis was on what can we find out about the 
problem of quitting that will help people quit when they want to 
says the 67yearold economist and selftaught behaviorist now 
were focusing more on policy issues 
schelling made a prediction smoking will disappear slowly 
in 50 years people will still be smoking but much less 
while other research groups examine the health effects of 
smoking harvards is thought to be the only one considering the 
deeper meaning of the habit 
there isnt anything like it anywhere else in the world 
says dr elena nightingale adviser to the carnegie foundation of 
new york a major institute sponsor 
the idea of such an institute was born about six years ago when 
schelling expressed fascination with the cessation of smoking since 
world war ii by scores of middleclass middleaged men he 
promoted meetings on the subject convincing harvard president 
derek bok among others that a more ambitious effort was needed to 
make any difference 
since it opened four years ago this small obscure research 
center at harvard university already has reached into more distant 
halls than the smokefree ones under its roof 
operating as a continuing forum the institute is host to a 
study group of 20 to 40 interested health government and 
psychological professionals who meet monthly to discuss and 
exchange the latest research 
in addition at any given time some 15 assorted physicians 
psychiatrists students of government policy health workers 
sociologists and the like attached to the institute conduct 
independent research this could be anything from writing a social 
history of smoking to studies on the effectiveness of hypnosis in 
breaking tobacco addiction 
the work of the institute is so compelling for smokers 
especially that when a psychologist was running a study of smokers 
at a veterans adminstration hospital she asked that its name not 
be published in a newspaper story about the institute publishing 
the name in the past caused a rush of volunteers that inundated the 
hospital 
the purpose of the institute on an annual budget of 600000 
is to prompt outside research and then disseminate the results in 
the words of executive director john pinney a former 
threepackaday smoker and onetime chief of the federal office of 
smoking and health we set out to be a convenor and stimulator 
some results 
snuffing out much of the smoking culture in the us military 
in 1986 by contributing to thendefense secretary caspar 
weinbergers decision to order aggressive antismoking efforts 
from the pentagon to boot camp 
helping persuade congress in 1985 to keep the 16cent federal 
excise tax on cigarettes instead of halving it as planned 
assisting foreign countries trying to resist us tobacco 
companies eager for new markets 
finding in a study that found teenagers unlike adults can 
start and stop smoking many times thus prompting health educators 
to shift their approach from prevention to intervention 
prompting smoking restrictions in massachusetts government 
office buildings and vehicles after a chat schelling had with gov 
michael dukakis at a harvard gettogether 
investigating life in a nearly smokefree world through 
pollsters who work in a laboratory in the city of cambridge which 
last year instituted one of the countrys toughest antismoking 
laws 
once upon a time smoking was considered stylish tobacco 
companies even claimed it offered health benefits 
what weve seen in this country is just about the most 
remarkable voluntary change in behavior anywhere schelling says 
institute researchers have tried to fathom this change and 
smoking behavior especially they are asking for instance why 
some people never smoke and why others do despite knowing the 
risks and why is it that most people who try to quit can but 
hardcore smokers cant part from cigarettes no matter how hard 
they try 
the institute is also eager to know how to prevent teenagers 
from taking up smoking since there is evidence that smoking is 
seldom begun past the age of 20 
according to institute figures there has been a steady decline 
in smoking since the 1950s in 1949 44 percent of adults smoked 
in 1986 the latest available figures the proportion of adult 
smokers was 265 percent institute figures show 
among people still smoking most try to stop 
just four years ago only a dozen major corporations restricted 
smoking to avert fires and contamination of their products today 
more than half the fortune 500 companies limit smoking on the job 
chief among the influences on this sea change is that after 
decades of concern about the lifeshortening effects of smoking 
the office of the us surgeon general in 1964 made the risks 
official when it linked smoking to lung disease 
since then americans have become more selfconscious about 
their health taking up exercise and improving their diets with the 
gusto of the old world explorers searching for the fountain of 
youth 
it is not only concern for personal health that is crushing the 
national smoking habit peer pressure has a lot to do with it 
there is some moral opprobrium the temperance notion that if 
you have to smoke you have to suffer schelling says

tamayo otsuki a former topless dancer 
who became a standup comic with a raunchy routine is being seen 
more and more on network television since she cleaned up her act 
otsuki perhaps the only female japanese comedian delivering 
punch lines in english will appear on nbcs the comedy store 
15th year class reunion on oct 13 and she was cast in elysian 
fields a cbs drama pilot that has yet to air 
the 29yearold osaka native takes to the stage at the dunes 
hotel here clad in a purplestriped kimono blue and gold obi sash 
and gold sandals in soft japaneseaccented english she 
introduces herself and tells the audience that her name translates 
as pearl harbor 
like much of her humor the joke is partially true her first 
name does mean pearl 
she then moves to the end of world war ii and startles the 
audience by saying thank you very much for dropping bomb 
otherwise she says there would have been no more nissan and 
sony and she probably never would have been born 
we really appreciate it she says smiling at the audience 
but please dont do it again 
later backstage otsuki explains that she believes that the 
atomic bombs detonated on hiroshima and nagasaki saved many 
japanese and american lives by averting a bloody land invasion 
while her routine is mostly rid of the profanity that spiced her 
act at comedy clubs around los angeles and later on the playboy 
channel she has drawn occasional criticism that her material is 
racist which she denies 
im against this prejudice thing she says adding that she 
wants to teach americans to laugh with japanese people instead of 
at them 
onstage she recounts the tale of her legendary grandfather 
the only surviving kamikaze pilot chicken nakamura 
when the audience seems uncomfortable laughing at the war jokes 
she defuses the situation by saying some people are looking at 
me and thinking we should have killed them all 
otsuki who now resides in hollywood says she picked up her 
sense of humor from her roller coaster life that initially took her 
from star high school pupil to college dropout to bar singer to 
tour guide 
she then moved to england and ended up as an admittedly 
incompetent nanny for a wealthy family the household eventually 
fired otsuki but took such pity on her they gave her free room and 
board 
after that it was on to america where within three months she 
was in a kentucky fried chicken commercial soon however she 
found herself wondering where her next meal would come from 
so the 22yearold woman took a job as a topless dancer in the 
los angeles suburb of monterey park 
a visit to the comedy store several years later persuaded her to 
change stages 
after three years of dancing naked i wanted to move on to a 
better thing she says 
she became obsessed with becoming a comedian but she was 
illprepared to make a living by delivering laughs 
i didnt even know standup comedy existed she says i 
didnt know what a punch line was but she says she knew she 
loved to make people laugh 
otsuki began at the bottom of the comedy profession working for 
free at comedy clubs in the los angeles area delivering a crude 
act which mostly consisted of cussing for three minutes with my 
heavy heavy accent i was horrible 
at least she recalls hugh hefner liked it and had her deliver 
the routine on the playboy channel 
over the years otsuki honed her act into a more sophisticated 
routine peppered with comments on such current topics as the trade 
friction between the united states and japan 
today the cursing barrage is gone but ethnic groups including 
asians jews and blacks are targets of otsukis humor 
for example she tells her audiences that americans are getting 
shorter because they eat so much sushi and a diet among japanese of 
burgers and fried chicken is making them taller 
one day we can play basketball together goes the punch line 
in addition to learning to play basketball japanese are 
becoming more civilized she says 
you know harakiri we finally realized its stupid after 
800 years

pianistarranger luther henderson one of the 
members of the original cast back for a revival of aint 
misbehavin thinks the fats waller musical is even better than 
when it opened 10 years ago 
and that original production was good enough to lead to 
successful broadway revues of music by eubie blake eubie and 
duke ellington sophisticated ladies 
other members of the original broadway cast nell carter 
armelia mcqueen charlaine woodard andre de shields and ken page 
are at the ambassador theater again singing songs that the late 
composerpianistsinger fats waller made into hits henderson sits 
in for waller at the upright piano 
there have been many extraordinarily good casts henderson 
says but none of them generate the kind of electricity that this 
group does this show has taken on a deeper dimension i dont know 
if thats visible to everybody the singers are doing the same 
thing they did before and as great as it was it seems to be better 
now i think im playing better now 
what we were attempting and i think we do is to capture be 
custodians of and illuminate the spirit of fats waller henderson 
says were not just giving lip service to songs like taint 
nobodys bizness if i do and his saying one never know do 
one its for fun 
one song black and blue isnt intended to be funny but 
sometimes the audience laughs as the song begins the laughter 
trails off as they realize its serious 
all of a sudden fats whos telling everybody your feets too 
big and this man is fat and greasy and being the buffoon for 
which he got a lot of flack in his lifetime decides to create a 
very strong protest song henderson says people have been 
having such a good time they cant believe right away hes not 
kidding 
aint misbehavin has been touring drawing audiences 
steadily over 10 years with different casts leonard oxley and 
billy mcdaniels whove done the show often currently play piano 
on tuesday nights and wednesday matinees when henderson is off 
henderson confesses that he really doesnt play like fats 
waller except in certain things 
i use some of his stride piano idioms he says stride is 
oom pah a rhythmic background effect like a band fats was 
exuberant and he showed it in his percussiveness he was able to do 
stride with his left hand and play other stuff up in the right hand 
in the late 1930s and early 1940s the art of stride piano 
playing and boogiewoogie were incredible i can tell you they 
are very difficult to do 
henderson was hired as arranger when aint misbehavin 
started as a musical revue at the offbroadway manhattan theater 
club the orchestra is built around the piano he says fats 
never had a band he called it fats waller and his rhythm he used 
a drummer bassist and sometimes a guitarist later henderson 
reluctantly agreed to play onstage piano as well 
henderson a juilliard school graduate decided early in life to 
concentrate on arranging instead of composing or performing he was 
intimidated by the great jazz pianists then working i always 
tell people i was frightened by art tatum at an early age he 
says then oscar peterson came along 
he composed the music for an offbroadway musical comedy 
crystal tree im not a bad composer he says but thats 
something you cant do offhand you have to do it every day its 
not a parttime job 
when he arranges henderson says he starts with pinning down 
what is to be communicated when i get a job like miss teen 
usa for tv i dont need to go into that depth i just 
generally do because thats how i got brought up when i get these 
gigs i work twice as hard as anybody else 
henderson recently arranged two albums of dixieland and 
gershwin music for the canadian brass there is nothing in those 
two hours of music that is improvised and they say dixieland should 
be improvised 
i think i was successful its the essence of what dixieland 
might have been if theyd all had the technique these boys have 
got i strive for that the essence a lot

despite sagging oil revenues libya is 
pushing ahead with col moammar gadhafis dream of piping fresh 
water from deep under the sahara desert to the shores of tripoli 
and other thirsty coastal areas 
gadhafi maintains his great manmade river project will transform 
a nation that is 95 percent desert into a garden of eden abloom 
in fruits vegetables and grain 
one underpinning of the project is us technology reportedly 
in place before january 1986 when the reagan administration 
ordered american companies to stop doing business in libya on 
grounds that libyans were behind terrorism aimed at americans and 
other westerners 
gadhafi riding in a beatup range rover behind bedouins on 
horses came here aug 26 1986 to inaugurate the factory that 
makes the concreteandsteel pipes for the river since then 
about 280 miles of the planned 12500mile pipeline have been laid 
in a trench cut through sand and underlying rock 
the first stage estimated to cost 45 billion calls for 1180 
miles of pipeline to carry half a billion gallons of fresh water 
daily from wells in east central libya to a reservoir at ajdabiya 
near the coast on the gulf of sidra for distribution to areas near 
sirte and benghazi 
in 1986 officials predicted the first stage would be completed 
in 1989 but factory manager osman jaouda estimated recently it 
would be finished in 1991 
the south korean construction company dongah is cranking out 
the pipes and digging through the desert to lay them down jaouda 
said the koreans inexperience with desert terrain and weather 
caused the delay 
its not a problem of financing said jaouda 
with current lower market prices libyas oil revenue is sharply 
down from the boom years of the late 1970s and early 80s in 1980 
oil revenue was 22 billion by 1987 it had plunged to 66 
billion 
diplomatic and business sources in tripoli say libya has cut 
back drastically on such projects as highway school and hospital 
construction and is concentrating its resources on its oil 
industry the military and the great manmade river 
every single libyan is waiting for water jaouda said 
leading a tour for foreign journalists flown on a government plane 
from tripoli to benghazi to see the project 
the pipelines first part slices through bleak terrain broken 
only occasionally by brush and date palms near oases where camels 
and goats graze 
gadhafi comes to the desert frequently to check on progress 
jaouda said 
the us order against american operations in libya caused a few 
hectic months without consultants but did not delay the project 
jaouda claimed 
the firm of root and brown inc of houston texas turned over 
its duties to its subsidiary in england and britons and canadians 
have taken the place of the estimated 300 americans who were 
working on the project jaouda said 
he added that the first water to flow will irrigate 247000 
acres of farmland near the mediterranean city of benghazi libyas 
second largest city 
other stages call for water to be tapped from wells in central 
west libya and be delivered to tripoli and for a pipeline to 
connect the libyan capital tripoli with sirte eventually a 
pipeline is to run out to wells in kufra deep in the south and 
the final phase will pipe water as far east as tobruk near the 
border with egypt 
jaouda declined to give even the roughest estimate for 
completion of the entire project but that contracts will be awarded 
for stage two by the end of this year a few months behind an 
earlier timetable 
businessmen and technicians here including those who have 
worked on irrigation projects express doubts that the project will 
guarantee that libya can grow all it needs to eat 
they cite the competing demands by major cities where most of 
libyas population lives for more and better drinking water they 
predict political pressures will dictate that more and more water 
transported by the pipeline will be diverted from agricultural to 
urban use 
they also say that the project is counting on enthusiastic 
cooperation from farmers to see that the irrigated land is most 
efficiently farmed but they add that state cooperative farms 
generally yield much less than possible because the workers wont 
make any more profit if they work harder or better 
as an example a european construction executive who is 
directing a smallscale irrigation project in the desert said the 
project failed because the farmers preferred to put in their extra 
work into private lands not the staterun irrigated fields 
jaouda said water from the project will be used for both state 
and private lands 
he estimated that the great manmade rivers water pumped up 
from natural wells 1150 feet below the ground will last 50 years 
the pipe segments each weighing 72 tons and measuring 23 feet 
long and 13 feet in diameter will probably outlast the water he 
said

a businesswoman trying to crack the socalled 
glass ceiling may find a useful tool in a new book that lists the 
50 companies that in the authors view give women the best 
opportunity for advancement heres a report on how the list was 
compiled 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its not a book an unreconstructed male 
chauvinist will run out and buy unless perhaps hes a ceo its 
written by women for women working women a guide to the companies 
where they are most likely to succeed 
two avowed feminists one a psychologist and business 
consultant the other a journalist and author spent almost three 
years in their quest to find the best us companies for women 
they came up with a list of 50 
it is possible that we missed a great company says the 
journalist lorraine dusky of sag harbor ny but i doubt it 
the researchers sent letters to 76 executive recruiters 72 
professional womens groups and 15 researchers and asked for 
nominations they came up with over 200 nominations some companies 
appeared on every list 
dusky and coauthor dr baila zeitz a psychologist who 
practices in new york city and teaneck nj then sent out a 
sixpage questionnaire to the companies and requested permission 
for an onsite visit to interview female employees 
they followed that up with private telephone interviews with the 
women who were allowed to remain anonymous if what they had to say 
might jeopardize their jobs 
the result is the best companies for women published this 
summer by simon amp schuster it lists the 50 best companies 
representing 22 industries and gives profiles of each 
the authors offer specific pros and cons be it maternity leave 
benefits or the whereabouts of the muchdiscussed glass ceiling 
that women can only look through 
we found that often those with terrific benefits for maternity 
leave had a glass ceiling so low that you couldnt stand up 
straight without bumping into it dusky says 
we also found that the attitude of the ceo had a great deal to 
do with the way the company treated women 
in addition the authors list 60 additional companies worth 
considering by women in the job market but which they did not 
profile for various reasons 
some companies that maybe should have been on the list refused 
to see us because there was some dirt going on dusky says one 
company who turned them down cold despite recommendations was found 
to be in the midst of a sexual harassment suit 
in one of the anecdotes in the book which reflect the slow 
progress of the womens movement in the workplace sara dickinson 
who got her engineering degree from the university of illinois in 
1976 tells how she had no trouble setting up a job interview but 
she was appalled that the interviewer did not want to know about 
her engineering skills instead they talked about the climate the 
prices of apartments in the city and how long it would take to 
establish a credit line to buy a car 
they must have wanted me for some quota she told dusky 
only hewlettpackard threw a transistor circuit at her and told 
her to analyze it so she took that job nonetheless she did get a 
chance to look at the recruiters summary it read pretty good 
for a girl 
she is still there has been promoted about every two years and 
is currently a research and development laboratory manager 
the authors point out that working in an engineering company is 
really working in a mans world and there is a lot to overcome but 
with a little humor the women say it can be done 
wall street the authors note has been notoriously tough on 
women and the only wall street entry is salomon brothers thats 
because of one man john gutfreund the ceo 
if he gets interested in an account he doesnt care if youre 
a zebra or someone from a small area of tibet youre the person 
hell call if anything gets screwed up or hes got an idea he wants 
you to think about said one woman who wished to remain 
anonymous and if you need to find him you just walk over to his 
desk you dont have to go through a secretary he is colorblind 
and sex blind hes not interested in you personally hes only 
interested in what you are doing to make money from your accounts 
essentially they say the old boy networks are too entrenched 
and women rise for the first eight or nine years and then are told 
its time to face reality thats the end of the trail as far as

the clatter of freight trains has 
replaced the crackle of gunfire and the whoosh of combat jets in 
this town on the soviet border 
crisscrossing the rolling grasslands of inner mongolia and 
siberia the trains provide noisy testimony to improving relations 
between china and the soviet union 
while officials in beijing and moscow still haggle over 
political matters businessmen in manzhouli and dozens of other 
towns along the 5000mile border are eagerly cementing closer 
economic ties 
the russians are very easy to deal with said zhang 
chengbin a businessman from a staterun firm that sold 314 
million in meat to the soviets in the first six months of this 
year theyre like the americans they dont worry too much about 
prices 
nows the time to get in on the trade said zhang wei a 
private businessman in harbin provincial capital of heilongjiang 
in the next couple of years it will explode the soviets dont 
have enough things and they like chinese goods 
in manzhouli connected to russia by rail since 1901 soviet 
trucks chemical fertilizer wood steel iron ore electrical 
generators and bulldozers cram freight cars moving south into the 
chinese heartland 
soviet railway workers and trade delegations walk freely around 
the town of 30000 dotted with traditional russian houses their 
logcabin walls painted yellow and blue 
its fascinating to be here said andrev vedernikov a 
russian railway worker as he strolled down sinosoviet road the 
towns main street manzhouli is like a small museum of russia 50 
years ago 
across the border in zabaikalsk freight cars packed with 
chinese meats fruit vegetables grains television sets radios 
and thermos bottles fill the station 
you think there are many trains here said vadim evdokimov 
another railway worker as he looked out over manzhoulis cluttered 
freight yard zabaikalsk is even busier 
chinese press reports say that in the first six months of this 
year trade between the soviet union and china reached 13 
billion a 32 percent jump when compared to the same period last 
year but chinese businessmen said the real amount could rival 
chinas trade with the united states which hit 10 billion last 
year 
indeed on aug 29 the official xinhua news agency reported 
that combined trade in the border provinces of heilongjiang and 
xinjiang had hit 707 million in the first half of 1988 or about 
800 percent above their total for all of 1987 
after two decades of tense relations china and the soviet union 
started trading again in the early 1980s it began with barter 
this year it expanded to include purchases with currency from a 
third country usually american dollars and the export of chinese 
labor to the soviet union in a further twist chinese officials in 
heilongjiang said privately they expect soviet technical advisers 
to return soon to china 
in the 1950s we traded because we were friends said xing 
wenzhao an official in heilongjiangs bureau of foreign trade 
now we do it because we need to that is a healthy development 
chinese officials say labor export could become the most 
important part of sinosoviet trade several said that china could 
easily supply the manpower to develop siberia 
in its report aug 29 xinhua said about 10000 chinese workers 
were expected to head to the soviet union over the next year for 
construction and farming 
labor export began in july when more than 100 chinese 
construction workers went to zabaikalsk to build a gymnasium 
several dormitories and a dining hall earlier in the year 77 
chinese peasants were given 1071 acres to grow cucumbers and 
watermelons in the soviet union north of vladivostok across the 
border from suifenhe another important trading post 
we gave the russians half and then sold them the rest said 
a chinese official in harbin who worked on the contract were 
looking at it as a model for future deals it makes perfect sense 
because we have a huge work force and they have a lot of land 
for their part soviet officials in manzhouli said they were 
interested in china for its consumer goods and food 
our agriculture and our light industry are weak said a 
soviet businessman who spoke on condition of anonymity china 
for us is like a big supermarket their stuff is generally good and 
inexpensive 
in the early 1950s the soviet union sent thousands of soviet 
technical advisers to china to help set up factories 
but relations soured in the late 1950s as china embraced a 
development model that emphasized people over machines radically 
different from the soviet plan 
by 1962 all soviet advisers had left china several years 
later as china moved farther left in its cultural revolution 
firefights broke out periodically along the border in 1969 soviet 
and chinese troops fought pitched battles on damansky island or 
zhenbao in chinese on the ussuri river clashes spread to inner 
mongolia 
at night gunshots would echo all around the valley said 
wen he a 59yearold railroad worker who sent his three sons 
south for a year to protect them in the daytime their jets and 
ours would fly above the town we were all scared 
ties began improving slowly in the late 1970s after deng 
xiaoping took power and instituted a series of reforms to open 
china to the west they have improved further since mikhail s 
gorbachev became soviet communist party chief in 1985 and began to 
reform his country 
now all you hear at night in manzhouli are train whistles 
said guan lancheng a 54yearold coal miner as he strolled to his 
house on a bluff overlooking the hills of siberia it is very 
peaceful 
economic relations have not proceeded without glitches the 
chinese complain that the soviets give them only their worst timber 
and charge that soviet business practices are not flexible enough 
the soviets accuse the chinese of trying to cheat them they 
also complain that chinas poor railways and road network are 
hampering trade growth 
soviet officials have provided some help to the chinese 
transportation system floating beijing a 180million loan earlier 
this year to recommence work on a railway to connect chinas far 
west to soviet central asia 
both countries have moved to further relax trade restrictions 
as of aug 13 the two countries dropped visa requirements for 
businessmen more border trading posts have opened and in july 
china announced that local governments not only those in border 
provinces would be allowed to cut deals with their soviet 
counterparts 
from that point on its been very busy in manzhouli said 
xue guiyuan vice chairman of manzhoulis committee for foreign 
trade everyone is coming here to talk to the soviets our hotels 
are packed were a hot spot which is kind of odd for such a 
little town

to the back to grab two plates of his famous salad 
soviet friends youve returned he shouts soviet 
friends we welcome you 
andrev vedernikov and vadim evdokimov railway workers in this 
town on the soviet border have come back for another meal 
down the street at the international guest house members of 
the soviet friendship delegation from zabaikalsk dance the night 
away with their counterparts from the manzhouli sinosoviet 
friendship committee 
at the close of the evening under revolving green and red disco 
lights xue guiyuan a chinese trade official waxes melodramatic 
two great nations are becoming friends again he says two 
peoples are moving closer together 
on train no 390 heading east from manzhouli ira shamrett 48 
and her son kostya 19 are off to see relatives in harbin the 
provincial capital of chinas heilongjiang province 
we come from siberia announces mrs shamrett in rusty 
chinese learned in the five years she spent in harbin as a 
youngster its been more than 30 years since i saw my brother 
i hope to learn about kungfu said her son its becoming 
very popular back home 
just as trade has blossomed between china and the soviet union 
so have contacts between chinese and soviets since last year 
china has allowed soviets to return to its border provinces to 
visit relatives who stayed after relations between the two 
countries deteriorated in the late 1950s the soviets have done the 
same for chinese with family in siberia and soviet central asia 
both countries also have dropped visa requirements for 
businessmen 
vedernikov 30 and evdokimov 29 who work on soviet freight 
trains between manzhouli and zabaikalsk studied chinese for five 
years at the chita pedagological institute about 180 miles from 
the chinese border 
now they handle freight and mail which have both increased 
markedly as trade between the countries rises 
i had a choice between a job as a teacher or work on this 
train said evdokimov speaking a mixture of chinese and english 
the job is boring but i wanted to see china it fascinates me 
strongly 
vedernikov hopes to parlay his excellent chinese into a job as a 
businessmen 
i was trained to be a translator but when i finished school 
in 1980 things were still bad between our countries so there were 
no jobs now theres much possibility he said 
the two men said they were impressed at the economic growth in 
china especially at the relative abundance of vegetables and 
consumer goods they also noted the increasing number of private 
businesses of which the crying deer is one 
private or cooperative businesses in the soviet union are just 
beginning but here theyve been going on for about five years 
now said vedernikov i think they can teach us very much 
sun a 61yearold former member of chinas famed eighth route 
army and regarded as the best chef in town agrees 
i say open the borders wide and well show them how to make 
money he said that would be a twist

television sitcoms have always known about it presidential 
politicians have embraced it now the movies are redisovering the 
potent appeal of the family 
sweet hearts dance is the latest variation on the family 
theme and it is an unexpected winner no movie has so touched the 
heart since terms of endearment 
of course you might expect sweet hearts dance to be 
impressive when you note that the writer is ernest thompson his 
play and movie of on golden pond were exquisite depictions of 
the joys and sorrows of old age now he focuses on a younger 
generation of marrieds and abouttobe marrieds contributing an 
equal portion of humanity and understanding 
susan sarandon and don johnson have been married long enough for 
boredom to have set in she tolerates his macho pastimes he 
largely ignores her womanly longings he is a builder and their 
life in a norman rockwellian new england town is comfortable 
familiar and dull 
johnsons best buddy is jeff daniels he is a school principal 
a bit dull but by no means dumb a devout bachelor he is attracted 
to the new teacher in town elizabeth perkins but is wary of 
commitment 
the story is told in seasons each framed like an oldtime 
calendar the seasons change as do the relationships of the four 
characters 
johnson rankling under his loss of freedom finally moves out 
of the family house after a caribbean vacation with his lodge 
members the four lives are sorted out more or less 
a synopsis makes it seem that not much happens in sweet hearts 
dance but it is constantly engrossing tender without excess 
sentiment and often hilarious amazingly the film is the first 
feature directed by robert greenwald a television veteran who has 
a bright future in films 
thompsons script and greenwalds direction give the four stars 
equal opportunity to shine with her wise wondering eyes sarandon 
is the ideal portrayer of the 1980s woman johnson is a revelation 
displaying none of his miami vice schtick daniels is ideal for 
the role as the intelligent innocent and elizabeth perkins 
big registers again as a bright screen presence 
sweet hearts dance has so many moments to cherish that it 
should probably be seen twice for full appreciation 
the tristar release was produced by jeffrey lourie the rating 
is r mostly for language running time 101 minutes

sgt lloyd hopkins is the kind of cop who wears his profession 
on his chest in big red letters hes a cop he makes his own rules 
and breaks others and he doesnt care who he has to whack in order 
to rid the world of bad guys and scum 
all this makes sgt lloyd hopkins james woods infinitely more 
dangerous than jack the ripper 
hes a married man who thinks nothing of giving a hooker a 
whirl and a father who tells his small daughter bedtime stories 
about his violent escapades in the understatement of the video 
year his wife tells him hes a very sick man and she takes the 
kid and leaves him 
hopkins doesnt have time to brood about crimes of the heart 
hes hot on the heels of a serial killer 
hopkins is the one man who thinks a serial killer is involved in 
the obscene murder of a young woman hes convinced she is the 15th 
victim of the same murderer and becomes obsessed in the hunt 
charles durning puts in a good performance as hopkins buddy and 
superior and charles haid of tvs hill street blues is fine as 
a sleazy homosexual cop on the take 
but lesley ann warrens feminist poet the killers secret love 
object sets the womens movement back 50 years shes a whimpering 
idiot who chainsmokes her way into a dangerous situation 
woods who coproduced the movie with director james b harris 
is in just about every scene with his squirrelly look and staccato

one more whimsical fantasy from the steven spielberg factory 
maybe one too many 
hume cronyn and jessica tandy head a cast of oddly assorted 
characters holding out against a ruthless developer who wants to 
buy them out of their crumbling new york tenement so he can build a 
skyscraper when they say no the creep hires a thug to destroy the 
place 
enter the cutest little creatures from outer space you ever saw 
flying saucers with eyes arms and legs who reproduce eat pieces 
of coffee pots and frying pans and most important fix things 
things like broken windows watches doors and eventually the 
entire building 
they also fix broken hearts and minds sparking a romance 
between two of the characters helping cronyn and tandy patch up 
their marriage and rehabilitating a washedup prize fighter who 
hasnt done anything in years but watch tv commercials 
the special effects are fun for a while and kids will put up 
with the ridiculous plot but grownups are likely to gag on the 
treacly sentimentality theres also a fair amount of bashing and 
burning which could prove upsetting for very young children

folk songs childrens melodies jazz tunes and others 
antillesnew directions michal urbaniak 
 
not at all the hodgepodge of styles suggested by the title 
michal urbaniaks folk songs childrens melodies jazz tunes 
and others is amazing wild and beautiful music that should 
not be missed 
urbaniak is a polishborn violinist who has recorded in many 
styles this collection 10 duets with pianist vladislav sendecki 
is hard to pin a label on but it sure sounds good 
the album gets off to a manic joyful start with two songs that 
kick like a pair of size 20 boots by the time munchkins and 
toys corner are over listeners might find themselves gasping 
for air and begging for a break in the action 
urbaniak and sendecki deliver that in septembers a 
meditative piece that leads off a series of slower more relaxed 
songs that are always compelling but on waltz the second song 
on side 2 its off to the races again as the pace picks up before 
winding down with the jazzy finale called montag 
urbaniaks music usually is heavily into electronics but this 
album is all acoustic and theres never a dull moment

our lives since they shopped their homemade demos around and 
landed themselves a record deal 
no it doesnt seem like four years but it has been and this 
bestof package stands as testimony to the fact that the judds

made a harmonious place for themselves in 1980s country music 
nine of the 10 selections here have been released before on the 
judds three studio albums the big hits are present and accounted 
for why not me mama hes crazy girls night out

which continues their proud tradition with a bluesy soulful 
approach

open all night elektra georgia satellites 
 
when the georgia satellites get their sentence in rock history 
books it will surely mention keep your hands to yourself the 
hardrocking tale of sexual frustration that brightened radio 
airwaves in 1986 
trouble is that was on their debut album open all night is 
the satellites second album and predictably lightning doesnt 
strike twice 
the good news about open all night is that the satellites 
didnt tear out their hair trying to rewrite their hit they also 
dont pretend to be anything other than what they are a raunchy 
guitar army trying to fill a void left by the absence of the 
rolling stones 
the bad news is the cupboard is nearly bare for all the 
inspired bashing and banging only a few songs truly stand out 
there are two cover tunes on side 1 which usually signals a lack 
of inspiration 
both jerry lee lewis whole lotta shakin and the beatles 
dont pass me by are given typical raucous workouts but its 
daunting and maybe dangerous to try and top the killer and 
there are reasons why dont pass me by is one of the most 
obscure beatle songs 
sheila is the standout tune on the album and thats an 
original the rockers tend to blur together on the second side 
until the record ends strongly with the bluesy hand to mouth 
featuring excellent guitar by rick richards and the piano of guest 
ian mclagan 
along with assorted girlfriends and roadies the band thanks on 
the album cover mr chuck berry and mr jack daniels that says 
about as much as you need to know about the georgia satellites

richard dreyfuss has this fantasy about his 
opening remarks at the press conference to announce his candidacy 
for us senator from california 
i want to tell you right off that 1 i am a jew 2 i am a 
recovering alcoholic 3 i was arrested on narcotic charges 4 i 
have been in therapy now gimme a break 
no dreyfuss is not prepared to declare his candidacy yet 
maybe in the next century 
by that time ill be 53 years old and ill probably be giving 
up acting he said ive always had two major interests in my 
life outside of acting one is politics the other is teaching so 
if i dont go into politics ill probably become a teacher 
theres little chance of a change of profession right away not 
with his film career once again at a peak after nearextinction 
the dreyfuss story is one of the most remarkable comebacks in 
recent times 
his lowest point was the day after he was arrested i told my 
wife well its over i guess ill have to find something else to 
do he said 
it happened in october 1982 driving down benedict canyon he 
lost control of his mercedesbenz and crashed into a palm tree 
flipping the car over police found two vials of cocaine and 31 
tablets of the narcotic percodan in the car as with most 
firsttime offenders he entered a drug rehabilitation program to 
avoid prosecution 
the drug bust almost sank a career that had already been 
foundering 
i had nothing but flops for four years he admitted its 
pretty hard to rise above something like that 
his mishaps included the big fix the competition 
whose life is it anyway and the buddy system on the last 
film his behavior seemed erratic and word circulated that richard 
dreyfuss was a bad risk 
that might have been the end except that paul mazursky 
happened to see me in a play in new york total abandon said 
dreyfuss he insisted on casting me in down and out in beverly 
hills 
the comedy proved a hit for disneys touchstone pictures and 
dreyfuss appeared in two more successes for the company the tin 
men and stakeout his new film is moon over parador 
reuniting with paul mazursky 
in the universal pictures movie dreyfuss plays a hustling new 
york actor forced to impersonate a recently deceased latin american 
dictator it is a tour de force for him made under rugged 
conditions in the historic brazilian cities of ouro preto and 
salvador de bahia 
costarring with raul julia sonia braga and jonathan winters 
dreyfuss was required to address 8000 brazilians as the latin 
dictator that didnt bother me he said ive addressed 
large crowds before though on other occasions the people 
understood what i was saying 
now 40 he has been an actor most of his life he was born in 
brooklyn but his lawyerfather moved the family to california when 
dreyfuss was 7 the boy grew up among the children of the rich and 
famous in beverly hills he was 9 when he announced he intended to 
become an actor and he occasionally acted in plays and films 
during his teens 
dreyfuss makes no claims to a lost childhood 
during all that time i was a son a brother a student as 
well as an actor he said i had a fairly normal boyhood 
he lasted only a year at san fernando valley state college 
before pursuing a career in earnest in 1973 he attracted notice 
as baby face nelson in dillinger then he joined the 
nowlegendary cast of american graffiti two other blockbusters 
of the 1970s followed jaws and close encounters of the third 
kind 
the climax of the dreyfuss career came with the academy award he 
received as best actor for the goodbye girl then he began the 
downhill race accelerated by bad decisions alcohol and drugs 
dreyfuss was interviewed at a location that symbolizes his 
return to grace he occupies a suite of offices at lorimar studios 
where he is developing film projects he expects to continue the 
arrangement with warner bros which has taken over lorimar 
understandably dreyfuss is weary of reliving his downfall for 
reporters 
recently i ran into barbara walters who asked to interview me 
for her show he said i told her look barbara there is 
only one richard dreyfuss story at the moment and i have already 
told that story in parade magazine usa today etc until there is 
another richard dreyfuss story id rather wait 
you know what she said i have to agree with you

the late abstract expressionist mark 
rothko said he was less interested in color and form than in 
expressing human emotions 
now as harvard university displays a colossal series of rothko 
murals the consequences of the artists philosophy as well as 
years of neglect have become clear 
the three murals some 500 square feet of oil and acrylic on 
canvas have badly faded in the sunlight during the 16 years they 
hung in a harvard dining room so much so that they actually have 
changed color they also suffered rips scratches and splatters 
caused by bumping chairs and spilled food on one panel is scrawled 
the name alan c 
the institution for years was criticized for what was believed 
to be its mishandling of the paintings particularly from devotees 
of the socalled new york school of modern artists cofounded by 
rothko before world war ii 
a new study conducted by harvard scholars has turned up two 
prime culprits the artist and harvard university rothko 
contributed to the demise of the works by using a highly unstable 
paint lithol red to form the background of all three murals 
harvard made matters worse by failing to protect the canvases from 
sunlight and careless visitors 
harvard has gotten so much bad press about the rothkos that we 
didnt feel it would matter if we said again theyre in tough 
shape said marjorie cohn head conservator at harvard 
the color used by rothko has a reputation as a fugitive 
pigment and its fleeting existence on rothkos canvas explains 
why 
the artist apparently had no idea in 1962 when he completed the 
paintings that the color was susceptible to fading his attitude 
toward the subject was revealed in a conversation related by 
elizabeth jones head conservator of harvards fogg art museum in 
the late 1960s 
i said what kind of paint do you use jones recalled in a 
telephone interview he said i use oil paint and if i run out i 
go downstairs to the woolworths and buy whatevers there he 
should have known better 
the fiveanddime paint wasnt up to the conditions in the 
sunfilled penthouse suite in harvard square that housed the murals 
from 1963 until 1979 when scratched scuffed and faded they were 
removed to a vault 
a winedark crimson chosen in honor of harvard formed the 
background color of the murals on two panels the color faded to a 
dull denim blue nearly yale blue and to make matters worse the 
color faded unevenly ruining the intended uniformity of background 
that made the room vibrate with color 
it was like walking into a medieval cathedral at sunset 
said jones who helped unroll and mount the paintings when they 
arrived at harvard 
the paintings are on display at harvards sackler museum through 
oct 2 they are arranged in the same configuration as their 
original setting in the universitys holyoke center but are now far 
from any direct sunlight 
if rothko could see the extent to which these particular 
color relations had been so drastically altered he would most 
likely disown the paintings said harvard associate art professor 
anna chave a rothko expert i think theyre relics basically 
theyre artifacts 
the paintings still have value in chaves view much the way 
leonardos the last supper can move a viewer despite extensive 
deterioration 
they were allowed to be exposed to an incredible amount of 
light in their original installation and thats why they faded so 
drastically chave said no one was doing anything about it 
harvard really did not pay attention to what was happening 
john coolidge former director of the fogg and one of those 
directly involved in promoting rothkos donation of the murals to 
harvard places most of the blame on the artist rothko was 
passionate to create a room but he had not the slightest idea what 
was involved coolidge said meanwhile harvard officials he 
said were loathe to question the quality of his technique 
we were certainly unprepared for the speed with which they went 
rothko was contacted once about the fading of the murals chave 
said he rejected a proposal to varnish the canvases to protect 
them in 1970 at age 67 rothko committed suicide 57 years after 
he came to the united states from the soviet union after his 
death confusion and controversy over control of rothkos estate 
complicated any decision about the harvard paintings 
since then another even larger set of murals at the rothko 
chapel in houston has had to undergo treatment because a chemical 
used in their varnish reacted with the atmosphere to create white 
splotches on black paint 
but dana cranmer former conservator of the rothko foundation 
said rothko is only one of many modern artists whose works have 
fallen victim to decay because of the emphasis on this it does 
look like rothkos the only bad boy in town cranmer said 
willem de kooning used mayonnaise on his paintings longevity is 
low on the totem pole

like the title of her current hit single brenda 
k starr says she still believes stardom will be hers 
i believe in myself but i know it takes time says the 
21yearold singer whose first hit single i still believe has 
climbed the charts to the top 40 
she recently talked about her career in an interview at the 
offices of mca records she compared herself to a long list of 
contemporary artists including janet jackson anita baker and 
diana ross before actually calling herself a young donna 
summer 
starr has been heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and latin 
sounds and she likes her music to have those elements 
however she doesnt like to be compared to other young artists 
such as tiffany or debbie gibson she says theyre too pure 
she prefers being thought of as sexier 
im a romantic starr said 
her selftitled lp contains the popular love ballad i still 
believe as well as more upbeat tracks including the hit what 
you see is what you get most of these danceable tunes portray 
love and happiness with one pop tune that warns against drunken 
driving 
born brenda kaplan on manhattans upper west side she took the 
last name starr because thats what ive always wanted to be a 
star 
she started singing in choirs in grammar and junior high school 
they always had choirs that you could join as a hobby so i took 
singing because i felt it was fun she said 
starr dropped out of high school to put out her first album i 
want your love on mirage records she later realized a lot more 
than singing was involved in the music business and that there was 
a lot more to life than singing so she went back to school to get 
her diploma 
her first big break came when she appeared in the movie beat 
street a 1984 dance film as an auditioning singer she also 
cowrote the songs shadows of the night and vicious beat 
for the movies soundtrack 
her other appearances were with an allgirl breakdancing group 
called the dynamic dolls they once performed in washington for 
president and mrs reagan 
though her father harvey kaplan who sang with the pop group 
spiral staircase was in the music business he wasnt her main 
influence 
my father didnt influence me my mother influenced me 
starr said she always told me i would be successful and if i 
wanted to do something i could do it my father i was happy that 
he was my dad and he had a record out but i wanted to show him 
that i could do just as he could so he would be proud of me now 
im doing it for me 
starr spends a lot of time on the road touring after meetings 
with managers voice lessons and family visits to new york she 
enjoys returning to the tranquility of her new home in north 
bergen nj where shes writing songs for an upcoming album 
whats does starr see in her future 
i want to be married by 24 and have a baby by 25 said the 
singer who already has names picked out for the five children she 
wants theyll be my audience in case theres not enough of one 
i want to be like my mom who had seven its like camp

ive been asked to do movies but havent taken anyone up on 
their offer because im so into my music right now she said

as the story of maverick automaker preston tucker 
is being discovered by moviegoers in the acclaimed george

to labor quietly on the big picture of automobile history 
books on the rich development of the industry and its cultural

james j flinks the automobile age the mit press 25 is 
thick with colorful detail on the industry its leaders and the 
automobile as an icon 
he focuses on all the highlights such as the days when henry 
fords model t democratized the industry by making cars affordable 
for millions of americans 
he then steers us through the emergence of stylized cars at 
general motors under the direction of alfred p sloan jr and the 
legendary harley j earl head of the styling section when gm 
outsold ford in every year from 1931 to 1970 with the exception of 
1935 and 1945 
there also are low points the modern japanese invasion ford 
motor co turning down volkswagen for free after world war ii and 
how under german direction it became by 1972 the bestselling car 
in the history of the automobile industry 
flink blends observations of cultural historians to show the 
many changes wrought by the car culture the disappearance of 
corner grocers and the emergence of the supermarket the 
proliferation of fastfood joints the increased ability of 
millions to vacation at farflung spots the emergence of 
entrepreneurs who had an eye on the road such as howard johnson 
who turned an idea into an empire on short order 
he looks at the car as an emancipator of women as destroyer of 
close relationships with neighbors as a modifier of architecture 
flink is a professor of comparative culture at the university of 
california irvine and affiliated with its institute of 
transportation studies he also is the author of the car

the book is complemented by archival pictures and especially by 
the work of collaborator lucinda lewis a specialist in automobile

whether lewis is focusing her camera on the door of a duesenberg

those hidden personalities behind the wheel get full attention 
in driving passion the psychology of the car faber and faber 
1695 
british authors peter marsh and peter collett explore the car as 
a part of the home we take to the road they see the car as a 
weapon one that can kill and turn even the most affable people 
into hostile aggressors when encountering a tailgater or undimmed 
headlights the automotive equivalent of the hostile stare 
they see the automobile as sanctuary as a provider of the 
sensual delight of speed as a courtship vehicle and as a 
statement of status 
they get right down to the color of cars citing studies that 
show people who have a high desire to achieve are more likely to be 
found in a brown black or gray car and to speed those operating 
at a more casual pace are likely to be found sitting in a red or 
yellow vehicle 
in the recondite asides can be found the identity of the 
millionth victim of an automobile accident and the owner of the 
first vanity license plate a1 issued in britain in 1903 and said 
to be worth around 100000 
but its the thought that counts here the authors look behind 
1950s design for example to tell us how the ubiquitous fins of 
the era grew from a fascination with fighter planes they 
eventually caught on as the main design motif of the day and were 
embellished with snarling grilles clearly intended as a 
subliminal form of threat display and moldings attached to the 
bumpers that were patently erotic

in los angeles and the automobile the making of the modern 
city university of california press 2750 scott l bottles 
traces the battles among railway monopolies merchants consumers 
and city hall that led to the emergence of the first major 
automobile metropolis in the united states 
he says the early rail systems in the city the pacific 
electric railway co and the los angeles railway co of collis p 
huntington whose routes were tied in with his vast real estate 
holdings simply failed to meet consumer demands for efficiency 
and safety 
the automobile became a desired alternative and by 1925 every 
other resident of los angeles owned a car as compared to 1 in 6 
americans elsewhere as early as 1930 with all traffic still 
routed to the central business district fears were raised about 
gridlock 
in 1928 when bullocks department store moved from downtown and 
out to wilshire boulevard the move by retail stores to the suburbs 
was on refinements in trucks helped manufacturers to take the same 
route out of the crowded city then came the freeways to link the 
communities and the rest is the sprawl that is modernday greater

chance to capitalize on the industry 
davis a history professor at the university of ottawa tells 
how detroits old families who had made fortunes in lumber 
mining banking and stove manufacturing shunned henry fords 
commitment to producing affordable cars for the masses and aimed at 
the more expensive market they eventually priced themselves out of 
the fledgling industry even as it grew prodigiously 
by 1910 as competition increased and the ventures got bigger 
and riskier detroits old families took a back seat forever

by the time dwight yoakam and buck owens 
have finished touring together the younger performer may be sorry 
he coaxed the country music legend out of retirement 
at a recent date at the concord pavilion owens took the stage 
after yoakam played several numbers and charged an otherwise 
nonplussed audience prompting this review by joel selvin of the 
san francisco chronicle 
giving buck owens a guest spot on his current tour gave the 
old pro a chance to blast out of retirement like a detonating 
grenade and show the young upstart to be the bogus dilettante he 
is 
ouch 
lucky for yoakam that scores of reviews since he came on the 
scene three years ago have been a tad more adoring 
many say he is the best of the neotraditionalists a 
growing group of nashville and los angeles recording artists who 
have returned to the roots of country shunning the easylistening 
trend of the 1970s but the young upstart prefers a 
straightforward description of his art 
its hillbilly music but a lot of people didnt like that 
term said yoakam taking a break from the tour to promote his 
third album buenos noches from a lonely room the tour 
includes 10 dates with owens 
neotraditionalist is kind of a trite fastfood term he 
said they said the term hillbilly will alienate somebody but 
i realized a long time ago that im not going to please everybody 
performing with owens yoakam is living out a childhood fantasy 
the former hee haw stars effect on yoakams music is evident 
on all three of the younger performers albums culminating in 
their joint effort streets of bakersfield 
besides being musical partners the two have come to be close 
pals yoakam said 
our friendship is whats important and if its fun well do 
it for a little while he said things arent fun more than a 
little while 
like owens and merle haggard yoakam has a reputation as a 
country music rebel turning his back on the nashville 
establishment he cuts his albums in los angeles 
a concept born in bakersfield calif where owens and haggard 
made their first recordings spurning the traditional country music 
structure has become a tradition in itself 
despite his straightfaced stage persona the 32yearold yoakam 
always surprises reporters with his sunny demeanor he seems 
humble articulate and polite in contrast to early reports of his 
penchant for looselipped brashness 
ive had to learn some political lessons in the past few 
years yoakam said but if i was to go into the specifics i 
wouldnt be adhering to the lessons ive learned 
i was and am outspoken i was perhaps naive in expressing 
myself in such a candid way people were reacting on a very 
personal level about it and not accepting it for what it was just 
an opinion 
in the early 80s he became known as a man with a chip on his 
shoulder complaining to and about the nashville establishment he 
said young listeners couldnt get a feel for real country music by 
listening to the current radio fare 
like his earlier albums buenos noches sticks to the roots 
yoakam has been playing much of the albums material for years 
in fact only two of the songs are new compositions including the 
title track and what i dont know 
i think this album is a little deeper emotional statement 
yoakam said the publics view of me i have to remember all the 
time is 20 songs old my view of myself is ancient at this point 
ive been with my music since i was a child 
for 11 years he worked the los angeles club circuit the roots 
of his success he said lie in his affiliation with wizard 
guitarist pete anderson whom he met while both were still 
struggling 
he was on the club scene playing guitar i was camping in the 
laundry room of his place at one point yoakam said he 
believed in what i was doing musically that moral support was very 
important 
anderson who plays on the current tour has produced all of 
yoakams albums and is gaining a reputation as a producer for other 
recording artists the first two yoakam albums guitars 
cadillacs etc and hillbilly deluxe went gold 
although he now owns a house in the hollywood hills and two 
vintage cadillac convertibles one a gift from owens yoakam is 
quick to point out that it wasnt too long ago that he was hauling 
for a storage company and driving airfreight trucks 
my memorys not failed me i worked and starved for 12 years 
of my life when i couldnt afford but one room

the pentagons going to war against the 
insect repellent that troops have been using for two decades 
the old one melted plastic watch crystals and eyeglass frames 
and left an oily feeling on their skin said lt col lyman w 
roberts who helped coordinate the new version generally they 
just didnt like it 
it also smelled so bad that there was a feeling particularly 
in vietnam that an enemy could smell you if you were wearing it 
said paul klein walter reed army institute of research spokesman 
in washington 
the new repellent which looks like hand cream and comes in a 
green plastic tube will be in the hands of servicemen by next 
summer it was developed in a 43 million effort directed by the 
us army medical material development activity at fort detrick 
and was prompted in part by a 1983 survey 
fortyfive percent of the 1542 soldiers questioned seldom or 
ever used the repellent issued since the 1960s and 62 percent said 
the army needed a better one fiftyfour percent used commercial 
repellents because they smelled better felt better on their skin 
and lasted longer 
the old version was 75 percent diethyltoluamide commonly called 
deet and 25 percent alcohol roberts said the new product 35 
percent deet and with no alcohol has a milder odor it protects 
for up to 12 hours vs four hours with the old version and doesnt 
wash or wear off as easily 
the new repellent has been tested in thailand pakistan egypt 
panama honduras australia africa and alaska it protects against 
diseasecarrying arthropods such as mosquitos chiggers fleas 
biting flies deer flies and stable flies the insects can carry 
diseases such as malaria scrub typhus lyme disease dengue fever 
sand fly fever and rift valley fever 
it still will melt and cloud some cheap plastic items if you 
let it set for a while roberts said but its not as bad as 
the old product that would make a hole in the plastic

from the first dry hole to big bertha the 
worlds most productive drill bit the records trivia and history 
that give the oil bidness its unique colorful character have 
been chronicled by an industry trade journal 
drilling magazine updating a list it first ran five years 
ago is giving its 20000 readers primarily wellsite operators 
some targets to shoot for and records to brag about 
its sort of the oil industrys guinness book says editor 
mike killalea who compiled the facts appearing in the current 
issue of the bimonthly magazine im very much interested in the 
curiosity and the oddball while penetration rates and footage 
distances are incredible they dont grip the imagination 
so besides records like the deepest first and most productive 
well the magazines list includes such items as how the term 
derrick got its name where the first dry hole was drilled and 
the strangest well blowout 
the us oil industry is generally given a birth year of 1859 
with the discovery of crude in venango county pa on land owned 
by the watson amp brewer lumber co the well generally is known as 
the drake discovery well so named for edwin drake president of 
seneca oil of new haven conn the well owner 
but whats less wellknown is the first dry hole in neighboring 
warren county pa it also carries the distinction of the worlds 
second oil well started four days after the drake well more 
dubious its the first well in which oil tools got stuck 
magazine editors also have decided the strangest well blowout 
occurred in april 1 1984 in texas palo pinto county when the 
mitchell lease no 1 well blew and was shut quickly as a safety 
precaution the next day however an explosion two miles away was 
blamed on the shut well apparently pressure built up and traveled 
along a layer of rock and salt 250 feet underground until surfacing 
two miles away 
the term derrick by the way is named after a famous 
english hangman who skillfully practiced his trade around 1600 he 
was so notorious that his name was applied to anything that was 
hoisted or lifted and in oil a derrick is the structure that 
lifts pipe in and out of the hole 
new entries to the record book include 
the deepest waterdepth oil discovery in the gulf of mexico a 
13600foot hole in 3560 feet of water 55 miles east of the 
mississippi river delta 
the deepest waterdepth drilling in the world 7520 feet gulf 
of mexico nov 5 1987 the hole reached 17430 feet before the 
drillship was moved feb 16 1988 
the most productive drill bit big bertha a 17inch bit 
manufactured by houstonbased hycalog drilled 18016 feet in 16 
runs in five north sea wells with no repair between wells the bit 
used in 1987 and this year made more holes in the north sea than 
any other single bit and its mark of going through more than 
30000 cubic feet of rock could make it the most productive single 
drill bit of all time 
us state deepdrilling marks on the books include a well of 
20335 feet in alaska set in 1979 22712 in california reached 
in 1987 louisianas 25703 feet in 1980 29670 feet in texas in 
1982 and 31441 feet in 1974 in oklahoma which used to be the 
worlds deepest and may be again 
a 40000foot well being drilled in the soviet union cited five 
years ago as the worlds deepest since then has caved in 
according to unidentified sources quoted by drilling magazine 
glasnost or no glasnost its not the easiest thing to find 
out killalea says i ultimately did discover that the well 
caved in a year and a half ago so they dont have that claim of 
the worlds deepest any more 
killalea says he called the soviet embassy in washington for 
confirmation and was told to send a letter 
they were very nice and told me they would get back to me 
he says im waiting to hear from them

over a year ago and 31 percent from the previous month the finance 
ministry announced monday 
the surplus in japans international trade fell to 494 billion

of declines to grow by 31 percent over the previous years level 
japans trade surplus with the united states declined by 127 
percent in august over the previous year to 325 billion the 
ministry said 
looking at the overall trend the volume and value of imports 
are growing and cutting into japans surplus the government is 
also stimulating domestic demand in an attempt to curtail its 
overseas trade surplus said a finance ministry official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
imports surged by 273 percent on a dollar basis from the 
previous years level to a record 1586 billion for august the 
ministry said

the dollar in contrast with 15083 yen in august 1987 and 13140 
yen last month 
the ministry said japans trade surplus with the united states 
declined in part because of major hikes in imports of us food in 
august 
imports of fish soared by 1053 percent while those of meat 
rose by 996 percent the ministry reported imports of nonferrous 
metals also increased growing by 1404 percent over the previous

the european economic community said 
monday it hopes president reagan vetoes the textile and apparel 
trade bill sanctioned by the us senate last week 
european external relations commissioner willy de clercq said 
that the bill if signed into law would inevitably lead to the 
collapse of the multifiber agreement which regulates world trade 
in textiles 
de clercq also claimed it would seriously jeopardize the 
uruguay round of international trade negotiations in which trade 
representatives are attempting to improve the global trade system 
including easing trade barriers between countries 
the us senate approved draft legislation friday that would put 
limits on us imports of textiles apparel and shoes the vote was 
too short however to override an expected veto by president 
reagan the measure must also be approved by the us house of 
representatives before being sent to reagan 
de clercq said that the senates move can only add to existing 
uncertainty in world trade because it came soon after last 
months enactment of the us trade bill which the european 
commission considers to be protectionist 
de clercq said that he hoped the us administrations 
opposition to the bill would be maintained and that president 
reagan would veto the draft law 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater already said president 
reagan would veto the bill if it reaches his desk reagan vetoed an 
earlier version of the textile trade bill last year after it was 
passed by the house of representatives

the song remains the same in advertising for us 
automakers in the 1989 model year with the exception of a little 
fine tuning 
only the oldsmobile division of general motors corp has created 
a new campaign for 1989 
in previous years companies experimented with new themes such 
as patriotism or comparisons for 1989 theyre playing it safe 
using standard themes to push their automobiles 
the crew of engineers in nissans built for the human race 
ads have been eliminated in favor of scenes of cars for example 
at the very least with consistency youre creating something 
people can identify you with said thomas healey director of 
media and advertising for jd power amp associates in agoura hills 
calif 
companies also are playing it safe by hiring the real thing to 
sing their commercial jingles instead of soundalike musicians 
a federal appeals court ruled in june that singer and actress bette 
midler could proceed with a 10 million lawsuit against ford motor 
co and its ad agency young amp rubicam for intentionally imitating 
her vocal style after she turned down an offer to do the jingle 
herself 
gms chevrolet division hired soul singer aretha franklin to 
belt out a new rendition of its heartbeat theme song 
oldsmobile is turning its advertising focus on younger viewers 
after research showed its image was that of a stodgy family car 
our product was getting younger and it was time for our image 
to catch up said warren christell oldsmobile general marketing 
manager we needed to drive that message home 
slated to appear in oldsmobile spots are actress priscilla 
presley and her daughter actor william shatner and his daughter 
and singer frankie avalon and his son 
at mercury the tag line is changing from the shape you want 
to be in to where comfort and control are one with golfer 
jack nicklaus teeing off this month as spokesman for lincoln 
continental 
the dodge division of chrysler corp is replacing its yearold 
tag of its gotta be a dodge with the new spirit of dodge 
while us carmakers are wooing the younger crowd foreign car 
makers have their sights set on the older generation 
the demographics are changing from the baby boom to the senior 
boom said gerry rubin president of rubin postaer amp associates 
a los angeles firm that represents honda motor corp were 
tilting more toward that older group 
while its ads wont change dramatically honda promotions will 
appear in publications such as 50 plus magazine and on 
television shows such as murder she wrote 
honda television ads will continue to feature the voice of actor 
daniel j travanti and the sights and sounds of actor james garner 
still will be used in mazda ads

publishing giant macmillan inc target of 
unwanted takeover offers for four months said today that it will 
be bought by the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co in a 
cash deal that values the company at 236 billion 
the announcement came after reports surfaced that macmillan 
officials had negotiated this weekend with kohlberg kravis a 
private partnership that has helped other large companies thwart 
unwelcome takeovers 
kohlberg kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts in which a 
company is acquired through mostly borrowed money repaid from the 
target companys profits or asset sales 
macmillan said in a brief announcement that kolhberg kravis had 
formed a subsidiary to begin a tender offer of 85 cash per share 
for up to 261 million shares of the company or 94 percent of the 
total the offer values the companys 2776 million shares at about 
236 billion 
the announcement was the latest twist in a takeover battle waged 
since may for macmillan a large new yorkbased publishing concern 
and leading supplier of college textbooks the company owns other 
operations that range from the berlitz foreign language training 
program to katharine gibbs clerical schools 
a group headed by british publisher robert maxwell had been 
attempting to buy macmillan and last week offered to raise its 
80ashare offer to 84 a share a group headed by texas investor 
robert bass has offered 75 a share 
the company had spurned offers from both and sought to 
restructure itself to thwart a takeover by selling the information 
division 
the bass group which owns about 92 percent of macmillans 
shares had successfully challenged the move in court but the 
company said today that because of the planned acquisition by 
kohlberg kravis it is scrapping the restructuring plan 
rumors that macmillan had enlisted the help of kohlberg kravis 
helped boost the price of the companys stock friday by 362 to 
8387 in composite new york stock exchange trading 
in early trading today macmillan rose to 8462

winnebagos those behemoths of americas wideopen 
spaces were launched in the home of the compact car on monday with 
the blessings of the japanese government 
with a logo suggesting japans forested mountains and blue 
lakes the venture announced between mitsubishi corp and winnebago 
industries inc of forest city iowa had the glitz of professional 
marketing 
mitsubishi coined the slogan mobilie mobile plus ie the 
word for home in japanese to try to sell the 122 million japanese 
on the american concept of familystyle recreational vehicles as a 
way to enjoy their countrys scenery 
the japanese government is seeking to cut japans 60 billion 
annual trade surplus with the united states by encouraging more 
imports of american goods into japan 
lauding the linkup were us commerce secretary c william 
verity iowa gov terry branstad and hajime tamura the powerful 
japanese minister of international trade and industry 
tamura one of the top political figures in japan came to the 
lavish party mitsubishi threw at a former imperial mansion and he 
drew a public pledge from company president shinroku morohashi to 
go allout to sell winnebagos 
if a japanese trading house like mitsubishi starts a 
fullfledged program it will succeed without fail tamura said 
asking morohashi to shake hands with verity and pledge to make an 
allout effort to succeed 
with a smile morohashi obliged 
verity commented with mitsubishi marketing this product i 
predict that this will be an immediate success 
the commerce secretary is here leading executives of 25 us 
consumerproducts companies on a mission to penetrate the big but 
difficult japanese market their slogan is market japan with 
americas best and the products include jewelry pet foods 
furniture sailboats power boats and sporting goods 
the party for winnebago was the centerpiece of the weeklong 
mission and the guests included members of the diet japans 
parliament as well as iowa government officials 
morohashi said his company regarded the motor home as one of 
the great achievements of american industry and predicted it will 
be a success as more leisure time encourages the japanese to do 
more things outdoors 
the market is very promising for the future he said 
only in japan could such a symbol of american gigantism be 
launched in a room where the decor included bonsai the purposely 
stunted trees that are a symbol of the miniaturism of this country 
of small cars and narrow roads 
gasoline costs almost 350 a gallon in japan and previous 
attempts to market japanesemade camper vans have fizzled because 
of the expense of fuel and lack of campgrounds for them but japan 
is richer now and mitsubishi says legislation will encourage the 
spread of campgrounds 
winnebago vice president gerald boman who had four of his 
smaller rv models on display outside the mansion said the 
30yearold company now exports only 05 percent of the 12000 to 
14000 units produced annually 
boman hoped the mitsubishi marketing will help increase exports 
to about 10 percent of production all of which takes place in iowa 
america has learned much from the japanese especially in 
motor manufacturing he said now we hope to share with the 
japanese people what we learned in our own experience in the 
leisure industry 
the governor who grew up in forest city iowa where winnebago 
is headquartered expressed delight at the opening to japans 
market 
this is a very major step forward by american industry and we 
are very proud that a company based in iowa is leading the way here 
in japan branstad said 
as the party ended boman was asked how he felt to have such 
lavish promotion and government backing its a great 
relationship he said and this has been a fantastic trip

the next time you hear your congressman defend 
trade protection through quotas higher tariffs or buy america 
programs you might consider asking him the cost 
it is through this sort of question that patriotic fervor which 
some people think doesnt cost a cent confronts the individual 
budgets of american households 
good or bad trade protection is costly forcing up the prices 
of domestic and imported goods by amounts that might surprise most 
people by one estimate it costs every man woman and child in 
america an average of 270 a year 
that estimate by economist gary hufbauer of georgetown 
university is based on his calculation of a total cost per year of 
65 billion or nearly double the tab as recently as 1980 
how could that be ask americans who believe that the american 
economy is as remarkably open to foreigners as foreign markets are 
closed to americans 
charles oliver who studied the matter for the citizens for a 
sound economy foundation concluded that it isnt so that 
contrary to popular belief the united states has become more 
protectionist over the last decade 
he says that 35 percent of all us manufactured goods were 
protected by some form of trade barrier in 1986 compared with just 
8 percent in 1975 the result he says is that americans are 
paying through the nose 
in addition to raiding consuumers pockets he says trade 
barriers invite other countries to retaliate against american 
industries 
he cites two incidents as examples 
when the united states imposed tariffs on canadian cedar in 
1986 canada responded with restrictions on american computers and 
grains 
when the united states placed restrictions on 50 million worth 
of chinese textiles in 1983 beijing cancelled american wheat 
contracts worth 699 million 
the united states maintains tariffs in excess of 20 percent on 
light trucks ceramic tile cedar shingles fruit juice footwear 
and clothing among other goods in some instances quotas are 
added to tariffs 
there are service restrictions as well oliver notes that the 
domestic air travel market is reserved for domestic airlines and 
that only usregistered ships are allowed to carry passengers and 
cargo between usports 
in fact the international monetary fund in 1987 ranked the 
united states as no better than average in its amount of protected 
trade 
the cost of trade protection is often obscured by other issues 
mainly the preservation of jobs but oliver cites a study made last 
year that shows more jobs were lost than created by protection of 
the textile industry 
that study shows protectionist measures did indeed save about 
46000 textile jobs at an alleged cost of 220000 each but 
that 52440 jobs were destroyed in retailing transportation and 
other importdependent areas 
such examples oliver indicates are among the more publicized 
but he observes hidden away in various regulatory areas are many 
lesser known limitations that inexorably add to the cost of living 
in the united states 
in insurance for example a common barrier forces foreign firms 
to pay higher state fees for licenses some state regulations 
require these companies to invest premiums within the united states 
what it amounts to says oliver is that before politicians try 
to raise trade barriers they should consider the costs of those 
already on the books including the net cost of jobs lost

undermined by weakening oil prices gold fell 
sharply monday in volatile european trading 
gold finished 755 an ounce lower in london after plunging 
1150 an ounce in zurich where trading ended early because of a 
holiday 
the dollar was mixed at the end of extremely quiet trading as 
market players sat on their positions before the release of us 
trade figures for july from the commerce department in washington 
zurich traders said the plunge in gold prices which began in 
new york on friday caught them completely by surprise 
i hate to admit it but were tending weaker psychologically 
if not fundamentally said one zurich trader 
weaker prices for oil and other commodities have calmed fears of 
inflation that has dampened demand for gold which investors 
historically have used as a hedge against inflation 
but traders said trading activity was limited although they 
reported good demand at lower prices around 417 
in new york financial activity was expected to be muted through 
tuesday because of rosh hashana the jewish new year holiday and 
traders said they anticipated the lull would keep the market a bit 
thinner than usual 
gold fell in london to a late bid price of 41925 a troy ounce 
compared with 42680 bid late friday 
in zurich gold was quoted at 418 when the market closed early 
down from 42950 late friday 
earlier in hong kong gold fell 560 to close at 41918 
silver bullion also fell sharply on the london market where the 
metal was trading at a late bid price of 641 a troy ounce 
compared with 663 friday 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar inched up earlier in 
the day for no particular reason but was knocked back by 
intervention by the west german central bank when it rose above 
18500 marks 
dealers said they expect the dollar to stay in its current range 
until the july trade report wednesday 
we have a serious case of the trade figure scenario said 
david deacon senior dealer at ebcamro bank in london in recent 
months foreign exchange trading has stalled in the days before a 
trade balance report 
market expectations are for a monthly trade gap of between 11 
billion and 12 billion compared with 1254 billion in june 
in london the dollar gained against the british pound it cost 
16958 to buy one pound cheaper than 16980 late friday 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late friday 
18453 west german marks down from 18490 15535 swiss francs 
down from 15620 62775 french francs down from 62865 20817 
dutch guilders down from 20835 137850 italian lire down from 
137950 12395 canadian dollars unchanged 
in tokyo where the business day ends as europes begins the 
dollar edged up 047 yen to close at 13342 yen later in london

us sprint communication cos operating 
losses in the third quarter of 1988 should be sharply reduced from 
the 165 million it lost in the same period of last year and the 
112 million lost in the second quarter of this year william 
esrey united telecommunications inc president and chief executive 
officer said monday 
esrey said that based on results in july and august us sprint 
is expected to have pretax losses of no more than 35 million in 
the quarter ending sept 30 
the longdistance telephone service is operated as a partnership 
of united telecom and gte corp they now own equal amounts but 
united telecom will purchase an additional 301 percent interest 
for more than 600 million in january 1989 
esrey said factors contributing to the improved performance were 
continued growth in net revenue and improved control of expenses 
he said the correction of billing system problems which adversely 
affected results in previous periods was a major factor 
moving customer traffic from leased lines and microwave 
facilities onto us sprints new fiberoptics network also 
contributed to operating efficiency he said 
while much work remains to be done we are very pleased with 
the recent progress we have made esrey said us sprint is now 
in position to exceed our internal shortterm objectives

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed 
monday on the chicago board of trade in light uneventful trading 
ahead of the agriculture departments new crop production report 
most soybean futures contracts were sharply lower wheat was 
higher and corn was narrowly mixed 
it was real quiet said cathy leow assistant vice president 
for grain futures trading at thomson mckinnon securities inc in 
new york 
she attributed most of the trading to positionbalancing before 
the report adding that a flurry of selling in the soybean trading 
pit minutes before the close doesnt mean a heck of a lot it all 
depends on what the usda says 
traders generally expected the government to again reduce its 
corn and soybean harvest projections because of drought damage to 
the crops analysts said 
but at least one private grain analyst conrad leslie of 
chicago had predicted only very slight reductions from the usdas 
august harvest projections of 448 billion bushels of corn and 147 
billion bushels of soybeans 
the new estimates released after the close of trading were 
446 billion bushels of corn or about 37 percent less than last 
years harvest 147 billion bushels of soybeans or about 23 
percent less than last years crop and 181 billion bushels of 
wheat or about 14 percent less than last years crop the wheat 
estimate compares with the august usda estimate of 182 billion 
bushels 
at the close wheat was cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 402 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to cent higher with september at 286 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to 4 cents higher with september at 266 a 
bushel soybeans were 11 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
september at 870 a bushel

the dollar weakened marginally monday in light 
trading reflecting what money brokers called their reluctance to 
speculate in advance of the governments marketjolting monthly 
trade deficit reports 
gold ended barely changed in the united states after a wild day 
in which precious metals prices tracked the volatile oil market 
republic national bank in new york quoted gold at 42135 a troy 
ounce at 4 pm edt down 10 cents from friday 
currency traders said the dollars behavior typified a pattern 
that has emerged in days just prior to the commerce departments 
merchandise trade deficit reports which have the potential of 
setting off sharp selloffs or rallies in the financial markets the 
july deficit figures are due wednesday 
the dollar stayed in a narrow range today and essentially went 
nowhere said stuart yannalfo senior foreign exchange trader at 
refco inc a new york commodities futures concern everybodys 
waiting for that trade number 
the consensus among foreignexchange houses is for a july 
deficit of between 11 billion and 12 billion compared with 
1254 billion in june but the unpredictability of these numbers 
has made many traders reluctant to take risky positions in dollars 
until after the report is issued 
in tokyo the dollar edged up 047 yen to close at 13342 yen 
later in london the dollar was quoted at 13350 yen by the time 
trading concluded in new york the dollar weakened to 13335 yen 
off from 13361 yen friday 
the dollar gained against the british pound in london where 
sterling was quoted at 16958 vs 16980 friday later in new 
york the pound strengthened a bit to 16974 more expensive than 
the 16970 price friday 
other latedollar rates in new york vs levels late friday 
included 18465 west german marks down from 18493 15540 swiss 
francs down from 15617 12367 canadian dollars down from 
12396 62815 french francs down from 62890 and 137885 
italian lire down from 1382125 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late friday 
18453 west german marks down from 18490 15535 swiss francs 
down from 15620 62775 french francs down from 62865 20817 
dutch guilders down from 20835 137850 italian lire down from 
137950 and 12395 canadian dolars unchanged 
traders were more active in the gold market which has weakened 
recently because of speculation about a renewed oilprice war 
prices plunged in europe but rebounded in new york tracking the 
path of energy futures 
cheaper energy prices could partly erase the effects of 
inflation historically a key reason that investors buy gold 
for the last couple of weeks the price of gold and precious 
metals have been following the oil market said joanne nagelhout 
a marketing analyst at amark precious metals a large trading 
concern in los angeles oil went down under 13 a barrel and 
rallied back up over 14 gold did the same thing the market has 
not stabilized 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold for current delivery 
closed at 42120 unchanged from friday when prices closed 
sharply lower 
in london gold plunged to 41925 down from 42680 late 
friday in zurich gold fell to 418 down from 42950 friday and 
in hong kong gold fell to 41918 from 42478 friday 
silver followed a similar pattern ending largely unchanged in 
the united states after plunging abroad silver eased 3 cent to

ford motor co which holds just less 
than a fourth of the fastgrowing minivan market with its aerostar 
announced plans monday to join with nissan motor corp to make a 
minivan in northeastern ohio 
the project which is to deliver the new vehicles to showroom 
floors in three years will involve a 1 billion ford investment 
about 90 percent of which is to be spent at fords van plant in 
avon lake ohio company vice chairman harold poling said at a news 
conference 
the factory which paints and assembles bodies for econoline and 
club wagon vans will double in size to 22 million square feet and 
will employ another 1300 people bringing total employment to 
nearly 2800 
ford spokesman jay meisenhelder said the company first would 
draw employees from a pool of laidoff ford workers before hiring 
people new to the company 
preparation of the plant site will begin later this month or 
early october poling said 
yoshio arakawa a nissan director told a news conference in 
tokyo that nissans investment in the venture would be small by 
comparison to fords 
our basic responsibility is development so our investment is 
going to be rather small arakawa told reporters 
arakawa said nissan will take over the design and engineering of 
the new multipurpose vehicle and supply parts provided by its 
manufacturing subsidiary the nissan motor manufacturing corp in 
smyrna tenn 
ford will assemble and provide most of the components of the new 
minivan about 75 percent of the components in the new vehicle will 
be made in north america poling said 
the venture would be the third formed by the two companies in 
1969 ford and nissan joined with mazda motor corp in the japan 
automatic transmission co ford sold its share to nissan in 1984 
more recently ford and nissan agreed to market versions of each 
others utility vehicles in australia 
ford and mazda a year ago began assembly of two cars at a plant 
in flat rock mich south of detroit ford owns 25 percent of 
mazda 
the newest project poling said will give us an additional 
vehicle in a market niche that has grown from 5 percent of the 
total truck market in 1984 to 12 percent in 1987 and is projected 
at 18 percent to 19 percent for the 1993 model year 
poling said only styling work has been completed so far on the 
new minivan which is expected to be in production in the fall of 
1991 for the 1992 model year about 130000 of the vehicles are 
expected to be produced annually a relatively small number 
considering the size of the work force 
the new minivan will be a more passengeroriented vehicle than 
the minivan that ford sells now the aerostar which has cargo and 
trailerhauling capabilities 
the aerostar held 22 percent of the compact van market during 
the first eight months of this year general motors corp and 
chrysler corp also produce minivans along with toyota motor corp 
mitsubishi and volkswagen but the imports hold just 4 percent of 
the minivan market 
i think its a great deal for ford said auto analyst 
maryann keller of furman selz mager deietz and birney of new york 
city ford has a marvelous way of working with japanese partners 
to find products that are of mutual interest and mutual benefit to 
both parties 
thats something gm has never been able to do she added 
chrysler is still struggling to find its way with mitsubishi

the governments new cropproduction estimates only slightly 
lower than predictions made a month ago surprised many grain 
market analysts and should trigger a drop in corn and soybean 
futures prices experts said monday 
grain and soybean futures settled mixed monday on the chicago 
board of trade in light trading ahead of the agriculture 
departments report soybeans were lower wheat was higher and corn 
futures were mixed 
on other markets energy futures finished higher in a volatile 
session precious metals were lower livestock and meat futures 
were mixed and stockindex futures retreated slightly 
the usda estimated 1988 us corn production at 446 billion 
bushels compared with its august estimate of 448 billion bushels 
the agency pegged the soybean crop at 147 bilion bushels 
virtually unchanged from last month and the usda predicted a wheat 
harvest of 181 billion bushels compared with augusts estimate of 
182 billion 
although the numbers reflect severe drought damage and represent 
sharp reductions from last years harvest 37 percent less corn 
23 percent fewer soybeans and 14 percent less wheat they were 
more optimistic than the market had anticipated and so were 
expected to exert downward pressure on prices especially in 
soybeans and corn 
i think corn will be down 3 to 4 cents beans 10 cents or so 
maybe even more said victor lespinasse a trader with dean 
witter reynolds inc in chicago 
other traders said soybean futures prices could drop as much as 
20 cents a bushel at tuesdays opening 
cathy leow vice president of grain futures trading with thomson 
mckinnon securities inc in new york said spotmarket sales of 
corn and soybeans linked to the advancing harvest already were 
weakening the futures markets 
between the numbers and the harvest it probably means the 
markets not going higher in the short run she said we may 
just move sideways for a while we wont go higher we wont go 
lower well trade in a range 
for the wheat market which has shown some vigor recently on 
expectations of rising export demand the usda report also had some 
bullish news 
the government reduced its projection for 198889 soviet grain 
production by 5 million metric tons to 205 million and raised its 
projected soviet grain imports estimate to 27 million metric tons 
from 25 million 
the usda also reduced its projection for the canadian wheat 
harvest by 26 million metric tons to 154 million 
but lespinasse said wheat prices still could decline tuesday in 
sympathy with corn and soybeans 
wheat settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in september at 402 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 
cent higher with september at 286 a bushel oats were 2 cents 
lower to 3 cents higher with september at 261 a bushel soybeans 
were 11 cents lower to cent higher with september at 870 a 
bushel 
crude oil futures touched twoyear lows below 14 a barrel on 
selling tied to the glut of oil caused by opec overproduction then 
rallied late in the session to finish well above fridays closing 
levels 
shahrokh nikkah vice president in charge of energy futures at 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york attributed the dramatic 
turnaround on the new york mercantile exchange to two announcements 
from saudi arabia a major opec member 
he said saudi arabia asked its fellow members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries and also nonopec oil 
producers to show some restraint in their production 
the saudis also formally denied a rumor that they opposed 
calling a meeting of opecs pricing committee to discuss the 
overproduction problem he said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents to 38 cents 
higher with october at 1449 a barrel heating oil was 56 cent to 
81 cent higher with october at 4168 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 56 cent to 110 cents higher with october at 4262 
cents a gallon 
precious metals futures finished slighty lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange but well above the days lows 
gold settled 30 cents to 160 lower with october at 42280 a 
troy ounce silver was 30 cent to 12 cents lower with september 
at 6437 a troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed on the chicago

cent higher with september at 7965 cents a pound hogs were 13

the son of the founder of the carls jr 
hamburger chain was ordered monday to repay 10500 as part of a 
federal insider trading suit against him and 15 other relatives and 
company officers 
carl leo karcher was ordered to give up the amount he avoided in 
losses by acting on inside information to sell debt securities in 
carl karcher enterprises inc in 1984 
in ordering the penalty us district judge edward rafeedie 
declined to impose treble damages as had been requested by the 
securities and exchange commission which filed the insidertrading 
civil suit the judge issued a permanent injunction barring karcher 
from future insider trades 
the case continues against other defendants including carls 
jr founder carl n karcher his brother and various of their 
spouses and children 
the sec case holds that karchers their inlaws and one 
nonfamily official of the west coast hamburger chain acted on 
confidential advance notice of an unfavorable earnings report to 
sell securities and avoid potential losses in october 1984 they 
are accused of avoiding losses totaling 300000 and treble 
damages could bring a total judgment against them to over 1 
million 
the attorney for carl leo karcher claimed that mondays ruling 
represented a partial victory for his client who maintained he 
didnt know he had broken any laws by selling karcher debentures in 
october 1984 in refusing to impose treble damages the judge in 
essence found karcher hadnt committed an egregious violation of 
securities law the attorney said 
it indicates to me that the judge concluded that he was not a 
willful violator of the law armstrong said were disappointed 
the court found there was a violation because karcher did believe 
he had the right to sell 
the sec will attempt to find the buyer of the securities and 
give him the money assessed karcher armstrong said the defendant 
who was a vice president of anaheimbased karcher enterprises at 
the time of the trades presently operates a string of 16 carls 
jr franchises in the palm springs and yuma ariz areas 
the sec case filed in april revolves around trading 
irregularities uncovered in random computer checks by the national 
association of securities dealers 
it shook many in orange county where the elder karcher who 
appears in folksy commercials for the 450outlet hamburger chain 
is regarded as an american success story and social benefactor 
the 1984 losses were attributed by some to a business downturn 
following the olympic games and have since been reversed the 
company made a 16 million profit on sales of 369 million in 1987 
in mondays case karcher didnt contest the facts of the case 
that he put in an order to his broker to sell 75 debentures a form 
of corporate debt the morning of oct 19 that afternoon after 
being told by a company official such a sale was improper because 
it was based on an unreleased earnings report he ordered the sale 
stopped but 50 of the debentures had been sold 
named in the sec civil suit in addition to carl leo karcher and 
his father carl n karcher are the elder karchers brother 
donald f karcher president and chief operating officer the 
karcher enterprises and alvin deshano a vice president 
also carl n karchers son jerome daughters barbara

apple computer inc announced price 
increases monday for some of its personal computers external 
drives monitors printers and expansion kits 
the price hikes result from rising component costs and changing 
global market conditions according to charles boesenberg apple 
usa senior vice president of sales and marketing 
to continue fulfilling the increasingly high demand for our 
products we are required to pursue more costly channels for 
dynamic random access memory dram acquisition thereby increasing 
the component costs of our products boesenberg said 
the two biggest price jumps at 29 percent each are in the 
macintosh ii increasing to 4869 from 3769 and the laserwriter 
iint controller card up to 2699 from 2099 
the apple iigs rises 15 percent to 1149 from 999 the price 
of the macintosh plus remains unchanged at 1799 
company spokeswoman carleen levasseur said apples dramatic 
growth during the past year has forced the company to place orders 
for drams with new vendors and to trade at premium prices on the 
spot market 
this has proven more expensive for the company than purchasing 
components from apples traditional sources she said noting the 
shortage of drams is expected to continue well into the next year

in view of continuing uncertainties that have delayed the sale 
of the assets of celestial seasonings to thomas j lipton inc the 
agreement between kraft and lipton has been terminated kraft 
said in a statement from its headquarters in glenview ill 
the new deal was a victory for rc bigelow inc another maker

would violate antitrust laws by uniting the nations two largest 
sellers of herbal tea

a new york private investment firm and members of celestial 
seasonings management including barnet m feinblum who will 
continue as president and chief executive officer and assume

their sleepytime lemon zinger mandarin orange and other herbal 
teas

the equal employment opportunity commission 
asked a federal court monday to hold united airlines in contempt 
for failing to hire enough blacks and women as pilots 
in a motion filed in us district court in chicago the 
commission charged that united has failed to abide by a 1976 
consent decree in which the airline agreed to hire qualified 
minority and women pilots at double the rate at which they applied 
for the jobs in relation to white males 
for example according to eeoc officials if united had 100 
qualified applicants for 10 jobs and 10 of the applicants were 
women or blacks at least two of the 10 new people hired would have 
to be women or blacks under the consent decree 
based on data provided by the company the eeoc said united 
received more than 32500 applications for entrylevel pilot 
positions between 1985 and 1987 
among the 1400 pilots hired 75 were blacks or other minorities 
and 59 were women a ratio smaller than the share of blacks and 
women in the pool of applicants the commission said 
the motion also alleges that united established a selection 
criteria that was not approved by the eeoc and then used some of 
the criteria selectively to benefit white males 
we feel that some of the interviewing and evaluation standards 
were subjective and were applied subjectively said renee devine 
a spokeswoman for the commission 
joe hopkins a spokesman for united said the airline has met 
eeoc minority and women hiring targets for several categories of 
workers minorities now comprise 22 percent of uniteds total work 
force and 148 percent of its management positions he said 
however hopkins acknowledged that with the exception of june 
this year the airline has not met the consent agreements goals in 
putting women and blacks in pilot seats 
were in tremendous competition with every other major airline 
that has the same objective in trying to attract minority and 
women pilots he said theres more demand than supply 
nonetheless we are making progress and taking some steps to make 
more progress in the future 
among those steps hopkins listed recent affiliations with 
southern illinois university and delaware state college aimed 
specifically at recruiting women and blacks into uniteds pilot 
ranks and the planned development of a company scholarship program 
in addition to the contempt citation the commission is seeking 
courtordered relief that includes job offers back pay and 
retroactive seniority for as many as 3000 women and blacks who it 
says were denied employment due to discrimination 
the case dates back to 1973 when united was sued by the justice 
department on charges of employment discrimination in violation of 
the 1964 civil rights act

national semiconductor corp said 
monday it lost 305 million in its first fiscal quarter due to a 
onetime pretax restructuring charge of 166 million and poor 
sales of mainframe computers 
although our semiconductor operations experienced strong 
demand and modest growth in the seasonally slow first quarter 
pressures on the information systems group continue to affect the 
companys operating performance said charles e sporck 
president and chief executive officer

the new york stock exchange before the earnings report was released 
for the three months ended aug 28 national semiconductor lost

compared with earnings of 135 million or 10 cents per share on 
sales of 5176 million for the same period a year earlier 
sporck said sales of mainframe computers were hurt by both 
slowing of demand and continued pricing pressure the computers are 
made by japans hitachi ltd to the specifications of nationals 
national advanced systems unit 
the outlook for the semiconductor group is strong sporck 
said we anticipate continued growth in components sales for the 
second quarter 
he said the restructuring within the information systems group

prices for ford motor cos 1989 cars and trucks will increase 
an average of 26 percent and hyundai motor americas subcompact 
excel will go up 28 percent over comparably equipped 1988 models 
the companies said monday 
the no 2 us automaker and the south korean car producer said 
in separate statements that higher material and labor costs 
contributed to the price changes 
some of fords sticker price increases for the 89 model year 
are caused by additional standard equipment on some models company 
spokesman dave krupp said 
for example the mustang lx convertible which sold for 13702 
during the 1988 model year will sell for 14140 in the 1989 model 
year krupp said some equipment listed as optional on the 1988 
models will be standard on 1989 models 
the company said the largest percentage jump more than 5 
percent was in the price of its 1989 crown victoria standard 
station wagon its 1988 price of 15311 will jump to 16208 in 
1989 a combination of higher pricing and optional equipment 
becoming standard krupp said 
meantime hyundai said the 1989 suggested retail prices for the 
excel will range from 5499 for the threedoor hatchback to 6949 
for the fivedoor gl hatchback up 104 and 204 respectively

the chicago board of trade has urged regulators 
not to approve a rival commodities exchanges electronic network 
for 24hour global trading of financial futures and options on the 
grounds the system could lead to abuse and would be hard to operate 
the cbot sent a 51page letter dated sept 6 to the commodity 
futures trading commission urging the commission to turn down the 
electronic venture planned by the chicago mercantile exchange and 
reuters holdings plc 
the 12year deal which requires government approval calls for 
the globex network to begin operating next summer 
it would link investors in north america europe and asia via an 
electronic system for trading futures and options contracts on 
currency futures including the british pound the west german 
mark the swiss franc the japanese yen and eurodollar time 
deposits 
the system would operate during hours when the chicago 
mercantiles trading floor is closed 
cbot president thomas r donovan raised a number of issues in 
the letter to the commission ranging from the way contracts are 
normally traded in the pit to the possibility of fraud 
the globex proposal marks a complete departure from the 
centralized open outcry markets which ensure the sort of honest 
and efficient price discovery which congress has mandated 
donovan wrote in the letter in effect globex is an offexchange 
market 
the globex proposal is inherently susceptible to manipulation 
prearranged trading and other abuses his letter said 
moreover the cmes application is incomplete because it fails 
to address a variety of compliance enforcement and liability 
issues including the applicability of foreign laws to the operation 
of globex terminals located abroad 
finally a host of unresolved financial and operational 
concerns particularly in the wake of the october stock market 
decline render final action on this unprecedented proposal 
altogether inappropriate donovan wrote 
reuters the news and market information concern will provide 
the technical expertise for globex the mercantile exchange a 
pioneer in the creation of financial futures and options will 
provide the main market for the system 
futures and options allow investors to bet on the future 
performance of commoditiesm currencies and financial instruments 
such as stocks and bonds

general mills inc said monday it nearly 
quadrupled its first quarter net earnings compared with the same 
period last year due largely to profits on the sale of its talbots 
and eddie bauer clothing outlets 
general mills reported net income of 2899 million or 353 
per share in the three months ended aug 28 compared with net 
income of 772 million or 87 cents per share in the first 
quarter of 1987 
the 1988 figures included a 1991 million gain from 
discontinued operations the sales of talbots and eddie bauer 
completed during the first quarter generated an aftertax profit 
of 2206 million the company said 
the gain was reduced by establishment of a 215 million reserve 
for the disposition of the companys yorks cafeterias and other 
adjustments to previously discontinued operations general mills 
said it plans to dispose of yorks 100unit chain during fiscal 
1989 
firstquarter sales rose 11 percent to 138 billion from 124 
billion the company said it attributed the sales increase largely 
to a more than 5 percent volume gain in consumer foods and 
expansion of restaurants by 69 companyoperated units since the end 
of the first quarter of 1987 
aftertax earnings from continuing operations rose to 908 
million in the first quarter from firstquarter 1987 aftertax 
earnings of 809 million 
chairman hb atwater said much of the proceeds from the talbots 
and eddie bauer sales was used to repurchase common stock reducing 
average shares outstanding by 7 percent from a year earlier 
firstquarter operating highlights reflect general mills 
aggressive internal expansion programs in consumer foods and 
restaurants 
consumer foods reported gains of 9 percent in sales and 125 
percent in operating profits in the first quarter of 1988 
restaurants reported gains of 15 percent in sales and 10 percent in

drought and hot weather nibbled at the 
nations corn and soybean crops last month but new agriculture 
department estimates showed monday that most of the damage had 
already been done in june and july 
officials held to an earlier prediction that consumer food 
prices will go up an average of only 3 percent to 5 percent this 
year with about 1 percent of the rise caused by drought a further 
increase is expected in 1989 
the department estimated the corn harvest which is under way 
at a fiveyear low of 446 billion bushels down 37 percent from 
706 billion bushels harvested in 1987 
the new crop projections based on sept 1 surveys were down by 
less than 1 percent from the forecast a month ago 
in may and june before the drought tightened its grip usda 
projected the corn harvest at 73 billion bushels based on trends 
and an assumption of normal weather 
those projections were revised downward in july to 52 billion 
bushels assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the 
season in august the forecast was lowered to 448 billion bushels 
the smallest harvest since 1983 when drought and federal acreage 
curbs reduced output to 417 billion bushels 
the soybean harvest was estimated at a 12year low of 147 
billion bushels down 23 percent from 19 billion bushels produced 
last year but virtually unchanged from the august forecast 
estimates last spring called for about 188 billion bushels and 
the july projection was 165 billion bushels 
production of all wheat was projected at 181 billion bushels 
down 14 percent from 21 billion produced in 1987 and 1 percent 
below the august forecast 
in may and june usda forecast this years wheat output would be 
up slightly the july projection was 184 billion bushels and the 
august forecast was 182 billion bushels 
cotton production was estimated at 147 million bales slightly 
below the 1987 harvest and 2 percent below the august forecast the 
crop was projected at 137 million bales in july 
corn is the largest and most important crop grown by american 
farmers and as a feed ingredient is essential to the production 
of meat poultry and dairy products 
soybeans which provide highprotein meal and quality vegetable 
oil used in food processing also are vital to us food production 
no new estimate of winter wheat production was included last 
months forecast which was carried forward into the september 
report was 155 billion bushels down 1 percent from last year 
new estimates for spring planted wheat included durum 492 
million bushels down 47 percent from 1987 production and the 
smallest harvest since 1961 the new estimate was also down 10 
percent from august 
other spring wheat was estimated at 206 million bushels down 54 
percent from last year and 3 percent below the august forecast 
cotton production was estimated at 147 million bales down 2 
percent from august but only slightly below the 1987 crop the crop 
was projected at 137 million bales in july 
overall the departments agricultural statistics board said 
us crop production this year is expected to drop to 88 percent of 
a 1977 base used as a comparison that would be the lowest since 
1983 
crop production last year averaged 106 percent of the base year 
the record was 117 percent reached in 1985 1982 and 1981 
assistant secretary ewen m wilson the departments chief 
economist said total grain production this year is expected to 
drop to 191 million metric tons down 31 percent from 1987 output 
total supplies of grain for 198889 which include inventories at 
the beginning of the season are forecast at 366 million tons down 
24 percent from last year 
wilson told a news conference that crop development now has 
progressed to the point where production can be forecast with a 
reasonable degree of confidence 
the corn yield for example was estimated at 785 bushels per 
harvested acre down from 1194 bushels last year the largest 
droughtinduced reduction in yield on record he said 
from 1965 to 1987 the september estimate overstated corn 
production on nine occasions and understated it on 14 occasions 
wilson said in the case of soybeans the september estimate 
overshot final production in 12 years and understated it in 11 
on the brighter side wilson said rainfall in the last month 
has improved the conditions of pastures and ranges although more 
precipitation is needed to restore them to normal
