caesar glowered amid the holiday cheer 
the gorilla clambered up the rocks and squatted turning out his 
lower lip in displeasure as the family ate its presents and a few 
trees on tuesday 
caesars gloom was probably caused by a cold but if the illness 
was catching his disposition wasnt the rest of the gorilla 
family and the family in the compound next door smelled the roses 
and promptly ate them 
the two families of gorillas at the los angeles zoo were 
released from their quarters at midmorning to find their compounds 
were strewn with popcorn balls cranberries bougainvilleas 
rawhide chews and fruit 
banana trees decorated with purple orange and yellow roses and 
sprinkled with coconut snow stood outside the grottos with boxed 
presents all around 
burlap stockings were placed by the rocks with care filled with 
nuts and squash and all sorts of goodies 
the holiday party was the work of volunteers from the gorilla 
garden which grows supplemental foods for the zoos dozen gorillas 
they enjoy it because a lot of their really special favorite 
treats are out there said jennifer chatfield the gorillas 
keeper they also have some things they dont usually get like 
a whole banana tree

edward viii gave up his throne to marry wallis 
simpson 53 years ago but the romantic windsor legend has come 
alive again at their mansion in the bois de boulogne 
in early december the wroughtiron gates of the final and 
favorite residence of the duke and duchess of windsor were thrown 
open for a high tea given by mohammed al fayed the egyptian tycoon 
who paid more than 8 million to renovate the mansion 
the owner of the hotel ritz in paris and the harrods department 
store in london al fayed plans to keep the mansion open for 
friends and approved groups of visitors 
theirs was the love story of the century al fayed said of 
the windsors he undertook renovation with the blessing of mayor 
jacques chirac and the city of paris which is still the official 
owner of the villa 
al fayed said he had been shocked to see the dilapidated 
condition of the villa when he visited after the duchesss death in 
1986 with moldy walls and tags on the furniture and art objects 
destined for the auction block 
it was a sight i know would have appalled the duke and 
duchess he said having seen the villa in its heyday at a dinner 
party given by the duchess the american socialite divorcee whom 
the duke had married in defiance of the royal family 
so al fayed took things in hand supervised by an angloamerican 
team of decorators the leaky roof was repaired the interior was 
given a coat of paint tapestries and woodwork were restored 
personal valuables were left in place including framed intimate 
letters and photographs and silver and crystal on the diningroom 
table as if the windsors were expecting guests countless porcelain 
pug dogs around the house commemorate the windsors family pets who 
always were given pride of place 
i feel on top of the world said sydney johnson 69 the 
dukes personal valet for more than 30 years who is now 
occasionally in attendance dressed splendidly in gold and red 
livery as he was in the old days 
i cried all through the party mr al fayed gave three years 
ago to celebrate his lease on the house said johnson a bahamian 
who was hired during world ii when the duke was the governor of the 
bahamas the restoration is so authentic i expect to see the 
duchess stepping down the staircase asking how do i look 
also on hand are the windsors chauffeur of 20 years gregoire 
martin and his wife maria martin said he had hidden 5000 
personal photographs in a bathroom to keep them from prying eyes 
during the duchesss 14year widowhood following the dukes death 
in 1972 
the house looks as if the windsors just stepped out for a stroll 
in the bois books are at the bedsides brushes and combs are in 
the bathrooms and some of the duchesss lingerie are tidily wrapped 
in tissue in her dressing room 
the dukes bed has its original velvet cover with his prince of 
wales insignia and motto honi soit qui mal y pense which 
translates roughly as shame on him who thinks evil of it 
by his bedside sprawls a touching little chimneysweep rag doll 
cherished by the duke given to him by his mother queen mary who 
publicly disowned him after his indiscreet marriage 
the duchesss bedroom is a symphony of wallis blue and cream 
moire silk with attractive imitation louis xv and xvi furnishings 
and a priceless venetian l8th century marquetry chest visitors 
also see a raft of stuffed pug dog dolls and framed needlepoint 
works by the duke who loved needlepoint almost as much as golf 
commemorated in souvenir golf balls all over the place 
the duchesss bathroom is an artwork in itself decorated by 
dimitri bouchene a russian artist who designed stage sets for 
diaghilev and pavlova 
under a napoleonicstyle striped silk tent ceiling the bathroom 
walls are covered with bouchenes floral and animal murals with a 
group of his christmas cards framed in glass lining the doors like 
a gallery exhibition 
one of the villas first visitors was the britishborn actress 
joan collins who asked al fayed if he planned to use the house for 
his own parties 
i will indeed he said adding that he plans to keep the 
mansion staffed and open to small group visits by special request 
in 1991 he said he will send an exhibition of mementoes to 
london and other british cities as well as to new york and to the 
duchesss birthplace baltimore

a jewish group acting on the strength of a 
favorable ruling by us supreme court justice william brennan 
erected a 18foot menorah outside the pittsburgh citycounty 
building on tuesday night 
this adds some light to the darkness of winter nights and is a 
victory for all the people of pittsburgh said elliot katz an 
attorney for the group chabad 
the city which contends it has the right to determine what is 
permitted in front of the building plans to petition the us 
supreme court on wednesday morning to have the hanukkah symbol 
taken down 
chabad was permitted to erect the display under protection of a 
restraining order issued last week by brennan in an involved 
holiday legal scramble brennan upheld us district judge barron 
p mccunes order preventing the city from blocking chabads 
installation of the menorah 
mccune maintains that the courthouse steps are a public forum 
open to all types of expression and brennan ruled the menorah 
could be allowed until a trial on the matter is held in district 
court 
the supreme court ruled last summer that the menorah a 
candelabrum associated with hanukkah was permitted outside the 
building because it was accompanied by secular symbols a christmas 
tree and a sign promoting liberty 
mccune aided the erection of the menorah tuesday by reducing a 
5000 bond that chabad would have been required to post to cover 
some potential court costs incurred by the city 
chabad requested the bond be reduced to 1000 but in a 
compromise mccune set the bond at 2500

young chinese determined to learn english are 
defying police orders and gathering weekly in a local park in a 
dramatic display of peaceful disobedience under martial law 
the mix of softspoken office and factory workers and fulltime 
students few of whom would dare challenge the government in any 
other way come each sunday to a hilltop glade in the purple bamboo 
park famous for five years as the english corner 
there they awkwardly accost each other and launch into careful 
but determined conversation in english a wellused opening line is 
how long have you studied english 
the park put signs up oct 28 declaring the corner closed it 
said students were too busy with other studies but still the 
english lovers keep coming 
they begin arriving shortly before 10 am hovering nearby 
until the numbers seem large enough for them to climb the 
nowforbidden hill then huddled deep in padded coats and mufflers 
and stomping feet for warmth they mingle cocktailparty style 
chatting in english 
two plainclothes police burst upon the gathering one recent 
sunday grabbing elbows and trying to move the participants along 
hey dont stand around here one yelled cant you read the 
signs the corner is closed 
the crowd of about 60 people moved sluggishly down the hill to a 
lakeside where skaters glided on the frozen surface conversation 
resumed through coldstiffened lips 
the police never come back one corner veteran said 
confidently a few minutes later one of the police gave a 
frustrated shout go away go away 
there was a pause then what do you think of beijing 
someone asked a visitor politely 
it is a practiced ritual they come every week according to 
a young man who said he was a science student so does he although 
a bit nervously i learn a lot from other people i think my 
english has improved he said 
many of those who frequent the corner study english on their 
own and it is their only opportunity to try out words theyve 
learned from tapes or books they consider english their best hope 
for going abroad to study and perhaps whispered one man to 
stay for freedom 
certain ground rules have prevailed since june when the army 
attacked prodemocracy protesters and he government began an 
intense campaign against dissent 
before we talked about anything we wanted to said the 
science student now we talk about daily life maybe about our 
work units or cooking 
laundry chimed in a girl in a pink parka the weather 
said a man 
but not politics concluded the student 
most believe politics is the real reason the corner was ordered 
closed the student said some people used the corner before june to 
make speeches about democracy believing that police who 
generally lack college educations would not understand 
foreign reporters also sometimes visited using the 
conversations as one barometer of what young intellectuals were 
thinking 
but almost everything in communistruled china touches on 
politics and it is hard to avoid entirely 
what do you think about the economic crisis in socialist 
countries the girl in pink asked 
crisis queried a factory technician who had somehow 
acquired australianaccented english do you mean shizi 
lukou he asked using the chinese for crossing or intersection 
someone explained and he was quick to learn the new word i 
heard an interesting conversation about the crisis in east 
europe he offered 
listeners shivered with excitement at the words east europe 
can we talk about international politics asked a tall young 
man is it ok to talk about romania 
i was delighted to hear about romania whispered a man in a 
pale blue jacket referring to the overthrow of hardline communist 
leader nicolae ceausescu 
asked what they thought of ceausescu the group giggled 
nervously i have an opinion but i cannot tell you said one 
he was a dictator said someone bolder autocrat supplied 
a third 
freedom and democracy is the trend in the world and it makes 
me very happy said the technician to general agreement 
no one spoke of chinese intellectuals frustrated hopes for 
democratic reform in their own country generations of chinese have 
learned to communicate dangerous ideas like that without words of 
any language

nicolae ceausescu reportedly killed 
60000 romanians during his terrible reign some sent to 
transylvanian torture chambers so horrible that the dead leader is 
being compared to the monsters of myth 
state media in postceausescu romania have begun to paint a 
horrific portrait of a man who killed with the epic blood lust of 
count dracula and the cavalier conscience of a real monster adolf 
hitler 
his son nicu was described as a drunk who ran down and killed 
two pedestrians with his car and had a special room where he used 
to rape women 
ceausescus execution and the new revelations about his 24year 
rule has romanians careening between revulsion and exultation 
oh what wonderful news the antichrist died on christmas 
a bucharest radio announcer said after an announcement that the 
former communist leader and his wife elena were executed 
christmas carols then filled the air 
a secret military tribunal in monday convicted ceausescu and his 
wife of genocide undermining the economy and attempting to flee 
with more than 1 billion stashed in foreign banks 
romanian state television tuesday broadcast a videotape of 
ceausescu and his wife after they were executed by a firing squad 
their bloody bodies slumped in front of a wall 
in an official announcement the television said the charge of 
genocide covered the deaths of 60000 people 
this is the moment of truth we got rid of the monsters who 
mutilated our history let these tyrants be cursed romanias soil 
should not accept their bodies anchorman viorel popescu said on 
tv and national radio the broadcasts were monitored in vienna 
the name of ceausescu should never be pronounced and written 
again it should be replaced with dracula from scornicesti an 
unidentified painter in the southern transylvania city of sibiu 
told national radio scornicesti is the village where ceausescu was 
born jan 26 1918 into a peasants family 
even when he was alive the ironfisted ceausescu had earned the 
nickname of vampirescu for his harsh rule an allusion to count 
draculas horror tales set in 19th century transylvania by bram 
stoker 
the united states and some other nations appeared critical of 
the decision to try convict and execute the ceausescus so quickly 
on monday a us statement announcing the establishment of 
diplomatic relations with romania said we regret the trial did 
not take place in an open and public fashion 
but silviu brucan a former romanian ambassador to washington 
and leading dissident who is on the 37member revolutionary 
governing council said the reason behind the ceausescus rapid 
execution was to crush any hopes for a lethal coup by his hated 
secret police the securitate 
he was probably executed on christmas day to show that a new 
hope the hope of freedom was born in romania ceausescu was the 
antichrist an unidentified poet told the radio 
during the ceausescu reign dissent was ruthlessly repressed by 
the securitate a huge and sinister network of tens of thousands of 
people 
debt repayment and mismanaged industrialization programs 
triggered widespread food and energy shortages and dissidents faced 
prison commitment to mental hospitals internal exile or house 
arrest 
laws mandated the reporting of every unauthorized conversation 
with a foreigner every typewriter had to be registered with the 
police and censorship was far tighter than anywhere in the soviet 
bloc 
romanian tv monitored in vienna showed a former torture 
chamber ran by the securitate in the western romanian city of 
timisoara where more then 12000 protesters including children 
and women were killed by the security forces when local riots 
erupted dec 17 
the revolution actually began in timisoara two days earlier 
when small protests began eventually blossomed into the nationwide 
uprising that toppled ceausescu on friday 
its terrifying what we see in this torture room a 
commentator said calcinated bodies pieces of hairy scalps 
blood and tortured bodies lying on the floor the victims were 
brought here naked 
how small were hitlers lackeys they were genuine angels by 
comparison these are nightmarish images the unidentified 
commentator said 
tearful residents looking for missing loved ones congregated at 
freshly unearthed mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of 
summarily executed people some mutilated 
one gruesome picture showed the body of an unborn baby whose 
mother had been cut open by a bayonet 
the army and revolutionaries who ransacked the communist party 
office of ceausescus youngest son nicu in sibiu southern 
transylvania found hundreds of kent cigarette packs and bottles of 
whiskey and tuica romanian plum brandy 
the television showed a back room where according to the 
commentator nicu party chief of the sibiu county used to rape 
women also displayed were stockings makeup and underwear of his 
purported victims 
nicu 39 was known as a womanizer heavy drinker and a fan of 
western fast cars who killed at least two people in traffic 
accidents romanian officials said he was arrested dec 22 
hitler had more dignity the radio and tv commentator said 
romanian tv also showed pictures of the apartment of ceausescus 
daughter zoiaelena where she was arrested 
among the items displayed were seven expensive watches jewelry 
95000 in cash valuable paintings taken from romanian art museums 
and pearls which we dont think are false 
such a modest baggage for such a long trip to jail the 
commentator said sarcastically 
the tv also showed meat supposedly shipped in from vienna for 
her dogs 
the media reported that zoia trained as a mathematician asked 
officers before being taken away by arresting officers is there 
enough room for my two pets

the television station that once 
beamed the glory of nicolae ceausescu to a numbed nation has become 
not only the voice but the soul of the revolution that toppled his 
government and ended his life 
while everything it broadcast once was suspect nothing now is 
believed until it appears on free romania television as the 
station is calling itself although he was reported captured and 
executed it wasnt until television showed ceausescu in captivity 
that the nation sighed in relief 
the station first broke from the propaganda of the stalinist 
past on friday morning when army units joined protesters to drive 
ceausescu from his palace and from power 
weve won weve won poet murica dinescu suddently shouted 
into the camera but those giddy opening moments only were a 
prelude to the battles with ceausescu loyalists that followed 
the national salvation committee clung to the television like a 
mantle of power running the country from a barricaded studio while 
ceausescus fanatical guard tried to blast it into silence sniper 
fire smashed windows and heavy shells blew holes in the walls 
early saturday morning news editor victor ionescu announced on 
the air we are under attack he urged people to rally outside 
the tv station in a masive human shield to protect the building 
almost immediately a crowd formed 
people chanted freedom freedom until gunfire broke out 
each time they scattered and regrouped they shouted we wont 
go and they didnt outgunned the attackers pulled back 
later that weekend ceausescus guard struck again infiltrators 
stabbed people in the hallways of the 13story complex reportedly 
killing three people for a few hours tv screens went mysteriously 
blank 
but the interruption was merely a technical problem it was 
explained romania was still governed from a hectic studio littered 
with empty bottles cracked coffee mugs and halfeaten sandwiches 
and run by people who had not slept in days 
television has played a large role in the forces of reform that 
swept the east bloc this year mass demonstrations were shown live 
on tv in czechoslovakia in the days preceding the communist 
leaderships downfall east germans able to watch west german 
broadcasts followed closely news of the loosening of travel 
restrictions and the rallies that brought down erich honecker a 
solidarity economic minister goes on the air with regular 
fireside chats to the people 
free romania television has become a chaotic reflection of the 
country it covers a jumbled but jubilant mirror of the revolution 
it helped orchestrate 
it is madness here madness said gratiela ripeanu her 
external relations job used to consist mainly of shaking hands with 
fraternal bulgarians 
suddenly she was shepherding countless foreign tv crews all 
desperate to relay film back home reporters counted on her to find 
them national salvation committee members to interview 
one by one she steered people and their bulky gear through an 
obstacle course of gun barrels locked gates roiling crowds and 
skittish guards who looked for explosives in balpoint pen refills 
six body searches separated the street from the studio 
we dont know what we are doing anymore but were doing it 
she said 
elena maria ionescu a news writer and victors wife helped out 
on the studio partly because her office was a gaping hole in the 
eighth floor 
she smiled broadly when she recognized several reporters who had 
sat with her until morning during the first assault 
they had subsequently stayed in the relative luxury of hotel 
rooms but she was still on the job 
ive slept here ate here washed things out here she said 
my husband is so hoarse he can hardly talk on the air 
nevertheless she seemed ready for another four days 
most of the stations 1300 employees were caught up in the mad 
metamorphosis 
until the revolution the station broadcast only two hours 
daily a deadening litany of the heroic and generous qualities of 
ceausescu romanias austerity budget left it short of equipment 
and supplies 
suddenly it was on the air around the clock and romanians who 
once scorned television sat glued to their screens 
technicians cannibalized old gear and pushed technical 
tolerances to the limit 
armed soldiers wandered across the set and overtired officials 
reverted to the hated communist term for comrade tovarase 
rather than domnul or mister but the show went on 
during the assault section chiefs and janitors alike beamed 
with pride at the unflickering image they broadcast across the 
fearful nation in the face of rumors and threats the reassuring 
voices on television maintained the momentum of the revolt 
unlikely heroes emerged in the heat of battle marin constantin 
who edited youth programs took it upon himself to make sure the 
eighth floor occupants made it through the night 
when the shooting started he herded eveyone into a central 
hallway protected from ricochets by a double layer of walls when 
he found no other way to extinguish the grilled ceiling light he 
deftly smashed it with a chair 
when the heavy fighting began his grin broadened comforting 
others whose thoughts were beginning to rattle them to amuse the 
company he sang an old national hymn that was almost forgotten 
during ceausescus reign 
it went wake up romania from the mortal sleep into which 
you have been lulled by the evil tyrant 
the song broadcast earlier in the day over the battered 
transmitters seemed to fit free romania television

one of the nearvictims of the romanian revolt 
against their hated longtime dictator was john daniszewski chief 
of the warsaw bureau of the associated press who had gone to the 
balkan nation to report the momentous events there here is his 
firsthand account filed from his hospital bed in belgrade of the 
hellish situation in romania and his brush with death

the uprising against dictator 
nicolae ceausescu gave rise to fierce resistance by his secret 
police turning romania into a land of fear suspicion and 
retribution i know i became a victim of that chaos saturday night 
i was shot three times narrowly escaping death one bullet 
grazed my skull and two more lodged in my left arm 
thanks to some dedicated doctors in district hospital no 1 in 
timisoara and the friendly intervention of yugoslav diplomats in 
the city i survived and was evacuated within two days to 
yugoslavias capital belgrade 
it is hard to describe the mood of pure panic and paranoia that 
pervaded timisoara a petrochemical center in western romania with 
about 350000 inhabitants 
the events that led to ceausescus fall and execution began a 
week before christmas demonstrations to prevent a protestant 
minister from being evicted swelled into antigovernment protests 
unarmed civilians were gunned down by state security troops the 
dreaded securitate in the main square 
no westerner has been able to verify the number of fatalities 
but doctors with whom i spoke said more than 4000 died after the 
slaughter the bodies were gathered in trucks and taken to a mass 
grave at the city cemetery 
the blood that flowed that day on the square sparked a popular 
thirst for revenge 
residents responded with a general strike and the army declared 
itself with the people and against ceausescu 
after state tv in bucharest fell to the opposition friday the 
borders opened for the first time in four days to western 
journalists 
i flew to belgrade from warsaw late friday rented a car at the 
airport and started driving to romanias border 
just before entering romania i met a yugoslav journalist ljuba 
pajic who was to be my companion in the days that followed 
although i arrived at the border with no visa the slightly 
drunken border guards wearing armbands in the national colors of 
red blue and yellow let me in with little formality 
american you are with us one guard whispered out of 
earshot of his superior 
on the twohour drive to timisoara we were repeatedly stopped 
by groups of peasants waving the romanian flag with the communist 
emblem cut out of it 
ceausescu kaput ceausescu finito they shouted to the 
foreigners 
but once entering timisoara tension replaced jubilation a 
siren wailed and young people on the street talked fearfully of an 
air raid 
ceausescus forces were going to bomb the city they claimed 
so with car lights off fearing the bombs that never fell and 
avoiding the black silhouettes of tanks at many street corners we 
began to look for the main hotel where i thought we would find 
other journalists 
ljuba and i ended up at the hotel timisoara near the opera 
square 
inside the darkened lobby we were frisked by nervous young 
people carrying knives clubs and sharpened sticks 
a young woman who spoke english gave me an account of the 
massacre 
children peacefully praying the previous sunday dec 17 were 
mowed down by automatic weapons she said when their mothers ran 
to them they too were shot 
it was also in the lobby less than an hour after arriving in 
town that i met my first casualty 
french photographer jean langevant hobbled in holding his 
buddys arm a bullet hole in his leg 
he was bleeding badly but the ratatattat of gunfire growing 
nearer outside made everyone reluctant to go for help 
finally a machina a car rolled up to the front door and 
langevant was bundled inside ljuba and i decided to follow in our 
car 
headlights still off we raced through the deserted streets 
afraid to stop we screeched into the courtyard of district 
hospital no 2 
the photographer was taken to the operating room and we spent 
the night huddled in the doctors lounge 
the hospital like the other buildings in timisoara at night 
was kept in eerie darkness whenever possible 
they shoot at the light one physician said drawing a 
curtain closed when the flicker of a television set dimly lighted 
the lounge 
doctors said they had been working with a constant stream of 
shooting victims since dec 17 they too were afraid cowering on 
the floor when the noise of gunfire came too close red tracers 
arched over the hospital roof 
it was a hairy night but at last by midmorning saturday the 
shooting had died down enough to go outside 
saturday we spent trying to locate an outside phone line to tell 
the story 
in the evening i returned to hotel timisoara where we talked 
to the leader of the prodemocracy forces headquartered there 
their chief was an automotive engineer a tall and dignified 
young man dressed in a black beret and trenchcoat who spoke some 
french 
the hotel was again in total blackness and he led us through the 
empty restaurant to a small cafe off the kitchen where he pushed 
together two tables and fed us a romanian feast sliced sausages 
and salty cheese washed down with grapefruit soda a romanian 
soldier with a soviet submachine gun and several rebels looked on 
politely 
i asked them what kind of country they wanted democracy and 
free elections was the reply and the ceausescus killing was too 
good for them the group agreed maybe torture 
after a short drive around downtown where the fighting had been 
the heaviest all appeared quiet i made one outside phone call and 
left the building 
outside the scene had suddenly changed gunfire erupted very 
close by as soon as we left retreating to the car we backed away 
in the opposite direction two italian journalists who had left the 
consulate with us followed in another car 
what followed was a nightmare of running with nowhere to hide 
every turn in the strange city seemed to lead to another firefight 
we tried to make our way back to the hotel going in ever wider 
circles because of the fighting 
finally luck ran out driving into an intersection somebody 
flashed a light on us and shouted in romanian 
before we could answer or get out of the car i saw the flash of 
a gun and realized in an instant they were shooting at us 
immediately i felt something slam into my arm and what felt 
like warm water being poured on my head my own blood

for what seemed like an eternity we screamed that we were 
journalists 
the men who came out of a bunker to us some in uniform some 
in civilian clothes screamed at us and dragged us to them 
we were roughed up one man came at me with a knife but stopped 
just before stabbing me a soldier kept a gun aimed at my head i 
thought they were going to kill us 
my companion ljuba was not hit by the gunfire but he was 
beaten they took our money 
of the italians one was badly wounded in the chest and the 
other unhurt 
finally to my relief two ambulances arrived the italian 
photographer pasquale modita went first then me 
the ride to the hospital was mercifully brief and for my second 
night in romania i was once again under the physicians protection 
the bullets had gone into my upper left arm a few inches from 
my heart the other one cut a gash in my scalp but did not 
penetrate my skull 
you were very very lucky my favorite doctor told me time 
and again the doctor said after my first operation to explore the 
wound in my arm someone as lucky as you will live a long time 
for the two nights and a day that i convalesced in the hospital 
battle raged outside my window between the romanian army and small 
ruthless commando units loyal to ceasescu 
i worried that the securitate would win and murder us all 
but christmas day about 36 hours after being shot ambulances 
arranged by the yugoslav government and the ap took me and zzeljko 
ssajan a wounded reporter from zagreb television to belgrade 
i was never so happy to cross a border

flooding in brazils normally dry 
eastcentral region has killed 24 people and left at least 140000 
homeless national civil defense spokesman silvio reiner says 
speaking by telephone on tuesday from brasilia the capital 750 
miles northwest of rio reiner said 140 cities and towns in five of 
the 26 states were affected by flooding caused by more than two 
weeks of torrential rain 
unofficial reports said most of those killed drowned or were 
buried when houses collapsed

gen manuel antonio noriega is gone 
but the question of fashioning a security force to replace his 
bully boys is causing friction between the us military and the 
new panamanian civilian government 
sources on both sides agree theres a problem 
the civilians want a weakened army that would be little more 
than a police force and would not represent a threat to the 
government the united states is pressing for a professional army 
to provide security for the panama canal 
panamanian civilians have been intimidated by the military for 
more than 20 years suffering exile torture imprisonment and 
death the panamanian military has not had much respect for 
politicians whom they considered weak and beholden to the united 
states 
the truth is that both the civilian and the military must be 
reeducated a us military source told the associated press 
we are telling the panamanian military that they must 
understand their role in society under civilian power and we are 
telling the civilians that a strong military organization is needed 
too the source said on condition of anonymity 
the panama canal is due to be turned over to panama on dec 31 
1999 and us bases are to be closed unless a further agreement is 
reached with the panamanian government since the treaties give the 
two countries joint responsibiilty for canal security even after 
2000 us sources say at least two bases probably will be 
maintained rather than the 10 major installations that now support 
12000 troops 
ironically the panamanian army under omar torrijos was the core 
of the long drive to eliminate the sovereign us enclave in the 
canal zone and negotiate the 1977 treaties us officials insist 
the united states will honor the treaties 
the dispute over how to reconstitute the panamanian forces is 
taking place even as us officers work with panamanian officers to 
do exactly that despite civilian unease 
it is a matter of concern that the members of the defense 
forces are being reintegrated and not by the panamanian 
government but by the american army said juan materno vasquez 
a lawyer who helped negotiate the 1977 canal treaties but left the 
government in a dispute with noriega 
vice president and minister of government ricardo arias calderon 
has spoken of a public security force avoiding all reference to 
the old name of defense forces or previous names such as national 
guard 
you can call it what you will a us source said it has 
to be a professional force army national guard or whatever 
us military leaders here who worked with the panamanians for 
years and know them well feel some especially those jailed by 
noriega following coup attempts can be trusted enough to form the 
core of an army 
before the us attack that toppled noriega dec 20 us 
military sources told the ap that us forces could work with 
some of the panamanian top officers even if they are not shining 
examples of democracy 
according to a panamanian military source us officers were 
rather blunt when they told president guillermo endara what they 
want in a panamanian army endara was elected president may 7 but 
noriega nullified the vote and endara was not installed until after 
the us assault 
the politicians did not shed any blood another source said 
the blood was shed by the americans and the few defense forces 
units that fought 
both the us and panamanian military even those opposed to 
noriega feel the opposition was unwilling to take risks to try to 
topple noriega comparisons with uprisings in south korea china 
and lately eastern europe were raised frequently 
they want us to do the job for them a topranking us 
officer told the ap before us forces did exactly that 
some of the new leaders of the future panamanian military are 
the majors and captains who were arrested march 16 1988 after 
their failed coup against noriega 
they include men like maj santiago fundora and maj aristides 
valdonedo who have been named directors of logistics and public 
security respectively and maj august villalaz who will be in 
charge of the air force 
they have been working closely with the commander of us army 
south maj gen marc cisneros and other army officers at fort 
clayton near panama city 
the person who is really governing in panama now is marc 
cisneros vasquez said 
vasquez said he saw a former lieutenant colonel surrender with 
other officers and return home with a passport from cisneros not 
even from panamanian authorities 
were concerned about too many of those guys coming back in 
said a christian democratic politician involved in forming the new 
government the endara government would like to set up something 
like what costa rica has 
costa rica just north of panama has been spared coups and 
military rule in large measure because the armed forces were 
dissolved more than 40 years ago costa rica has only a civilian 
police force and relies on the organization of american states 
charter which calls for collective defense in case of attack 
in essence that means relying on the united states but us 
officials are not sympathetic to the civilian governments desires 
endara may feel that he was elected in may one source said 
but his majority meant nothing and he is where he is because of 
the american guns

columnist art buchwald came up with an 
original idea when he proposed a movie based on the comic 
adventures of an african king in america says the cocreator of 
the old tv series barney miller 
buchwald is suing paramount pictures corp for 5 million 
alleging the 1988 eddie murphy hit coming to america was based 
on an idea he optioned to the studio in 1983 
paramounts attorney robert draper has contended that buchwald 
failed to live up to his contract with paramount because his idea 
was not original that it was based on a charlie chaplin movie 
called a king in new york 
but barney miller cocreator danny arnold disagreed i 
cannot remember a particular work or motion picture about an 
african king transposed into a situation in america he testified 
tuesday in the superior court trial 
the chaplin movie was about a european king who is kicked out of 
his own country and tries to sell atomic energy ideas to us 
officials 
arnold called as an expert witness for buchwald also testified 
that the elusive show business term based upon refers to the 
beginning of an idea but under crossexamination he said there 
is no industry standard for based upon its a purely subjective

the new government of prime minister 
vp singh says it will temporarily stop buying weapons from a 
swedish armaments firm accused of paying huge bribes to secure a 
1986 contract with the indian army 
the alleged impropriety in ab bofors 14 billion howitzer gun 
deal was a key campaign issue for singh whose centrist coalition 
ousted rajiv gandhi and the congress party from power in last 
months elections 
singh who is also the countrys defense minister announced in 
parliament on tuesday that bofors will be barred from future 
contracts until they satisfy us in their conduct in regard to 
the howitzer guns 
at least two newspaper investigations have sought to prove that 
bofors paid as much as 50 million in bribes and commissions to yet 
unnamed persons 
the allegations have not been proved since they surfaced in 
april 1987 but one newspaper the hindu has published purported 
documents that it said established gandhis links with recipients 
of the alleged bribes and commissions 
the hindu and another newspaper indian express said senior 
officials in gandhis cabinet and persons close to him received the 
bribes gandhi has also been accused of covering up the 
investigation by handing it over to pliant officers 
gandhi has denied the charges and maintained that his actions 
have been above board 
singhs national front coalition government said in its election 
manifesto that it will unearth and disclose the names of the 
commission recipients within 15 days of taking office singh was 
sworn in dec 2 
on tuesday singh denied that he is not longer keen on probing 
the bofors deal now that his coalition is power 
singh said the government order tuesday covers supply of names 
of recipients and return of money paid in regard to bofors gun 
transactions 
this shows there is no lack of enthusiasm we are determined 
there is no question of compromise on anything 
we will do everything to get the names and come to the 
truth singh said his colleagues in parliament loudly thumped 
desks 
singh was interrupted by gandhis congress party members when he 
continued with the statement house chairman shankar dayal sharma 
adjourned the session amid the uproar triggered by angry shouts 
from singhs colleagues 
hours after singhs truncated statement the defense ministry 
said it had been directed by the prime minister to stop all future 
contracts with bofors 
it was the new governments first major policy decision on the 
bofors deal since taking office 
the embargo will be till such time as the company satisfied 
the government of india about their previous conduct the defense 
ministry said in a statement 
the current howitzer gun deal apparently remained unaffected by 
the decision as neither singh nor the defense ministry referred to 
it

the securities and exchange commission 
catapulted into the headlines by its pursuit of multimilliondollar 
insider trading scandals is putting out the word that it intends 
to be just as aggressive in protecting small investors 
sec chairman richard breeden is creating a new fraud unit at the 
sec designed to police the sale of securities by savings and loan 
institutions 
investigators have charged that some small investors lost their 
life savings when they bought securities sold by sampl branches in 
the mistaken belief that their investments were protected by 
federal deposit insurance 
we intend to see to it that when people are sold securities 
they are provided all the necessary information breeden said 
breeden also announced tuesday that he had selected william r 
mclucas a 12year sec veteran to be the new director of 
enforcement at the sec he will succeed gary lynch who resigned in 
july after supervising such landmark insider trading cases as the 
investigation of ivan boesky and the wall street firm of drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
both breeden and mclucas stressed that insider trading still 
would be a top sec priority but they also indicated that the sec 
with a 20 percent increase in its budget would devote more 
resources to more lowprofile crooks 
where there is an abuse of a customers trust those are the 
kinds of cases where we are going to make sure we have an impact 
mclucas said at a news conference where his selection was announced 
individual investors have been leaving the market in droves in 
recent years scared off in part by extreme trading volatility 
many officials believe the sec must return to its primary mission 
of bolstering confidence in financial markets through protection of 
the small investor 
breeden who was picked for the sec post by president bush last 
summer said both the administration and congress had expressed a 
strong desire to crack down on abuses against individual investors 
breeden noted that congress approved a 20 percent increase in the 
sec budget this year enough to allow the agency to hire 100 more 
attorneys 
part of the increased staffing will be used breeden said to 
create a special 25attorney unit to investigate overly aggressive 
sales of securities by savings and loans and other financial 
institutions 
such sales became a major focus of congressional hearings into 
the activities at lincoln savings and loan association the irvine 
califbased sampl whose failure is expected to end up costing 
taxpayers a record 2 billion 
small investors told congressional investigators they were lured 
into purchasing bonds in lincoln savings parent company american 
continental corp in the mistaken belief that their money was 
protected by federal deposit insurance 
when american continental which is headed by arizona 
businessman charles h keating jr filed for protection under the 
bankruptcy law it left some 22000 small investors who had 
purchased nearly 200 million in corporate bonds in the lurch 
breeden said the new sec unit will try to prevent financially 
ailing sampls from turning to fraudulent practices in a desperate 
effort to raise cash 
mclucas 39 joined the sec in 1977 two years after receiving a 
law degree from temple university 
lynch who resigned to join a new york law firm served for four 
years as sec enforcement chief taking over from john fedders who 
was forced to resign after allegations surfaced that he had beaten 
his wife 
lynch was credited with restoring morale at the sec and 
directing some of the agencys biggest investigations beginning 
with the exposure of dennis levine in may 1986 levines 
cooperation led to a 100 million settlement with speculator ivan 
boesky boesky in turn implicated drexel burnham which led to a 
650 million settlement with the securities firm the largest 
securities fraud case ever brought by the government 
civil and criminal charges are still pending against former 
drexel junk bond pioneer michael milken

us presidents since teddy roosevelt in 1903 
have talked about the need to install democracy in panama some 
sent troops under the banner of shoring up democratic rule 
but all have been stymied by the lack of democratic tradition in 
the strategically placed isthmus and by their overriding desire to 
protect us rights of passage through the panama canal scholars 
say 
when president bush went on television wednesday morning to 
explain why he dispatched troops to remove panamanian strongman 
manuel antonio noriega from power he cited the panamanian peoples 
desire for democracy and peace the people of the united states 
seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals he 
said 
the rhetoric about favoring democracy is no more than that 
its a pretense said john peeler who heads the center for the 
study of the americas at bucknell university in pennsylvania 
the real us desire is for democratic government read 
reliable government one that wont threaten our control of the 
canal peeler added 
the few times in their 86year history of independence when 
panamanians have supported a truly democratic government we 
werent willing to accept their choice peeler said 
that includes arnulfo arias a populist leader elected president 
twice in the 1940s and again in 1968 arias leftleaning views did 
not sit well with the united states which was not sorry to see him 
ousted after several days in office by national guard commander 
gen omar torrijos 
but torrijos proved an even bigger problem for the 
administration with his procuban policies and strong nationalism 
which opposed the us right under the 1903 treaty to use the canal 
in perpetuity 
increasing friction with the united states led to the 
ratification of a new treaty in 1978 ceding the canal to panama in 
the year 2000 but reserving the right to intervene if shipping 
through the waterway were threatened 
threats to us use of the canal were what prompted the first 
dispatch of military force to panama when colombia which ruled 
panama in the 19th century refused to approve the 1903 canal 
treaty with the united states roosevelt sent warships to help the 
growing panamanian secessionist movement 
but the warships only stood by as the secessionists launched a 
bloodless revolt and declared independence 
in august 1914 the same month world war i broke out the first 
ships passed through the canal but political chaos reigned and the 
united states sent troops to register voters and supervise 
elections 
each time that happened in 1908 1912 and 1916 the losing 
side blamed us interference 
by the 1930s there was growing us frustration with the 
attempts to instill democracy in panama said frank gerome a 
professor of history at james madison university in virginia 
gerome has written extensively about us efforts to organize the 
1912 elections 
panamas strategic importance grew immensely in world war ii 
when the us military presence rose sharply to defend oil 
shipments from venezuela to the united states against german 
interception the hitherto limited us military presence which 
had been centered mostly around the canal spread to other parts of 
the country 
panama in the 1950s and 1960s was ruled by a succession of 
families from among a thin elite while not a military state 
neither was it truly democratic 
torrijos rise to power in 1968 transferred power to the 
military with a nominal role for civilian governments such was 
the setup under noriega too after torrijos died in a 1981 plane 
crash 
various american presidents hoped the roots of democracy might 
grow said gerome what they failed to understand is that you 
cant export democracy 
noriega abhorrent though he is now to the us administration 
which nurtured him in the 1970s enjoyed strong popular appeal 
among panamas poor 
guillermo endara who was installed at a us military facility 
as panamas president on thursday based on the results of last 
mays elections does not enjoy noriegas popular appeal his main 
support comes from middleclass merchants 
support for him is weak not passionate and being propped 
up by the united states can only be a liability said peeler 
adding people arent celebrating democracy theyre looting 
doesnt bush see that

president bush is winding up his first year as 
president pretty much the same way he ended the year before and 
the year before that going back several decades quail hunting on 
a texas ranch 
bush aides say they hope hell have better luck than last year 
when dry conditions made the tiny game birds scarce 
the president will spend several days isolated but never out 
of touch aides insist at the 10000acre lazy f ranch near 
beeville in south texas owned by his friend houston millionaire 
will farish 
its been a tradition for the past 20 years said aide 
stephen hart who worked for bush as vice president and has been 
along on several of the previous quailhunting trips 
they drive around the ranch in big specially designed trucks 
then hunt with dogs if they can catch turkey too then thats a 
big treat hart said 
in the past bush has hunted quail with a 20gauge shotgun 
dressed in snakeresistant chaps heavy leather boots and an orange 
hunting cap 
secretary of state james a baker iii expected to be along on 
the trip is known to prefer turkey hunting which requires greater 
patience 
but bush who likes to jump from event to event has defended 
the sport of quail hunting as more to his liking and has asserted 
that the birds are not to be regarded as cute animals but as wily 
determined quarry 
these arent animals these are wild quail bush declared 
during last years trip in a remark that angered animal rights 
groups youve got to eat our forefathers ate by harvesting 
game 
the texas office of the fund for animals has written to bush 
asking him to cancel the hunt and plans to have animal activists 
travel to beeville to protest his activities if he carries out his 
hunting plans 
it seems likely that bush and baker will discuss another wily 
determined quarry while on the ranch deposed panamanian dictator 
manuel antonio noriega 
noriegas decision to go sunday to the vatican embassy in panama 
city where he is currently in hiding took a lot pressure off the 
bush administration as it seeks to help restore postinvasion order 
in panama 
however aides said bush never wavered from his determination to 
make the hunting trip and that little short of a major crisis 
would force him to cancel the trip 
the town of beeville population about 15000 is throwing a 
barbecue for the president tonight upon his arrival but probably 
wont see him again once he enters the vast ranch he is not 
expected to be seen publicly in the area he will fly by helicopter 
directly to houston on friday 
meanwhile the chamber of commerce of neighboring goliad texas 
is fussing to the white house that the part of the ranch where bush 
hunts is actually in goliad not beeville and that it should be 
able to share in the publicity 
but the sheriff of goliad county jk mcmahan says its fine 
with him if the president keeps a low profile referring to recent 
stories that colombian drug lords may have put a 30 million price 
on the presidents head mcmahan said recently i dont want him 
killed period but i damn sure dont want him killed in my 
county 
bush also plans to bracket his quailhunting with two fishing 
expeditions another endeavor in which the president has not had 
much recent luck 
bush planned to fish for redfish in the gulf of mexico off 
corpus christi today on his way to beeville 
and on new years day after spending several days in houston 
including a side trip on sunday to two military hospitals in san 
antonio to visit soldiers wounded in panama bush will take about 
five hours out on his return to washington to fish for bass on a 
private lake near montgomery ala

consumer food prices are still on track to 
increase by a modest 3 percent to 5 percent in 1990 despite the 
bitter cold that has ravaged citrus and winter vegetable crops 
says an agriculture department analyst 
the food price forecast was made last month and economist ralph 
parlett said tuesday he is sticking by it at least for now 
overall food prices are up an average of about 57 percent this 
year the largest annual gain since a 78 percent jump in 1981 
much of this years increase was due to lingering effects of the 
1988 drought and poor weather early in 1989 
im not worried about my overall forecast for 1990 at this 
point parlett said in a telephone interview but therell be 
some impact and possibly higher prices in the first quarter 
parlett said he and other agency analysts are still trying to 
assess the damage to citrus and vegetable crops in florida and 
elsewhere 
the main thing is oranges he said vegetables tomatoes 
bell peppers celery theyre some of the big volume things that 
would be coming out of florida now 
parlett said 90 percent of the florida oranges are for 
processing and that a lot of them can be salvaged for juice the 
main source of fresh market oranges is california 
there will be some retail price impact he said but 
since we do have decent supplies in california this year the 
supply impact will be minimal 
with the supply of florida orange juice reduced by the freezing 
weather parlett said imports from brazil will probably rise 
sharply 
weve got super supplies in brazil this year but the price 
has been fairly low because of the higher supplies he said 
but now that we probably will be importing that will push the 
price up some 
parlett said he had not seen damage reports from texas where 
state officials have estimated losses of 70 percent of the citrus 
and 80 percent of the winter vegetables 
vegetable losses are a more temporary kind of thing because 
those crops can be replanted he said growers were just starting 
to harvest floridas main supply of winter vegetables when the cold 
weather struck 
california is still producing vegetables however and this 
time of year we start getting produce out of mexico too parlett 
said 
theres no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short 
and well probably see higher prices at produce counters he said 
in his forecast last month parlett said 1990 average retail 
prices of all fruits and vegetables might rise only 1 percent to 3 
percent compared with the preliminary 78 percent gain registered 
this year and 76 percent in 1988 
parlett said the current freeze damage might push us to the 
high end of the 1990 forecast range 1 percent to 3 percent 
and if conditions worsen could push it even higher 
oranges themselves arent going to do much to hurt that range 
and the vegetables will recover later on he said 
according to usda computations based on bureau of labor 
statistics price information prices of fresh fruits and vegetables 
last year accounted for 114 percent of the bls consumer price 
index for food bought in grocery stores while processed fruits and 
vegetables made up only 68 percent of the index 
meats by comparison accounted for 203 percent of the bls 
foodathome price index while cereals and bakery products 
accounted for 14 percent and dairy products 123 percent

he is president bushs top adviser on domestic

counsel c boyden gray adding dont mistake that for lack of 
influence or lack of force 
the president typically consults with porter on a daily basis 
for what some describe as porters honest broker approach to 
sifting through competing policy options 
he is bushs intermediary to interest groups members of 
congress and government agencies that want to sell their side of a 
given issue 
he also gives speeches on administration policy with a 
methodical style recalling his days as a rhodes scholar and 
professor of government and politics at harvard and oxford 
but his lowkey image belies a toughminded dealer who is 
fiercely protective of bushs interests associates say 
i found roger to be cautious he likes you to verify 
everything said dewey stokes head of the fraternal order of 
police who sought bushs support for a waiting period and 
background check for gun purchasers 
that idea was rejected and under porters guidance other ideas 
for bushs muchproclaimed kinder gentler america have been 
muted along the way 
as the administration point man at the education summit with 
bush and the nations governors porter ensured joint endorsement 
of resultsoriented education without committing washington to 
specific spending 
while he led the administrations drive for a new clean air 
package that went well beyond president reagans stringency it 
didnt quite measure up to the aspirations of environmental groups 
perhaps because he tries to give bush a balanced view of all 
viable policy options porter is seen by some as a weaker adviser 
than might be expected of his position 
one white house colleague said porters effectiveness is 
dampened by white house chief of staff john sununus unquestioned 
dominance making it impossible for porter to assume a larger role 
asked if that is true porter says he is quite happy to be 
part of a collegial effort 
i dont go out and do things that im not going to discuss 
with him but he gives me a lot of latitude he said referring 
to sununu 
porter who often spends the night in his white house office 
admits to being a workaholic and a bit of a perfectionist 
i have never regretted the extra effort i know im not 
going to be doing this for the rest of my life he said i view 
it as a rare opportunity 
his introduction to the white house came aug 9 1974 arriving 
from harvard to start work as a white house fellow porter recalls 
he ran into his new boss thenvice president ford at the elevator 
ford greeted him somewhat distractedly and headed off to his 
historic final oval office meeting with nixon porter recalled 
later that day a ford aide assigned porter to be the secretary 
of fords transition team he helped write a report based on 
interviews with all the cabinet members and senior players in 
government 
under ford porter had a variety of jobs including special 
assistant to the president and executive secretary to the economic 
policy board during the reagan administration he also held several 
white house jobs including director of the office of policy 
development 
porter me bush over tennis a game for which both share a 
passion and considerable skill ford had just named bush to be his 
cia director and invited both men to play on the white house courts 
porter says he can tell a lot about a person from his tennis 
game about bush he said one thing i look for is how they call 
the lines in all the time ive played with bush over a 15year 
period i have never once had occasion to question his line calls 
he is scrupulously honest 
other bush tennis traits porter said are patience persistence 
and strategy reflecting a methodical approach in how he approaches 
other things as well

the pentagon says the stealth fighter passed 
its first combat test during the panama military intervention by 
hitting its targets in a raid on a field outside a panamanian 
military barracks 
the mission was successful spokesman pete williams said 
tuesday telling reporters that the f117 aircrafts sophisticated 
bombs precisely hit their targets 
asked whether the f117s had any other role in the 
intervention the spokesman said no that was the sole mission 
others were considered but they were discarded 
he declined to say what they were williams also declined to say 
how many of the airplanes were involved or what kind of bombs they 
dropped 
the washington post on saturday quoted unnamed government 
officials as saying they understood the plane was tapped for the 
job of bombing hideouts of gen manuel antonio noriega before he 
could get away 
williams repeated earlier pentagon statements that the objective 
of the stealth plane was not to hit the barracks but rather in 
fact the mission was to miss the barracks and hit the field and 
by nature of the explosion disorient and stun and confuse and 
frighten frankly the panamanian soldiers 
im told that the f117 hit it very precisely and that it was 
the precision of the f117s bombing capability that was the reason 
it was used he said 
i dont know how much of a factor the stealthiness was he 
said

when they first dated in 1982 jack 
elson opened doors for his future wife robin cooked romantic 
dinners and lit her cigarettes 
i figured my knight in shining armor had finally come said 
robin elson who has an 11thgrade education and was selling avon 
products when she met the 188pound 5foot8 auto mechanic 
what he didnt tell her was that he had been married four times 
that one previous wife was hiding from him and another got a 
restraining order against him when he beat her for slicing onions 
too big 
they married after a twomonth courtship he showed up 45 
minutes late and drunk for the wedding 
six months later when robin objected to jack going on a 
saturday fishing trip he asked his friend to wait outside went in 
the house and blackened both her eyes 
it was the opening of a brutal reign that left the two children 
he and robin had together sons camrin 4 and brock 2 and a 
daughter from robins previous marriage renee 11 living in 
terror 
robin and the children were not only beaten but jack also left 
her lists of chores to be completed limited her nail polish colors 
to pale pink and peach forbade her to wear makeup told her what 
food to buy and checked her change against grocery receipts 
last december robin picked up a rifle as her husband lay in his 
recliner chair after a morning of drinking and beating his family 
and their pet dog the 4foot9 70pound woman braced herself 
against a wall and fired three times killing him 
a jury in long beach last month acquitted the 28yearold woman 
of murder after hearing a wide range of testimony about a married 
life filled with terror and abuse 
he beat her because the pork chops she cooked were too dry he 
slugged her in the stomach while she was pregnant because she 
burned the toast then apologized with flowers 
neighbors said they watched horrified but too terrified of 
jack to call police as he ordered one pleading child to do 100 
pushups on hot cement and shoved a running garden hose down the 
throat of another 
if he told me i was stupid i believed it if he told me he 
would kill me i believed it if he opened the door and said go 
i wouldnt for fear hed stab me in the back on my way out 
robin said in an interview published in tuesdays los angeles 
times i was a robot 
prosecutors were appalled by the jurys vote but defense 
attorneys hailed the decision saying jurors are ready to accept 
the battered wife defense 
is this a signal that men who get frustrated by the actions of 
their wives can kill them that whenever we get frustrated with 
someone we are entitled to exact the ultimate sentence death 
asked denis petty deputy district attorney 
the law requires an imminent danger to justify a killing in 
selfdefense prosecutors insist that was not the case when robin 
shot and killed her husband 
she could have left the state gone to a neighbor called the 
police he was asleep when the first shot was fired he wasnt 
posing any threat and when we start allowing citizens to take 
matters into their own hands we are back to the law of the 
jungle petty said 
robin tried twice to escape and both times jack found her 
after the second time he found her he promised to reform but 
when they returned home he took away her checkcashing card and 
house key quit his job and never left the house without one of 
the children he often took the telephone with him 
its like the scientific experiment where they shocked dogs to 
the point that even when the gate was left open the dogs never 
left defense attorney lynda vitale said the dogs saw the open 
gate not as a means of escape but an invitation to more 
punishment 
neighbors said jack and his little sister were raised in the 
house that he later inherited from his two alcoholic parents while 
they were growing up jack and his sister were often thrown against 
the wall by their parents or left alone at night while they went 
out for a night of drinking 
when jack got big enough he began beating his mother sounds of 
violence from the house were common the sounds continued after 
robin moved in 
neighbors reported hearing the children shouting please 
daddy dont 
i knew what he was like i tried not to irritate him i was 
scared to death of that man said longtime neighbor nola de 
martino 74 
robin and her family now live in a twobedroom apartment in long 
beach she has put on 25 pounds and is trying to stop smoking the 
entire family is undergoing extensive therapy the times said 
de martino can see the elson house from her kitchen window 
i cry about it and i pray about it she said i even 
prayed for jack that he wouldnt go to hell but i dont know how 
he couldnt

top government salaries will rise by up to 35 
percent in the next 13 months under an executive order signed by 
president bush that carries out the recently enacted pay raise and 
ethics bill 
also under the plan all federal workers will receive a 36 
percent costofliving pay increase 
the order signed by bush on tuesday at the presidential retreat 
at camp david md follows his signature earlier this month on the 
pay raise and ethics bill 
the measure will raise top government salaries by up to 35 
percent over the next 13 months with house salaries jumping from 
the current 89500 to 96600 in 1990 and more than 120000 in 
1991 plus a costofliving adjustment 
but by then the 435 members of the house will be barred from 
accepting honoraria generally fees for making speeches 
senate salaries would climb in 1990 from 89500 to 98400 but 
senators balked at giving up their honoraria the new law would not 
bar speaking fees for senators but they also would not get the big 
jump in salaries in 1991 that the house gets 
senators could keep 26900 in honoraria compared to 35800 
presently 
federal judges and top executive branch officials also would get 
an immediate 41 percent raise and 36 percent compounded on that 
on jan 1 1990 as a catchup for two years without a 
costofliving adjustment 
house employees and other top federal executive and judicial 
officials also would be barred from accepting speech fees beginning 
in 1991 currently house members are limited to earning speech 
fees equivalent to 30 percent of their salary senators can make up 
to 40 percent but that will fall with their pay increase to 
slightly more than 27 percent 
under the pay package toplevel members of the executive 
service level who now earn a maximum of 99500 would earn up to 
107300 under the legislation and the executive order signed by 
bush

penny hollis left new hampshire last summer 
and bought a home in this farm belt town so fast that she didnt 
notice the major landmark a grain elevator 
i thought elevator whats so special about an elevator 
isnt that what goes up and down in department stores she 
recalled 
hoping to save its businesses and its school rolfe put out a 
national invitation two years ago offering a free lot and 1200 
cash to anyone who builds a house worth 30000 
about 70 people have accepted the invitation increasing the 
population by almost 10 percent their 20 children padded school 
enrollment to 190 
four houses have been built although none by the transplants 
who are happy to rent or buy existing homes at a fraction of the 
price theyre used to paying 
we paid 4500 for it plus 1500 for the garage says 
becky roberts of her centuryold 3000squarefoot house in 
sacramento it would probably go for 300000 
to mrs roberts and her husband gary who moved from the 
california city this year for their retirement this town about 80 
miles northwest of des moines is just what she and her husband were 
looking for 
we were thinking about retiring and moving to a small 
community and one morning on the boob tube here comes the story 
about rolfe she said 
they visited liked the place and decided to settle 
its real slow here she said people are genuinely 
friendly if they call on you or visit its because they want to 
you dont have to be suspicious of people at your door 
you go downtown and find cars parked at the curb running 
with babies in them in california you would never leave it 
unlocked let along running with a kid in it that would be like 
stamping the kid on the forehead with take me im available 
for that matter a car hasnt been stolen in rolfe in three 
years said city administrator dave jochims 
alcides and guelly mendoza who came from brazil by way of the 
bronx tired of the rush and risk of the new york city 
the move was especially good for their four children three in 
school and an 8monthold says mrs mendoza in new york they 
lived in a very good area but four or five blocks over there 
were buildings where there was trouble 
i like it here because i dont have too much problem for my 
kids she said here many people look after kids everybody 
takes care of everybody people here make me feel welcome 
until her husband found a job in nearby pocahantas mrs mendoza 
received public assistance for the infant but now my husband 
found a good job and when i pick up my last check this month i 
tell how much we appreciate but we do not need any more she said 
other families arent so quick to get on their feet 
ron walrod director of social services for pocahontas county 
said he knows of about a dozen people receiving public assistance 
in rolfe 
but jochims said most of the newcomers are on their own 
i know there are families who need assistance like a lot of 
iowans whether we like it or not these people are not 
disposable he said this is a free society were concerned 
about the people who come here 
the elevator is the main employer in rolfe but there are ample 
opportunities for skilled workers in nearby communities jochims 
said the county unemployment rate is 11 percent 
so far the businesses have been happy with the workers 
theyve received and i feel good about it people are moving to 
rolfe to better themselves jochims said 
after her husband died of a brain tumor two years ago ms 
hollis 31 decided she and her four children ages 3 to 14 needed 
to get away from new hampshire 
i saw this article in a womans magazine and decided to drive 
out she said i couldnt get over the openness i kept 
stopping the car and getting out so i could see how far i could see 
i really didnt check out rolfe very much it was the land i 
loved i put a down payment down on this house right away 
she said relatives practically dared her to leave betting that 
she wouldnt and said shes having reservations 
i used to socialize all the time and now i dont know 
anybody she said

currency dealers described the trading as thin with fewer 
participants due to the holiday season

european currencies especially the west german mark through 
dollar selling but the buying was not enough to direct the us 
currency

remained close to its opening said the dealer who spoke 
anonymously 
other dealers said many market players expected a further 
narrowing of gaps in interest rates between japan and the united 
states 
on monday the bank of japan the nations central bank raised 
its official discount rate to 425 percent from 375 percent to 
stem inflationary pressure in japan

loans to commercial banks tends to boost the value of the yen 
against the dollar

on the stock market the nikkei index continued to gain with 
shares being bought on a broad front encouraged by the yens 
firmness against the dollar securities dealers said

medical supplies from florida have been sent to panama and food 
and clothing are being gathered in massachusetts to help the 
central american country recover from the us invasion its 
resulting civil disorders 
we realize this is just a small amount of whats needed 
said luis endara jr a cousin of the new panamanian president and 
head of the group help panama which sent the 50000 shipment 
tuesday but at this point anything is a help these supplies are 
urgently needed 
the supplies included plasma and antibiotics syringes and 
needles intravenous solutions and orthopedic devices and were to 
be distributed at panama citys two main hospitals 
help panamas first shipment mostly donated by several south 
florida hospitals filled a chartered twinengine lear 25 jet 
endara said a cargo ship with six 40foot containers of food is 
expected to leave miami on friday for the fourday voyage to 
panama and help panama has opened accounts at two miami banks to 
take donations 
in quincy mass mike preble a 23yearold department store 
statistician began a drive to collect food and clothing for 
victims of warfare and looting in the central american country 
im not a spokesman for the us government preble said 
but we did what we had to do and now its our responsibility to 
clean it up 
preble said he was prompted into action saturday when he phoned 
his cousin jane huff whose husband bill works as a pilot on the 
panama canal they live in balboa panama with their three 
children 
mrs huff told preble that a high school soccer stadium in 
balboa was filled with about 3000 people seeking help at a refugee 
center 
preble felt he had to do something about that so he enlisted 
the cooperation from the quincy mayors and he put out a call 
asking donors to bring clothing and nonperishable food to fire 
stations arrangements could also be made to have volunteers 
collect the goods he said 
on tuesday he didnt know how much was collected and he was 
still trying to arrange for a military cargo plane to deliver the 
goods to panama 
panamanian hospitals have suffered in part because gen manuel 
antonio noriegas regime used medical supply areas to hide arms 
according to roberto dominguez who on tuesday was named the 
panamanian consul in miami 
its going to take a lot more shipments like these to return 
the hospitals to where they should be said dominguez

at graveside a yellow bath towel 
knotted around a rough pine cross and a spray of white 
chrysanthemums scrounged in a city where even bread is scarce were 
among tributes to heroes of the revolution 
a procession of sobbing families tuesday accompanied makeshift 
coffins to a field of 200 freshly dug graves in southern bucharest 
one coffin was for 14yearold silviu minca whose friends said 
he was killed when the nations hated security police called to 
them from a window and opened fire when they approached 
the security police have killed hundreds perhaps thousands of 
people in in their armed resistance to the uprising that toppled 
nicolae ceausescu 
officials at belo cemetery believe 300 to 400 people killed in 
fighting during the past five days will have to be buried but 
perhaps hundreds more are believed hidden in secret graves dug by 
ceausescus men before he was overthrown 
by a pine cross marked first hero a veteran gravedigger 
named nicolae abag wept along with the mourners 
this is so so much he said i have not cried here since 
the earth moved in 1977 the year of the earthquake in which 
almost 2000 people were killed 
at the next grave people mourned nicisor paunoiu an elevator 
mechanic who responded when the radio station appealed for help 
because it was attacked by the securitate the security police 
paunoiu and three friends stormed a securitate stronghold 
unarmed three of them were cut down by automatic weapons fire he 
left a son and a daughter who was married three weeks ago 
farther down there was the student dan adrian urucu who went 
to protect the tv station he joined 3000 others in a human shield 
between harassing ceausescu loyalists and army men protecting the 
13story tv building urucu 21 was shot in the back 
his death was for all of us for our freedom student ileana 
nita said as she stood by urucus grave it was a sacrifice we 
must appreciate we have to learn what it means to be free and what 
that is worth 
bits of food round bread rings and bath towels adorned many of 
the graves symbols from an ancient tradition of offering things to 
the dead they may need in the afterlife 
boughs from christmas trees with long yellow candles burning 
were left on many graves and there were photographs of smiling 
young faces tacked to crosses 
the romanian news agency agerpress said a monument would be 
erected at the cemetery to pay tribute the revolutions dead for 
their pure sacrifice for romanias freedom

a state appeals court has overturned the 
misdemeanor riot convictions of three young men in the howard beach 
racial killing and dismissed the indictments against them saying 
the trial judge committed two errors 
prosecutors either can appeal resubmit evidence to a grand jury 
for new indictments or dismiss the case against the three white 
defendants 
we are studying the opinion and we are considering a further 
appeal and thats as far as we are going to comment at this 
particular point matthew greenberg a special assistant attorney 
general said tuesday 
the 19yearold defendants william bollander thomas farino 
and james povinelli were charged with taking part in the attack 
on three black men three years ago in the mainly white howard beach 
section of queens 
one of the victims michael griffith was killed when the mob 
chased him onto a highway where he was struck by a car 
the three young men whose convictions were overturned were found 
guilty in the second trial related to the case 
in the first trial three other white youths were convicted of 
manslaughter and assault in the fatal attack their case is 
apparently unaffected by the appellate ruling handed down dec 11 
in overturning the misdemeanor convictions from the second 
trial a fivejudge panel said the trial judge made two important 
errors in charging the jury 
the panel said the judge thomas a demakos over strenuous 
defense objections furnished the jury with verdict sheets that 
improperly described some of the alleged crimes 
it said the judge also erred by refusing a defense request to 
instruct the jury on disorderly conduct as a lesser offense of 
seconddegree riot 
defense lawyer spiros a tsimbinos said he and his clients 
learned of the ruling saturday 
the rev al sharpton a community activist who advised the 
attack victims not to cooperate with investigators until a special 
prosecutor was appointed said the ruling was an outrageous act 
its a smack in the face of all people especially black people 
farino bollander and povinelli were convicted in 1988 of 
seconddegree riot but acquitted of a more serious felony riot 
charge for their roles in the dec 20 1986 attack 
demakos sentenced the three on sept 19 1988 to 34 days in 
jail to be served on weekends over a fourmonth period but they 
were granted a stay pending appeal and spent no time in jail after 
their conviction 
in july the appellate panel unanimously upheld the conviction

highranking government officials deny us 
allegations that cuba has established a route through mexico for 
shipping arms to el salvadors leftist guerrillas 
mexico has been especially careful to establish facilities in 
its territory for preventing the situations described a mexican 
official said tuesday on condition of anonymity 
in a dispatch from washington the associated press reported 
monday that us officials believe cuba is shipping weapons across 
the 130mile wide yucatan channel which leads to mexicos yucatan 
peninsula from there the arms are loaded on trucks and taken on 
an unknown route through guatemala to el salvador the us 
officials said 
one top mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the claim was irresponsible lacking in credibility and 
false 
the official said that the united states has never brought up 
the matter officially and that the mexican government would have no 
comment on the record because the claim had been leaked 
the mexican government historically has been sympathetic to the 
salvadoran rebels in their decadeold war but that support has 
been muted since president carlos salinas de gortari took office a 
year ago 
us officials contend soviet bloc arms are reaching salvadoran 
rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front through 
cuba and nicaragua although recent administration statements 
indicate they do not see the soviet union as the principal villain 
the us officials told the ap that cuba was looking for new 
ways to help the rebels and at the same time shield nicaraguas 
sandinista government from further criticism 
the sandinistas were embarrassed in october when a truck 
carrying arms was intercepted in honduras and in november when a 
plane carrying surfacetoair missiles was shot down in el salvador 
the salvadoran rebels who maintain offices in mexico city 
refuse to confirm or deny that they receive arms from cuba and 
nicaragua 
but even if we do so what said one rebel official the 
united states is helping its own 
the mexican official said the mexican government has tried to 
work with the united states to fight arms and drug trafficking if 
there was a problem this official said channels created for that 
purpose should have been used 
a mexican law enforcement official also denied claims that his 
country was being used to smuggle arms south and noted that the 
shortest route would take the arms into the resort area of cancun 
he said there was some evidence that a route had been 
established through belize south of mexico on the yucatan 
peninsula 
the coast is much less well guarded down there said this 
official

mayor edward i koch says his biggest regret as 
he leaves office is that blacks do not perceive that i was their 
friend 
i believe this administration has been more helpful to the 
black minority than all administrations before us he said 
tuesday i dont think we got credit for it 
koch who lost his reelection bid to black democrat david 
dinkins spoke at his annual yearend meeting with reporters the 
last scheduled news conference of his 12 years in city hall 
he appointed the citys first black police commissioner and the 
first black deputy mayor for economic development and under his 
administration the percentage of civil service jobs held by 
members of minority groups grew from 31 percent to 62 percent 
yet he noted many people in the black community do not 
perceive that i was their friend 
he also discussed his statement during the 1988 presidential 
campaign that jews and other supporters of israel would be 
crazy to vote for jesse jackson the remark caused a black 
backlash that carried into the 1989 democratic mayoral primary 
when dinkins took 97 percent of the black vote 
koch said the second half of his remark about jackson went 
unheeded it was in the same way that blacks and supporters 
of black causes would be crazy to vote for george bush 
koch said he would try to refrain from criticizing dinkins for 
the first six months after he takes office 
but the mayor did not refrain from criticizing south african 
archbishop desmond m tutu who will speak at dinkins swearingin 
koch said tutu who recently criticized israel for its handling 
of the palestinian uprising and called for a palestinian state was 
wrong for singling out israel when its under attack 
after 25 years in city and federal government koch 65 a 
former congressman and city councilman said he wont consider 
reentering politics 
instead hell juggle a halfdozen new jobs including 
commercial endorsements a newspaper column radio and tv 
commentaries and teaching 
koch said the city is better off than when he took office in 
1978 during a fiscal crisis that nearly bankrupted the city 
i took the city and saved it from bankruptcy he said

the ymca is gearing up for a return to the soviet 
union after more than 70 years of exile 
the young mens christian association has been working with 
private groups in the soviet union since may to establish branches 
in at least four cities said celeste wroblewski spokeswoman for 
the us ymca 
robert masuda director of the international division will 
travel there this spring to speak with charitable organizations and 
citizen groups about opening center in leningrad tbilisi in soviet 
georgia and novosibirsk and omsk in siberia ms wroblewski said 
we will see ymca programs aimed at developing soviet citizens 
minds spirits and bodies said nicholas goncharoff director of 
the american ymcas statesmanship programs who first contacted 
soviet organizations 
in addition to the four cities targeted the organization also 
might open a branch in kiev he said 
the difference however is that they will be called the yfca 
for youth families christian association said goncharoff a 
soviet emigre who stayed at a new york ymca during his first five 
months in the united states in 1952 a spokesman for the soviet 
embassy in washington dc said he hadnt heard about the ymca 
reopening in his country 
nowadays there are so many organizations and we cant know 
every one of them said andrei parastayev the embassys first 
secretary there is a rise in political activities of the young 
people and of course they want to express themselves 
goncharoff said the reforms of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev have made it possible for the ymca to attempt a return 
only since gorbachev could such a historic event be 
possible he said in a recent interview the last five years 
we began to explore actively the idea of ymca in russia 
the ymca had firm roots in czarist russia with branches mainly 
devoted to physical activities for young men but after the 1917 
bolshevik revolution its doors in petrograd now leningrad and 
many other cities were shut goncharoff said 
today the organization intends to give soviet youths training 
in western management styles and let them participate in exchanges 
with american and canadian youths he said 
there is a great excitement for solving community problems in 
the soviet union and thats what the ymca is all about here ms 
wroblewski said 
the organization also plans to offer activities involving music 
theater and other arts goncharoff said 
the ymca was founded in london in 1844 as a conduit for 
religious study it has spread to 97 countries and serves about 30 
million people ms wroblewski said

he roared like a lion but when it 
was time to fight he scurried like a mouse running from hole to 
hole as us paratroopers tried to trap him 
he repressed us for years and then he humiliated us by giving 
up without a fight said taxi driver pedro hernandez i never 
supported him but he should have fought 
there was no final power play and gen manuel antonio noriega 
didnt go down in a blaze of bullets a fitting end for someone to 
be romanticized in latin american folklore once his political 
crimes and other sins are forgotten 
he did not even have the guts to kill himself said 
housewife martiza martinez 
instead of the name commander of dignity his cronies gave 
him because he stood up to americans mrs martinez said he was the 
commander of indignity 
although most panamanians were opposed to the military strongman 
who named and fired six presidents like shop supervisors they 
almost believed his nationalist rhetoric of fighting to the death 
he was said to enjoy a crisis and it seemed that was the case 
as he survived threat after threat to his reign many expected him 
to die fighting to be carried out of the barracks face up 
noriega was defiant and mocking when the united states indicted 
him in 1988 on drug trafficking charges he vowed our life for 
panama and said the us accusations were masking designs to 
renege on the panama canal treaties and maintain the us military 
presence in panama 
for more than a year noriega repressed all dissent silenced all 
opposition survived two coup attempts and got away with annulling 
the may 7 election his candidates lost he portrayed himself as 
david fighting the american goliath arms in the air ever the 
winner 
in the end even his governmentrun newspapers and radio 
stations almost believed the propaganda noriega became a hero a 
man who could do no wrong the savior of panama while the americans 
were stupid their soldiers cowards drug addicts and aids carriers 
so his flight to the vaticans embassy on sunday to seek asylum 
was an anticlimax not only for his supporters who hoped he would 
take to the hills and lead an insurgency war but also to 
detractors who wished him dead 
i did not think he was going to be such a coward said a 
government official who had sympathized with noreiga and requested 
anonymity bacause he wants to keep his job in the new usbacked 
government 
it was a big bluff said judith alvarez who said she was 
still nervous even though noriega was closeted in the vatican 
mission i will feel safe when i see him behind bars 
many panamanians felt it was more a question of the americans 
suffering him until their patience ran out that happened on dec 
16 when members of noriegas security forces killed an american 
soldier in civilian clothes near panamanian military headquarers 
us army south commander maj gen marc cisneros a 
mexicanamerican from texas who considered noriega an affront to 
latin america angrily demanded an explanation and an apology and 
threatened military reprisal 
but when 26000 us troops invaded the country one week ago 
noriega was surprised and there were not many in his 15000member 
defense forces willing to fight for him 
most units surrendered although the 1800 or so who fought back 
surprised the americans with their stubborn resistance 
but according to us officials noriega never led the troops in 
battle when the first shots were fired he fled and spent the next 
six days running from place to place as us soldiers combed the 
city looking for him and his associates most of whom were turned 
in by angry neighbors 
and panama city paid a high price 
el chorrillo a populous lowincome barrio of old wooden 
structures around the panamanian military headquarters was leveled 
by the guns of the us armys sheridan tanks the number of dead 
in the neighborhood known for its friday night street 
celebrations will never be known 
moaned taxi driver hernandez all those people died because of 
this coward

gov bob miller has set the stage for a 
court battle with the federal government by rejecting four permits 
to study a nevada sites suitability as the nations first 
highlevel radioactive waste dump 
this issue will certainly go to court miller said tuesday 
after rejecting the permit requests by the federal energy 
department the legislature has passed and i have signed bills 
that make the dump illegal here 
we cannot issue permits allowing the doe to begin testing a 
site we have outlawed they cant proceed without these permits 
carl gertz the energy departments project manager for the 
proposed yucca mountain site 110 miles northwest of las vegas 
agreed that millers action made a court battle inevitible 
he said a lawsuit would be filed early next year to obtain the 
permits 
it seems strange to us that state officials say yucca mountain 
is not suitable for the repository yet the state will not grant us 
the permits needed to make that determination scientifically he 
said 
current plans call for a waste site to be established by the 
year 2010 to store 70000 metric tons of radioactive wastes for 
10000 years yucca mountain is the only location in the country 
under consideration 
miller said the energy department has no authority to conduct 
experiments at yucca mountain without the states approval that 
was blocked earlier this year when the legislature passed a bill 
forbidding the storage of highlevel nuclear waste in nevada 
energy department officials maintain the state cannot ban the 
repository until the president recommends a site to congress

a close aide to gen manuel noriega pleaded 
innocent to federal charges of drug smuggling moneylaundering and 
racketeering saying he chose to surrender to us troops in panama 
so he could stand trial 
lt col luis del cid is charged in the same february 1988 
indictment that accuses the ousted panamanian dictator and leaders 
of colombias medellin drug cartel of importing cocaine into the 
united states 
del cid 46 commanded a panamanian defense forces unit in the 
province of chiriqui until he gave himself up saturday to us 
forces that invaded the country to oust noriega 
i surrendered myself i wanted to be brought here del cid 
told us district judge william hoeveler in miami on tuesday 
del cid strongly denied the charges against him he then 
formally pleaded innocent to all four counts and demanded a jury 
trial 
he told his troops not to fire not to engage in any combat 
to turn their arms in assistant public defender ken swartz said 
after the hearing 
he didnt want any more bloodshed it was his desire to 
surrender to the us forces and to come here to face these 
charges said swartz 
us attorney dexter lehtinen described del cid as one of the 
righthand men of general noriega 
we allege del cid personally imported shipments of cocaine 
and he personally transmitted large amounts of cash lehtinen 
said 
hoeveler appointed swartz as del cids temporary counsel after 
the panamanian testified he had only 7000 with him del cid said 
he couldnt get funds from his panama savings account which has 
been frozen 
del cid is unemployed swartz told the judge adding his 
former employer is out of business 
the judge blocked efforts by the us attorneys office to ask 
detailed questions of del cid in an effort to uncover any 
additional assets hoeveler said such testimony could affect the 
racketeering counts against the panamanian 
del cid who if convicted could be sentenced to 70 years in 
prison and fined 550000 was ordered held without bond until a 
full hearing jan 2 
the judge also denied a request by prosecutors to block contact 
between del cid and noriegas us attorneys 
needless to say we wish to monitor this case to see whats 
happening and obviously look at what if any evidence the 
government may have said frank rubino one of the noriegas 
attorneys in florida 
after the hearing lehtinen referred all questions about noriega 
to officials in washington and refused to say what contacts his 
office had made with del cid 
lehtinen also refused to comment on whether del cid has 
indicated he might testify against noriega 
del cid noriega cartel leader pablo escobar gaviria and 12 
others are accused in the miami indictment of running drugs and 
using panama as a safe haven for traffickers 
the indictment alleges that del cid was used by noriega as an 
emissary as noriega allowed the cartel to process drugs launder 
money and ship cocaine through panama 
in addition noriega is accused of taking a 46 million bribe 
from the colombians 
del cid is accused of being personally involved in a 
400kilogram cocaine shipment to florida in december 1982 
he also allegedly picked up 100000 from noriegas personal 
pilot floyd carlton cacerez in november 1982 and delivered 
200000 to carlton at the military headquarters in panama city a 
month later 
carlton is a principal witness in the case

president mikhail s gorbachev will travel to 
lithuania in coming days to try to persuade the republics defiant 
communist party to reaffirm its allegiance to the national party 
officials say 
when it declared itself independent on dec 20 the lithuanian 
communist party created the first major crack in the political 
monopoly forged by vladimir lenin after the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution 
gorbachev attacked the lithuanian party leadership at a meeting 
of the soviet partys central committee held monday and tuesday to 
consider the lithuanian break with moscow 
he accused the lithuanians of allowing themselves to become 
hostages to separatists 
but in a report published tuesday in the party newspaper 
pravda he also urged maximum restraint to allow emotions to 
cool the 250member central committee unanimously approved the 
report 
the committee decided to send gorbachev and other top party 
officials to lithuania to explain our position and at the same 
time to get a better sense of the situation there vadim a 
medvedev a politburo member and the partys chief ideologist told 
a news conference afterward 
medvedev said some officials at the central committee meeting 
proposed ousting the lithuanians from the national party or 
annulling the lithuanian decision but others pushed more moderate 
measures 
all were united however in their disapproval of the lithuanian 
move mededev said most agreed that this was a blow to 
perestroika he said referring to gorbachevs program to 
restructure the soviet economy and to a certain extent the 
political system 
medvedev said the trip to lithuania would take place in not 
very many days and that the central committee will make a firm 
decision on the dispute in january 
the lithuanian communist leader algirdas brazauskas said in an 
interview that the party officials visit would be good and 
helpful an editor at lithuanian radio said 
despite the postponement of a full decision the central 
committees stand as stated tuesday refused to recognize the 
lithuanian partys selfproclaimed independent status 
no part of the soviet communist party has the right to decide 
the question about its independent existence with its own program 
and rules not taking into account the position of the soviet 
communist party as a whole gorbachev said in the report approved 
by the plenum and this means that the communist party of 
lithuania was and remains a part of the united soviet communist 
party 
gorbachev tried for several months to head off the lithuanian 
split 
at the congress of peoples deputies meeting in moscow on 
saturday he lashed out at separatists today to realize the 
right to selfdetermination through secession means to blow up the 
union set the people against each other and sow conflict and blood 
and death 
gorbachev told the central committee meeting the soviet 
government should consider the legal status of movements that are 
carrying out separatist activities and whipping up nationalist 
terror 
he did not identify any such organizations but in the context 
of the debate he likely was referring to lithuanias peoples 
front known as sajudis and other groups pushing for independence 
from the soviet union 
medvedev said the fight against separatist groups would not 
involve the use of force by moscow were against application of 
the military or other such methods he said 
thousands of people gathered tuesday in vilnius lithuanias 
capital for a rally in support of the regional partys move said 
lithuanian radio editor eduardas potasinskas 
brazauskas in an interview with the interfax news service 
published tuesday defended his partys decision as a step toward 
renewal of the party 
the idea is to make sure that the public perceives it as a new 
political force with a new message he said 
medvedev however said the lithuanian party would end up 
crushed by separatist and nationalist forces without moscows 
support 
despite gorbachevs bluster brazauskas and other lithuanian 
party leaders maintain that the soviet leader has shown 
understanding of their move

romanias princess ileana now a nun at an 
orthodox monastery in rural western pennsylvania said her homeland 
was saved in the nick of time by a revolution she never thought 
shed live to see 
i always believed my prayers would be answered the rev 
mother alexandra said tuesday 
the 80yearold daughter of king ferdinand and queen marie and 
greatgranddaughter of englands queen victoria and czar alexander 
ii of russia said her european contacts told her ousted president 
nicolae ceausescu had to die 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed by a firing squad 
monday following conviction by a secret military tribunal the 
former communist leader and his wife had been captured saturday a 
day after a popular uprising forced him from power 
he was denounced as the antichrist and accused of killing 
60000 people 
they said 60000 is enough and it execution had to be 
done because it would have gone on and on and on mother 
alexandra said in a telephone interview from the orthodox monastery 
of the transfiguration near ellwood city they had to do it so 
they tell me i personally have no opinion 
mother alexandras father was king from 1914 until his death in 
1927 her nephew king michael was forced to abdicate by the 
communists in 1947 and lives in switzerland 
i didnt expect the whole thing i must say ive lived with 
it so long its been 42 years since i left she said 
the strength of the country has always been in its peasantry 
thats what ceausescu was destroying i hope there is enough of 
them left and enough intellectuals left to be able to build again 
princess ileana was exiled from romania with the rest of the 
royal family soon after king michaels abdication in december 1947 
she immigrated with her husband an archduke of austria and 
their six children to switzerland and then argentina before 
settling in 1950 in the united states the move ultimately led to 
divorce 
she ended a second marriage to become a postulant or a 
candidate for the religious order in 1961 six years later she 
took her monastic vows and put up a trailer outside ellwood city to 
began building an englishspeaking monastery for orthodox women of 
all ethnic backgrounds 
mother alexandra said she has spent much of the past week on the 
telephone with friends and relatives in europe keeping abreast of 
developments and consoling friends of the many who died in the 
uprising 
she said that even with the changes elsewhere in eastern europe 
she did not expect such quick drastic moves in her homeland 
quite honestly i was feeling very depressed about it she 
said i thought everybody was doing something but nothing was 
moving in romania at all and suddenly it blew up 
mother alexandra said she is working with the romanian orthodox 
episcopate of america in jackson mich to organize a save romania 
fund she also plans a special service at the monastery this week 
for romanias dead 
she said she would consider returning to romania if i could be 
of use

the vatican said today there is no legal way 
its embassy in panama can hand over gen manuel antonio noriega to 
us authorities 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro also said the vatican had not 
discussed with any countries the possibility of arranging exile for 
noriega who turned himself in to the vatican embassy in panama 
city on sunday 
navarro told a news conference that noriega took refuge after 
the papal nuncio or ambassador to panama agreed to let the ousted 
dictator stay in the embassy he arrived there five days after us 
troops invaded panama in an effort to capture noriega and restore 
the elected government 
asked about us demands that the embassy directly turn over 
noriega to us authorities navarro said there was no legal way 
that could be done he said the embassy is empowered to deal only 
with the government of panama and no other foreign government 
the panamanian government has not made any request for noriega 
navarro added 
he said the vatican and the united states were working together 
to find a legal solution satisfactory to both sides 
were dealing with a complex problem whose various elements 
cannot be ignored these elements include legal considerations 
diplomatic humanitarian and therefore ethical ones he said in a 
statement 
asked about reports of hard feelings between the vatican and the 
united states navarro said there has been no element at all 
that could be called a situation of strain tension 
misunderstanding 
he said meetings between us and vatican officials on the 
noriega case have taken place from the beginning in a clear and 
very cordial climate 
the comments contrasted with reports from washington where a 
state department source said monday that the united states had 
demanded in extraordinarily tough terms that the vatican turn 
over noriega to the united states where he faces drug charges 
earlier this week navarro virtually ruled out the possibility 
noriega would simply be turned over to us authorities as demanded 
by the bush administration 
vatican officials have said noriega will probably be granted 
exile in a third country 
however navarro said the vatican had not been in contact with 
any countries about the possibility of offering noriega exile and 
said it was too soon to talk about that 
navarro said three other panamanians arrived at the embassy 
sunday with noriega he identified them only as a military captain 
his wife and another military official 
he said the holy see believes the matter can be resolved in 
days not weeks but provided no evidence of progress in talks 
on the fate of the deposed panamanian strongman

the first officer of the queen mary 
said hell probably be the next to walk the plank following firings 
of two waiters whose mustaches ran afoul of a walt disney co 
grooming code 
first officer john magness said he planned to keep the mustache 
he has worn for 42 years while serving on ships around the world 
im going to work punch in as usual and if they want to fire 
me they can find me and fire me magness 65 said tuesday 
adding that he would fight the anticipated dismissal in court 
waiters reza nazertehrani and tom nicolai were dismissed 
christmas eve for refusing to shave facial hair forbidden by 
disney which owns the leaseholds on the permanently docked ocean 
liner in long beach harbor 
i got a beautiful present from the disney corporation my 
pink slip said nazertehrani a 12year queen mary employee 
nicolai 26 said the 35yearold disney policy barring facial 
hair is out of date 
both men said they would file union grievances protesting their 
dismissals 
the grooming code bans mustaches beards and long hair on men 
bright eye shadow red fingernails or twotoned hair for women are 
forbidden 
nazertehrani 43 said the issue involved more than appearance 
i am iranian he said this mustache is part of my 
culture it is a thing of pride 
five or fewer queen mary workers have lost their jobs for 
refusing to shave said rich kerlin a spokesman for the tourist 
attraction he said the firing of nazertehrani and nicolai on 
christmas eve was an accident of scheduling 
disney bought rights to the ship a couple years ago but only 
imposed its companywide dress and grooming codes on it recently in 
conjunction with a promotional campaign 
i think the initial reluctance people expressed has subsided 
it was controversial for only a week or two kerlin said 
the nofacial hair restriction puzzles some who recall that walt 
disney sported a mustache

afghan refugees today rallied in 
several pakistani camps to mark the 10th anniversary of the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan 
also today western diplomats in islamabad said the latest 
reports indicate the communist government which the red army left 
behind in afghanistan in february has arrested more than 200 
people in a recent coup plot 
tens of thousands of afghan guerrillas and their supporters 
burned effigies and listened to impassioned speeches at refugee 
camps around the pakistani frontier city of peshawar where several 
usbacked rebel groups are based 
they vowed to keep fighting for the downfall of president najib 
and pledged to replace his marxist administration with a 
guerrillarun moslem government 
about 100000 soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in 
december 1979 to replace one promoscow government with another 
they stayed on to help fight the insurgency that began when the 
afghan communists seized power in 1978 
soviet forces fought the guerrillas for nine years before 
completing a phased withdrawal feb 15 the kremlin continues 
massive military supplies to the kabul government the moslem 
rebels are supported by the united states 
the communists still hold afghanistans major cities but the 
guerrillas control most of the countryside 
gulbaddin hekmatyar leader of the hardline hezbiislami 
guerrilla group told a crowd of supporters at the hyatabad refugee 
camp near peshawar today that his party would never enter a 
coalition with the communists 
we believe that only the cessation of delivery of arms to the 
crumbling kabul regime will seal the fall of this disgusting 
regime hekmatyar said 
he also has accused the united states of interfering with his 
aims 
western diplomats in islamabad speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
has arrested more than 200 people in the latest outbreak of 
factional infighting in kabul 
officials in kabul reported only the arrest of about 100 
clandestine hekmatyar supporters earlier this month however 
western diplomats allege that it was a coup plot among members of 
the afghan army 
in recent years the governing parcham wing of najibs party 
has survived several conspiracies by the khlaq faction which 
is dominated by the military 
an estimated 2 million afghans have fled the civil war to 
neighboring pakistan and 1 million went to iran

party today withdrew from talks between east germanys coalition 
government and other opposition groups after he was accused of 
corruption 
the announcement came as the talks which concern the future 
course of the country resumed today after a christmas break 
wolfgang schnur chairman of the democratic awakening party was 
accused in the newspaper junge welt of using his position to obtain 
a large apartment that originally had been allocated to a family 
with several children 
the 45yearold lawyer denied the allegations but said he was 
withdrawing from the talks until the matter had been clarified he 
said he was the target of a massive campaign aimed at 
discrediting him and his party politically and he claimed his 
mother who is jewish has received threats from neonazis 
schnur elected chairman of democratic awakening earlier this 
month when the opposition group met to constitute itself as a 
political party said he would seek a vote of confidence from the 
party board 
since the fall of hardline communist leader erich honecker on 
oct 18 east germans have been intent on rooting out corruption 
most such allegations have centered on the top levels of the 
nowousted communist party leadership 
east german leaders have instituted dizzying changes following 
protests by hundreds of thousands of people for democratic reform 
it opened the berlin wall as part of loosened travel restrictions 
in november promised free elections and called for the talks 
between communist and opposition leaders 
honeckers successor egon krenz also resigned as president and 
a noncommunist replaced him in a new coalition government which 
includes the communists and four traditionally allied parties 
communist premier hans modrow is handling daytoday affairs until 
the free elections 
the talks involve 37 representatives from five established 
political parties including the communists and representatives of 
16 opposition groups 
the discussion group is acting as a watchdog group on modrows 
government until the elections may 6 
junge welt a youthoriented newspaper once closely allied with 
the communists made the allegations against schnur 
schnurs party has maintained close contacts with west german 
officials but is split on the question of reunification it has 
also called for a free market system in east germany although 
there is a dispute on this topic as well 
his movement has existed as a party for only two weeks and its 
national influence is still hard to assess 
schnur said he would sue the newspaper which has become 
increasingly independent and aggressive in its reporting schnur 
also said his mother received anonymous letters containing threats 
from neonazis 
east german leaders have said they are on guard against a 
possible rise in nationalist and neonazi groups as a result of 
the turmoil gripping the communist country

more countries today joined the major powers in 
recognizing romanias new government and millions of dollars in 
medical supplies and food were pledged to help the country recover 
from its bloody revolution 
more than 20 countries have recognized romanias provisional 
national salvation committee which took charge friday when the 
popular revolt toppled president nicolae ceausescu 
china which violently crushed a prodemocracy movement in the 
spring today congratulated romanias new leaders ceausescu was 
one of the only world leaders to support chinas crackdown 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev gave his personal support 
to ion iliescu the chief of romanias new provisional government 
and an acquantance from their college days 
japan said it would send 1 million following an appeal by the 
international committee of the red cross for 4 million in medical 
relief 
the japanese red cross society sent medical supplies worth about 
700000 to romania and committed a sixmember medical team to help 
the wounded 
the irish red cross said today that it would send eight tons of 
medical supplies food and equipment and it began a fundraising 
campaign to match a cash donation of about 43000 promised by the 
irish government 
an israeli military spokesman said a plane loaded with six to 
eight tons of medicine bandages and equipment and two 
romanianspeaking surgeons left for bucharest today 
france said its post office would send free aid packages to any 
identified recipient in romania until january in a separate 
statement the government said that besides two planeloads of 
medical aid sent saturday about 20 planeloads had been sent by 
nongovernmental organizations including 100 tons of medical 
supplies and 60 doctors and nurses 
the bush administration said tuesday it was providing 500000 
to buy medical supplies 
a score of countries including the united states and the soviet 
union recognized romanias provisional government over the past 
several days and more joined in today 
israel formally announced its support for the new romanian 
leaders and condemned the mass slayings by forces allied with 
ceausescu 
the statement by foreign minister moshe arens to parliament was 
the first time israel openly criticized ceausescu who had been 
highly regarded in israel for maintaining a longstanding alliance 
with the jewish state 
gorbachevs contratulatory message was carried in the government 
daily izvestia and was strikingly informal signed simply m 
gorbachev with no title accenting the unusual recognition of an 
informal government was a shorter announcement immediately below 
signed by the council of ministers of the ussr congratulating 
petre roman on becoming the romanian prime minister 
denmark sent a congratulatory telegram to romanias newly 
appointed leader ion iliescu said hans henrik brunn of the 
foreign ministry 
in zambia president kenneth kaunda prayed that ongoing 
changes will be without further loss of life the official zambia 
news agency reported 
assistant secretary general adnan amran of the arab league was 
quoted as telling abu dhabis staterun newspaper alittihad that 
the changes in romania were respected by all arab states because 
they express the will of the romanian people 
czechoslovakias communist daily rude pravo said the cabinet 
recognized romanias national salvation committee on saturday and 
praised the armys decision to support the people 
the united states was among several countries that criticized 
the new government for trying and executing the ceausescus in 
secret 
today japans liberal asahi shimbun daily newspaper said the 
actions violated democratic principles 
granted though that the couple had committed great crimes 
it remained a categorical imperative of democracy to go through the 
legitimate legal procedure and give the verdict of guilty it 
said 
egypt today also criticized the secret trial while supporting 
the new romanian government 
londons conservative daily mail newspaper said the criticisms 
come easy from the comfort of western armchairs 
such advice takes little account of the necessities imposed by 
a civil war while ceausescu stayed alive his securitate 
secret police had every incentive to carry on fighting and 
killing in the hope of restoring him to power the paper said 
the british government has said it regretted the trial and 
killings 
iolanda stranescu president of the british romania association 
said ceausescu should have had a public trial 
it is difficult at this range to know all the reasons for the 
execution maybe it was security perhaps at a public trial too 
much information might have come out about people who want to be 
involved in the new government stranescu said 
the kuwait times said ceausescu deserved more time to answer the 
charges against him 
those who tried the deposed head of state have proved 
themselves overefficient in their performance they seem to have 
handed down a preordained death verdict to the accused without 
judging its merit under the accepted canons of justice it said

early trading continuing the trend that accelerated after a 
weekend explosion at the nations secondlargest petrochemical 
plant 
heating oil futures prices had surged tuesday in the wake of the 
blast at the exxon corp refinery at baton rouge la the accident 
at the plant which normally produces about 44 million gallons of 
heating oil daily aggravated a price spike caused by the 
recordsetting cold snap that has hit much of the nation and raised 
the prospect of further spot oil shortages 
the explosion christmas eve killed two people and shattered 
windows in buildings as far as six miles away the second body was 
recovered tuesday an investigation has yet to determine the cause 
of the blast 
supplies of home heating oil already were tight before the 
explosion and the accelerated demand has pushed retail prices as 
high as 1 a gallon in some areas 
wholesale prices also have surged as reflected by the futures 
market heating oil for january delivery up 1074 cents on 
tuesday jumped another 402 cents to 9650 cents a gallon in early 
trading today on the new york mercantile exchange

january up 549 cents on tuesday rose 006 cent to 61 cents a 
gallon in early trading today 
theres no stopping prices for the short term until the 
temperatures warm up said dillard spriggs president of 
petroleum analysis ltd in new york

reported last week that some of their terminals in the northeast 
suffered temporary oil shortages and customers were sent to other 
suppliers or forced to wait for new shipments 
on tuesday texaco spokesman peter maneri said further 
information on the shortages was unavailable mobils offices were 
closed for the holiday and telephone calls went unanswered 
exxon spokesman jim davis in houston said the company wouldnt 
have any problems supplying contract volumes of heating oil to 
customers there is some flexibility in the network he said

at its refineries in baytown texas and linden nj davis said it 
was impossible to predict when the baton rouge refinery would begin 
operating normally again 
he said the crippled plant made a large heating oil shipment to 
the east coast on saturday and hadnt planned to supply the region 
again until after jan 1 
but oil traders appeared skeptical 
the markets factoring in a lot more than that said peter 
beutel assistant director of the energy group at elders futures 
inc 
the futures market is betting it will take exxon five days or 
more to get the baton rouge refinery operating normally again

when american wounded began arriving last 
week from panama maj nelson smith and hospital staff quickly 
realized that the injured soldiers families were going to need 
help too 
the military does things differently than other people do 
smith observed tuesday for the families of the wounded 
particularly those unfamiliar with the military bureaucracy it 
was something of a culture shock he said 
for instance families had to apply for identification badges 
before seeing their loved ones and could not visit them without an 
escort 
were more structured to protect the privacy of the patient 
than a civilian hospital said smith a clinical social worker 
smith the chairman of the social work department at wilford 
hall medical center and others established a reception center to 
help the visiting families deal with wounds and injuries to their 
sons and husbands 
about 250 wounded soldiers have been treated at wilford and 
brooke army medical center since the united states invaded panama 
last week 
many soldiers have been released or transferred to their home 
bases tuesday marked the first day in a week that military 
hospitals did not receive wounded soldiers from panama and today 
there were 41 soldiers at wilford hall and 17 across town at brooke 
army medical center 
president bush will visit the wounded soldiers sunday the white 
house said 
smith 42 said the sight of loved ones being reunited with 
those wounded in panama recalled the return of american hostages 
from iran in january 1981 
smith was assigned to the us hospital in wiesbaden west 
germany where the newly freed hostages were taken for observation 
and treatment before returning to the united states 
both the hostages returning from iran and the soldiers wounded 
in panama were very emotional it was the same sense of relief 
that they had survived smith said 
he said the soldiers from panama and the hostages behaved 
similarly concentrating on televised news accounts of the event of 
which they were part 
smith said the hospital and volunteers have been working hard to 
help families of casualties through reception centers staffed by a 
clinical social workers and two mental health technicians 
he said the first thing family members want to do is to see 
their loved ones regardless of the wound or injury smith said 
relatives must be accompanied by a hospital staff person or 
volunteer during that initial encounter to give them whatever 
emotional support they may need 
we dont let them go up by themselves he said

the justice department today asked authorities 
in four european countries to freeze bank accounts where it 
believes ousted panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega stashed 
millions of dollars in illegal drug profits 
we have taken steps today in four european countries to freeze 
assets in numerous accounts said david runkel the departments 
chief spokesman officials say noriega hid at least 10 million in 
the accounts 
as the department sought to gain control of noriegas money 
us officials in panama and washington negotiated with the 
vatican whose embassy in panama city took in an exhausted noriega 
and 10 associates sought asylum sunday noriegas regime was 
toppled on dec 20 by us troops 
us officials sent letters to authorities in switzerland 
france luxembourg and britain asking them to halt transactions in 
the bank accounts belonging to the deposed panamanian dictator 
runkel said 
the actions were taken under international treaty agreements 
that the united states has with the foreign nations he said 
based on records seized in panama which was invaded by us 
troops on dec 20 us officials believe they can document that 
the money in the overseas accounts stemmed from noriegas alleged 
drug dealing runkel said 
we will have to demonstrate to the banking officials that 
the money was earned illegally he added he said preliminary 
discussions were under way with other countries where noriega has 
money 
while the justice department is trying to freeze 10 million 
the state department estimates noriegas worth at about 200 
million to 300 million 
in a speech last august deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger alluded to multimilliondollar transactions noriega has 
made over the past two years involving accounts in west germany 
switzerland and luxembourg 
justice attorneys are confident that banking officials in the 
four european countries will cooperate with their request weve 
had a remarkable display of international cooperation runkel 
said 
but he added there is a possibility that noriega his family or 
his bankers have already transferred the money out of the accounts 
since the us invasion 
freezing the accounts if the first step in a process to seize 
the assets runkel said distribution of the money however would 
be governed by the laws of the countries where the cash is hidden 
president bush meanwhile told reporters today he did not think 
that he or the us government would be embarrassed if information 
about noriegas past links to the cia came out during a trial of 
the panamanian 
i think thats history and i think the main thing is he should 
be tried and brought to justice bush said in corpus christi 
texas and we are pursuing that course with no fear of that 
you know you may get into some release of certain 
confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole 
justice process but the system works so i wouldnt worry about 
that 
president bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier that 
noriega can talk until hes blue in the face about his links 
with bush and the cia 
the spokesman was referring to things noriega might reveal about 
his past close ties with the us government including the period 
in the 1970s when bush headed the cia it wont hurt anything 
fitzwater added 
we want noriega here because he would cause trouble wherever 
he goes we want him in a nice jail cell where we can keep an 
eye on him fitzwater told reporters aboard air force one en 
route with bush to a fishing and hunting vacation in texas 
in panama city gen maxwell thurman head of the us southern 
command met facetoface three times with monsignor sebastian 
laboa the papal nuncio on the street outside the embassy 
less public diplomatic channels also were used to communicate 
with the vatican though bush has not contacted pope john paul ii 
while us troops ringed the vatican embassy to block noriega 
from leaving defense secretary dick cheney indicated the soldiers 
could be in for a long wait 
it could be that theyll the vatican have a longterm 
resident in their embassy in panama city he told abctv 
cheney along with national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff briefed 
bush on the panama situation at camp david md on tuesday 
the vatican which has no extradition treaty with the united 
states has refused to hand over noriega to the united states 
sources in rome said the vatican would rather turn noriega over to 
a third country while another possibility is having noriega stand 
trial in panama 
fitzwater said administration officials have not ruled out 
various options although the us policy is that noriega should be 
brought to trial in the united states should the united states 
receive custody of noriega he would be brought first to miami for 
an initial court appearance 
fitzwater said the united states would keep troops around the 
vatican embassy as long as hes there 
while us officials rejected the idea that noriega be given 
political asylum one expert said noriegas fate is in the 
vaticans hands 
asylum in an embassy is well recognized said john lawrence 
hargrove executive director of the american society of 
international law if the vatican says he is entitled to asylum 
he is safe the latin americans are especially strong on diplomatic 
asylum 
runkel said noriegas claims to asylum are invalid because he 
doesnt fit into the categories for which asylum is granted 
persecution on the grounds of religious or political beliefs 
his fears are of prosecution in the united states on two 
indictments he said 
meantime cheney who spent christmas day in panama indicated 
some of the 26000 us troops in the country could be brought back 
sooner than expected because the situation is returning to normal 
he gave no timetable 
despite occasional sniping incidents cheney said the 
overwhelming sense is a return to normalcy cheney said the 
us military did its job and now the lawyers and the 
diplomats have to take over

romanias new president today defended 
the swiftness of nicolae ceausescus trial and execution and said 
there had been indications forces loyal to the ousted dictator 
might try to free him 
proceausescu security police today attacked bucharest 
television headquarters where the provisional government was 
based but were driven off by army units supporting the revolution 
after a gunbattle of a half an hour the army regained firm 
control of the situation hungarys mti news agency reported from 
the scene 
mti said the army was in control of most of the capital but that 
there were fears the security police would strike again 
overall however things appeared to be quiet and businesses 
and factories began resuming operations after the 12daylong 
revolt that ousted ceausescu after 24 years of strict communist 
rule 
the governing national salvation committee demanded that 
security police surrender by thursday and indicated they face the 
same fate as ceausescu and his wife elena if they do not 
the government set up military courts tuesday to try members of 
ceausescus vicious security police 
ion iliescu named president by the governing national salvation 
committee today defended the secrecy surrounding the ceausescus 
trial and execution on christmas day 
we are people carried away by a very spontaneous process so 
there was a general demand which pushed us to follow this 
process he told french television he said the security police 
could have tried to rescue ceausescu 
romanias agerpres news agency said tuesday night that romanias 
interim leaders set up special military courts to try all cases 
of terrorist acts and said sentences would be carried out 
immediately 
it said the interim government demanded all members of the 
security police surrender by thursday afternoon or they will be 
tried and condemned 
romanian television tuesday night showed the first videotape 
footage of the trial of ceausescu and his wife 
everything that was said here is false and i dont want to 
talk anymore ceausescu told his accusers insisting he was still 
in power and refusing to acknowledge either the severe hardships he 
forced on his people or the massacre of thousands of people by his 
security forces 
earlier in the day state television showed pictures of the 
bulletriddled bodies of nicolae and elena ceausescu who was 
secondincommand in romania 
ceausescu unrepentant right up until his execution did not 
tolerate even the mildest dissent in 24 years of rule and many 
romanians are concerned that the bloody 12dayold revolution that 
toppled him will not lead to democracy 
iliescu in a speech tuesday night stressed that the 37member 
national salvation committee intends to govern only until new 
structures can be established under a new constitution 
the leadership promised free elections in april which would be 
the first in romania since 1937 
the committee comprised of dissidents disaffected government 
officials and army commanders has run the short and bloody 
revolution since taking over television headquarters friday 
sporadic gunfire still rang out through parts of the capital 
after proof of the execution was broadcast but bucharest radio and 
romanian sources said ceausescu loyalists were surrendering by the 
hundreds 
many buildings in bucharest were burned out or pocked by the 
thousands of bullets and shells fired in earlier battles between 
the army which sided with the people and security forces 
sniping from windows and rooftops 
the provisional government appointed its leaders on tuesday and 
said it was repealing many hated laws that held romanians in a 
straitjacket of repression including one that required the 
registration of all typewriters 
some members of newly founded political parties demanded that 
all communists be excluded from the government 
the committee said iliescu 59 a senior communist official 
until his demotion by ceausescu would remain chairman as well as 
president petre roman a 43yearold professor of hydroengineering 
with no political background was named prime minister 
in one of the governments first acts iliescu and defense 
minister gen nicolae militaru ordered the dreaded state security 
department placed under the jurisdiction of the defense agency 
leaving only traffic police firefighters and prison guards under 
the jurisdiction of the interior ministry 
other decrees repealed laws forbidding unauthorized contact with 
foreigners and requiring the intelligentsia to live in the same 
city where they work a statute frequently used to banish critical 
voices to remote towns 
what we have achieved so far is to solve only emergency 
problems prime minister roman told the soviet television news 
program vremya 
the questions ill be dealing with are connected with 
restoration of the economy under new conditions 
in a late night television address reported by agerpres roman 
said his new government would be formed quite soon 
we are not in a desparate situation he was quoted as 
saying but he noted that the ceausescu clique left the economy 
a disaster 
the economy and social organization were at the beck and 
call of two primitive minds with no perspective but with the 
thirst for power roman said of the ceausescus 
at his trial the 71yearold ceausescu lashed out at his 
accusers as the charges were read against him and refused to reply 
when asked who ordered that demonstrators be shot on dec 17 in the 
western city of timisoara where the revolt began 
this was a coup detat and i dont answer your questions 
he said 
the ceausescus were convicted of killing more than 60000 people 
during their years in power stashing more than 1 billion in 
foreign banks and ruining the national heritage and economy 
romanias standard of living has plunged in recent years because 
of ceausescus harsh campaign to pay off the foreign debt which 
included exporting the vast bulk of the nations crops 
a military officer who asked not to be identified said 300 
soldiers volunteered for the firing squad to kill the former ruling 
couple but only three were chosen the ceausescus were granted 
their last wish to die together the officer said 
down with tyranny a radio announcer proclaimed after the 
executions romania is free the supreme moment has come 
for some death was not enough 
he should be stripped naked and his body paraded through the 
streets said dimitru minca 70 whose 14yearold grandson was 
among those killed in the unrest 
the ceausescus were reportedly captured in an underground bunker 
after fleeing the capital in a helicopter their son and daughter 
nicu and zoia and other family members were arrested and 
reportedly face trial

warren ohio tribunechronicle on the panama invasion 
we can find plenty of reasons for wishing president george bush 
had not invaded panama wednesday to oust dictator manuel noriega 
furthermore bush pulled the trigger on what at first glance 
looks like flimsy pretexts 
noreiga did virtually declare war with the united states friday 
and his actions in the next few days were troubling but while we 
do not mean to belittle anyones life only one us citizen was 
killed before the invasion 
and while wednesdays wellorchestrated events began with the 
swearingin of a democratic government our invasion made it our 
government in a sense our puppet and yet deep inside we have a 
gut feeling that justice just might have been served 
we should be humble and perhaps even a little ashamed we had to 
resort to violence but noriega by all accounts did deserve to be 
ousted and should be brought to trial in that light perhaps a 
more apt comparison than the invasion of czechoslovakia may be the 
killing in romania would we protest if soviet president gorbachev 
invaded romania to put a stop to the killing there

the greenwood miss commonwealth on the panama invasion 
president bushs decision to invade panama were certain will 
be well received by the american people his popularity rating will 
shoot upward 
this is the president who has been criticized for being too 
cautious and too prudent a wimp some have called him now hes 
playing rambo 
few nations are applauding us might does not necessarily mean 
right despite the fact that noriega was a disreputable dictator 
who pushed his luck too far and who should have been dumped 
but many americans do not properly appreciate the sensitivity of 
the latin americans to intervention by uncle sam the latins have a 
name for it gunboat diplomacy 
the united states has no legal or moral right to intervene in 
the affairs of independent nations 
in this case noriega made it easy for bush 
in retrospect we wonder why our government made it so hard for 
noriega to step down peaceably why did we insist that he be tried 
on drug charges we should have eased him out cajoled and 
persuaded him to resign then slipped him away to exile

the birmingham ala news on the panama invasion 
panama may have lost a tinhorn dictator last week but in the 
near future it will gain about 375 million in assets and 
multimillions more in back taxes from us companies 
looks like a pretty good swap from here 
the united states cut off all military and economic aid to 
panama in july 1987 in an attempt to force manuel noriega from 
power 
further sanctions sharply restricted us companies that do 
business in panama froze panamanian assets held in the united 
states held payments relating to operating the panama canal in 
escrow and forbade american companies from paying taxes and fees to 
the noriega regime 
but those sanctions probably hurt the poor people of panama more 
than noriega

the tulsa okla tribune on the panama invasion 
the bush administration will make a tactical error if it insists 
that gen noriega now sequestered in the quarters of the vaticans 
apostolic nuncio be turned directly over to us soldiers 
surrounding the property 
let us not forget that the no 1 objective was not to capture a 
man wanted on criminal charges but to oust a bloody and corrupt 
dictator 
noriega is such an opprobrious character that it would be 
foolish to give him a chance to play the martyr by demanding that 
the vatican shove him out the door into the hands of what is in 
fact an invading army we would raise again all the anger latent 
at best in latin america over the colossus of the north 
it would be far better to allow the vatican which wants nothing 
of this red hot potato to hand him over to whatever passes for the 
military forces in panama not under control of noriega officers

los angeles times on the panama invasion 
by surrendering to vatican diplomats on christmas eve former 
panamanian dictator manuel noriega saved himself at least 
temporarily from the us military forces that ousted him 
even if noriega evaded the us government again he still stands 
deposed and discredited and thats an important victory 
the holy see may give him to the new civilian government in 
panama which also wants to put noriega on trial or it may 
negotiate noriegas departure to a third country like cuba but 
frankly now that noriegas come to a pathetic end hes no longer 
of any real concern there are far more important tasks facing the 
united states in panama getting us forces out of the country 
as quickly as possible helping panamas new civilian 
government build the genuine democracy that has never had a chance 
to develop in that country rebuilding panamas badlydamaged 
economy

the spokane wash chronicle on nuclear plant safety 
officials at us nuclear weapons plants say the knowing 
disregard for worker safety that prevailed 30 to 40 years ago would 
not occur today 
americans in general and weapons plant workers in particular 
can hope thats true they may never feel completely confident its 
true though given the evidence that weaponsproduction pressures 
have taken precedence over worker safety for virtually the entire 
history of us nuclear weapons production 
congress is in the process of providing funds for a new 
generation of nuclear weapons plants so dramatic are the trends in 
superpower relations that even the most prudent observers rightly 
can ask how much production capacity is required some such 
capacity however will be required if only to recycle old 
warheads to glean the materials for a much smaller deterrent force 
given that need for a new generation of weapons plants congress 
must see to it that those new plants are operated safely the means 
to that end not yet achieved is a management structure severing 
safety obligations from production responsibilities and making the 
latter subordinate to the former

the cedar rapids iowa gazette on mississippi river pollution 
abuse and indifference finally have caught up with the 
mississippi river it probably shouldnt have come as too great a 
shock recently when the environmental group greenpeace pronounced 
the father of waters a soup of toxic chemicals 
iowas contribution to the pollution is varied although the 
greatest portion comes from agricultural pesticide runoff 
startling quantities are involved it has been determined for 
example that 112000 pounds of the chemical alachlor flows past a 
test site in louisiana each year 
the greenpeace report pointed a finger at specific industries 
as well claiming they are discharging metals solvents 
cancercausing hydrocarbons and assorted other toxins into the 
mississippi at clinton muscatine and riverdale 
any smugness we middle americans may have felt toward our 
countrymen in the sooty grimy reaches of new york or california 
with their debrisinfested beaches is misplaced until we get to 
work cleaning up after ourselves

the omaha neb worldherald on the soviets and nato 
after years of hating the nato alliance and trying to weaken it 
the kremlin now apparently sees nato as a way of keeping germany 
from attempting to capitalize on soviet weakness 
american diplomats have pointed to the warsaw pact as a 
stabilizing infuence as eastern europe undergoes what amounts to a 
democratic revolution shevardnadze has made a similar point 
regarding the american presence the two germanys are not likely to 
go wobbling off on a disturbing political or military course if 
soviet and american troops are still present in the heart of europe 
reducing those troops to more reasonable levels is now the work 
of the sovietamerican arms negotiators in geneva the job should 
be easier because the soviets finally admit that the americans are 
in europe to keep the peace not to start another war

make in a year 
the star outfielder will make more in a month than south 
dakota gov george mickelson will for his entire fouryear term 
at 9 million for three years puckett will average 250000 a 
month and he isnt even the highest paid player in major league 
baseball 
lately baseball players have been grabbing the spotlight they 
have been the beneficiaries of a spectacular new boom in salaries 
the players have shown that they can overpower team owners at the 
bargaining table as well as on the field 
the new salary structure is almost sickening it reflects a 
skewed system of public values that has actually been in place for 
decades dont blame the modern players for taking what they can 
get thats how free enterprise works 
if you like blame the owners who publicly plead poverty and 
then get into multimilliondollar bidding wars for mediocre 
pitchers and 225 hitters 
mostly though blame those of us who are silly enough to keep 
going to games keep watching them on television keep reading

a work crew christmas weekend was 
assigned to do nothing but flush the 503 toilets at the gator bowl 
to prevent a freezeup at the stadium before the annual new years 
college football game 
a freeze in 1983 caused about 400000 damage in broken water 
pipes so when record cold headed for town last week officials 
hired a crack brigade of toilet flushers to keep water moving 
through the plumbing 
from dusk friday until noon on christmas the 23member crew 
flushed toilets each person was responsible for an average of 218 
toilets each 
everything went fine until a power outage shut down stadium 
water pumps on saturday and sunday the stadium sustained about 
5000 damage to plumbing 
when the pumps werent working and the water pressure was bad 
there wasnt much you could do said sports complex manager

us soldiers played loud rock music 
mowed the lawn and shot out street lights around the vatican 
embassy today after hours of curbside diplomacy failed to break a 
stalemate over the status of gen manuel antonio noriega 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said in italy today there was 
no legal way the holy see could hand over noriega to us 
authorities 
president bush said he would not give up efforts to gain custody 
of the ousted dictator who is wanted in the united states on drug 
charges 
the justice department meanwhile asked authorities in 
switzerland france luxembourg and britain to freeze bank accounts 
in which noriega is believed to have stashed millions of dollars in 
illegal drug profits 
before dawn a company of american soldiers paraded past the 
vatican embassy where noriega sought refuge christmas eve five 
days after american troops invaded panama in an effort to capture 
him 
american troops mowed down a field of tall grass alongside the 
embassy overnight and shot out all working street lights with a 
pellet gun 
later in the morning some soldiers hooked up small olivegreen 
speakers in the parking lot of the nearby holiday inn and played 
david bowies modern love album and other rock music at high 
volume the sound easily reached reporters in a 12thfloor room 
overlooking the vatican embassy 
army lt col jerry murguia a spokesman for the us southern 
command said he could not comment on why the troops might have 
mowed the lawn and shot out street lights 
the music appeared to relieve the tedium for some of the 
soldiers who have had to stand in the hot sun for hours wearing 
heavy flak jackets 
on tuesday us soldiers searched the vatican representative 
monsignor sebastian laboa and his car as he left the embassy 
apparently to prevent noriega from being spirited out 
after a week of fighting order returned to panama city crews 
cleared mounds of garbage left from wild looting sprees that 
emptied shelves and many people returned to work 
the us military reported only scattered clashes with noriega 
loyalists tuesday a few members of his defense forces were 
arrested and many surrendered 
on the third day of negotiations over noriegas fate gen 
maxwell thurman who commands us forces in central and south 
america posted himself outside the vatican embassy for nearly six 
hours tuesday afternoon 
he met three times with laboa in the street and spent the rest 
of the time waiting in a car one of a caravan of sedans jeeps and 
armored personnel carriers that escorted him to the mission 
neither thurman nor other us officials would comment on the 
negotiations 
at the vatican navarro told reporters the holy see could not 
legally give noriega to us officials because the embassy is 
empowered to deal only with the panamanian government he said 
panamas usbacked civilian government had not made any request 
for noriega 
navarro also said the vatican had not spoken with other 
countries about arranging exile for noriega 
the united states and the vatican have no extradition treaty and 
the vatican criticized the bloody us invasion that toppled the 
general and installed the government of president guillermo endara 
who was elected in may in balloting noriega nullified 
without an agreement noriega will not get past the us troops 
surrounding the vatican mission under international law embassies 
are considered inviolable and us troops cannot legally enter the 
mission to get him 
us troops also surrounded the cuban nicaraguan and libyan 
embassies where it was thought noriega might try to seek refuge 
in retaliation nicaragua announced today it will not permit a us 
plane carrying supplies to the us embassy in managua to land next 
month until the embassy standoff ends 
bush speaking to reporters today in texas said he was 
personally involved in trying to win custody of noriega and had set 
no time limit on negotiations 
the us southern command said noriega probably went to the 
vatican mission on his own after his closest collaborators either 
deserted him or were arrested 
lt col luis del cid considered one of noriegas righthand 
men pleaded innocent tuesday in us district court in miami to 
drug smuggling charges 
i surrendered myself i wanted to be brought here he told 
the court 
he is charged with racketeering drug smuggling and money 
laundering in the same february 1988 indictment that names noriega 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said del cid was a liaison 
courier and emissary for manuel noriega dealing wit drug 
trafficking 
us drug agents in panama were scrutinizing thousands of 
documents seized in raids on noriegas houses and government 
offices including the headquarters of the antinarcotics special 
force 
the information included files on foreigners entering and 
leaving the country a us drug enforcment administration agent 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said some of the files were on 
colombian drug lords 
in panama city us troops continued to block some major 
streets adding to the usual traffic jams and 15 tons of emergency 
medical supplies arrived to help hospitals in need of blood 
surgical equipment and other basics 
since the invasion began 23 americans and 293 panamanian 
military have been killed and 330 americans and 123 panamanians 
wounded according to the southern command another 4446 
panamanians have been detained 
panamanian doctors say more than 100 civilians were killed and 
hundreds of others injured no complete figure was available 
because many civilians were buried quickly in common graves and 
there were no authorities to keep records

north korea urged fellow communist countries 
wednesday to heighten vigilance and unite against imperialist 
efforts to undermine socialism 
a commentary in the official communist party newspaper rodong 
shinmun did not directly mention the fall of the hardline 
dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu in romania or other changes in 
eastern europe although it blamed imperialists for what it 
called a scheme to make the most of changes in political and 
economic life in some socialist countries 
china and cuba were the only countries identified in the report 
north korea is ruled by a hardline communist leadership headed 
by kim il sung who like ceausescu built a strong personality 
cult 
the commentary broadcast in part by pyongyangs official korean 
central news agency said the us imperialists were trying 
military threats blackmail political and diplomatic pressure and 
an economic blockade against cuba 
they are also continuing a vicious and shameless interference 
in the internal affairs of china displeased at the fact that the 
chinese people keep to the road of socialism after quelling the 
counterrevolutionary riot a reference to chinas june 34 
military crackdown of a studentled prodemocracy movement 
rodong shinmun said imperialists claim that some socialist 
countries should be given assistance needed for leading some of 
their policies to the capitalist market economy they scheme to win 
over and bring under their control socialist countries declaring 
that they would render economic aid to somer country and treat 
some other country as most favored nation 
they slander socialism in the media seek to infiltrate the 
corrupt bourgeois ideology culture and way of life into socialist 
countries and send in spies and saboteurs the paper said 
the situation makes it incumbent upon all socialist countries 
and the antiimperialist independent forces to heighten vigilance 
over the vicious and crafty antisocialist moves and reactionary 
offensive of the imperialists and pool their strength to repulse 
them it added

a un agency appealed wednesday for 
700000 tons of food to avert widespread starvation in northern 
ethiopia where as many as 4 million people are threatened by famine 
the un food and agriculture organization said its estimate was 
based on a recent crop survey which found that serious drought had 
cut harvests by nearly 80 percent in eritrea and 50 percent in 
eritreas southern neighbor tigre 
the fao said there also would be food deficits in eastern 
ethiopia and to a lesser extent in pockets of the southern and 
central regions 
an international relief operation of major proportions is 
needed to avert a repeat of the 198485 drought and famine when an 
estimated 1 million people died said fao directorgeneral edouard 
saouma in a statement issued in nairobi 
the ethiopian government has put the number of people threatened 
with hunger at 18 million and directed the countrys own relief 
agencies to study ways to get relief food to them 
the situation has deteriorated since the initial estimates in 
september by the romebased agency saouma said and the 
population at risk is increasing at an alarming rate 
he said current food stocks in the affected areas would be 
exhausted by early 1990 
only 270000 tons of food had been pledged so far by 
international donors and appealed for 700000 tons of emergency 
food mostly for the droughtaffected northern regions and 400000 
tons of structural and project food aid he said 
saouma also urged donors to provide logistic support to ensure 
the timely delivery of the emergency aid 
saouma did not specify the nature of logistic support but 
fighting in eritrea and tigre between the government and insurgents 
has closed many roads a situation that might require aircraft for 
relief deliveries 
relief agencies and donors have so far unsucessfully appealed to 
the rebels and the government to agree on air and ground corridors 
through which supplies can move unhindered by fighting 
another un agency the world food program has appealed for 
600000 tons of food to feed as many as 4 million people threatened 
with famine

romanias provisional governmment will 
ask switzerland for judicial assistance to try to recover any 
assets nicolae ceausescu may have stashed in swiss banks before he 
was ousted and executed 
ambassador gheorghe dolgu who declared his support for the 
anticeausescu uprising last week delivered a diplomatic note to 
the swiss justice ministry on wednesday announcing that a formal 
request would follow the new leadership has two months to detail 
its request 
in anticipation of the request switzerland on sunday froze an 
any assets linked to ceausescu or his clan addressing itself in 
particular to two of its largest banks credit suisse and union 
bank of switzerland 
the action was taken after moritz leuenberger a social 
democratic member of parliament and lawyer said he received 
information from unidentified romanian exile sources that ceausescu 
had transferred about 400 million chiefly gold bullion to 
zurich much of it in recent weeks and months 
justice ministry spokesman joerg kistler said a circular from 
the romanian national bank dated dec 25 asked all countries to 
block any ceausescu accounts they may be spotted 
according to a videotape of his secret trial released by the new 
leadership in bucharest ceausescu denied having assets in 
switzerland and refused to sign a statement authorizing the return 
of any such assets to the romanian national bank his wife elena 
rejected the military courts question about swiss funds as a 
provocation 
in zurich union bank spokeswoman gertrud erismann said the 
freeze had been superfluous because no serious bank would permit 
in such a situation permit the withdrawal of funds by people who 
may have obtained them illegally 
she declined comment when asked whether union bank had traced 
any funds confirming or denying their existence would violate 
swiss banking secrecy laws she added 
a credit suisse spokesman helmut reinke said a careful check 
had not produced any evidence of ceausesculinked assets at the 
bank

theres oil in them thar birds and two 
entrepreneurs are cashing in on the animal thats so despised in 
its native land that the government once paid people to kill the 
varmints 
on a 65acre tract in the east texas piney woods mark solomon 
and dusty driskell are entering their second year as a new breed of 
texas oilmen raising emus 
its just been unbelievable for us beyond our wildest 
dreams said solomon 27 whose fulltime job with the texas 
department of criminal justice is designing furniture manufactured 
for the state by inmates 
we have to pinch ourselves to see if were awake its still 
hard to believe and we have to tell ourselves its really 
happening added driskell 29 a tax consultant 
last october the lifelong friends purchased a pair of emus for 
1800 the australian birds which resemble ostriches now fetch 
more than 12000 per pair 
they now have 31 birds including 12 breeding pair and profits 
from sales of birds to people who buy them as an investment have 
enabled solomon and driskell to purchase the 65acre spread in 
houston county 
people dont know what they are but theyve been good for 
us solomon said 
emus can grow to about 5 feet tall and can weigh up to 120 
pounds the only bigger bird is the ostrich emus have 
brownishblack feathers long neck and long legs that can propel 
them about 30 mph 
the birds meat leather and feathers are marketable but what 
makes emus valuable is the oil they secrete 
the oil about 5 quarts per processed bird is used as a 
pharmaceutical for people suffering from arthritis in cosmetics 
the oil is used in production of wrinkleretarding emollient 
driskell and solomon say the meat although not readily 
available tastes like beef and has less cholesterol and fewer 
calories the leather is used like ostrich leather and the feathers 
are used for fishing lures and feather dusters even the large 
toenails three per foot are used for jewelry 
right now its strictly a breeders market solomon said 
recently thats why prices are so high because there are not so 
many around but its getting more common 
emu prices are on the rise because of speculation about placing 
a processing plant in the united states according to the american 
emu association based in harper one plant already operates in 
europe and another in australia where thousands were killed and 
bounties were placed on the emu because the bird trampled sheep 
fences and ate crops 
the association estimates about 1500 breeding pair were in the 
united states as of last year with the largest concentration in 
texas driskell and solomon have driven as far as washington state 
and minnesota to purchase birds 
whenever the processing stage comes into play were going to 
get less per bird driskell said but ill be tickled to death 
when it happens because youll be looking at a definite place to 
sell the bird and a definite income coming in 
their first breeding pair named bonnie and clyde laid 36 eggs 
the first year the eggs which are dark green and resemble 
avocados hatch in 48 to 52 days and once the birds get into a 
cycle theyll lay eggs every three days 
driskell and solomon are expanding their farm and hope to 
eventually have 90 pens in operation 
some people will purchase chicks at 1000 to 1500 apiece 
keep them for three or four months and then sell for as much as 
3000 each feed costs are minimal ranging from 150 to 180 per 
year for each bird 
neighbors who raise cattle like to joke that texas is a land for 
moomoo not emu 
they are an ugly bird driskell acknowledged but when 
they sell for 12000 they look pretty good

now that hes been toppled and executed nicolae 
ceausescu has few defenders his rank secure among the centurys 
most brutal and despised dictators 
but it wasnt so long ago the romanian president was the wests 
favorite communist showered with kind words and economic benefits 
for his role as a maverick in the east bloc 
france was especially friendly toward ceausescus romania for 
many years seeing a people with cultural affinities as well as a 
country whose independence from the soviet union could be a 
mirrorimage for french refusal to follow us foreign policy leads 
in the aftermath of the romanian revolution france is now 
seeing apologies and recriminations as politicians and parties 
accuse each other of being slow to realize the scope of ceausescus 
abuses of power 
elsewhere the change of heart has taken a different form queen 
elizabeth ii stripped ceausescu of his honorary knighthood as a 
mark of revulsion at the abuse of human rights in romania 
king olav v of norway took away his honorary grand cross of st 
olav order and by action of queen margrethe ii of denmark the 
romanian leader was no longer a knight of the elephant order when 
he went before the firing squad 
all three monarchs acted after ceausescu was driven from power 
friday wiping out honors that had been awarded about a decade 
earlier when romanias reputation was at its height 
the process occurring in the aftermath of ceausescus ouster is 
similar to those that followed the demise of other dictators this 
century such as josef stalin in the soviet union ferdinand marcos 
of the philippines idi amin in uganda and jeanbedel bokassa of 
the central african republic 
it was not until early this year that the united states withdrew 
romanias valuable status as most favored nation for trade 
purposes on grounds of human rights violations 
as recently as 1986 reagan administration officials were 
defending romanias most favored nation status with edward j 
derwinski counselor of the state department telling a hostile 
congressional committee that romania had an overall reasonably 
good record on allowing people to leave the country 
ceausescus reputation for freethinking was earned in foreign 
affairs 
he condemned the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1979 and 
refused to join the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia that ended the 
prague spring liberalization movement 
ceausescu also stood apart from the other communist countries 
when he maintained links with israel after the 1967 middle east 
war eventually serving as mediator between israel and egypt in the 
talks that led to their peace treaty 
the gratitude won as the jewish states only ally in a hostile 
communist bloc has survived although israel condemned massive 
killings by the secret police and pledged support for romanias new 
leadership 
speaking as jews and israelis we cannot forget the general 
point we cannot remember our enemies and forget our friends 
israels former ambassador to bucharest abba geffen said 
wednesday on israel radio we must not enter into the 
anticeausescu hysteria 
anticeausescu sentiment was mostly to be found in moscow back 
in 1969 when richard nixon chose romania for the first visit by a 
us president to a warsaw pact country 
nixon and ceausescu delighted crowds by joining in a traditional 
romanian peasant dance with a romanian girl dancing between them 
their joint statement talked of a spirit of cordiality sincerity 
and mutual respect 
earlier in the 1960s french president charles de gaulle blazed 
the trail of ties between the west and romania 
de gaulle was following a policy of independence visavis the 
united states france was seeking an ally in the east ceausescu 
was following a similar path in the warsaw pact said ewa 
kulesza an expert on eastern europe at the french institute for 
international relations in paris 
there was a kind of identification between de gaulles france 
and ceausescus romania it was an illusion she said in an 
interview 
the illusion based in part on cultural associations between 
france and romania whose languages are similar was longlasting 
claude cheysson former french foreign minister who visited 
romania in 1983 apologized for his role in an interview published 
monday in the leftist daily newspaper liberation 
we should have been more clear in our denunciations of what we 
knew of what we guessed about romania so that perhaps we could 
have precipitated the movements that we see now cheysson was 
quoted as saying 
former president valery giscard destaing accused the current 
socialist government of not doing enough to call attention to 
ceausescus misdeeds 
socialist leaders criticized giscard destaing for exchanging 
visits with ceausescu while mitterrand at least scrapped a 
planned visit to romania in 1982 although he cited scheduling 
problems rather than human rights abuses the trip was never 
rescheduled 
giscard destaing replied in an interview in the rightist 
newspaper le figaro that he personally felt a strong antipathy 
for ceausescu after their 1980 encounter in france and said the 
translator at their session could confirm it 
the heaviest fire has focused on georges marchais the hardline 
french communist party leader who vacationed on ceausescus yacht 
in 1984 dissidents in the party called this week on marchais and 
the entire politburo to resign because of their past support for 
ceausescu 
the politburo replied that marchais had not seen ceausescu in 
five years and had made many quiet appeals to the romanian leader 
for respect of human rights

british diplomats to romania said they ran into 
the streets and shouted rebellious slogans during the revolt 
against nicolae ceausescu and some envoys even joined a crowd that 
stormed the television station 
we were cheering with them and shouting down with ceausescu 
we were romanians to all intents and purposes said army lt mike 
brown an assistant defense attache 
fifteen members of the british embassy in bucharest and their 
families arrived at londons heathrow airport tuesday night after 
leaving romania 
the foreign office said wednesday it had no problems with 
browns actions in bucharest 
a spokesman who was not identified in accordance with british 
practice said as he made clear he joined the crowd in order to 
be able to report developments if he had not shown some degree of 
enthusiasm the crowd might have asked who he was there were 
concerns in the crowd about the activities of the security forces 
brown 40 said he went into the streets with the embassy second 
secretary susan laffey to observe the uprising 
we worked as a team out on the streets for a considerable 
time the most remembered part for me was when we joined in with 
the students to take the television station brown said 
we went along with them we went along with the armored 
personnel carriers they had captured bedecked with civilians 
flags flowers and christmas trees 
we drove to the television building went through the building 
and through the forbidden zone and stormed the building with them 
brown said it was the diplomats job to observe the situation 
and they were taken along with it all 
we were swept away by the emotion of it all it was very 
exciting and we felt part of the events unfolding on the streets 
said miss laffey 28 
when asked if he felt his action violated his diplomatic role 
brown replied i dont think we took part in it we went along as 
fairly passive observers and i think that was our job if we hadnt 
cheered and shouted slogans there might have been queries as to who 
we were 
brown said on another occasion he and the defense attache had 
driven on an armored personnel carrier to the scene of an attack 
and went through so much blood in the streets they thought it was 
water 
i think there was an orgy of killing brown said 
brown said the british diplomats worked in four groups of pairs 
observing activities 
i dont think any of us had come away unscathed he said 
it will certainly be on my mind for the rest of my life i feel 
tremendous affiliation with the romanian people 
they have changed from being a nation of people who walk down 
the streets with their heads down now they are happy they read 
newspapers in the streets and have smiles on their faces 
veronica atkinson wife of british ambassador michael atkinson 
who has remained in bucharest said she hid in the basement of the 
embassy residence when one of the security policemen fighting the 
army was on the premises 
we were terrified we feared for our lives had we made any 
noise we would probably have been killed she said

soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
attempts in october to convince erich honecker to abandon stalinism 
helped topple the east germany leader a former honecker aide was 
quoted as saying wednesday 
gorbachev visited honecker in east berlin on oct 78 for 
celebrations marking east germanys 40th anniversary of statehood 
his visit came as a fledgling prodemocracy movement was growing in 
strength 
in an interview with the newspaper junge welt former parliament 
speaker horst sindermann said that gorbachev tried to convince the 
communist party chief to pursue reform and that honecker resisted 
the realization that honecker must go was growing all the 
time the last push came from gorbachevs visit for the 40th 
anniversary sindermann was quoted as saying 
sindermanns interview was the first insight into the power 
struggle that preceded honeckers last days in office and the 
pivotal role played by gorbachevs visit 
honecker a hardliner who ruled east germany for 18 years was 
ousted oct 18 and replaced as party leader by egon krenz growing 
pressure from the prodemocracy movement and dissent in party ranks 
forced krenz and the entire communist party leadership to step down 
dec 3 
a new communistled reformist coalition took its place and has 
agreed with the prodemocracy opposition to hold free elections on 
may 6 1990 
the 77yearold honecker and 11 of his former aides including 
sindermann have been expelled from the party honecker has been 
placed under house arrest and he and other leaders are accused of 
profiting financially from their positions of power 
gorbachevs visit came during a mass exodus of east germans to 
the west the official celebrations of east german statehood were 
marked by antigovernment demonstrations which included clashes 
between activists and security police 
sindermann one of honeckers closest aides in the ruling 
politburo said differences between honecker and other politburo 
members had been growing for some time 
describing a meeting between gorbachev and the politburo during 
the soviet leaders visit sindermann said gorbachev urged the 
leaders to pursue perestroika the soviet leaders system of social 
and economic reforms 
he told us we would have a much easier time with perestroika 
because we have a much higher level of economic development 
sindermann said 
but honecker kept on pulling out a un statistic that showed 
that we had a higher productivity than the soviet union and he 
used it to argue that we must stay true to the old course 
sindermann was quoted as saying he told this to gorbachev too 
that gave the impulse we came out of the meeting and we were 
united now is the end 
the next day we went to the politburo and former premier 
willi stoph made the motion to remove honecker and thats how it 
happened sindermann was quoted as saying 
he said the politburo voted unanimously to oust honecker he 
was fighting against it 
meanwhile talks between the communistled coalition government 
and the opposition resumed in controversy wednesday when the 
chairman of democratic awakening one of the new political parties 
withdrew from the forum 
wolfgang schnur denied newspaper allegations that he had abused 
his position to obtain a large apartment but schnur said he was 
withdrawing from the talks until the matter is clarified 
the fourth session of the discussions on the future of the 
country ended wednesday with opposition calls for more say in the 
daytoday running of the country 
several opposition leaders called on communist premier hans 
modrow to attend all the sessions and to consult more with the 
participants over important government decisions 
the talks involve 37 representatives from five established 
political parties including the communists and 16 opposition 
groups 
the forum is acting as a watchdog group on modrows government 
until the elections 
the official news agency adn published results of a survey 
carried out last week in leipzig the cradle of east germanys 
prodemocracy movement that gave modrow a 66 percent approval 
rating up from 58 percent a week earlier

defiant students shouted out criticisms of deng 
xiaoping and his handpicked successor wednesday in a dialogue with 
a senior government official 
the beijing university students in a twohour meeting with 
state council spokesman yuan mu also sought chinas response to 
events in romania and hissed when yuan stressed that china wont 
veer from its socialist road 
yuans meeting with the students appeared timed to the overthrow 
of romanias dictator nicolae ceausescu which has rekindled sparks 
of student activism smothered by the june crackdown on the 
studentled prodemocracy movement 
at least three illegal posters have gone up at beijing and 
qinghua universities in recent days commenting on romanias 
uprising according to chinese and western sources one poster 
said learn from romania 
another one of two at beijing university described ceausescu 
as a lost dog who might try to flee to china whose leaders had 
regarded him as a friend all the posters were torn down swiftly by 
authorities 
it was one of the first open acts of opposition to the 
government on the campus since it was in the forefront of the 
crushed student movement 
a student who attended the meeting said about 300 students with 
tickets issued by official student associations were allowed to 
attend the meeting and only universityapproved student leaders 
could read questions submitted in advance 
but one student shouted out a question asking why former party 
chief zhao ziyang was purged following the june turmoil and blamed 
for chinas economic and political problems when it was his mentor 
senior leader deng xiaoping who has decided policy in the past 
decade 
yuan didnt answer and also didnt respond when a student asked 
why deng had suddenly anointed new party chief jiang zemin as the 
core of chinas new leaders after allowing the ouster of two 
tried and experienced revolutionaries zhao and former party 
general secretary hu yaobang 
hu whose death in april set off the prodemocracy movement was 
also dismissed from office in january 1987 after being blamed for 
failing to stop student rallies for democratic reform 
the students asked the whereabouts of zhao who has not been 
seen in public since may and were told he is in beijing they also 
asked about wang dan the beijing university student who was one of 
the leaders of the spring movement 
beijing city party secretary general yuan liben said he was 
under arrest but provided no other details 
when asked about romania yuan mu replied no matter what the 
situation is in the rest of the world china will always walk the 
path of socialism uphold the socialist flag and adhere to the 
leadership of the communist party of china 
the student participant said yuan spoke with vehemence standing 
up and banging his hand on the table 
but when he went on to repeat familiar socialist principles 
some students made hissing noises the students were very brave 
to do that in these times the student said 
some students also yelled out questions about the legitimacy of 
two student leaders who were reading questions in may when 
independent student organizations were formed to challenge the 
officially sanctioned student unions students voted the two out of 
office the independent unions have since been declared illegal and 
the sanctioned groups restored to their former place 
the student said the session ended without all the questions 
being answered but that both sides appeared glad to terminate the 
largely fruitless dialogue 
since june university students have been subjected to a 
campaign of heavy political indoctrination and have been forced to 
write confessions repenting their activities during the 
demonstrations 
students say another major uprising is unlikely at present 
because of the political repression and close surveillance but 
that anger over the bloody military attack in june when hundreds 
and perhaps thousands of demonstrators were killed has not 
subsided 
in addition to the poster at beijing university another poster 
was seen recently outside the central drama academy urging students 
to remember june at least six people were arrested dec 9 when 
students from the beijing college of aeronautics unfurled a banner 
in front of the central tv station reading motherland why are 
you so poor

president bush said today that 
ousted panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriegas knowledge of cia 
activities could not embarrass the us government but that he 
could try to blindside the us judicial process 
i think thats history and i think the main thing is he 
should be tried and brought to justice bush said at a brief news 
conference as he arrived in texas for a sixday fishing and hunting 
vacation 
he said a trial on drugtrafficking charges lodged against 
noriega in this country could result in some release of certain 
confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole 
justice process but he added the system works so i wouldnt 
worry about that 
bush was asked if he would direct release of any documents 
noriega might request in order to avoid challenges to the fairness 
of the trial as occurred in the case of irancontra defendant 
oliver north he replied thered be enough to see that hes 
given a totally fair trial certainly 
later bush appeared to leave open the possibility that noriega 
could be tried in panama he said there was a threat of noriega 
regaining power if he remained there unless he were in total 
custody and sentenced to the prison sentence he deserves 
the president said he was personally involved in efforts to gain 
custody of noriega from the vatican embassy in panama where 
noriega has been sheltered since christmas eve but he had not 
contacted either the papal nuncio in panama city or pope john paul 
ii 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
aboard air force one en route to texas that noriega can talk 
about the cia and bush until hes blue in the face it wont hurt 
anything 
he was referring to things noriega might reveal about his 
previous close relations with the us government including the 
period in the 1970s when bush was cia director and noriega was an 
intelligence source 
we want noriega here because he would cause trouble wherever 
he goes we want him in a nice jail cell where we can keep an 
eye on him fitzwater said 
he said it would require a lot of diplomatic effort and a lot 
of it on my part to address the concerns of latin american 
leaders who have been critical of us military action in panama 
but he said that as they see democracy functioning in panama and 
noriega brought to justice they would begin to see the problem 
that might have been caused by a prolonged conflict down there 
bush taking questions yelled above the roar of helicopter 
rotors at a naval air station said there would be no time 
limit on negotiations over noriega 
the president was asked about the reported refusal of the 
vatican to surrender noriega who has taken shelter in its panama 
city embassy to us authorities that complicates things if 
they said that he said 
bush said that however he wanted more specific information on 
the vaticans position and would not give up hopes of winning 
noriegas extradition we will continue to negotiate he said 
the president defended his decision to take the yearend 
vacation in view of the panama situation claiming he did not think 
it amounted to shirking his responsibility as chief executive 
during a time of crisis 
im not concerned about that at all why should i be he 
said things have gone well its winding down 
the president said that he would stay in constant touch with his 
national security advisers in washington by telephone by secure 
link and he noted that secretary of state james a baker iii had 
come along with him for part of the vacation 
look i dont make any cover im going to be enjoying myself 
and i think the american people understand that he said i 
think ive worked pretty hard all year 
on another subject bush said he hoped that stability could soon 
be restored to romania and said that the provisional government and 
the army appeared to be doing a good job of restoring order 
my concern is for tranquillity and freedom in romania bush 
said 
the president said that he was touched by hearing a guy 
singing a christmas carol on romanias staterun television 
claiming it was the first time that a christmas carol had been 
heard on the public airwaves in 40 years bush said it made a 
dramatic statement for me 
democracy and freedom is on the move around the world he 
said 
bush who wore a hunting jacket and the pinstriped pants of his 
suit as he spoke briefly with reporters aboard the plane said he 
spent much of his christmas holiday at camp david md on the 
phone but got a great christmas present in noriegas overthrow 
by us troops on dec 19 
the president and his wife barbara were at camp david with 
their five children and their families including 11 grandchildren 
describing his holiday bush said it was cold wonderful 
sleigh riding for the kids it was great 
earlier fitzwater said bush will keep close tabs on 
developments in panama by telephone he said tuesday the 
administration told the vatican very directly it wants noriega 
returned for trial 
fitzwater said bush was not taking a direct role in the 
negotiations on noriegas extradition 
after fishing in the gulf of mexico later today near corpus 
christi bush was to travel by helicopter some 60 miles to the 
ranch of a friend near beeville where he will spend two days quail 
hunting 
he goes to houston on friday where he will stay until monday 
on sunday he plans a side trip to two military hospitals near san 
antonio to visit us soldiers wounded in panama

nicolae ceausescu made the first of 
his final mistakes when he tried to deport the rev laszlo toekes 
a popular pastor of hungarian heritage who spoke his mind from the 
pulpit in timisoara 
romanias durable dictator did not like hungarians and a 
rambunctious community of ethnic hungarians challenged his control 
toekes articulate and courageous amounted to a dissident 
on friday dec 15 youths in the city about 300 miles west of 
bucharest formed a human chain to shield him from police and 
prevent his arrest they were dispersed with tear gas and water 
cannons but even larger crowds gathered at the cathedral the next 
day 
crowds again formed on sunday more raucous and threatening 
but still peaceable local officials fearing wrath from the 
ceausescu if things got out of hand ordered heavy repression 
security forces drove assault vehicles into the crowd and they 
opened fire innocent protesters died in their friends arms so 
did children no one knew the death toll but word began to spread 
around the world 
then ceausescu made another mistake he ignored the explosive 
situation and left on a threeday trip to iran authorities had to 
use their own judgment with only the dictators ironwilled wife 
elena to guide them 
because the world had gotten word of what was happening in 
romania even other romanians for a change were informed 
foreign radio broadcasts including those from neighboring hungary 
echoed the news to bucharest the capital and spurred protesters 
in timisoara 
despite the violent repression demonstrators came back and the 
guns fired again killings were mostly by the hated securitate a 
secret police and elite guard fiercely loyal to ceausescu but the 
army helped subdue protesers 
what should have been crowd control was a chilling example of 
the ruthless terror ceausescu had applied to keep his increasingly 
extravagant personal regime in place a protest of one mans 
impending arrest was suddenly a release for years of pentup hatred 
by thursday ceausescu was back in bucharest facing the worst 
crisis in 24 years of power thats when he made another mistake 
yet again ceausescu summoned his masses for a spontaneous 
outburst of their warmth and loyalty at a huge rally he harangued 
them with the old slogans if students were unhappy he would raise 
their allowances a little some subsidies would be increased 
as for timisoara he said it was the work of hooligan 
elements and external meddlers 
most of the crowd had to be there and their future in 
ceausescus society depended upon how earnestly they cheered but 
one group of young people mostly students had heard those 
stalinist formulas once too often 
they whistled and booed ceausescu to silence demanding an 
explanation for the events in timisoara the live tv and radio 
broadcast was cut for several minutes to spare the dictator further 
embarrassment 
ceausescus face showed disbelief as he plowed on but he had 
lost the crowd obedient applause was drowned out by cries of 
death death and down with ceausescu 
when the shaken dictator finished students staged their own 
rally they snaked through bucharest streets picking up in number 
and staying slightly ahead of the water cannons at nightfall 
thousands had assembled around university square 
sometime during the night the secret police went for blood 
light tanks crashed into the crowd marksmen atop buildings shot 
people in the back covered trucks carried the bodies to secret 
graves 
but the students came back the next morning on friday army 
tanks rolled up to face them but they did not fire instead 
students stuck christmas tree branches down their rifle barrels 
and soldiers smiled shyly in sympathy with the crowd 
ceausescus media pressed on in his service at 11 am the 
television announced that defense minister vasile milea committed 
suicide because he was found to be a traitor quickly word spread 
that he was shot for not ordering repressive fire 
a small delegation walked to the communists central committee 
building and persuaded the army to join the people 
ceausescu finally got the message he and his wife took a 
helicopter to a government airbase 30 miles north but could not 
arrange a safe haven in another country they headed north in a 
small car humbled and on the run until they were captured 
for days afterward secret police diehards fought urban 
guerrilla warfare to take back the capital the central committee 
building and the elegant palace nearby was bombed out and burned 
many thousands of romanians had to be buried 
nicolae and elena ceausescu were tried by a secret military 
tribunal he animatedly argued that the charges against him were 
lies that he ordered no killings that he and his wife lived as 
ordinary romanians 
but he made no apparent admission of the mistakes he made he 
and his wife were convicted of grave crimes against romania put up 
against a concrete wall and executed by three riflemen chosen from 
among hundreds who volunteered

the vatican on wednesday said it had not yet 
reached a decision about gen manuel antonio noriega but it 
declared it would not simply push him out of its embassy in panama 
and hand him to us authorities 
cuba nicaragua and the dominican republic have been reported to 
be contenders for accepting the ousted panamanian leader but 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said that so far the holy see had 
not contacted any third country 
its too soon navarro told a news briefing he added that 
as of this moment the vatican has not yet made a decision 
about noriegas bid for asylum status 
navarro was pressed repeatedly about bush administration 
assertions that the united states officials forcefully demanded 
noriega be turned over to us authorities so he can be tried on 
drug trafficking charges 
the united states has put its case very clearly and with 
respect and very cordially navarro said 
the vatican also presented its case with the same clarity 
navarro said 
taking into account international law and accepted procedure 
i dont see how the embassy can hand over someone to a nation 
other than the host country he said 
the vatican spokesman declined to comment on the us criminal 
accusations against noriega 
but he said he has also been head of government and of the 
armed forces theres something more than a criminal case here 
on wednesday a spanish newspaper published an interview with 
guillermo endara who was installed as president after the 
invasion endara whose election in may was voided when noriega 
seized the ballots was quoted as saying that noriega should stand 
trial and added panama cannot permit him to leave the country 
navarro said there had been no request by panama for noriega as 
of wednesday morning 
despite his estimate that the dilemma could be resolved in a 
few days not weeks navarro offered no evidence that the united 
states and the vatican were close to a solution 
noriega has been staying at the vatican embassy in panama since 
sunday 
he is not allowed to make telephone calls not allowed 
visits navarro said he is simply staying at the embassy 
while his case is debated 
navarro said the general a captain and his wife and another 
panamanian military officer were allowed to stay after noriega made 
a very serious commitment to help in easing the situation the 
bloodshed in the wake of the us invasion 
navarro said it was the papal nuncio or envoy who 
autonomously decided to give noriega shelter 
while pope john paul ii is not actively involved in the talks he 
has been kept informed of the situation navarro said 
the us ambassador to the holy see thomas p melady met 
wednesday with monsignor angelo sodano a senior vatican diplomatic 
official with expertise in latin american affairs navarro said 
navarro expressed hope the case would be resolved to the 
satisfaction of both the united states and the vatican and in 
accordance with the international right law and justice 
the vatican is studying the case in its juridical diplomatic 
and humanitarian and therefore ethical considerations navarro 
said 
seeking to dispel the reports of tense usvatican relations 
navarro said the us side had sent a message of appreciation for 
vatican officials availability during the christmas religious 
festivities 
navarro stressed that noriegas action is seen as part of an 
accepted practice in latin american countries of seeking asylum 
in embassies 
as for cases involving the vatican no one has ever been 
expelled from an embassy after seeking asylum navarro said 
he pointed out that just two months ago the vatican mission in 
panama city sheltered endara after he was beaten by noriega 
supporters 
the late cardinal josef mindszenty took refuge in the us 
mission in budapest after soviet forces crushed the 1956 hungarian 
uprising he had been freed earlier from prison by hungarian 
revolutionaries he had been convicted of treason in 1949 in what 
was considered a rigged trial 
mindszenty left at the embassy in 1971 under an agreement with 
the vatican

a rapist who called himself a vampire and 
drank a victims blood is suspected in at least six slayings and 
prosecutors are trying to build a murder case against him before he 
gets out of prison 
i dont feel comfortable with him being in our community 
state attorney norm wolfinger said of vampire rapist john 
crutchley the only crime weve proven him of is reason enough 
crutchleys former lawyer joe mitchell said he tried to work 
out a plea bargain in which crutchley would have admitted to up to 
six murders and led investigators to the burial sites but the 
talks broke down 
wolfinger said tuesday the informal negotiations broke down 
because the state could not produce solid evidence linking 
crutchley to any deaths 
there comes a point in the negotiations when the state has to 
show something the prosecutor said if we had had anything to 
tie a charge to we would have done it but we had nothing 
crutchley a former engineer pleaded guilty in 1986 to raping a 
19yearold woman and was sentenced to 25 years in prison 
prosecutors agreed to drop several other charges including robbing 
the woman of nearly half her blood 
with time off for good behavior crutchley could be out of 
prison by 1992 
doctors saihey have long suspected him in the deaths of at 
least six women in brevard county five victims whose bodies were 
discovered in 1985 and another woman who disappeared 
but wolfinger said his strategy was to get him in prison and 
continue the investigation of the homicides 
we will continue to work these cases as hard as we can he 
said

parliament on wednesday extended for two years 
emergency regulations that allow the military to hold palestinian 
prisoners from the occupied territories inside israeli territory 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip shops were closed by a 
general strike called by the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas 
or zeal the strike was first ordered for christmas but was delayed 
when palestinian christians objected 
israeli troops shot and wounded four palestinians in clashes 
with stonethrowing youths in the gaza strip arab hospital 
officials said 
at least 640 palestinians have been killed by israelis in the 
2yearold uprising against israeli occupation fortythree 
israelis also have died and 162 palestinians have been slain by 
fellow arabs on suspicion of collaborating with israel 
the latest death of a suspected collaborator occurred wednesday 
when jawad hassan mahmoud tmaizi 40 died of wounds suffered in an 
attack by fellow arabs the previous day 
the 120seat knesset or parliament extended the emergency 
regulations of 1967 for two years at the request of the government 
the vote was 299 
the regulations permit the military to hold palestinians 
arrested in the occupied lands in israeli territory they make 
israeli law applicable to israelis in the territories but not to 
palestinians who are judged in military courts 
this means there are different laws for jews and arabs this 
bill perpetuates discrimination amnon rubinstein of the liberal 
shinui party said during the knessets brief debate on the issue 
the army is holding about 9000 palestinians and has jailed more 
than 40000 during the uprising 
many have been held in the ketziot prison camp in israels negev 
desert and the united states and human rights group have 
repeatedly complained that imprisonment there violates the geneva 
human rights convention rule against moving prisoners out of 
occupied territory 
also wednesday about 1300 american and european peace 
activists toured towns in the west bank but witnesses said the 
army blocked one bus of about 50 people from entering jericho 
while letting a second one through later 
marina sereni spokeswoman for the 1990 time for peace 
movement said the army gave no reason for the action the army 
spokesmans office said it had no information about the bus 
ms sereni said the group was appealing to authorities to 
reverse a ban on visits by the peace activists to palestinian 
refugee camps 
elizabeth donini an italian delegate from torino also said the 
army intended to block palestinians from the west bank and gaza 
strip from joining the groups peace chain demonstration 
saturday 
we are here to stress palestinian rights and this act is 
unjust she told reporters we are here to demonstrate 
together palestinians israelis and europeans and stress the 
importance of peace 
army officials have refused to comment on newspaper reports that 
palestinians from the territories will be barred from taking part 
in the forming of a human chain around jerusalems old city

women will be earning more doctoral degrees 
than men by the year 2000 the department of education predicted 
wednesday 
in a projection of educational statistics for the remaining 
decade of the 20th century the department also said elementary and 
secondary school enrollments will increase dramatically and 
teachers will be paid 14 percent more in real purchasing power 
this publication will be a useful planning tool for our 
nations governors federal state and local leaders and members of 
the business community education secretary lauro cavazos said in 
a statement 
women have been earning more associate bachelors and masters 
degrees than men for the past several years but 1999 is expected 
to be the first year that they exceed men in the number of doctoral 
degrees received 
men will continue their dominance of first professional degrees 
in such fields as medicine and law according to the study 
entitled projections of education statistics to 2000 
other highlights of the study include 
secondary and elementary school enrollment is expected to reach 
495 million by the time classes begin in the fall of 2000 an 
increase of about 4 million students or 9 percent over the current 
school year enrollment has declined 4 percent in the past 11 years 
the biggest shift will be in the secondary schools since the 
rise in enrollment reflects an increase in births that began in 
1977 and has continued secondary school enrollment peaked at 157 
million in 1976 has since declined steadily and is expected to 
drop to 126 million students its lowest since 1963 next year it 
is expected to climb to 148 million an increase of 18 percent by 
the end of the century 
the average public school teacher is expected to earn 14 
percent more in real purchasing power after adjusting for 
inflation in the year 2000 than now the national average in the 
current school year is 31200 
the number of classroom teachers will increase by an estimated 
15 percent reaching 31 million by the year 2000 most of the 
increase will be absorbed in secondary schools which have lower 
studentteacher ratios and a greater range of subjects 
the pupilteacher ratio will continue to drop although not as 
steeply as in the 1980s by 2000 the ratio for elementary and 
secondary schools both public and private is expected to be 161 
students per teacher in the current year it is 169 in 1978 it 
was 192 
expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary 
schools now about 4800 are expected to rise by 24 percent after 
adjusting for inflation 
college and university enrollments are expected to increase 
from 128 million to 134 million a gain of 4 percent faculty 
will also increase by 4 percent from 741000 in 1988 to 771000 in 
2000

their matter he said 
im just amazed and respectful of the change that has taken 
place he said as arrived here for six days of hunting and 
fishing

forces to bay bush said the army seems to be doing that and 
my concern is for tranquility and freedom in romania 
the president sent a congratulatory message to romanias new 
head of state president ion iliescu 
the president expressed his sympathy over the tragic bloodshed 
over the past two weeks and his hope that romania will now move 
along on a peaceful path of democratic change the white house 
said in a statement issued in corpus christi 
the administration was sending a c141 cargo plane loaded with 
medical supplies to romania on thursday the agency for 
international development aid announced 
the cost of the flight and supplies about 250000 was in 
addition to the 500000 in cash the administration was giving to 
the international red cross for medical supplies along with 
25000 from an embassy contingency fund in romania 
in washington state department spokesman mark dillen said that 
the us ambassador to bucharest alan green had requested an 
appointment with the provisional president ion iliescu but no 
appointment had been scheduled 
commenting on reports of an anticommunist rally in the romanian 
capital dillen said the embassy had reported the demonstration was 
attended by 500 to 1000 students and that a student leader had 
appeared on romanian television 
we encourage the government of romania to allow all voices to 
be heard as the process of reform and the transition to a new 
government progress said dillen reading a prepared statement 
on tuesday andrew natsios director of the us aid office for 
foreign disaster assistance said that private citizens were 
welcome to help but that the best way to get assistance to 
romania is through cash donations 
concerned citizens are urged not to donate goods or supplies 
which are sometimes inappropriate and tend to clog relief supply 
lines natsios said on tuesday 
us officials who recognized the new government on monday 
expressed regret that romanian revolutionaries did not hold an open 
trial for ceausescu and his wife elena who were executed on 
christmas day 
we would have preferred it if there had been a public trial 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
state department officials said they had been in contact with 
romanian ambassador ion stoichici who announced over christmas 
weekend that the embassy staff had switched allegiances to the new 
government 
stoichici kept the doors of the embassy closed tuesday but said 
he was helping romanians who wanted to return home 
we have the same feelings as other romanians said 
stoichici who declared his loyalty to the new government on 
saturday before the outcome of the fighting was clear 
another embassy officer vasile leca said all the staff 
condemn the crimes that were done to the romanian people by nicolae 
and elena ceausescu 
stoichici and leca refused to allow a reporter inside the 
embassy speaking instead through iron bars on a window 
splattered frozen eggs coated the white brick walls of the 
embassy a turnofcentury mansion on sheridan circle along embassy 
row 
wooden police barricades and yellow plastic tape stretched 
alongside the sidewalk where over the weekend scores of romanians 
vented their rage against ceausescus 24year rule 
the ambassador said his first order of business was to work to 
improve relations with the united states which had grown 
increasingly critical of ceausescus human rights policies 
las evening the state department informed us that they 
recognized the staff of the romanian embassy as representative of 
the new government said stoichici he said he was in telephone 
contact with us authorities 
a state department official said no meetings were scheduled 
between stoichici and us diplomats 
they are in telephone contact with us but when we call them 
they dont answer said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity press calls to the embassy were not answered either 
romanian consular officials were accepting through the barred 
window visa applications from romanianamericans who wanted to 
return home

state regulators spurred by the 
collapse of lincoln savings and loan intend to prohibit the sale 
of highrisk junk bonds from the offices of californias 
statechartered thrifts 
a temporary order will be issued next week by the state savings 
and loan department chief deputy commissioner william davis said 
he said his agency will then begin procedures to make the order 
permanent 
the order will affect about 117 statechartered sampl offices 
currently no junk bond sales are taking place in any california 
thrift offices although such practices have occurred in the past 
davis said 
just so no one gets that idea in mind we are saying you cant 
do it davis said tuesday we just dont think it is a good 
idea 
an estimated 23000 investors mostly retirees in southern 
california claim they lost nearly 250 million when they 
purchased uninsured corporate bonds sold by american continental 
corp primarily through the 26 offices of lincoln savings its 
wholly owned subsidiary 
the irvinebased thrift was seized in april by federal 
regulators the takeover is expected to cost 25 billion the 
nations largest thrift bailout 
many investors said that because the bonds were sold at savings 
and loan offices they assumed they were insured against loss the 
bonds sold in 1987 and 1988 now are considered virtually 
worthless 
davis said similar rules on the sale of junk bonds are 
apparently being drafted by the us office of thrift supervision 
and by the us savings and loan league a trade association for 
the industry 
john jones a spokesman in washington for the office of thrift 
supervision said wednesday he didnt know of any such orders 
the chairman of the federal securities and exchange commission 
richard breeden suggested earlier this year that congress consider 
a ban on junk bond sales from sampl offices new regulations passed 
by congress already require sampls to get rid of their own junkbond 
investments by 1994 those rules dont apply to companies that are 
using sampl offices to sell junk bonds to the public 
at lincoln the actual approval to sell the bonds was given by 
the state department of corporations which is under fire for its 
role 
with that approval the state savings and loan department gave 
lincoln savings permission to lease space in each of its offices 
for employees of american continental to sell the bonds 
there was nothing illegal or illicit about what they were 
doing davis said but many of the senior citizens were not 
knowledgeable enough to realize the risk they were taking he added

inmates demanding better living 
conditions and amnesties staged hunger strikes or other protests in 
at least 20 prisons across the country wednesday 
opposition leaders many of them former prisoners themselves 
said they were working with the justice ministry in reviewing 
inmate grievances and would propose an amnesty for some prisoners 
any amnesty would have to be granted by the president who is to 
be elected friday vaclav havel a leader in the opposition civic 
forum is the only candidate 
the prisoners demands vary widely but focus on living 
conditions petr pospichal a civic forum spokesman said many of 
the demands were legitimate 
many of us have experience in this situation personally he 
said referring to several members of czechoslovakias reform 
government including havel who once were imprisoned for dissident 
activities 
the nonviolent protests began friday when 2500 inmates at 
leopoldov prison east of prague began a hunger strike demanding a 
general amnesty 
by wednesday the hunger strike had spread to 16 prisons in the 
czech republic and four in the slovak republic according to the 
justice ministry and the communist party daily rude pravo 
some prisoners waved banners advocating nonviolence 
the protest is spreading so fast its impossible to monitor 
said pospichal 
he said civic forum would ask that some sentences be reduced and 
some prisoners released 
all political prisoners were released from czechoslovak jails 
under an amnesty granted by hardline communist president gustav 
husak before he resigned dec 9 that amnesty covered 800 to 2000 
inmates 
popsichal said he did not know how many prisoners might be 
affected by a future amnesty but said six inmates sentenced in 
secret trials for espionage would be included on civic forums list 
of those deserving amnesty 
the president is the only one who can decide about whether to 
grant amnesty and the scope is his decision pospichal said 
the czechoslovak government meanwhile announced plans for 
lavish inaugural festivities including an outdoor ball following 
parliaments presidential vote friday 
havel a playwright and former dissident is the unchallenged 
candidate and would be czechoslovakias first noncommunist 
president in 41 years 
the election is the crowning victory of a peaceful revolution 
that began nov 17 and ended four decades of communist domination 
ousted hardline communist leaders and installed a reformist 
government to plan for free elections next year

the man who was driving the pickup truck 
in which former new york yankee manager billy martin was killed was 
legally intoxicated at the time of the accident a prosecutor said 
today 
results of the bloodalcohol test support the charge that 
william reedy was drunk when he drove martins truck off the road 
outside martins 148acre farm near binghamton kevin guyette of 
the broome county district attorneys office said 
guyette refused to say what reedys blood alcohol level was but 
he said reedy was charged under the new york state law that says a 
person is intoxicated when his bloodalcohol level is at least 010 
percent 
martin 61 died christmas night when the truck in which he was 
a passenger skidded off an icy rural road and into a ditch outside 
his farm 
reedy owner of reedys bar near detroits tiger stadium 
remained in a hospital with a broken hip and possible broken ribs 
martins funeral is scheduled for friday morning at st 
patricks cathedral in manhattan burial plans are pending 
investigators said it wasnt relevant whether martin as well 
known for his barroom brawls as for his managerial prowess had 
been drinking before the accident because he was a passenger in his 
own truck when it crashed 
reedy a longtime martin friend was charged with driving while

attorney general dick thornburgh announced 
wednesday he will proceed with plans to dismantle the justice 
departments organized crime strike forces despite some 
congressional claims the move is unwarranted 
starting jan 1 the 14 strike forces will be folded into 23 
us attorneys offices across the country thornburgh said in a 
statement 
i am convinced that this new organizational structure will not 
only strengthen our efforts against traditional organized criminal 
families but will enhance our efforts against new organized crime 
elements thornburgh said 
additionally thornburgh said he would create an organized crime 
council in washington to oversee the federal goverments attack on 
organized crime 
he defended the reorganization which had been revealed 
previously on the grounds that traditional organized crime run by 
mafia families has changed with the mob often working in tandem 
with colombian drug cartels and others 
moreover organized crime is also operated by elements in the 
asian community and gangs such as the crips and bloods and the 
jamaican posses 
in letters to members of the house and senate judiciary 
committees thornburgh also said his plan offers substantial 
managerial benefits that should not longer be postponed

strike forces and the us attorneys offices

solidarity lawmakers proposed 
constitutional amendments wednesday that include restoring the 
countrys name to the prewar republic of poland from the 
communistimposed peoples republic of poland 
parliament convened wednesday for a threeday session to 
consider sweeping economic legislation that was proposed earlier 
this month by the solidarityled government to transform the 
economy to a market system 
the government hopes by the end of the session that parliament 
will pass wideranging laws that aim to reduce the current 900 
percent inflation rate make the zloty a convertible currency and 
reform the bloated state sector 
in addition to the name change the constitutional amendments 
would remove 19 articles including one saying the polish peoples 
republic is a socialist state and another that mandates the leading 
role of the communist party in state affairs 
the prewar republic of poland was changed to the peoples 
republic of poland in july 1944 when sovietbacked polish 
communists entered the country and proclaimed a communist 
government in poland 
the package also calls for dropping the phrase that says the 
polish peoples republic will strengthen friendship with the 
soviet union and other socialist countries as well as removing a 
clause which refers to the socialist system in the polish economy 
the amendments were presented first to the solidarity deputies 
by caucus leader bronislaw geremek who appealed to the unionbacked 
deputies to be present for the debate in parliament 
geremek said an amended constitution would serve as a temporary 
one until a new constitution could be drafted the amendments must 
receive a twothirds majority of the sejm as the lower house of 
parliament is called to pass 
the amendments also would create a provision for the formation 
of new political parties as it is now worded the constitution 
allows only the communist party the democratic party and the 
peasants party to operate legally 
after the solidarityled opposition and communist authorities 
agreed to partially free elections at talks this spring 
unionbacked candidates to parliament were forced to organize 
themselves as a club rather than a political party because of the 
wording in the constitution

beneficial effect by putting the chill on next summers bug 
population 
the record cold last week and over the weekend may have killed 
off large quantities of fleas ticks gnats mosquitoes and flies 
said frank funderburk a bibb county extension agent 
its hard to say what nature is going to do but the insects 
that bother man should be less in number early in the summer he 
said 
the bug population could be back by late summer funderburk 
said and household pests such as cockroaches probably wont be 
affected by the cold he said 
the cold also may have slowed the spread of a virus that damages 
peanuts tomatoes and peppers sumter county extension agent tim 
lawson said the virus is carried by aphids and thrips insects 
susceptible to low temperatures he said 
georgias peaches may have gotten a boost from the cold peach 
grower robert dickey of musella said the cold was a good down 
payment on the 850 hours of chilling temperatures the trees 
need 
it couldnt be anything but beneficial to us peach growers 
he said last winter we didnt get the adequate chilling required 
and that was one reason our peach crop came up real short

on the 100th anniversary of the eiffel 
tower mock charges calculated to wound french pride claim the 
parisian landmark was copied from an ordinary light tower in san 
jose 
the claim a justforfun charge filed with san joses mock 
court of historical inquiry was brought against the estate of 
alexandre gustave eiffel and demanded all profits the french have 
received since the 984foot iron framework structure opened to 
sightseers at the paris exposition of 1889 
the trial was set for jan 25 
the complaint says eiffel got his idea for the tower after being 
stricken dumb with admiration upon gazing at a nowdefunct 
208foot light tower at a san jose intersection in 1881 the claim 
does not say what business eiffel an engineer had in the orchard 
capital of northern california 
the claim will be prosecuted by santa clara county deputy 
district attorney paul r bernal who admitted his case was built 
on hearsay and not a hint of direct evidence 
it was rumored at the time the light tower was built that 
gustave eiffel came to see it we are going to substantiate 
that rumor bernal heatedly told reporters 
lawyer jacques dulin pledged to defend the french origin of the 
tower describing the san jose version as puny 
we he fumed gave the americans the statue of liberty 
we did not give them the liberty to steal any of the other 
monuments of france

a top official declared wednesday that 
romania is no longer a communist country and revolutionary leaders 
tried to stop citizens from waging a witch hunt of revenge 
against supporters of the old regime 
security police still loyal to executed leader nicolae ceausescu 
attacked the television building in the capital early wednesday but 
were repulsed in a halfhour firefight news reports said 
the television building is the headquarters of the provisional 
government headed by new president ion iliescu who on wednesday 
spoke with mikhail s gorbachev and expressed his thanks for the 
soviet leaders support the men are friends from their college 
days in moscow 
dumitru mazilu vice chairman of the national salvation 
committee provisional government reaffirmed that the new leaders 
are devoted to replacing ceausescus 24year stalinist despotism 
with democracy 
the government has said free elections will be held in april 
we want romania to become a member of the free civilized 
world mazilu said romania is no longer a communist country 
romania is a free land and we will create a real democracy 
but the revolutionary government still is fighting a guerrilla 
war with ceausescu loyalists although the battles are waning 
romanian news reports said security police were holding out in 
isolated positions in other parts of the country but army 
forces backing the revolt were for the most part in control 
trying to heal the wounds of romanias revolution the interim 
leadership offered the possibility of lenient penalties to 
ceausescus security forces if they surrendered 
but there were suggestions those who did not give up could face 
the same fate as the ceausescus who were reported executed by 
firing squad on monday 
according to a communique read on bucharest radio security 
police members have until thursday afternoon to surrender or 
theyll be tried and condemned by special tribunals 
if they surrender voluntarily with their weapons they will 
be tried and the death penalty will not be applied the 
communique said 
loyalist ceausescu forces have been launching their attacks in 
bucharest from a maze of tunnels built by the dictator for the 
feared security police 
on wednesday night romanian tv showed nervous soldiers combing 
the tunnels in search of members of the security police known as 
the securitate 
the soldiers found bottles of whiskey radio equipment food and 
weapons caches and at least one gas mask but no security police 
the army troops kicked open doors leading to small rooms in the 
tunnels 
at one point a young soldier tipped back his helmet and wiped 
his brow after forcing his way into one of the rooms his 
frightened expression reflected romanians fear of the securitate 
unconfirmed reports have said ceausescus police have walked 
into hospitals hiding knives to carry out acts of terrorism and 
poisoned village wells 
there have been reports that securitate forces have been 
surrendering en masse after battling army units backing the 
revolution and armed citizens however there have been no figures 
on how many ceausescu loyalists have given up 
elsewhere romanian tv on wednesday showed workers taking down 
communist party signs and slogans from buildings in bucharest 
corneliu bogdan romanias new deputy foreign minister said 
that while bureaucrats who worked for years under ceausescu still 
are in positions of power the new government wants a clean 
peaceful break with the past 
they are not all criminals they were at the most too servile 
and obedient we must try to avoid a witch hunt at any costs he 
said 
the governing committee headed by iliescu a former communist 
party secretary ousted for challenging ceausescu is made up of 
dissidents intellectuals and disaffected army commanders and 
former government officials

romania was returning to normal and that 90 percent of the 
factories were back at work the soviet news agency tass said it 
said iliescu thanked gorbachev for a resolution passed by soviet 
lawmakers expressing support for the revolution at a time when its 
outcome was in doubt 
the national salvation committee named a new foreign minister 
university professor sergiu celac 58 his predecessor ion stoian 
has been ousted with ceausescus ruling cabal 
relief flights were arriving in romania as the country struggled 
to recover from nearly two weeks of upheaval at bucharest airport 
more than 40 relief aircraft had arrived by wednesday 
there is even too much aid said bernard kouchner french 
minister for humanitarian affairs we have to decide what is 
needed and then coordinate 
the revolution began with a protest in the western town of 
timisoara on dec 15 and escalated into huge demonstrations in 
which thousands are believed to have been slain 
thousands were reported massacred by troops in timisoara and 
dumped into mass graves during his trial ceausescu was accused of 
being responsible for the killing of 60000 people during his 
24year reign 
ceausescu fled his palace friday after army units joined the 
revolt since then the revolutionary government has been fighting 
urban guerrilla attacks by secret police he was captured saturday 
president bush said he was amazed at the changes that have 
taken place in romania we did say we were concerned that the 
trial of ceausescu should have been more open but thats their 
matter he said 
petre roman the countrys new interim prime minister defended 
the secret trial and quick executions of ceausescu and his wife 
elena 
we were in circumstances which did not permit us to wait 
longer in a situation of instability there were pressures we had 
information concerning possible attacks on the place where he 
was roman told french tv 
roman previously has said there had been indications secret 
police were making plans to try to free ceausescu 
at the onceprestigious university library 500000 volumes 
including some precious manuscripts were burned in a fire sparked 
by the fighting

long shelves of the works of ceausescu pages upon pages of his 
revised stalinist socialism 
from the first signs of ceausescus forced departure friday 
staff members began baling the dusty volumes to be destroyed 
no one ever read this stuff no one said virgil tiberiu

ceausescus being tried as well as photos of the couple lying dead 
next to a bulletriddled wall 
the firing squad was eager to execute the couple according to a 
man who said he was on the tribunal that tried the ceausescus 
we werent even able to film the execution because the 
soldiers lost control they could no longer wait to fire the man

the panama canal has been 
increasing its working hours gradually as employees return to work 
but 125 ships were backed up wednesday waiting to cross the 
isthmus a canal official said 
the canal was shut down to all ship traffic for the first 48 
hours after us troops invaded panama dec 20 it resumed 
operation during daylight hours but halted work at night because 
not enough employees could get to work 
some people are actually walking to work as much as 15 miles 
because theres no public transport said willie k friar a 
spokeswoman at panama canal commission headquarters just west of 
panama city 
but there is still a bottleneck of ships from around the world 
at the atlantic and pacific entrances waiting to pass through the 
canal she said 
we have 125 ships waiting ms friar said 
buses and taxis have begun cruising panama city streets but 
gasoline is hard to find following a looting spree 
us army lt col jerry murguia said gasoline was being 
distributed to service stations as life slowly returned to normal 
panama city is on the canals southern end along the pacific 
ocean and the town of colon is on the canals northern mouth on 
the atlantic coast 
the canal normally can handle 42 ships a day under its 12hour 
daylight operations only 12 ships a day passed through ms friar 
said 
on tuesday as more employees returned to work the canal began 
work at 3 am and stopped operations 16 hours later 
today wednesday were hoping to go to 24 hours but we dont 
know ms friar said we are now assessing the number of 
employees that have shown up for work 
neither the canal nor any ships suffered damage during the 
fighting she said 
in 1988 12261 ships went through the canal there are 7602 
fulltime employees of whom 86 percent are panamanians 
last weeks closing was the first time the canal has shut down 
for anything but natural disaster since its opening in 1914 
the commission has both us and panamanian members under a 
1977 treaty the united states will turn over operation of the 
canal to panama at the end of 1999

romanias new president thanked soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday for backing the revolution that 
ended 24 years of stalinist dictatorship in the east bloc nation 
tass said 
romanias provisional revolutionary leader ion iliescu spoke 
with gorbachev by telephone and expressed appreciation for a 
supportive soviet resolution that came at the height of the revolt 
the soviet news agency said 
iliescu and gorbachev reportedly are old friends from their 
college days in moscow 
iliescu is leader of the national salvation committee that took 
power in romania after the downfall of dictator nicolae ceausescu 
the revolutionary government says it is a provisional leadership 
until free elections are held in april 
ceausescu was forced to flee his palace on friday but fierce 
fighting between loyalist and revolutionary forces left the outcome 
of the insurrection in doubt for days 
gorbachev speaking to the soviet congress of peoples deputies 
on friday suggested that a resolution be approved urging support 
for the romanian peoples just cause iliescu reportedly was 
particularly grateful for that support 
iliescu also told gorbachev the situation in romania was 
returning to normal and that 90 percent of the factories were back 
at work tass said 
on tuesday gorbachev congratulated iliescu on his election as 
head of the national salvation committee at a time when patriots 
are trying to rescue the nation from forces of terror 
gorbachevs message in the communist party newspaper izvestia 
was strikingly different from the usual formal congratulations of a 
new leader because it was signed simply m gorbachev with no title 
you have taken the leadership of the country in a very 
difficult hour for it when the romanian patriots have decisively 
moved to rescue the nations from the forces of disorder and terror 
in order to install a truly democratic order in your country 
gorbachevs statement said 
he went on to assure iliescu that the romanians will receive 
the full support of the peoples and the leadership of the soviet 
union on their road to renewal 
gorbachev and iliescu reportedly knew each other as university 
students in moscow three decades ago iliescu was a leader in the 
romanian communist party until criticizing ceausescu 
still the soviet recognition of an informal government was 
unusual and indicative of gorbachevs efforts to clear out the 
vestiges of stalinism in the east bloc reform movements with tacit 
soviet approval have ousted regimes in poland hungary 
czechoslovakia and east germany 
in east berlin a former aide to ousted east german leader erich 
honecker said wednesday that gorbachev had a hand in ousting 
hardline east german leader erich honecker gorbachev reportedly 
urged honecker to embrace reform during the soviet leaders state 
visit in october the former honecker aide said the visit prompted 
dissidents on the politburo to force honecker from power 
however gorbachev also has not hestitated to issued mild 
warnings when the pace of reform threatens the warsaw pact 
alliance the soviets expressed some caution when a noncommunist 
government took power in poland and when west german leaders began 
pushing for reunification with east germany

mexico denied on wednesday allegations by us 
officials that its territory has been used by cuba to transport 
weapons to leftist rebels in el salvador 
an official mexican source rejected the allegation 
categorically because mexico has built up a surveillance 
infrastructure to avoid use of its territory for such purchases 
us officials have said that there are strong indications that 
cubansupplied weaponry is being sent to the salvadoran rebels via 
a remote route that begins in the yucatan peninsula 
the mexican source asking not to be identified called the 
statements by the us officials irresponsible lacking in 
substance and false 
the state department declined comment on whether cuba has been 
using mexican territory to arm the salvadoran rebels but said it 
would not be surprising if cuba sought new ways to transport 
supplies to the insurgents 
the administration has said cuba traditionally has sent supplies 
to the rebels via nicaragua

disney let captain hook and captain nemo wear 
mustaches but first officer john magness of the queen mary the 
only reallife seaman of the three was ordered wednesday to shave 
it off or ship out 
magness the no 3 officer on the disneyoperated ship was sent 
home on a oneday suspension for violating the walt disney cos 
grooming policy which forbids beards and mustaches 
if magness goes ahead with plans to keep his mustache by next 
week he will have run out of suspensions and will join three other 
crew members two waiters and a busboy who were fired for 
wearing mustaches 
its a matter of principle said magness 65 whose mustache 
is little more than a thin grey tuft ive had that mustache for 
42 years now my wife wants me to keep it my kids have not seen me 
without it so there it stays 
the policy is so strict that company founder the mustachioed 
walt disney would be in violation along with many famous disney 
characters from uncle remus to six of the seven dwarfs much of 
minnie mouses wardrobe would be too gaudy for disney 
magness who wore his mustache in the navy through 13 
engagements in world war ii and three engagements in the korean 
war summed up his feelings for the policy in two words 
it stinks 
the flap was the latest in several disputes over what critics 
have called disneys overly conservative practices the 
burbankbased company for instance lost its battle to ban 
homosexuals from dancing together at disneyland 
the 35yearold grooming policy just went into effect his month 
at the disneyoperated queen mary permanently docked in long beach 
harbor 25 miles south of los angeles two of the employees were 
fired christmas eve 
disney bought the leasehold to the queen mary two years ago 
along with the adjacent spruce goose plane built by howard hughes 
a billionaire with a mustache the ship is run as an attraction 
and officers such as magness basically are in charge of answering 
visitors questions 
the grooming policy which applies to all park and hotel 
employees bans mustaches beards and long hair on men bright eye 
shadow red fingernails or twotoned hair on women are also 
forbidden 
queen mary spokesman rich kerlin said that enforcing the policy 
was a matter of keeping the disney empire consistent although he 
would not say why the company was so strict on facial hair 
its just that its been a policy for 35 years he remarked 
adding that disney himself instituted the policy 
if we allowed the queen mary employees to have mustaches wed 
have to let the entire theme park and resort employees do the 
same the spokesman said 
kerlin said that the only exceptions to the nomustache rule 
were if an employee needed one for medical reasons 
so far 90 of the 100 men with mustaches agreed to shave them 
off others like reza nazertehrani and tom nicolai refused they 
were fired dec 24 from their jobs as waiters and plan to protest 
the policy with their union 
i feel i have a right as a person to live in the united states

the ruling communists and an opposition 
coalition agreed wednesday to hold wideranging talks on bulgarias 
future government some workers staged brief strikes as a warning 
to the communists 
following the agreement an independent trade union called off a 
general strike scheduled for thursday the union demands the 
resignation of the government the parliament and the communist 
partys central committee 
in other developments wednesday the government fired interior 
minister georgi tanev following criticism of police violence 
against demonstrators in october the official bta news agency gave 
no reason for his ouster 
the announcements are the latest in a series of changes since 
bulgarias longtime hardline communist leader todor zhivkov was 
ousted nov 10 
since then amid a wave of democratic reform that has swept 
eastern europe leaders have scrapped a law forbidding dissent 
proposed free elections in may and granted amnesty to political 
prisoners 
the ruling party reached agreement with the opposition 
coalition the union of democratic forces toward holding 
consultations beginning tuesday or wednesday said ivan angelov 
a spokesman for the central committee 
the talks were characterized as being similar to those in 
czechoslovakia that led to a government dominated by noncommunists 
for the first time in bulgaria strikes were held throughout the 
country wednesday but only small groups of workers took part the 
twohour strikes were intended as a warning to communist leaders 
the independent union support withdrew its thursday strike call 
following the agreement said chairman konstantin trenchev 
supports job action was not backed by most of the independent 
organizations in the union of democratic forces which said workers 
should strike only after all other forms of a dialogue are 
exhausted 
plamen darakchiev a secretary of support said the trade union 
will not relinquish its demands but make them in a categoric 
way at the talks with the communists 
bta said tanev was replaced as interior minister by gen atanas 
semerdzhiev the armys chief of staff bta said the deputy foreign 
minister lyuben gotsev would move to the no 2 position at the 
interior ministry which is responsible for the east bloc countrys 
police and internal security 
tanev 48 was blamed for the oct 26 crackdown on demonstrators 
of the thenbanned ecoglasnost environmental group the government 
said at least 22 people protesting in sofia against a government 
hydroelectric project were beaten and kicked by police and western 
diplomats said from 30 to 40 were detained 
the police action embarrassed the bulgarian leadership because 
it drew sharp criticism from delegates to a 35nation ecological 
forum in sofia taking place at the time the group was later 
legalized 
at the last session of the parliament on dec 14 tanev read a 
long statement on the incident rejecting all responsibility he 
said he had only learned of the police action afterward 
under tanev a police squad that cracked down on human rights 
activists and political opponents was in operation under new 
communist leader petar mladenov it was disbanded nov 25

a strikebound coal company sued the 
united mine workers for 60 million wednesday accusing the union 
and its members of attempted murder arson and extortion as part of 
a nationwide racketeering scheme 
the lawsuit was filed in federal court in beckley by the new 
beckley mining corp which also announced it will close its nearby 
glen daniel mine because of what it called union violence stemming 
from the umws selective strikes 
the umw has been on strike against new beckley since january 
idling 130 miners the union also is engaged in a bitter strike 
against the pittston coal group inc in west virginia virginia and 
kentucky 
the lawsuit was filed under the racketeer influenced corrupt 
organizations act although the racketeering statute was intended 
by congress primarily as a tool against organized crime it been 
used frequently against unions including a 1988 lawsuit by the 
government against the the teamsters 
earlier this year the supreme court upheld the use of the 
statute against legitimate organizations despite complaints by the 
aflcio that it had become a tool of harassment against 
legitimate businesses and labor organizations 
the new beckley mining lawsuit cites alleged violence at more 
than 20 coal companies in west virginia kentucky and virginia 
since 1983 when the union began its selective strike strategy in 
which the umw targeted specific companies for work stoppages 
previous strikes were industrywide 
the lawsuit alleges that new beckley employees have been the 
targets of vandalism death threats shootings and beatings at work 
and at home 
the violence pervades the coal industry discouraging 
productivity and inhibiting the economic wellbeing of individuals 
living and working in coalproducing communities the lawsuit 
says 
union spokesman john duray called the lawsuit ridiculous and 
accused the company of engaging in a pressrelease lawsuit by 
hiring a public relations company to notify the news media of the 
filing 
it looks to me like these guys are a lot more interested in 
trying their case in the media than in court duray said 
district 29 president everett acord said he knew nothing of the 
lawsuit or the mine closing 
at a news conference on the courthouse steps new beckley 
president jay sasell said the decision to shut down and seal new 
beckleys glen daniel mine was reached because the continued 
organized violence orchestrated against new beckley by the umwa has 
reached an intolerable level of acceptability by any rational 
standard 
marauding pickets continue to cause great hardship upon the 
company and its families on a daily basis 
the lawsuit contends that the union has engaged in a pattern of 
racketeering that includes 34 counts of attempted murder 23 of 
arson and 79 of extortion 
under the rico statute the companys requested 20 million in 
damages can be tripled if the union and various individuals are 
found to have violated the act

the army has been flooded with offers from 
volunteers who want to go to panama and help restore battered 
public services a spokesman said wednesday 
its unbelievable said maj henry fitts a spokesman at the 
us army reserve special operations command at fort bragg nc 
call it patriotism call it boredom call it what you will 
but weve had to set up a 24hour operation just to screen the 
volunteers fitts said 
the pentagon already has dispatched 25 reserve civil affairs 
specialists along with 107 active duty experts to panama 
civil affairs specialists act as liaison officers between the 
military and the civilian government to help reestablish public 
services disrupted by fighting such as utilities and 
transportation 
virtually all the armys civil affairs specialists are in 
reserve units and the pentagon paged those units for volunteers 
fitts said 
weve in the reserves been requested by the regular 
special operations command to augment the active duty civil affairs 
officers in their effort to rebuild and restore order in panama 
he said 
the army particularly sought specialists such as engineers or 
people familiar with transit systems or sanitation programs 
so many have volunteered fitts said in a telephone interview 
that hes been unable to get a count 
the number to be chosen to go to panama probably will be in 
the dozens rather than hundreds because we really need people 
with specific talents he said 
most people can be expected to put in about two weeks but 
regulations permit a tour of duty of up to 139 days a bit less 
than 20 weeks 
in florida soldiers from the 361st civil affairs bridgade in 
pensacola and a subordinate unit the 478th civil affairs company 
in perrine near miami will leave friday for panama said maj tom 
bechtell a member of the brigade

the justice department asked four european 
nations wednesday to freeze bank accounts where former panamanian 
dictator manuel antonio noriega is thought to have hidden illegal 
drug profits 
david runkel a department spokesman said the legal papers were 
filed with the governments of france switzerland luxembourg and 
the united kingdom requesting authorities to order banks to block 
any transactions in the noriega accounts 
the request is of money directly tied to his alleged illegal 
drug trafficking runkel said adding there is more than one 
account in each country 
authorities in france responded to the us request by freezing 
accounts in two banks holding 33 million under the names of 
noriega and members of his families swiss officials placed a 
precautionary freeze on two accounts in banks in zurich and 
geneva 
french investigators said the banks in france may have been used 
as transit points for funds destined for luxembourg or switzerland 
the swiss justice ministry said the us request charged noriega 
with giving logistic support to colombian drug lords shipments 
to the united states 
noriega who is hiding in the vatican embassy in panama city is 
thought to have transferred at least 10 million into numerous 
accounts in europe runkel said state department officials 
however say noriegas personal wealth could total as much as 300 
million 
deposed as dictator by us troops on dec 20 noriega has been 
charged in florida in two drug trafficking indictments 
runkel said department lawyers are confident they can document 
that money noriega sent abroad had been earned illegally in the 
drug trade us troops seized a slew of records in panama city 
after noriega was ousted 
the four european countries are expected to cooperate with the 
american request rules of which are spelled out in international 
treaties 
we have had a remarkable display of international 
cooperation runkel said these letters were not sprung on 
these countries this morning 
once the bank accounts have been frozen as justice expects 
there is still the possibility they will be barren runkel said 
its conceivable he said that noriega his family or his bankers 
moved money out of accounts since the invasion 
freezing assets is the first step to seizing them said runkel 
these things are not easy processes any disposition of the 
money however would be by international agreements 
preliminary discussions were also under way with others 
countries where noriega might has stashed money runkel said but 
he is not thought to have assets in the united states 
state department estimates put noriegas worth at between 200 
million to 300 million much of it hidden in secret bank accounts 
abroad 
in a speech last august deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger alluded to multimilliondollar transactions noriega has 
made over the past two years involving accounts in west germany 
switzerland and luxembourg 
the private gains noriega has accumulated eagleburger said 
belie the image he has projected of a poor youth of humble 
origins who by virtue of individual effort merit and talent rose 
through the ranks to become head of a small but respectable 
military force

dozens of store owners whose shops 
were sacked by frenzied looting after the us invasion were told 
wednesday that acts of war were not covered by their insurance 
policies 
we regret to inform you that the claim you have submitted 
must be rejected because the insurance policy excludes losses 
suffered as a direct or indirect result of acts of war said one 
letter panamanian insurance companies were mailing wednesday to 
their clients 
conservative estimates by insurance brokers and store owners put 
the damage and losses between 750 million and 1 billion 
according to alfredo maduro president of the panamanian chamber of 
commerce 
maduro said panamanian businessmen will now ask the united 
states for direct assistance to try to recover losses and resume 
operations 
this is a bomb worse than the ones of last wednesday the 
insurance companies are saying that in an invaded country there is 
no insurance coverage insurance broker gilberto jimenez said in 
an interview 
businessmen have estimated that more than 90 percent of the 
shops were looted on via espana and central avenue two commercial 
streets in downtown panana city 
thousands of looters raided everything from food furniture 
televisions and appliances only bookstores survived 
lazaro gago owner of the gago supermarket chain said six of 
his nine establishments had been looted and added his company was 
in ruins 
eight of nine of the arrocha pharmacies also were looted 
a car company said it lost 4 million to looters avis and other 
rental companies still were looking for cars taken from their lots 
television stations ran ads from car distributors offering 
rewards for information leading to the recovery of new vehicles 
looting damage in el dorado a shopping center for upper middle 
neighborhoods was estimated at 25 million 
maduro said the chamber would ask for direct us assistance 
in the form of equipment technology and interestree loans 
something like a marshall plan for panama 
it is our responsibility to rebuild the economy maduro 
said but we do not have the capacity at this time 
both maduro and jimenez regretted the damage was done mostly by 
panamanians 
we have committed a grievous mistake maduro added we 
attacked our own business establishments while the americans were 
attacking military targets only

egypt and syria agreed to restore 
diplomatic relations wednesday after a 12year rift caused by the 
late egyptian president anwar sadats peace negotiations with 
israel 
a summit between presidents hafez assad of syria and hosni 
mubarak of egypt will take place in early january the prime 
ministers of both countries announced syrian prime minister 
mahmoud zoubi said restoring ties will open a new page in the 
history of our common destiny 
the accord was announced at the end of a oneday visit to 
damascus by prime minister atef sedki of egypt at a news 
conference sedki and zoubi said they agreed to exchange 
ambassadors they gave no date for the january summit 
in jerusalem israeli officials said the development could 
improve israels peace prospects with the arab world egypt is the 
only arab nation with which israel has a peace treaty and syria 
has been an implacable foe 
a statement released in cairo and damascus said the 
governments of the syrian arab republic and the arab republic of 
egypt have agreed to resume full diplomatic relations effective 
wednesday dec 27 1989 this comes to express the determination 
of the two peoples to consolidate brotherly relations in all 
fields 
the announcement said changes worldwide made both countries 
realize the necessity of achieving comprehensive arab entente as 
a sound basis for joint arab action 
syria and egypt were united in 1958 under a panarabic movement 
led by sadats predecessor gamal abdul nasser they resumed 
independent governments in 1961 
assad broke ties after sadat made a dramatic visit to jerusalem 
in 1977 the opening move in two years of negotiations that 
resulted in the egyptisrael peace accord 
avi pazner aide to israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
characterized wednesdays agreement as part of egypts going back 
to the arab world after its ostracism 
we hope it will bring about a bigger realization in the arab 
world that peace with israel is possible and desirable he told 
the associated press 
however shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir said israel did not see 
the agreement as signifying any change in the syrian position 
regarding israel or peace 
sedki the first such highranking egyptian official to visit 
the syrian capital since the rift met for two hours with assad 
before the announcement he said the results of the meeting were 
even more than i originally expected 
president assad talked very warmly about egypt and recalled 
all the past and historic ties between the two countries he 
further qualified the period of complications as an experience we 
should profit from 
damascus radio said sedki carried a message to assad from 
mubarak he did not disclose its contents 
the purpose of this trip is to take the last step following 
which comes the resumption of ties sedki said egypts goal is 
to unify ranks with syria and consolidate cooperation between our 
two countries 
in a brief statement to reporters zoubi said developments 
witnessed by the arab world require that syria and egypt return 
to each other on the basis of their historical and fraternal 
bonds 
mubarak said tuesday that he and assad planned to meet but 
indicated this would follow restoration of diplomatic links 
mubarak said his policy was never to allow improvement of 
egypts relations with any country to affect ties with another 
nation 
this appeared aimed at both syria and iraq ruled by rival wings 
of the arab baath party and at odds for years 
egypt aided iraq militarily in its eightyear war with iran 
syria backed iran 
seventeen arab states severed relations with egypt after the 
camp david peace accords with israel in 1979 all except libya now 
have restored diplomatic ties with egypt

president bush said wednesday he is 
determined to bring to justice manuel antonio noriega for 
poisoning the children of the united states with drugs but he 
conceded that the vaticans refusal to give up thedeposed 
panamanian dictator does complicate things 
in a speech before a crowd of more than 800 at a barbeque dinner 
in beeville near one of his favorite south texcas hunting haunts 
bush drew loud applause both when he promised to press to bring 
noriega to trial and to avoid hellacious cuts in the defense 
budget 
i am determined to bring him to justice we have to work with 
our friends in the vatican we have to certainly work with respect 
with the new endara government in panama he said but i want 
to see this man who is under indictment brought to justice for 
poisoning the children of the united states of america with drugs 
a senior official who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified said in washington that officials believe the vatican 
has not yet defined its position and thus a resolution is not 
close 
but this official said the administration expects a solution 
sooner rather than later because it is in no ones interest not 
that of the united states panama or the vatican to allow the 
current state of affairs to drag on 
earlier at a news conference upon landing in corpus christi 
bush said he was putting no time limit on the quest to bring 
noriega now holed up in the vaticans embassy in panama city to 
trial in the united states noriega was indicted in florida on 
federal drug trafficking charges in 1988 
in his dinner remarks bush called the us military operation 
in panama a superb effort and said it makes him determined to 
resist calls for deep cuts in defense spending 
i believe we should keep a ready force that is able to defend 
american interests and american lives around the world he said 
from a stage surrounded by bales of hay 
a banner read bee county is bush quail country 
were still going down the road of trying to get him sent 
here said bush starting a fiveday hunting and fishing trip in 
his adopted homestate of texas we will continue to negotiate 
he refused to criticize the holy see telling reporters were 
not posturing ourselves as trying to be calling people to task 
and saying it was no time for namecalling 
bush appeared to leave open the possibility that noriega could 
be tried in panama he said there was a threat of noriega regaining 
power if he remained there unless he were in total custody and 
sentenced to the prison sentence he deserves 
answering questions at corpus christi naval air station where 
he took pilot training in 1943 bush exclaimed noriega turning 
himself in was about as good a christmas present as our soldiers 
marines airmen and the american people could want he pronounced 
the us military intervention an amazingly wellcoordinated 
superbly executed operation 
the president said he wasnt worried about taking a vacation 
while us troops remained active in panama why should i be 
he asked its winding down 
bush commenced his vacation as a vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro said there was no legal way its embassy in panama city 
could hand over noriega in washington the justice department made 
good on its tuesday threat to seek a freeze on european bank 
accounts where noriega is believed to have stashed millions of 
dollars in illegal drug profits 
the president maintained wednesday he had no concerns about 
noriega revealing uspanamanian intelligence secrets at a trial 
he was referring to things noriega might reveal about his 
previous close relations with the us government including the 
period in the 1970s when bush was cia director and noriega was an 
intelligence source 
i think thats history and i think the main thing is he 
should be tried and brought to justice bush said at a brief news 
conference 
a us trial could result in some release of certain 
confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole 
justice process but he added the system works so i wouldnt 
worry about that 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
aboard air force one that noriega can talk about the cia and bush 
until hes blue in the face it wont hurt anything 
bush asked whether the united states would let panama try 
noriega replied that would require a lot of conversations 
because we dont want to do anything that even implies undermining 
the sovereign power of panama or the fact the government is 
operating with the trust of the people 
the president said he was personally involved in efforts to gain 
custody of noriega from the vatican embassy in panama where 
noriega has been sheltered since christmas eve but he had not 
contacted either the papal nuncio in panama city or pope john paul 
ii bush did say he planned to hold talks with secretary of state 
james a baker iii his longtime friend and hunting partner while 
in texas 
asked about us demands that the embassy directly turn over 
noriega to us authorities the vatican city spokesman said there 
was no legal way that could be done he said the embassy is 
empowered to deal only with the government of panama and no other 
foreign government 
on a related matter bush said it will take a lot of 
diplomatic effort and a lot of it on my part to repair relations 
with latin countries offended by the us invasion of panama he 
said he thinks that once they see the democratically elected 
government in place and they see that noriega is out of the 
picture none of them supported him at all they found him 
outrageous then i think you begin to see the problem that might 
have been caused by a prolonged conflict down there 
meanwhile the justice department wednesday asked authorities in 
switzerland france luxembourg and britain to halt transactions in 
bank accounts believed to hold 10 million noriega amassed through 
drug dealing 
france and switzerland responded by freezing accounts in four 
banks 
in another development panamas new government sent a 
highlevel economic team to washington for talks with officials 
from the state and treasury departments and other agencies about 
reviving that countrys economy blasted by months of us 
sanctions against the noriega regime 
the assistant secretary for interamerican affairs bernard 
aronson said a us delegation will be sent to panama soon to 
continue the talks 
meanwhile bush had some success in his fishing and hunting 
expedition wednesday the president who was plagued by bad luck 
fishing at his home in kennebunkport maine last summer caught 
three fish off san jose island and showed off a huge 22inch 
redfish to reporters to prove his claim 
i wanted you to know we werent lying bush told reporters 
in beeville his fishing companion baker showed off part of his 
catch a large trout baker caught four or five fish to bushs 
three 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush and baker also 
bagged 10 quail between them in a morning shoot

us soldiers on wednesday blasted 
rock music and the latest panama news bulletins at the vatican 
embassy where gen manuel antonio noriega is shuttered as the 
stalemate over his fate continued 
both the united states and the new usbacked panamanian 
government renewed their pleas wednesday to the vatican to release 
the ousted dictator 
we feel that the nunciature the papal nuncio should in the 
very near future ask the exdictator to leave said president 
guillermo endara we believe that gen noriegas crimes are not 
political he is a common criminal of the worst kind 
in texas president bush said wednesday he is determined to 
bring noriega to justice for poisoning the children of the united 
states with drugs but bush conceded the vaticans refusal to 
give him up does complicate things 
the diplomatic standoff went into its fourth day and noriegas 
fate remained undetermined a vatican spokesman said he did not see 
how noriega could be released to the united states among 
alternatives being discussed were transfer to a third country and a 
trial for noriega in panama 
he has been accused justly accused of homicides and 
narcotrafficking and very very horrendous crimes endara said at 
a news conference 
also on wednesday the panama canal was returning to normal 
gradually and a spokeswoman said waterway officials hoped to go to 
24hour operation to clear a 125ship backup as more personnel 
returned to work 
in panama city battered by days of fighting and looting people 
were returning to work and lined up outside grocery stores that 
were not looted 
the president of the panamanian chamber of commerce alfredo 
maduro put losses caused by looting between 750 million and 1 
billion 
at some gasoline stations motorists were lowering buckets into 
belowground storage tanks to fill up their cars the pumps were 
destroyed at many stations by looters 
in colon 50 miles northwest of panama city us soldiers 
confiscated a warehouse belonging to carlos duque noriegas 
candidate for president in the annulled may elections a us 
soldier who helped in the search said the drugsniffing dog was 
running around in circles but the troops wouldnt say if drugs 
were found 
on wednesday some of the 100 us troops surrounding the 
vatican embassy hooked up powerful loudspeakers in a nearby parking 
lot and played rock songs that included i fought the law 
voodoo child and youre no good the music could be heard 
by reporters on the 12th floor of a nearby hotel 
throughout the afternoon the olivegreen loudspeakers were 
hooked up to us southern command radio if noriega was listening 
he could have heard about negotiations over his status and that the 
united states froze millions of dollars he allegedly stashed in 
overseas accounts 
a technician who got out of a us military communications van 
opened a telephone line box outside the walls of the embassy but 
it couldnt be determined if the lines were being fixed or tapped 
the americans also shot out all street lights with pellet guns 
and mowed tall grass outside the embassy compound a southern 
command spokesman refused to say whether the actions might be for 
security or for harassment 
noriega fled to the embassy on sunday five days after a us 
invasion toppled his government and sent him into hiding us 
troops armored cars and helicopters ring the embassy around the 
clock to ensure the toppled strongman doesnt escape or get 
spirited away 
the united states wants to capture noriega and bring him to the 
united states to face drug trafficking charges filed in 1988 
in rome vatican spokesman joaquin navarro reiterated wednesday 
there is no legal way the holy see can hand noriega over as there 
is no extradition treaty with the united states 
navarro added the vatican is studying the case in its 
juridical diplomatic and humanitarian and therefore ethical 
considerations 
without an agreement it would be nearly impossible for noriega 
to get past the us troops surrounding the vatican mission at the 
same time us troops cannot go after noriega because embassies 
are inviolable under international law 
faced with the possibility noriega could be granted asylum in 
another country the us justice department filed papers wednesday 
in four countries to freeze bank accounts in which noriega is 
believed to have stashed more than 10 million in illegal drug 
money 
cuba and the dominican republic where one of noriegas 
daughters lives have been mentioned as possible havens 
however dominican foreign minister joaquin ricardo said 
wednesday his country has an extradition treaty with the united 
states and noriega could be extradited if he goes there 
bush appeared to leave open the possibility that noriega could 
be tried in panama he said there was a threat of noriega regaining 
power if he remained unless he were sentenced to the prison 
sentence he deserves 
endara said panamas constitution forbids extradition of 
panamaniam nationals to another country but said a loophole might 
be provided by the 1904 treaty that allowed the united states to 
build the panama canal 
also wednesday panamas election commission certified that 
endara won a may 7 election nullified by noriega the commission 
said tallies collected by endaras coalition were enough to show 
his ticket winning with 625 percent of the vote endara was sworn 
in on dec 20 shortly after the us invasion began 
the us military said it arrested most members of noriegas 
defense forces which numbered 15000 and only a few hundred 
remained unaccounted for 
among those reported arrested wednesday was vicky amado 
noriegas longtime mistress 
southern command said wednesday 23 americans were killed and 322 
wounded since the united states invaded it said 297 panamanians 
were killed and 123 wounded doctors say more than 100 civilians 
also died during the fighting 
meanwhile panamas ambassador to mexico jorge turner morales 
resigned and asked for asylum in mexico a panamanian embassy 
employee said on condition of anonymity mexico has not officially 
recognized the endara government 
i cannot accept a government that was imposed under the 
machine guns of george bush turner morales was quoted as saying 
by mexicos excelsior news service

romanias national library is 
desperate for books but not that desperate the complete works of 
nicolae ceausescu are headed for the pulping machine 
perhaps well keep one copy of each somewhere allowed 
angela popescu bradiceni director since 1955 with a slight sniff 
after all we are a library 
a trigger of the revolution was the looming presence of the 
dictators numbing words bound in bulk they were stacked in the 
window of every bookstore at the national library they filled six 
long rows 
enthusiastic workmen have already carted off various 
translations of on the way of building up the multilaterally 
developed socialist society all 32 volumes 700 pages each the 
english edition was baled to go 
had anyone ever checked out volume 26 for example he would 
have learned the visit i have paid to somalia at the invitation 
of president mohamed siad barre has yielded highly good results 
the pile included leaflets of speeches collected mental musings 
and 12ounce publicity packets to the glory of a man who traveled 
the world ceaselessly to exchange fulsome toasts and pose for 
photos 
one collection had almost identical covers at the left there 
was ceausescu with slicked down jet black hair and a debonaire 
mien a photo from 1957 at the right there was someone else 
jimmy carter brezhnev mengistu or whichever of his friends he 
happened to be visiting 
but not all the purged books were his 
there was also research in the field of systems and 
characteristics of macromolecules by his wife elena 
no one ever read this stuff no one said virgil tiberiu 
spanu director of acquisitions never 
the couple was ousted from power friday they were reported 
executed monday a new revolutionary council has promised free 
elections and democracy 
at un headquarters in new york the romanian mission tossed 
out dozens of books by ceausescu cut the hammer and sickle from 
its flag and dropped socialist from its name 
delegation member dino marian said wednesday i must confess 
there already was a thick layer of dust on the books 
for the librarians destroying ceausescus books was sweet 
revenge for bibliophiles forced to hide away 10 percent of their 
collection under lock and key 
ceausescus strict laws forbade anyone without a special permit 
to see books about romanian politics since world war i or works of 
anyone suspected to be even a mild dissident books by foreign 
radicals or us economists also were restricted 
romanian and foreign researchers had to apply to a cultural 
council that decided whether to grant permission applications were 
referred to the secret police 
when you applied to the council a very secret complex 
mechanism came into play spanu said most people did not 
bother some books were banned altogether 
mostly books were not bought because the library had no foreign 
currency 
we were 10 to 15 years behind the world in scientific 
material spanu said the librarys latest edition of the journal 
chemical abstracts is from 1972 
but the problem went beyond money 
in romania each typewriter had to be registered with the 
police along with a sample of its characters 
at the news agency agerpres editors made a careful selection of 
what was truth for the general public what would be passed along 
in a single copy and what would go nowhere at all 
at the national library directors are confident of a sharp 
shift as one good omen their collection survived the revolution 
although the nearby university library lost 500000 books 
burned in fighting between ceausescu loyalists and revolutionaries 
all of the national librarys 15 million volumes survived 
we were lucky because we have no building of our own and our 
books are in storage all over town mrs bradiceni said 
she looked around at at the shelves purged of ceausescus works 
now we have plenty of room

the defense ministry said wednesday 
all those supporting us military intervention in central america 
will be neutralized cut off and executed if the united states 
attacks nicaragua 
the threat by the ruling leftist sandinista government was not 
specific but appeared aimed at the 14party national opposition 
union coalition and its presidential candidate violeta chamorro 
in national elections feb 25 
the warning came in a special communique to all military units 
broadcast over government radio and part of a maximum alert of 
armed forces ordered dec 20 by president daniel ortega hours 
after the us invasion of panama 
it said that at the start of any yankee intervention all 
units are ordered to apply plans to neutralize cut off and 
execute all recalcitrant traitors who openly or covertly have been 
encouraging such yankee intervention 
earlier wednesday the sandinista newspaper barricada said 
nicaragua will not let a us plane carrying monthly supplies for 
the us embassy land as scheduled on jan 11 
foreign minister miguel descoto told us secretary of state 
james baker iii tuesday night the measure was taken because us 
forces would not let nicaraguan planes land in panama and 
surrounded the nicaraguan embassy in panama city barricada said 
us embassy spokesman lou falino said he had no comment 
last week nicaraguan troops surrounded the us embassy in 
managua in response to nicaraguas embassy in panama being 
surrounded us officials were trying to prevent any effort by 
ousted panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega to flee to 
that embassy 
instead he took refuge in the vatican embassy

attorneys for mobil oil corp wanted to 
shield top executives from details of environmental problems at 
chemical plants to protect them from legal action according to 
court papers filed in a lawsuit against the oil giant 
the papers were filed in federal court here in a lawsuit against 
the nations second largest oil company by valcar bowman jr of 
riverdale ga mobil chemical cos former environmental affairs 
manager 
bowman claims he was fired in april 1986 because he refused to 
go along with a coverup of pollution problems bowman had been the 
divisions second ranking environmental official 
the court papers also quote a memorandum by a company lawyer as 
saying attorneyclient privilege can be used to keep documents out 
of the hands of government agencies 
the papers shed new light on wording changes sought by mobil 
lawyers in confidential reports about environmental conditions at 
plants nationwide 
those reports filed with the court remain sealed us 
district judge harold a ackerman unsealed them friday but delayed 
his order when mobil said it would appeal 
the company denies covering up pollution problems argues that 
the changes were minor and and contends that bowman was fired in an 
economic cutback 
ackerman ruled dec 11 that enough evidence existed for the case 
to go to trial denying mobils summary judgment motion briefs 
submitted by both sides for the motion were released this week and 
contain the disclosures 
mobil chemical cos thenenvironmental counsel winfred t 
colbert voiced concern in a 1985 memorandum about the 
companys longstanding practice of distributing the 
environmental reports to upperlevel management according to a 
brief by bowmans lawyer stephen b wiley 
the memo concerns a report about the companys jacksonville 
ill plant 
i note that the report contains several admissions of 
noncompliance which in some cases are unavoidable the memo 
read the principal concern i have in this regard relates to the 
potential liability which can attach to all managers who receive 
the report 
colbert said only plant managers mobil environmental officials 
and lawyers should see whole reports others would receive 
summaries on a needtoknow basis 
this revised procedure will properly focus direct 
responsibility for necessary actions at the plant level and 
minimize the potential exposure of higher level management the 
brief quoted colbert as writing 
what colbert said there i think is general lawyering said 
mobil spokesman allen gray in new york denying it was company 
policy 
mobil chemical cos president art e biggs wrote a letter at 
about the same time that required line managers to report 
significant environmental problems to him said the divisions 
general counsel ron neill 
colbert wasnt trying to shield anybody from liability 
neill said but was only making sure that responsibility for plant 
operations was properly delegated 
bowman also charges that mobil removed records from its 
bakersfield calif plant which was under scrutiny by 
environmental officials to keep the records out of regulators 
hands the records were given to an outside attorney lawrence j 
straw jr to cloak them in the attorneyclient privilege said 
wileys brief 
the brief cited a may 30 1985 memo from another mobil chemical 
lawyer charles s lindberg to bowman explaining that the 
attorneyclient privilege is much broader and receives greater 
protection under the law than most of our company documents which 
are not protected by legal privilege 
in fact it would be more difficult for any governmental 
agency to obtain any of the information delivered to mr straw than 
it would for them to obtain that information from mobil directly 
under a subpoena lindberg wrote 
im not going to excuse what lindberg said gray commented 
calling the statement another example of lawyering 
he said all papers required by law to be at the bakersfield 
plant never left there two or three boxes of documents were sent 
to straw but have never been subpoenaed he said 
as an example of alleged sanitizing of environmental reports 
by lawyers bowmans brief refers to colberts jacksonville memo 
colbert wanted the word fully placed before acquainted 
in the sentence plant personnel have not had time to become 
acquainted with superfund reporting procedures according to 
court papers 
in a report about the frankfort ill plant colbert added 
records do not indicate that to the sentence the plant is 
not consistently reporting excursions within five days of becoming 
aware of the incident 
mobil says the second not was accidental and that the other 
two changes made the reports more accurate

a former hughes aircraft co engineer 
has filed a 96 billion lawsuit against the company charging that 
it concealed a potential defect in computer chips used in defense 
systems 
the lawsuit was dismissed as mostly fantasy by a hughes 
official 
metallurgist michael c denlinger a former senior staff 
engineer at a hughes division here filed the lawsuit in us 
district court in santa ana last june but it remained sealed until 
it was served on tuesday 
denlinger claims that more than 4 million computer chips used in 
national defense systems may corrode because hughes took a shortcut 
in a soldering process that can cause cracks in what should be 
airtight surfaces 
we think our national security is compromised his attorney 
frank barbaro said tuesday 
denlinger who worked for hughes for 14 years and was most 
recently responsible for testing strengths of materials brought 
the action under the federal false claims act which allows 
whistleblowers to share in damage awards in defense fraud cases 
damages in false claims cases are usually triple the value of 
the products denlingers attorneys claim the company sold 32 
billion worth of systems using the allegedly faulty computer chips 
the us department of justice must decide whether to join such 
false claims lawsuits which usually are sealed while the 
department investigates 
the department told the federal court that its research of the 
hughes case was complete and court papers indicated the department 
would make a decision on the case within 60 days 
denlinger alleges that defective chips installed since 1984 
caused two failures in the navys submarinelaunched advance 
capability torpedo system 
while routine screening found two defective chips in torpedoes 
the lawsuits allegations are wrong said dan reeder a spokesman 
for hughes ground systems group in fullerton 
most of the stuff is just fantasy he said we have never 
had any failure of the test torpedoes due to hardware problems 
during any of the hundreds of runs we have gone through 
denlinger said in the lawsuit that he repeatedly wrote memos 
about possible cracking of the chips but they were ignored he 
resigned in november 1988 
hughes said tuesday that it has inspected every chip since 
becoming aware of a cracking problem in 1985 and said it was an 
industrywide problem

to be just as aggressive in protecting small investors 
sec chairman richard breeden is creating a new fraud unit at the 
sec designed to police the sale of securities by savings and loan 
institutions 
investigators have charged that some small investors lost their 
life savings when they bought securities sold by sampl branches in 
the mistaken belief that their investments were protected by 
federal deposit insurance 
we intend to see to it that when people are sold securities 
they are provided all the necessary information breeden said 
breeden also announced tuesday that he had selected william r 
mclucas a 12year sec veteran to be the new director of 
enforcement at the sec he will succeed gary lynch who resigned in 
july after supervising such landmark insider trading cases as the 
investigation of ivan boesky and the wall street firm of drexel 
burnham lambert inc

orange juice prices leaped on the futures 
market after a weekend freeze overwhelmed florida and texas citrus 
groves but experts said consumers may escape big price increases 
because of a bumper crop in brazil 
however big chill 89 likely will drive up vegetable prices in 
the northeast because the cold wiped out thousands of acres of 
carrots cauliflower broccoli and other crops in florida 
agriculture officials said 
experts assessing the damage tuesday said it was too early for 
definite predictions about prices us agriculture department 
economist ralph parlett in washington said price increases were 
likely but he hadnt changed his earlier forecast of a 3 percent 
to 5 percent overall rise in food prices in 1990 
in florida where the citrus industry is worth an estimated 35 
billion a year the christmas cold wave struck with about 80 
percent of the citrus crop still on the trees and there was heavy

in religion the decade of the 1980s started with a plunge into 
politics by americas religious right and is ending with a 
burst of new freedoms for believers within the soviet orbit 
over the past 10 years the religion domain also has been jolted 
with scandals hit with jail terms for sanctuary workers and 
shaken with conflicts over homosexuality the bible and abortion 
simultaneously the quest for christian unity though flagging 
from its earlier euphoria nevertheless made substantial strides 
so did closer jewishchristian relations despite rocky moments 
but the main religious hallmarks of the 80s were the burst into 
us political activism by church conservatives and the burgeoning 
of religious rights in lands long shackled under atheist statism 
the freshening spiritual breath in eastern europe emanated in 
part from the churches themselves and from that surprising soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
capping the trend was the unprecedented friendly meeting this 
year between gorbachev and pope john paul ii the vatican was 
scorned by previous soviet leadership as impotent for lack of 
military power 
but while religious opportunities grew in most communist areas 
even in china despite the brutal antidemocracy suppression last 
summer the churches met persistent harassment in latin american 
but they also became bastions of human rights there although a 
long line of christian workers were slain particularly el salvador 
and guatamala along with thousands of civilians 
the decade there began with the assassination of el salvadors 
roman catholic archbishop oscar romero in 1980 and ended in 1989 
with the murder of six jesuit priests 
us churches entered a sanctuary movement to shelter refugees 
fleeing the striferidden area but the formerly open movement 
edged underground after several participants were convicted in 1986 
of smuggling aliens 
a key religious development of the decade was the emergence into 
public affairs of the long insular religious right which had 
previously denounced such activity as meddling in politics 
but they surged from their spiritual closet in l980 along with 
their paragon former president ronald reagan claiming credit for 
electing him that year and again in 1984 
the changed mode was sparked by a suave virginia preacher jerry 
falwell who founded moral majority in l979 and led it through 10 
years of robust politicking closing it down only this year 
mission accomplished he said adding that other 
conservative christian lobbying groups had evolved to handle the 
cause 
the movements prime objectives public school prayer tuition 
tax credits for church schools and stopping abortion remained 
unaccomplished but ferment continued about them 
a conservative tide also swept the southern baptist convention 
where fundamentalists gained the presidency in 1979 and held it 
through l989 broadening control throughout that biggest protestant 
body 
it was a battle for the bible fundamentalists contended 
gradually imposing their demand for literalist biblical 
inerrancy historically and scientifically on denominational 
agencies 
meanwhile mainline denominations suffered declines in 
membership and their chief cooperative organization the national 
council of churches fell into operational and financial disarray 
late in the decade 
but remodeling work was underway with efforts to bring more 
evangelical churches and roman catholicism into full membership 
also quiet but steady progress continued on the ecumenical 
front 
northern and southern presbyterians separated since the civil 
war united in 1983 into the presbyterian church usa and three 
branches of lutherans united in 1987 into the evangelical lutheran 
church in america 
of wider significance a stream of worldwide largely favorable 
responses flowed into the world council of churches to a remarkably 
inclusive convergence agreeement 
dealing with key issues dividing churches baptism eucharist 
and ministry the bem document was produced by representatives 
of protestantism roman catholicism and eastern orthodoxy at a l982 
meeting in lima peru 
the deepening ties were dramatized at a giant largely baptist 
rally in columbia sc where the pope preached on his 1987 us 
trip flanked by leading figures of most us denominations 
but he had a tense session with his us hierarchy in los 
angeles where bishops told him americans were used to being 
persuaded rather than told what to believe but he insisted 
dissenters weret good catholics 
seeking to tighten vatican controls he stripped noted moral 
theologian charles curran of teaching credentials in 1986 and 
temporarily curtailed the authority of seatle archbishop raymond 
hunthausen restoring it in 1987 
the vaticans middecade repudiation of homosexualty as a 
moral disorder continued to stir sharp resentments and 
disruptions in catholic churches 
sex scandals hit two prominent television evangelists jimmy 
swaggart and jim bakker baker resigned his ptl network in 1987 
over a sexual tryst and in 1989 was convicted and imprisoned for 
defrauding contributors 
swaggart was defrocked in 1988 for sexual misbehavior after he 
refused to to accept disciplines imposed by his denomination the 
assemblies of god

temporarily at least manuel antonio noriega 
picked his own prison by taking refuge at the vatican embassy in 
panama city where secretary of defense dick cheney thinks the 
ousted military boss might be a longterm resident 
thats not what the administration wants but worse things could 
happen and have so long as the deposed military boss of panama is 
a cloistered fugitive he is isolated silenced and confined to 
small compound living in a spare single room 
despite washingtons sharp demands that the vatican turn over 
noriega the us stake to the right of embassy refuge seems more 
important than his case so long as he is out of power and 
neutralized american embassies sometimes have been havens for 
dissenters notably in cold war hungary and now beijing 
us officials argue that noriega should not be granted asylum 
because he is a common criminal not a political fugitive in his 
case there is solid evidence of it but totalitarian governments 
have no difficulty constructing criminal charges against their 
dissenters 
chinese dissident fang lizhi and his wife took refuge in the 
american embassy in beijing more than six months ago after the 
government crushed the democracy movement and began a purge of its 
leaders hes still there despite repeated protests from the 
chinese who say the united states is interfering in their internal 
affairs 
for 15 years cardinal josef mindszenty lived in asylum in the 
us embassy in budapest he had been freed from a communist prison 
in the hungarian uprising of 1956 and took refuge at the embassy 
after the soviet union put down that rebellion the vatican finally 
was able to arrange his release to the west in 1971 
embassies are considered to be the territory of the nations they 
represent and when they choose to grant haven even the most 
dictatorial of regimes have accepted it 
now as cheney said lawyers and diplomats are trying to figure 
out what happens next in the noriega case he left open the 
possibility that it could be nothing 
cheney said tuesday that the embassy is surrounded with no way 
out for noriega and no way in for us authorities it could be 
that theyll have a longterm resident in their embassy in panama 
city he said 
noriega would hardly seem a welcome guest church leaders 
including monsignor jose sebastian laboa the papal nuncio in 
panama city had long been critics of the generals regime the 
vatican embassy had been a refuge for noriega opponents when they 
needed one 
unless there is a deal to let noriega go to exile rather than to 
us trial the ousted dictator can keep hiding but he cant run 
at present if he leaves the embassy under any circumstances 
he will in fact be arrested by us forces and returned to the 
united states cheney said tuesday 
embassy refuge does not apply outside an embassy compound so as 
soon as noriega stepped outside guarded vatican mission he could 
be seized 
the way around that would be a diplomatic deal to let him go 
into exile it would have to be distant and silent lest he regain 
his voice and try to incite his supporters against the new 
government 
for all the demands that noriega go on drug trial the 
administration had been willing as recently as october to let him 
go into exile without prosecution if he yielded power 
the vatican has no extradition agreement with the united states 
so if the church decided noriega should be expelled from the 
diplomatic mission it would be to the custody of the panamanian 
government 
the panamanian constitution forbids the extradition of any 
citizen guillermo endara the new president installed with 
american protection after noriega was ousted said if his 
government had custody he could not deliver the dictator for us 
drug trial 
the fledgling endara government apparent winner of the may 
elections noriega annulled needs to establish itself and display a 
power to govern independent of the united states yielding up 
noriega would be counterproductive but the endara government could 
put him on trial as a killer there have been us hints that 
prosecution in panama might be acceptable 
until and unless the diplomats find a solution noriega 
presumably stays put a captive in spare surroundings that mock the 
luxuries of his days in power the cash cocaine and voodoo cults 
said to have been his lifestyle

its an accomplishment when a writer can get 
even one television series going but dean hargrove has two hits on 
the air and next week launches two more shows 
father dowling mysteries previously on nbc makes its debut 
on abc next thursday max monroe loose cannon premieres on cbs 
on friday 
hargrove also created nbcs matlock and cbs jake and the 
fatman earlier he also developed the very successful series of 
perry mason movies for nbc his frequent collaborator is joel 
steiger 
everybody has a theory about why a show is successful said 
hargrove i think the audience basically is attracted by 
characters and when you have that perfect wedding of character and 
performer you have a success 
most successful tv series are identified by a name lucy 
archie bunker columbo jr even with shows like thirtysomething 
or la law i think people tune in for the characters 
basically i tailor shows for the stars like andy griffith bill 
conrad and tom bosley 
loose cannon stars shadoe stevens as max monroe a police 
detective whose wild and unconventional tactics have earned him the 
nickname of loose cannon stevens is a rock n roll disc jockey 
who is host of american top 40 and a panelist on hollywood 
squares 
its a new kind of show for us said hargrove whose partner 
is fred silverman former president of nbc and former head of 
programming at cbs and abc the series weve done so far have 
been traditional middle of the road series 
working with shadoe gives us an opportunity to design a show 
thats offbeat and contemporary it has a strong vein of humor i 
think almost all successful shows have had humor i got my start as 
a comedy writer and i still think of myself as a comedy writer 
father dowling stars tom bosley and tracy nelson as two 
ecclesiastical snoops hes the good father frank dowling and 
shes sister steve father dowling is always running afoul of 
church hierarchy in the person of james stephens as father 
prestwick the bishops aide the shows set in chicago but like 
perry mason its filmed in denver 
the next perry mason movie however has been filmed in 
paris its the 14th in the series since silverman sold the project 
to nbc 
fred talked to raymond burr got the rights and got nbc 
interested hargrove said he asked me to write the script we 
thought it would be a good idea to bring in a younger character so 
we cast william katt as masons investigator 
my notion was to put a detective story in the middle of perry 
mason the detective gets an assignment early and goes off to 
pursue it perry mason carries on his mysterysolving and the 
detective works on solving another element of the case katt has 
left but we use the same technique with bill moses 
in the show set in paris mason defends an american marine 
officer in a courtmartial 
hargrove grew up in iowa and began writing student films while 
in college he attended the ucla film school as a graduate student 
but dropped out to write professionally 
his first job was writing for the bob newhart show 
newharts first series on nbc in 196163 
newhart was the buttondown mind just out of chicago he 
said we wrote a lot of telephone routines for him roland kibbe 
hired me and we later worked together on columbo and madigan i 
also wrote for the man from uncle because they wanted to 
bring a sense of humor to the show 
hargrove wrote the pilot for the girl from uncle and was 
story consultant for it takes a thief he wrote and produced 
gene barrys segments on name of the game he was also producer 
and writer for such series as columbo madigan 
mccloud mccoy the family holvak and me and mom

when the new year arrives so will a gallant 
masked figure from the past of old spanish california with sword 
flashing black cape billowing white teeth gleaming here comes 
zorro 
yes by neddies zorro with a z its the latest in a long line 
of zorros that includes the abc series of 195759 that set millions 
of tykes to running about in zorro costumes trying to puncture 
each other in the name of justice 
that one starred guy williams this one starring duncan regehr 
36 is the first new zorro series ever on cable specifically 
the family channel where the halfhour series will debut on jan 5 
the shows star a canadian with shakespearean stage credits is 
a very big zorro he stands 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 215 
pounds were this a zorro of fistics not fencing hed be 
right at home 
this is because regehr a softspoken man with a dry sense of 
humor regularly used to put his dukes for sport he once thought 
of seeking a spot on canadas olympic boxing team he fought 65 
amateur bouts he says and had only three losses none of them by 
knockouts 
it did enter his mind that a flattened nose might be bad for 
someone seeking work as the handsome leading man in a work by 
shakespeare thats why it was kind of dumb idea dont you 
think he wryly asks 
but that was when he was in his late teens when the notion that 
he could get his face rearranged had not quite sunk in no at 
that age i think i was so stupid and cocky that i figured it 
wouldnt happen to me 
and fortunately i got out before it did i hope 
regehrs dossier includes such varied work as hamlet at 
ontarios stratford shakespeare festival and the role of the late 
erroll flynn in cbs my wicked wicked ways 
he shot 25 zorro episodes in spain this fall 
the new series takes place as have most zorro films in 
california in 1820 regehr has as have others before him a 
tworole part the dandy don diego vega who really is the masked 
senor zorro who zips about righting wrongs and leaving his 
trademark z carved in various places 
george hamilton played things for laughs and with a gay 
lookalike brother in 1981s zorro the gay blade so did cbs 
in 1983 with a contemporary zorro and son which was the sort 
of show in which a franciscan monk was arrested for selling wine 
before its time 
but in this edition done in the old romantic tradition don 
diego usually played as a popinjay or even a fop doesnt get that 
treatment from regehr 
ive played hm more like a renaissance man interested in art 
science and music more bookish rather than being er a little 
light on the feet 
the actor the son of an artist and a painter himself has lived 
for the past ten years in los angeles but he and his wife 
catherine have a new years project to move to vancouver island 
in british columbia 
he would keep a place in los angeles and commute there for film 
and tv work he says but he no longer wants to call it home i 
did sort of like it 10 years ago when it wasnt as crowded or 
smogfilled he says 
not now and he has found that there is such a thing as too much 
mellow of which there is said to be a lot in hollywood 
in the old days regehr says i could deal with the people 
there the laidbackness now i dont know it just seems too 
relaxed to me 
 
elsewhere in television 
no new years eve whoopee on nbc on dec 31 a night many 
viewers are in funny hats blowing horns and throwing confetti in 
the air nbc is airing a onehour news special stalins ghost 
at 10 pm est its about the legacy of death and repression by 
the late soviet leader and the stalinists who seek to turn back 
the reforms and liberalization of the gorbachev era 
it is possible the shows ratings wont be very big

the financial menu looks pretty skimpy as 
incomeconscious investors consider where to put their money for a 
new year and a new decade 
no matter how far in time you are willing to extend yourself 
alluring returns on certificates of deposit bonds and other 
interestbearing investments are hard to find these days 
certainly you are unlikely to come across anything now that 
matches the twodigit yields on lowrisk securities that were so 
commonly available in the early 1980s 
but inflation has also declined in recent years and so has the 
maximum rate at which the federal government taxes most peoples 
interest income so in the view of many analysts the real 
returns offered now arent as stingy as they might look 
suppose as 1990 begins that you can get a yield of 83 percent 
from a cd or moneymarket mutual fund if your income tax bracket 
is 28 percent the top rate that applies to most savers and 
investors you have a return of 6 percent left over after uncle 
sam takes his cut 
after taking into account consumer inflation in the 4 percent to 
5 percent annual range you still emerge with a positive return 
on paper at least that beats the results you might have 
achieved at a nominal interest rate of say 13 percent a decade 
ago when inflation and taxes together would have left you actually 
in the red 
of course the current returns savers and investors can get are 
only part of the story the ideal investment choice also must keep 
looking good through the future ups and downs of inflation and 
interest rates 
right now many analysts are predicting at least a modest 
decline in interest rates over the next several months that would 
argue in favor of longerterm investments such as cds or bonds 
rather than shortterm options such as money market funds 
unfortunately interest rates at present are such that you get 
paid little or nothing for making that kind of longerterm 
commitment 
a recent tally by the bank rate monitor showed threemonth cds 
yielding an average of 787 percent twoyear cds 771 percent and 
fiveyear cds 773 percent 
this is known in financial circles as a flat or slightly 
inverted yield curve and it is abnormal although by no means 
unprecedented in modern history 
the yield curve has been out of kilter for more than a year now 
but some analysts think it is slowly beginning to resume a more 
orthodox shape 
for now the value line investment survey the nations largest 
independent investment advisory service recommends keeping your 
options open by sticking mainly with shortterm commitments a 
bit more patience the firm urges a wait until the long rate 
offers more of a yield advantage to warrant the added risk 
staying shortterm of course also gives you protection should 
interest rates pull a surprise by heading higher in that event 
yields on vehicles such as money market funds would stand to move 
up as well 
what if interest rates should neither rise nor fall but hover 
around present levels for some indeterminate period 
that would create few opportunities for investors to pull off 
heroic coups of market timing but it would leave enough goodies to 
go around that hardly anyone need be entirely dissatisfied 
the sideways scenario isnt bad for either camp observed 
edward yardeni economist at the wall street firm of 
prudentialbache securities 
the bulls earn the coupon or nominal interest rate on 
longterm investments and since the yield curve is flat the 
bears earn a comparable return in the shortterm money markets

the fury of romanians against their former 
government is revealed partly by the economic statistics romania 
in recent years has been the economic backwater of eastern europe 
alone among those nations bulgaria czechoslovakia east 
germany hungary and poland the countrys gross national product 
and industrial production declined in 1988 
its gnp last year in fact was about where it was in 1980 
while almost every other developed nation communist and 
noncommunist registered increases in that time china more than 
doubled its gnp 
while romanias neighbors increased exports between 1980 and 
1986 its exports stagnated romanias population of 23 million is 
exceeded only by that of poland but romanias imports were lower 
than any fraternal east bloc country 
its per capita gross national product of 5500 also remains the 
lowest in eastern europe less than onehalf that of east germany 
and it is falling 
whereas east germans had an automobiletopopulation ratio of 
one to five in romania the ratio was just a bit more than one in 
100 while romanian meat production averaged 70 kilograms per 
capita that of hungary was 160 
in effect the old government was leading the nation into 
economic decline and lower living standards at a time when growth 
if perhaps slowly was the rule in every other european country 
possibly excluding tiny albania 
the profile of economic deterioration amid growth emerges from 
research completed in august and published in september by the 
central intelligence agency it shows a vivid contrast between 
communist and capitalist nations 
the figures also suggest the urgent need of the soviet union to 
renovate and spur its own economy in which growth rates have 
steadily deteriorated in recent years 
the cia research shows soviet gnp falling from average annual 
growth of 48 percent in 196165 and 49 percent from 196670 to 
31 percent in 197175 21 percent in 197680 and 19 percent in 
198185 
after a 4 percent spurt in 1986 mainly the result of a 103 
percent surge in agricultural production the gnp growth rate 
subsided to 13 percent in 1987 and 15 percent in 1988 
agricultural production shrank in the latter years 
reviewing the numbers and contrasting them with those of the 
capitalist world its clear that the economies of the communist 
countries as a whole were becoming outmatched 
in 1988 the annual rate of gnp growth in the united states 
canada japan australia and all countries of western europe 
yugoslavia excepted exceeded that of the soviet union and the 
soviet bloc nations of eastern europe 
even the economies of the less developed countries taken as a 
whole showed a growth rate of 37 percent or higher than the 
soviet union and the communists nations of eastern europe 
among the large communist nations a swiftly industrializing 
china stands out registering a growth rate of 112 percent in 
1988 the third time since 1983 in which it has reached 
doubledigit levels 
the stark contrast between the communist and noncommunist 
nations that emerges from the data emphasizes the economic origins 
of the upheavals 
in an age of developing communications that contrast was 
obvious to all except perhaps for a few leaders

although he ostensibly is not a religious man 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev is the top religion 
newsmaker of 1989 according to specialists in reporting that 
field 
a poll of members of the religion newswriters association made 
that choice and also picked the extraordinary meeting of gorbachev 
and pope john paul ii as the no 1 religion news story of the year 
it was the first meeting ever between a pope and leader of a 
government that for decades has upheld atheism and spurned 
religion shackling it but gorbachev baptized as an infant but a 
committed communist broke the pattern 
we need spiritual values he told the pope 
the meeting presaged diplomatic relations between the two long 
antagonistic leaderships cleared the way for a possible papal 
visit to the ussr and brought assurances from gorbachev of 
broadened religious freedoms 
those expanding religious freedoms already were proliferating in 
the soviet orbit in the swift shift toward democracy in east 
germany poland hungary and czechoslovakia in what some hailed 
as a triumph of faith over marxism 
that tide and the fading of restrictions on religion in that 
area even ahead of revised statutes was picked by religion news 
specialists as 1989s third ranked religion story 
a lot of that reform movement was fueled by the churches 
said religion reporter bill thorkelson of minneapolis who compiled 
the survey results by and large that aspect hasnt been told 
the secondranked religion story was the trial conviction and 
sentencing of television evangelist jim bakker to 45 years in 
prison and 500000 in fines for defrauding contributors he had 
quit his network in 1987 in a sex scandal 
other religion events ranked in this order 
fourth the murder of six roman catholic priests and jailing 
and torture of other church workers in el salvador sparking new 
demands by religious groups for an end to us military aid to that 
nation 
fifth worldwide controvery over publication of salman 
rushdies the satanic verses which islamic zealots called 
blasphemous and degrading to the prophet mohammed iranian death 
threats sent rushdie into hiding 
sixth election by the massachusetts diocese of the episcopal 
church of barbara clementine harris 55 as suffragan bishop the 
first woman to become a bishop in the worldwide anglican communion 
seventh a warning by us catholic bishops to politicians 
against taking prochoice stands on abortion lucy killea running 
for the california state senate did so and was barred from holy 
communion by san diegos bishop leo maher she won 
eighth the rev george augustus stallings jr a washington 
dc catholic priest was suspended after he formed his own 
africanamerican congregation in washington dc calling 
catholicism racist 
ninth the vatican backed relocation of a carmelite convent 
from the auschwitz death camp after polish cardinal jozef glemp 
outraged jews and some catholic prelates with his comments about 
jews in the controversy 
tenth religious leaders condemned suppression of a student 
democracy movement in china and the dalia lama exiled tibetan 
buddhist leader receives the nobel peace prize in a move to point 
up the brutal crackdown 
besides picking the toprated religion stories religion 
reporters singled out incidents that tended to cover up religious 
affairs and stifle the publics right to know 
cited for first place in this into the darkness award was 
the national conference of catholic bishops who went into closed 
session for an entire afternoon at their novermber meeting and 
refused to disclose even their topic 
second place went to the southern baptist convention at which 
newly predominant fundamentalist trustees of denominational 
agencies summoned executives behind closed doors to lay down 
tightened rules 
other darkness citations went to episcopal bishops who 
barred reporters from smallgroup discussions about women bishops 
and the united church of christ which refused to divulge vote 
totals in election of the denominations new president in which a 
white won over a black church officials said people simply should 
take their word on the outcome

the world council of churches has 
made new grants totalling 635000 to organizations fighting 
racism one of them a south africabanned group which dominated 
recent elections in adjoining namibia 
the largest grant from the councils fund to combat racism 
165000 went to the south west african peoples organization 
swapo which garnered 57 percent of votes to elect 41 of 72 members 
of namibias assembly which is to produce a constitution for the

brahms loved buffalo bills wild west shows when 
they played in vienna and so presumes conductor zubin mehta did 
johann strauss sr at any rate strauss composed indian maidens 
galop and mehta will conduct the work with the vienna 
philharmonic on new years day 
from vienna the new years celebration 1990 viennas 
traditional new years concert of effervescent strauss music will 
be televised on jan 1 at 230 pm est by pbs 
there is such an output by the strauss family taking johann 
strauss jr and sr cousins and uncles we can go on for 10 years 
of concerts without repeating a single piece said mehta who was 
born in india 
however the blue danube waltz and radetzky march will be 
repeated theyre played every year 
the accent is on vienna in this years program said mehta 
who has never conducted a new years concert in vienna im doing 
an overture by franz von suppe to morning noon and night in 
vienna also on the program is mehtas favorite by strauss 
vienna blood which he has often presented as an encore when he 
conducted the vienna philharmonic 
they used to ask the music director of the opera to do it 
they have come to another sort of a plan now each year they want 
to ask another one of their regular conductors to take over next 
year will be somebody else 
in an interview at his office in avery fisher hall mehta said 
he has watched the concert on tv in the past and will in the 
future i think johann strauss is as classical as mozart is the 
pieces are played too much and without the right style which tends 
to diminish the quality of this music when played in the right 
style it is sheer pleasure it is the kind of music like mozart 
that one feels theres not an extra note 
this music reflects an age before the turn of the century when 
vienna was the cultural center of the world its the height of the 
hapsburg monarchy that it reflects 
mehta 53yearold artistic director of both the new york 
philharmonic and israel philharmonic conducted the vienna 
philharmonic last year in amsterdam but hasnt toured with it i 
cant be music director to two orchestras and tour with a third 
one that wouldnt be fair to any side 
last year mehta told the new york philharmonic that when his 
contract expires in 1991 he wont renew even though he believes 
the new york philharmonic is one of the greatest orchestras around 
today 
i feel after 13 years of my contributions here somebody else 
should take over now he said new york takes its toll on your 
spirit nobody can work harder than i can but 13 years of playing 
20 programs a season takes its toll on your inner person 
and one has to be honest with oneself and say i like to be 
free im going to do a lot but im going to do what i want im 
planning my freedom im planning more free time and im also 
planning projects the next person waiting to meet me now is the 
director of the chicago lyric opera from 1993 ill be doing a new 
ring cycle in chicago 
he also plans to record more operas 
the physical part of conducting doesnt tire mehta it is that 
inexplicable love and drive that you have from within for the music 
that makes you supersede all these material discomforts 
in florence when he conducted gotterdammerung the fourth 
and last opera in wagners ring cycle he said you come out of 
the pit after conducting two hours the longest mahler symphony is 
an hour and a half youve got the second and third acts to look 
forward to and i cant wait for the second act to begin for me 
these wagner pauses are necessary because of stage changes and the 
singers have to rest but i cant wait to go back 
mehta planned to fly to vienna the wednesday before new years 
this concert is carefully prepared he said though its 
music that comes out of their blood there are four rehearsals and 
two previous concerts one for the army one for the public to 
prepare for it

the soviet union and its old east bloc allies 
roared out of the 1980s on an incredible wave of reform that 
shattered the very foundations of communism they move now into the 
1990s on an uncharted course of high hopes and deep concerns 
one grim possibility came from soviet journalist alexander 
kabakov writing in the monthly magazine art of film it is the 
mid1990s and mikhail s gorbachevs reforms have failed the 
soviet union has splintered into warring cantons famine grips the 
land and roaming gangs of thugs rule moscow 
his nightmare is no idle fancy for a people who have known 
revolution civil war and famine in this century again there is 
widespread worry disillusionment and lack of faith as the soviet 
union 72 years old staggers into a new decade 
in eastern europe the kremlins allies are still aglow over the 
contagious political reforms that toppled the regions last 
hardline leader romanias nicolae ceausescu in the final days of 
the 1980s but they are also girding for tough years ahead 
someone will have to tell czechoslovaks they have to work 
harder and earn less warns the czechoslovak economist dusan 
triska 
in bulgaria we can hardly point to a subbranch and even a 
single production which is competitive on free international 
markets says premier georgi atanasov 
a liberator of eastern europe who has also freed his own people 
from decades of repression the 58yearold gorbachev has failed to 
deliver more tangible goods at home as the 1990s dawn and with 
them the sixth year of gorbachevs reign there still are lines for 
soap matches even sausage so foul its called doggy delight 
many items arent available at all 
communists no longer talk about burying capitalists they want 
to mimic them 
now we need your ideas now we need your lessons in 
managing vitaly korotich editor in chief of ogonyok magazine 
told americans recently marxism hasnt adequately fed soviets 
soon big mac will have a chance moscows first mcdonalds opens in 
january 
the 1990s pose historys greatest challenge for what was once 
labeled the soviet bloc erstwhile truths now discredited old 
guard leaders tossed in the trash bin of history eastern europe 
and the soviet union want to become smoothly functioning components 
in the modern world economic order 
but can they 
even in hungary a pioneer in implementing freemarket 
practices managers still have little concept of profitoriented 
thinking competition and labor productivity where you pay those 
who work and fire those who dont says us ambassador mark 
palmer 
the specter of hard times looms everywhere 
hungarys government is proposing an austerity program 
foreseeing a 15 percent increase in consumer prices and a slash in 
state subsidies 
czechoslovakia which had europes no 6 economy before world 
war ii must undo 40 years of communist underinvestment and shoddy 
maintenance of industry 
we will have to abolish many insufficient factories and 
gradually open to the international market says economist 
miroslav slouf deputy mayor of prague any newly elected 
government will be unpopular within months 
inflation tops 600 percent in poland and poles donate the 
family silver and money hidden under mattresses to a fund to help 
the nation economists in warsaw their desks piled high with dire 
forecasts struggle to draft a reform blueprint that will encourage 
western help 
the coming austerity could have high political costs 
shorn of their legally guaranteed grip on power in hungary east 
germany and czechoslovakia communists are now condemned to share 
power and even lose it their bulgarian comrades possibly the 
romanians and finally the soviets are fated to follow 
politicians more responsive to voter demands will bring even 
more unraveling in the old soviet bloc communism borne into east 
europe on the bayonets of the red army in world war ii already 
must compete with other creeds like solidaritystyle trade 
unionism and roman catholicism in poland the kremlin is sending 
signals it will brook virtually any style of reform as long as its 
allies stay in the warsaw pact military alliance 
the late soviet dissident andrei amalric wrote a book will 
the soviet union survive until 1984 it has but enters the 1990s 
riven by ethnic disputes that constitute the most violent menace 
both to unity and moscows authority this continentsized land of 
more than 100 nationalities is being unraveled by demands of 
azerbaijanis armenians georgians estonians latvians and others 
in the 1990s gorbachevs kremlin must placate those 
nationalities or see the multiethnic empire the bolsheviks seized 
from the czars disintegrate so far the kremlins efforts have 
largely failed using more traditional tactics repression would 
cost the soviets much of the good will they have accumulated abroad 
in the gorbachev era 
more than anything else the next soviet decade depends on one 
man mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev the stocky son of a southern 
russian peasant who is unquestionably one of the most gifted 
political operators of the century he may not be able to realize 
his vision of a more modern open better working soviet union at 
peace with the world but it is impossible to imagine anyone else 
doing it 
the last rock of stalinist stability in the soviet bloc was 
swept away by the reform tide on the eve of the 1990s though not 
without bloody resistance nicolae ceausescu 71 was driven from 
power by a mass uprising of romanians enraged that his security 
forces had slain thousands of antigovernment demonstrators 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed on christmas day 
that revolt which lasted less than a week was the final act in 
a remarkable year that saw hardline leaders in poland 
czechoslovakia east germany and bulgaria ousted by popular 
pressure street demonstrations and civic bravery 
still untouched by all accounts was albania which long ago 
sealed itself up in a stalinist mold apart from the world and now 
is more alone than ever in a churning sea of change 
but a joke making the rounds in warsaw reflected a view of poles 
that the liberalization process they began is inevitable for all 
the joke goes 
q how long does it take to overthrow communism 
a ten years in poland 10 weeks in east germany 10 days in 
czechoslovakia and 10 seconds in romania

advances in science and technology promise to make the 10 years 
that begin jan 1 a decade of unparalleled accomplishment but 
damage to the atmosphere accumulation of solid wastes the spread 
of aids and other threats also make the 1990s a decade of potential 
peril 
human beings now have the power to control their own fate to a 
degree that theyve never had before said edward cornish

the intertwined issues of air pollution the ozone layer and the 
greenhouse effect will all be high on the environmental agenda in 
the 1990s 
in smogbound los angeles authorities will try to change a way 
of life by starting to wean commuters off gasolinepowered 
automobiles other cities are likely to follow suit 
scientists meanwhile will train their instruments on the 
thinning ozone in the stratosphere a layer that shields the earth 
from ultraviolet rays which can cause skin cancer a human 
pollutant chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs is destroying the ozone 
governments are trying to reduce cfc releases but the question for 
the 1990s is whether it is too little too late 
scientists almost universally agree that carbon dioxide and 
other gases released into the atmosphere will produce the 
greenhouse effect letting sunlight in but not letting earths 
heat out but specialists disagree on when the warming will occur 
and how bad it will be pessimists predict the 1990s will be even 
warmer than the 1980s one of the warmest recent decades

specialists see an upcoming crunch on the garbage front half 
the nations 6000 dumps will be filled and closed in the 90s 
said bruce weddle director of the environmental protection 
agencys municipal solid waste program by the end of the decade 
i think recycling is going to be part of the cultural fabric of 
society people will be separating out all bottles cans 
newspapers plastics leaves and grass clippings instead of 
throwing them in one can 
americans now bury about 80 percent of their waste in dumps 
burn 10 percent and recycle the remainder the epa predicts 
recycling will jump to 25 percent by 1992

the world health organization estimates that nine times more 
people around the world will get aids in the 1990s than did in the 
1980s by the year 2000 there could be 6 million aids cases and 
18 million people could be infected 
an estimated 1 million to 15 million americans are now infected 
with the deadly disease most perhaps all will eventually become 
ill 
researchers cannot confidently predict a vaccine or cure in the 
coming decade but they believe aids could be subdued to the point 
of becoming a chronic disease one for which those infected must 
take longterm medication

if current death rates continue 13 million american lives will 
be claimed in the 1990s by two big killers heart disease and 
cancer 
medical researchers do not expect cures in the next decade 
instead they look for new insights to help them attack the 
diseases from many directions 
better understanding of cancercausing genes and how to block 
them for example and of cancersuppressing genes and how to 
harness them would give medical scientists crucial new weapons to 
wield against cancer 
new discoveries about the relationship of diet to heart disease 
might lead to innovative treatments for the nations leading killer

biologists who have uncovered the genetic causes of such 
ailments as cystic fibrosis will turn their attention to the 
genetics of human behavior in the 1990s 
in human genes scientists may find the roots of such complex 
disorders as manicdepressive illness and schizophrenia 
specialists believe understanding of some behavioral disorders 
should come by the year 2000

10 years says david baltimore a nobel laureate at the

after years of tight budgets american scientists hope the 1990s 
will introduce a new golden age of space exploration 
president bush has proposed a major commitment to completing the 
manned space station freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base 
on the moon and a manned mission to mars early in the next century 
the us probe magellan launched from a space shuttle last may 
is to orbit venus next august the probe galileo launched from a 
shuttle in october is to orbit jupiter in 1995 en route galileo 
will also study venus and take the first closeup look at an 
asteroid in 1992 the mars observer will be launched to orbit the 
red planet for a multiyear examination 
the soviets meanwhile will continue development of a space 
shuttle and exploit their own space station mir as they pursue 
their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to mars early in the

specialists foresee more automobiles on the road in the 1990s 
on a us highway system that will never keep pace 
experts say air pollution and possible oil shortages in the 90s 
will spur production of cleaner highermileage cars increased use 
of vehicles that run on methanol natural gas electricity or solar 
power construction of more trolleys and other light rail 
systems and more vacation travel done by trains planes and cruise 
ships 
traffic management will include synchronized traffic lights

the high technologists look ahead to a personal computer in the 
1990s that will be a blend of 3d television and quadraphonic 
stereo with the hand controls of a video game machine and more 
speed than carsized mainframes of the 1980s 
multimedia computers will rival television for attention 
able to surround the user with for example the sights and sounds 
of an early morning in paris or an erupting hawaiian volcano 
experts say they will help educate the next generation of 
videohungry schoolchildren 
other advances expected in the 90s machine translation of 
language and telerobots with human guidance that will clean up

demographics will change the face of the us factory and office 
and of american society in the coming decade 
the private population reference bureau reports that in the 
1970s 241 million young people entered the workforce in the 
1980s only 180 million did so and in the 1990s the number is 
expected to decline to 156 million 
much of the dropoff is among nonhispanic white males women and 
minoritygroup members will account for more than 80 percent of all 
new entrants in the labor force in the 90s the bureau says 
some businesses such as fastfood outlets are already feeling 
the shortage of new labormarket entrants and have begun seeking 
out retired people to fill jobs

<TEXT>
the soviet unions exit from communism appears to be the most 
difficult process to manage in the next 10 years no doubt it will 
involve periods of high inflation and also political 
convulsions as the states of eastern europe move rather quickly 
toward the european model the soviet union will seek a separate 
way whose definition it probably will not be able to find soon 
this will lead it to remain in a state of uncertainty and strong 
internal tension

the 90s promise to be the environmental decade a time when 
environmental trends increasingly will shape economic trends 
rising world grain prices will likely be the first economic 
indicator to signal trouble in the relationship between ourselves 
now numbering 52 billion and the natural systems and resources on 
which we depend as the decade unfolds the degradation of the 
planet will begin showing up at harvest time 
reversing the deterioration of the planet will require 
governments everywhere to redefine security recognizing that the 
principal threats to our future come less from military aggression 
and more from environmental degradation

the prospect that seems most important to me is the potential 
that our position as a preeminent nation in scientific research 
may be eroded i attribute it to the decline in real funding for 
fundamental research and to a decline in public education i 
think our nation is in danger of not taking intellect seriously 
enough 
not even the parents of affluent children take the education of 
their children as seriously as they should they look to it as an 
avenue to material success they do not look to it for enrichment 
of adult life the public no longer cares about the creative 
side of life

we are discovering a fundamental law of our human existence 
that we are made for interdependence with one another and with the 
rest of creation consequently there will be increasing revulsion 
with the arms race with an increase in peoples participation in

and clients to make peace in their respective areas there will be 
an upsurge of concern for human rights and interest in 
participatory styles of government aids and poverty will draw

political changes in these countries are also helping sports

there is a danger that rapid economic growth in some parts of 
the developing world could be mistakenly interpreted as the end of 
the problems of economic imbalance between developed and developing 
countries in the 1990s the international community must sustain

countries and the poorest people within those countries

conflicts reflect a mounting confusion in the country over what we 
really want of our colleges and universities and how we would like 
their most creative knowledgeable professors to allocate their 
time in the 1990s universities the government and the 
public at large will need to work harder to reconcile their 
differences or we will surely damage institutions of great 
potential value that are preeminent in the world and essential to

we enter the next decade with the troubling knowledge that the 
20year effort to clean up the environment has failed 
environmental pollution is an incurable disease it can only be 
prevented 
pollution prevention means building new smogless car engines 
eliminating the use of agricultural chemicals by shifting to 
organic farming replacing fossil fuels with solar energy 
the transition to such ecologically sound production 
technologies will challenge the taboo against questioning the 
dominance of private interests over the public interest in 
environmental quality in the 1990s we will need a perestroika of 
our own

bargain hunters had reason to rejoice this christmas but store 
owners had less cause for celebrating 
retailers rang up mostly respectable holiday sales gains but 
many relied on profiteating discounts to woo customers 
kurt barnard publisher of the newsletter retail marketing 
report said tuesday that judging by the evidence so far his 
prediction of a 5 percent increase in holiday sales this year looks 
accurate 
to eke out the estimated increase which falls short of 1988s 
7 percent rise above the prior year retailers had to accept lower 
prices that pinched their profits 
i think the consumer had a very very merry christmas and im 
not so sure that the retailers did from a profit point of view 
said analyst linda r morris of pnc financial corp in philadelphia 
many stores still are stuck with too much inventory so 
postchristmas price cutting is expected to be more extensive than 
normal barnard said 
holiday shoppers lived up to their reputation as procrastinators 
and didnt spend heavily until the final days before christmas 
helping to salvage the season for some retailers last year a 
belated buying surge boosted business and more than made up for 
earlier weakness 
thank goodness it came and pulled out the christmas season 
said irwin greenberg president of hesss department stores inc 
earlier sales at the chain had been erratic healthy when the 
weather was favorable for shopping and poor when it wasnt he said 
this past saturday was the best day ever for hesss a 
pennsylvaniabased chain of 76 department stores operating in 11 
eastern states and owned by crown american corp 
like other retailers greenberg said hesss made a special 
effort to get shoppers in the door we were as promotional as you 
can get i dont know how you can get more promotional than this 
christmas season 
for hesss the merchandising tactic paid off a big increase in 
sales volume offset the price markdowns and the chain appears 
likely to register unexpectedly strong fourthquarter sales 
greenberg said 
not every retailer had to resort to unusually intense 
pricecutting dayton hudson corp which operates the target 
discount chain and the dayton hudson and mervyns department 
stores said business this year was slightly less promotional than 
in 1988 however sales were good 
we are very pleased with the results said kenneth a macke 
chairman and chief executive officer of the minneapolisbased 
retailer we continue to expect a strong fourth quarter 
deep discounts giveaways and other promotional gimmicks have 
been fiercest in the most competitive areas of the country 
particularly in cities where department stores owned by heavily 
indebted campeau corp operate 
campeau stores such as bloomingdales the bon marche burdines 
lazarus and richs have been under pressure to generate sales to 
cover the parent companys debt payments 
stores emphasizing clothing indicated they enjoyed better 
results than general merchants continuing a yearlong pattern 
frigid weather in many parts of the country sent shoppers searching 
for overcoats sweaters scarves and similar coldweather garb 
retailers said 
j c penney co inc which does the bulk of its business in 
clothing finished the holiday season strongly said spokesman 
duncan muir he said doubledigit sales gains occurred at many 
stores around the country run by the texasbased retailer 
the nations biggest retailer sears roebuck and co benefited 
from a late surge in shopping which reached a high point saturday 
spokesman ernest arms said but overall sears holiday sales 
probably will turn out to be about even with last year when the 
retailer reported a 121 percent jump in sales over 1987 
most of the major american retailers will issue reports jan 4 
on their sales in the weeks between thanksgiving and new years eve 
cynthia turk a retail specialist with the accounting firm 
deloitte amp touche estimated that chains achieved sales gains of 5 
percent to 8 percent over last year 
the higher gains within this average clearly are among the 
specialty stores she said there is however a lot of 
disappointment because of the weak profitability environment

orange juice prices leaped on the futures 
market after a weekend freeze overwhelmed florida and texas citrus 
groves but experts said consumers may escape big price increases 
because of a bumper crop in brazil 
however big chill 89 likely will drive up vegetable prices in 
the northeast because the cold wiped out thousands of acres of 
carrots cauliflower broccoli and other crops in florida 
agriculture officials said 
experts assessing the damage tuesday said it was too early for 
definite predictions about prices us agriculture department 
economist ralph parlett in washington said price increases were 
likely but he hadnt changed his earlier forecast of a 3 percent 
to 5 percent overall rise in food prices in 1990 
in florida where the citrus industry is worth an estimated 35 
billion a year the christmas cold wave struck with about 80 
percent of the citrus crop still on the trees and there was heavy 
icing of oranges and grapefruit in texas an estimated 65 percent 
of the crop or 55 million worth wholesale was still on the 
trees according to growers and farm officials 
fruit frozen on the trees can still be used for juice as long 
as its picked and processed before the weather warms too much and 
crews raced through groves salvaging what they could 
a large juice reserve in florida booming citrus production in 
brazil and swift processing of iced oranges should stabilize juice 
prices somewhat said dan gunter executive director of the florida 
department of citrus 
because of that there might be a more moderate impact than we 
might expect for a freeze year gunter said 
everjumpy commodities traders ran up the price of frozen orange 
juice futures in effect a contract to buy a set amount of juice 
on a specified date 
the contract for january delivery of frozen concentrated orange 
juice jumped 161 cents to 1531 a pound tuesday on the new york 
cotton exchange an 118 percent gain the contracts for march and 
may delivery rose their permitted daily limits of 5 cents a pound 
the freeze didnt affect california and arizona citrus which 
generally is sold fresh rather than frozen for juice florida 
farmers use about 90 percent of their oranges for juice and about 
50 percent of the grapefruit 
consumers biggest worry from the freeze appeared to be 
vegetable prices florida farmers reported widespread damage to 
vegetable crops from one end of the peninsula to the other said 
state agriculture commissioner doyle conner 
much of the winter vegetable crop was destined for the 
northeastern united states and central and south florida growers 
said thousands of acres of carrots radishes cauliflower and 
broccoli were destroyed and that little would be salvageable 
neartotal losses were reported in winter vegetables in large 
areas of the state and heavy losses of beans squash corn 
tomatoes and watermelons strawberries ornamental plants and other 
crops also were hard hit 
with shortages naturally prices will go up conner said 
vegetable losses are a more temporary kind of thing because 
those crops can be replanted noted the usdas parlett continued 
production from california and mexico could also cushion the blow 
he said 
theres no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short 
and well probably see higher prices at produce counters parlett 
said 
florida growers were optimistic that trees throughout the 
700000acre citrus belt had been spared extensive damage 
nevertheless losses to the industry just starting to recover 
from disastrous freezes in 1983 and 1985 were expected to be 
heavy 
growers are concerned about their trees said bobby mckown 
executive vice president of lakelandbased florida citrus mutual a 
trade association of more than 12000 growers but right now we 
dont see the black leaves that we had in 1983 
freeze fallout could include unemployment for thousands of 
migrant farm workers once the rush to save the oranges subsides 
and the crops disappear those workers workers could lose their 
jobs said charles esposito program manager for the bethel 
mission in plant city

a former employee of the hughes 
aircraft co division here sued the company for 96 billion 
contending it covered up a potential defect in more than 4 million 
computer chips used in defense systems 
the suit was filed in june in us district court in santa ana 
and was unsealed and served tuesday said frank barbaro an 
attorney for plaintiff michael c denlinger 
we think our national security is compromised barbaro said 
the suit was brought under the federal false claims act which 
allows socalled whistleblowers to share in damage awards in 
defense fraud cases 
denlinger a former senior staff engineer at the hughes 
division alleged that defective chips installed since 1984 caused 
two failures in the navys submarinelaunched advance capability 
torpedo system 
while routine screening found two defective chips in torpedoes 
but the suits allegations are wrong said dan reeder a spokesman 
for hughes ground systems group here 
erroneous reeder said we have never had any failure of 
the test torpedoes due to hardware problems during any of the 
hundreds of runs we have gone through 
the microchips were used in several defense systems including 
an informationprocessing system for the radar on board the uss 
vincennes which mistakenly shot down an iranian commercial 
jetliner in 1988 the los angeles times reported today 
in his suit denlinger said his repeated memos about possible 
cracking of the chips because of a soldering process were ignored 
he resigned in november 1988 
the basis for the unusually large multibilliondollar damage 
request was not immediately available 
hughes said tuesday that it has inspected every chip since 
becoming aware of a cracking problem in 1985 and said it was an 
industrywide problem the times said 
hughes already is the target of another defenserelated lawsuit 
it alleges that the radar systems group in el segundo overcharged 
the government 50 million on four radar programs including one 
for the b2 stealth bomber 
that suit seeks 120 million in damages

grain and soybean futures prices were little 
changed in quiet early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
as export optimism offset selling linked to warmer temperatures in 
the nations midsection 
trading was light which is typical for a holiday period 
the markets opened mostly lower extending the weaker pattern 
established tuesday due to warmer temperatures in the great plains 
and midwest after a twoweek cold spell 
but selling pressure waned and buying interest surfaced early in 
the session partly reflecting the agriculture departments weekly 
graininspections report which showed unexpectedly large exports 
of corn wheat and soybeans last week 
some buying also stemmed from spains overnight purchase of 
180000 metric tons of us corn and from expectations that 
pakistan will tender tonight for 26000 metric tons of us soybean 
oil said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc in chicago 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in march at 410 a bushel corn

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower wednesday on the chicago board of trade led by a drop in the 
soybean market that analysts attributed mainly to technical factors 
soybean prices have been in a downward trend since last week and 
on tuesday the contract for nearterm delivery fell below 570 a 
bushel for the first time since early november 
slight losses early in wednesdays session triggered new 
selling and reports of beneficial rain in the soybean fields of 
brazil encouraged further sales of soybean futures 
wheat and oat futures also dropped but corn futures finished 
narrowly mixed with support stemming from an unexpected overnight 
sale of 180000 metric tons of us corn to spain 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 3 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 406 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to cent higher with march at 238 a bushel oats

for many people trips to crowded shopping malls airports or 
restaurants this holiday season werent complete without a stop at 
an automated teller machine 
one of the worlds largest atm networks plus system inc of 
denver predicts that between dec 1 and new years day consumers 
will have used the hightech bank machines twice as much as last 
year largely for withdrawals 
thats good news for many financial institutions who charge 
anywhere from 10 cents to 3 per transaction for such atm services 
as cash withdrawals deposits transfers or balance inquiries 
consumers have clearly embraced the idea of using atms 
theyve become more confident in technolgoy said ddale 
browning president of plus system which estimates its atm 
customers will withdraw more than 500 million through 65 million 
transactions this month 
at the same time usage has risen and the number of available 
atms has grown since their introduction more than a decade ago the 
likelihood of fraud committed by and against consumers also has 
increased especially during the holidays experts say 
the potential for it to rise is there just as creditcard 
fraud rose as people started to use their cards more and thieves 
became more aware of how they can beat the system said marsha 
sullivan a spokeswoman for the consumer bankers association in 
arlington va 
there are few estimates available on atmrelated losses but 
some experts say it runs as high as 200 million a year and has the 
potential to move into the billions as it has in the creditcard 
industry 
bank of america in san francisco narrowly escaped 14 million in 
potential losses earlier this year after uncovering a scam in which 
several insiders planned to use stolen secret codes of atm 
cardholders to withdraw money from 8000 bank accounts the group 
planned to carry out the scheme with bogus bank cards made of 
posterboard 
a recent survey by the washingtonbased american bankers 
association found that 25 percent of the 1200 banks polled 
reported cases of fraud committed by a customer thirteen percent 
reported fraud against a customer 
the average financial institution had 62 cases of atm fraud or 
about one incident for every 28070 transactions last year 
according to another study by bank administration institute of 
rolling meadows ill that was down sharply from the 390 incidents 
reported in 1986 due largely the bia says to increased 
safeguards by banks 
atm fraud can include from whitecollar scams such as thieves 
withdrawing money after stealing bank customers personal 
identification numbers strongarmed tactics like robberies at atm 
locations or overwithdrawals by customers 
still fraud cases involving atm cards are much rarer than with 
credit cards thats because in order to use an atm card a thief 
must also gain access to the persons personal identification code 
usually a secret fourdigit number punched into an atm keyboard 
to gain access to an account 
despite this safeguard a significant number of atm cardholders 
about 25 percent by some accounts still make the mistake of 
noting their pins either on the back of their cards or somewhere in 
their wallets purse snatchers usually out in full force during 
the holidays often can figure out what the number stands for and 
use it long before the card is missed 
while it is important for you to read you monthly creditcard 
statement to check for unauthorized charges its even more crucial 
to read your bank statement to find unauthorized withdrawal through 
an atm said elgie holstein director of the consumer group 
bankcard holders of america in herndon va 
holstein says consumers receive far less protection on atm cards 
than on credit cards liability from losses on an atm card is 50 
for the first two days after it is reported missing the same as 
with credit cards but it rises to 500 for the next 60 days from 
the time a bank statement is mailed out after which there is 
technically no limit 
financial institutions have built a number of safeguards into 
the atm system to prevent customers from seeing their savings wiped 
out such as placing limits on the amount of an atm withdrawal per 
transaction 
in addition the computers that operate atms are kept in high 
security areas in financial institutions the data that travels 
across the wires each time a customer uses a machine is 
scrambled meaning the information never travels across the 
line the same way twice 
boris melnikoff vice chairman of the abas security and risk 
management division says technology exists to make it virtually 
impossible for anybody but the cardholder to withdraw money from 
his or her account among those being considered are identification 
on the basis of fingerprints handprints or a customers retinas 
but it has to be a practical approach melnikoff said 
not everyone might feel comfortable sticking their face in a 
device so their retinas could be examined

sales of existing homes advanced 32 percent 
in november with a big jump in activity in the south spurring the 
fastest growth rate in 11 months a real estate trade group 
reported wednesday 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
359 million units last month the best performance since sales 
reached a rate of 392 million units in december 1988 
the 32 percent octobertonovember sales increase followed a 
11 percent decline in october it was the biggest percentage gain 
since a 45 percent rise in august 
analysts credited declining mortgage rates for the upturn in 
sales activity but they said that housing sales presented a mixed 
picture with some areas of the country such as the northeast 
hurting because of a rapid surge in prices in the past several 
years 
some large highcost markets have experienced some softening 
this year however many smaller secondary cities are quite 
strong said john tuccillo chief economist for the realtors 
he said the disparity in sales between highcost areas and more 
moderately priced markets should continue in 1990 
sluggish sales in highcost areas has prompted some fears of a 
coming housing recession but norman d flynn president of the 
realtors group said the doomsayers would be proven wrong 
people who are predicting hard times for housing are not 
considering how much prices rose in highcost areas over the past 
few years said flynn who cited the northeast where the median 
price is up 85 percent from five years ago 
tuccillo predicted that falling mortgage rates would continue to 
boost home sales in coming months the national average for 
fixedrate mortgages dipped to 969 percent last week down from a 
high last march of 1122 percent 
the median price for homes sold in november edged up 04 percent 
to 93000 
the west pulled ahead of the northeast in november as the region 
with the highest priced homes recording a median resale cost of 
150200 last month the northeast was second with a median price 
of 145800 followed by the south at 82400 and the midwest at 
70900 
the median is the point at which half the homes sold for more 
and half for less 
in november the sales increase was led by a 92 percent jump in 
sales in the south where homes were sold at an annual rate of 142 
million units in november sales were up 32 percent in the west to 
an annual rate of 640000 units the northeast posted a 17 percent 
rise to an annual rate of 590000 units 
sales in the midwest were down 4 percent to an annual rate of 
950000 units 
all of the percentage comparisons were with october sales rates 
when compared to sales in november 1988 the midwest had a small 
increase of 11 percent while activity in the south was up by 07 
percent 
however sales in the northeast are down 132 percent when 
compared to a year ago while sales in the west are off by 59 
percent compared to november 1988

manufacturers who supply merchandise to 
campeau corps department stores continued to watch wednesday for 
clues whether the retail operations would file for bankruptcy 
protection 
in the meantime many of the clothing makers and other companies 
that do business with the stores have stopped shipments or 
postponed decisions about future shipments amid worries about 
campeaus solvency 
torontobased campeaus nearly 260 department stores around the 
united states are continuing to sell and stock goods but executives 
at some of the stores said this week that they have noticed 
shipment disruptions 
campeau announced three weeks ago that its cincinnatibased 
retail divisions federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp might seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy 
court early next year 
its now a game of russian roulette said alan millstein 
publisher of the fashion network report the spigots been turned 
off on seventh avenue he said referring to the new york garment 
district where many apparel companies have their headquarters 
the only way to turn it back on is some sort of resolution of 
the current situation he said 
merchandise credit companies and several clothing makers 
announced before christmas that they had suspended business with 
federated and allied as a result of campeaus financial problems 
federated and allied warned in a quarterly financial statement 
in middecember that they might seek bankruptcy protection as early 
as next month if 69 billion in debt cant be restructured the 
debt was created as part of campeaus acquisition of the department 
store chains 
among campeaus chains are bloomingdales burdines richs 
abraham amp straus lazarus and others 
donald van suilichem senior vice president and director of 
marketing at atlantabased richs said there have been some 
limited interruptions in shipments 
we expect there will be some more but at this point its 
been really negligible he said 
one of richs vendors new yorkbased greif cos said it wont 
make any shipments until the financial health of richs parent 
becomes clearer 
greif supplies mens suits and sport coats under the polo 
university club and perry ellis labels 
theyre hanging and waiting to go out said norman fryman 
greifs president and chief executive officer he said greif 
already has manufactured hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of 
goods for richs and other campeau units 
campeaus suppliers are concerned about their prospects if a 
filing under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code ensues 
what i see happening and what is going to make me angry along 
with all the other customers owed money is a chapter 11 just 
before they have to pay their debts said bud konheim president 
of nicole miller ltd a dress maker the perfect time is just 
prior to jan 10 
the jan 10 date is when payment is due for the goods suppliers 
shipped to campeau in late november and december 
campeau announced friday that citibank had informed campeau that 
it might technically be in default on a loan agreement because it 
cannot provide assurance about its solvency citibank which is 
campeaus major lender could call for full repayment on the 234 
billion in loans it made for acquisition financing if campeau cant 
remedy the situation by dec 31

when it comes to quackgrass a slimy 
cropchewing slug is a dead duck the agriculture department said 
wednesday 
weed scientist roger d hagin of the departments agricultural 
research service said that when quackgrass is killed it releases a 
compound into the soil that acts as a nerve poison against slugs 
the poison is highly specific to slugs he said it has 
been tested with no ill effects on three species of freshwater 
snails as well as mammals in general 
hagin who works at the agencys plant protection research unit 
in ithaca ny has isolated and synthesized the quackgrass 
compound a patent on the material is in the works which could 
clear the way for commercial development of a new lethal bait for 
slugs 
commercial poisons are available now to kill slugs but those 
also are toxic to birds and animals he said the quackgrass 
treatment could be applied at much lower rates and at less cost 
hagin fieldtested the compound for two years in snapbeans 
alfalfa and other crops he said the snapbean yields were nearly 
doubled as a result of reduced slug damage 
quackgrass is widespread and competes strongly for fertilizer 
and water in crops such as corn soybeans and forages hagin said 
slugs are especially troublesome in humid areas and have taken a 
heavy toll of west coast strawberry fields and citrus orchards 
hagin said they also interfere with corn production on the east 
coast 
further slugs are a serious problem in notill or 
minimumtillage farming where the soil is not cultivated heavily 
were currently looking at the possibility of using the slug 
poison compound as a seed treatment in minimumtillage 
situations hagin said we might be able to get the crop plants 
to take this material up as a defense against slug attacks 
hagin accidentally discovered the quackgrass connection in 1981 
after he had used herbicides to get rid of weeds before he planted 
notill corn on land where red clover had been raised 
when the corn was about six inches tall i noticed that slugs 
were attacking it heavily he said but there were little 
islands in the field where quackgrass had been growing with the 
clover and in those areas the slugs werent attacking the corn at 
all 
quackgrass is known to leave two allelopathic chemical 
compounds behind in the soil that inhibit the growth of certain 
other plants but those are different from the compound that kills 
the slugs hagin said

the furor that marked approval of the free trade 
agreement with the united states has subsided but critics in 
canada blame the yearold pact for bad economic news ranging from 
unemployment to a big rise in imports 
the agreements supporters just as adamantly credit it with 
operating smoothly and preparing the way for growth 
the pact that took effect on jan 1 1989 phases out over a 
10year period virtually all remaining tariffs in the worlds 
largest trading partnership most analysts agree that no method has 
been devised to measure its early effects accurately 
i think the concrete ways to measure it are difficult at this 
point said jim dewilde a professor at the university of western 
ontarios business school its an adjustment in the way canada 
and the united states conduct a very large trading relationship 
its going to be very difficult to calculate the precise 
impact economist alan rugman of the university of toronto said 
the value of twoway trade in goods grew dramatically during the 
past decade more than doubling from 7685 billion in 1980 to 
15302 billion in 1988 us commerce department figures show 
in all of those years the united states bought more goods from 
canada than the canadians bought in return netting canada a trade 
surplus that helped restrain inflation and keep people working 
canadas parliament approved the pact only after a heated 
election campaign dominated by the trade debate returned prime 
minister brian mulroneys progressive conservative party for a 
second consecutive majority government 
mulroney argued that the agreement he had signed with 
thenpresident reagan would ensure canadas access to the vastly 
larger us market at a time when protectionism was increasing 
around the world 
his opponents insisted the pact was unnecessary because 80 
percent of uscanadian trade already was tarifffree by lowering 
the remaining barriers the opponents argued canada would be 
swamped culturally and economically by its more populous powerful 
southern neighbor 
the argument lingers on 
the fact is when choices have to be made between saving 
canadian and american jobs multinational firms sacrifice canadian 
jobs every time john turner leader of the opposition liberal 
party told parliament in early december following a flurry of 
announcements about plant closings and layoffs 
finance minister michael wilson replied that any job losses are 
unfortunate but we have to realize we have a dynamic economy 
there are jobs that are being created every day there are jobs 
being lost every day 
the canadian labor congress a key opponent of the trade 
agreement has a list of 70000 jobs lost in plant closings and 
layoffs this year by such companies as gerber general electric 
and burlington industries 
maude barlow head of the nationalistic council of canadians 
that opposes the agreement said the trends sending jobs to us 
over canadian operations are clear even if not every layoff can be 
traced directly to free trade 
a survey taken for the national news weekly macleans at yearend 
found that 52 percent of canadians think the free trade agreement 
is a bad idea up from 32 percent a year ago but while 42 percent 
of canadians a year ago believed that free trade was the most 
important issue facing the country only 7 percent believe that now 
the persistent criticism of the trade agreement parallels 
evidence of an economic slowdown in canada with some warnings of 
an imminent recession 
canadas healthy trade balance historically considered a sign 
of economic strength showed a monthly deficit in october the 
first time that has happened in more than 13 years 
federal officials attributed the 362 million shortfall partly 
to the high value of the canadian dollar which makes imports 
cheaper and canadian goods more expensive government critics 
blamed the trade agreement 
is this what the prime minister meant when he said that his 
trade deal would make our trade more and more secure turner 
asked 
mulroney replied that the deficit reflected increased imports of 
capital goods and machinery which he said will help canada 
restructure its industries and exploit the free trade pact more 
effectively 
the agreement not only phases out tariffs but also creates new 
ways to settle trade disputes and eases investment and the movement 
of employees between the two countries 
canada and the united states agreed recently that the pact was 
working well enough to merit acceleration of tariff cuts on an 
additional 6 billion worth of trade starting april 1 
overall were extremely satisfied trade minister john 
crosbie said nov 30 after the second meeting of the free trade 
commission created by the pact 
its remarkable how well it is working and what few disputes 
we have us trade representative carla hills told reporters at 
the meeting in ottawa 
although the impact of the trade agreement may be difficult to 
measure companies now refer to it regularly in their planning 
its accelerated the need for canadian corporate strategists 
to think about the performance of their companies in a larger 
context said dewilde of the western ontario business school in 
london ontario 
arthur church president of champion road machinery ltd said 
his company has started to examine japanese management techniques 
and take other steps to increase productivity as his larger us 
competitors discover the canadian market 
i truly believe that before free trade many of our american 
competitors did not know where canada was he said at a forum for 
exporters we can complain or we can do something about it

floridas attorney general said 
wednesday the state is investigating whether southern bell 
underpaid commissions for pay telephone use to governments in 
several southeastern states 
attorney general bob butterworth said the delinquent commissions 
could total in the millions of dollars but determining the exact 
amount has been hampered by the telephone companys inability to 
provide records 
the commissions were to have been paid over two years starting 
in august 1986 butterworth said atlantabased southern bell knew 
of the problem in february 1987 but did nothing until a report in 
the miami herald last month 
computer mistakes do happen he said it is troubling 
however that southern bell knew about this problem for more than 
2 years yet apparently made little effort to reimburse its 
shortchanged government customers 
southern bell contracts with government agencies to put pay 
phones in buildings and then pays a percentage based on usage 
southern bell did not immediately return calls seeking comment 
officials previously have denied any wrongdoing and said the 
mistake was caused by a computer error 
butterworth said the failure to make backpayments promptly 
could violate the states grand theft law 
butterworth said he began sending letters wednesday to federal 
state and local agencies advising them not to accept restitution 
from southern bell until his office accounts for the delinquent 
commissions 
as soon as we can determine what appears to be owed we will 
advise you butterworth said in one letter you may well be 
entitled to to a claim exceeding the contract amount plus 
interest 
butterworth said southern bell may owe commissions to agencies 
in florida georgia north carolina and south carolina 
in a letter last week to southern bell president b franklin 
skinner butterworth said key documents regarding the commissions 
were lost or destroyed and that the company initially said it could 
not replace them now however southern bell is reconstructing 
those records he said 
butterworth asked skinner to ensure that southern bell does not 
attempt to pay restitution and that whatever amount the utility 
believes it owes be placed in an interestbearing trust account 
until the investigation ends 
the herald reported that southern bell had underpaid broward 
county agencies more than 150000 in commissions the newspaper 
quoted a former utility manager as saying the company knew the 
revenue reports were wrong

at an age when most men would consider waking 
up in the morning an accomplishment isaac a long gets his kicks 
by creating headlines in financial publications around the world 
the 90yearold chairman emeritus of southwest bank of st louis 
has made a career out of taking the lead in cutting the prime 
lending rate and watching other banks follow in his tracks 
until nov 8 long was batting 900 as a bellwether but other 
banks didnt match him that time and he became news because 
southwest had to backtrack three weeks later and readjust its prime 
from 10 percent to 105 percent 
considering that it was the first time in at least 10 years that 
he has had to retreat long took it well 
were still batting about 875 he said thats still a 
pretty good average 
in fact long said the move was well worth it 
what we really did was give our commercial customers a 
christmas bonus a little early he said we feel it was an 
excellent investment from an advertising and public relations 
standpoint 
the prime rate is important because it is used by many banks as 
a basis for determining rates on a wide range of other loans 
including highly popular homeequity loans a drop in the prime 
would be followed by lower interest rates for loans to consumers 
and small businesses 
speculation has persisted in the past few weeks that banks would 
cut the prime rate because their own borrowing costs have declined 
a result of recent crediteasing moves by the federal reserve the 
nations central bank to forestall an economic downturn as of 
this past week however neither longs bank nor any other appeared 
willing to lower the prime rate 
using the year 1989 as an example of longs influence on the 
banking industry the prime rate rested at 115 percent until 
friday june 2 
thats when long announced southwest was dropping its prime to 
11 percent on monday the next work day all the major banks in 
the country followed 
on friday july 7 long again rattled the industrys chains and 
dropped his prime to 105 percent the following monday only new 
yorks chase manhattan bank followed southwests lead it wasnt 
until the 29th that bank of america joined them and it was two more 
days before the other big banks fell into step 
then came nov 8 and the cut that separated southwest from the 
rest of the pack 
ia long sort of hung himself out there to dry said ray 
worseck chief economist at ag edwards amp son inc a st louis 
investment firm i think the optimists got a little bit ahead of 
themselves on this 
long said one of the reasons he erred was the difficulty in 
interpreting the behavior of the federal reserve which 
historically has acted with great secrecy in order to keep 
financial markets stable 
but the nations central bank can send subtle signals about its 
possible intentions partly by control over the amount of money 
available to lend that control sometimes can be seen in the 
behavior of the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans 
between banks 
the rate had fallen below 85 percent in november convincing 
long that the fed was easing and it was time for a primerate cut 
then the fed appeared to suddenly reverse itself and the federal 
funds rate rose to 875 on nov 28 forcing long to backtrack 
some new york bankers may have enjoyed seeing long with egg on 
his face but the old veteran says his aim ever since he began his 
rate crusade in the 1970s has never been to make the big banks 
look bad 
our policy our ambition is not to upstage the new york 
banks long said our customers are very appreciative of the 
fact that they dont have to wait for what banks in new york or 
chicago do we make our own decisions 
those decisions he said are based on lengthy analysis he said 
southwest looks at trends rather than specific economic indicators 
and he said he prefers to look at a six month period 
long broke into banking with the royal bank of canada in new 
york in 1920 after organizing the first branch bank in virginia in 
1922 he came to the national bank of commerce in st louis in 1927 
and has never left the area 
named president of southwest bank in 1953 long soon became its 
largest stockholder he often is called col long a title that has 
stuck since he served a term as chairman of the st louis police 
board 
the bank has had the same location and the same name for 69 
years said long the banks president edward c berra and a 
vice chairman fred a giacoma were both hired by long 29 years 
ago long finally sold controlling interest in the institution in 
1984 
i think its interesting that every time we get in the news 
for being a national leader they call us a small bank long 
said but if you look at the figres were in the top 5 percent 
nationally and were the largest independent bank in missouri 
as chairman emeritus long isnt involved in daytoday 
operations of the bank but he remains active and is considered an 
authority on interest rates 
i enjoy being here every day keeping in touch with whats 
going on he said its really a lot of fun i attribute my 
longivity to having steady employment and my wife of 51 years 
as for retirement long said i havent given it a thought 
ill worry about it when i get closer to retirement age

toyota motor corp japans largest carmaker is 
considering moving part of its station wagon production unit to the 
united states company officials said wednesday 
the officials said toyota plans to start production of its camry 
wagon at its us carmaking unit toyota motor manufacturing usa 
inc in georgetown ky 
production at the us plant is expected to start in early 1992 
but the schedule is subject to change depending on the market 
situation said a company official speaking on condition of 
anonymity

to manufacture where products will be sold he said 
toyota currently sells camry wagons only in overseas markets 
but it plans to import some of its usmade wagons to japan 
toyota has been selling about 1600 camry wagons a month in the 
united states but the official said they expect the demand to grow

heating oil futures rose dramatically again wednesday on the new 
york mercantile exchange as speculation continued that supplies 
would be tight amid continued cold weather 
on other commodity markets gold and silver prices plummeted as 
investment buying dried up orange juice futures were widely mixed 
livestock and meat were mixed and grains and soybeans were mostly 
lower 
with temperatures slowly warming oil traders focused on reports 
of reduced production capacity at the gulf of mexico where several 
refineries were forced to shut down because of coldweather damage 
to equipment 
the spot january heatingoil contract again led the gainers but 
analysts said the market could become extremely volatile in the 
next two sessions as the january contracts approach expiration on 
friday 
the risktoreward at these price levels dictates a lot of 
prudence and probably profittaking said william oneill 
research director with elders futures inc in new york 
wholesale home heating oil settled 36 cent lower to 723 cent 
higher with january at 9971 cents a gallon a sixyear high 
in other energy futures west texas intermediate crude oil 
finished 13 cent lower to 16 cent higher with february at 2178

higher with january at 6085 cents a gallon 
gold futures settled 6 to 7 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the spot contract for delivery in december at 40080 
a troy ounce a fiveweek low 
silver futures fell 272 cents to 308 cents with spot december 
settling at a sevenweek low of 524 a troy ounce 
market analysts said the investment buying that drove precious 
metals up sharply in october and november had dwindled with the 
easing of international tensions 
that development compounded by typically thin holiday trading 
conditions caused a dearth of willing buyers when commercial 
traders turned sellers early in wednesdays session 
there was nothing on the other side said stephen platt an 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago as the market 
started breaking through chart support you started seeing some 
computerfund selling which was not easily absorbed by speculators 
so the market pretty much got hammered 
the recent bull move had carried spot gold to almost 420 an 
ounce and spot silver to nearly 590 
most orange juice futures soared the permitted daily limit of 5 
cents a pound on the new york cotton exchange but the january 
contract fell 295 cents to 15015 a pound amid profittaking 
after tuesdays strong gains 
florida officials said they still could not estimate the damage 
from the weekend freeze in the orange groves but an increasing 
number of experts said brazilian imports and stockpiled florida 
juice should prevent a sharp rise in cash prices 
cattle futures fell on the chicago mercantile exchange amid 
profittaking after steep gains on tuesday hog futures rose and 
pork belly futures fell in light trading ahead of the agriculture 
departments monthly cold storage report 
the report showed 687 million pounds of bellies in cold storage 
as of dec 1 compared with 398 million pounds a month earlier and 
933 million pounds a year ago 
live cattle settled 15 cent to 48 cent lower with february at 
7745 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 43 cent lower 
with january at 8482 cents a pound hogs were 08 cent to 35 cent 
higher with february at 4925 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 57 cent lower to 15 cent higher with february at 4920 cents 
a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly lower on the 
chicago board of trade led by a drop in the soybean market that 
analysts attributed mainly to technical factors 
wheat futures settled cent to 3 cents lower with march at 
406 a bushel corn was unchanged to cent higher with march at 
239 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent lower with march

great northern nekoosa corp said 
wednesday in federal court that needed capital investments at its 
maine operations could not be made and that anticompetitive 
practices would result if georgiapacific corp is successful in 
its 38 billion takeover attempt 
the testimony came in the opening day of a hearing on great 
northerns request for an injunction to block the unfriendly 
takeover great northern claims antitrust laws would be violated if 
the two forest products companies merged 
us district judge warren w eginton set aside 14 days for the 
hearing 
the chairman of great northern william r laidig testified 
about the norwalkbased companys plans for 25 billion in capital 
investments and acquisitions in maine over the next five years 
laidig during questioning by the companys attorney said 
georgiapacific would be so laden with debt if it were successful 
in the takeover that it could not possibly carry out the capital 
plans 
the takeover would result in anticompetitive practices in 
southern pulpwood markets and in the national market for paper used 
in personal bank checks great northern also asserted 
georgiapacifics chief executive officer t marshall hahn 
said outside the courtroom that the projected cash flow after a 
merger of the two companies would be adequate even in a financial 
crisis to finance needed capital expenditures 
its an oldfashioned combination of two strong industrial 
companies hahn said calling great northerns claims 
transparent nonsense 
there is no junk debt involved he said 
great northern has calculated the resulting debt would total 
45 billion 
attorneys for atlantabased georgiapacific said a merger would 
increase efficiency 
as of friday 734 percent of great northern stockholders 
tendered their shares under georgiapacifics 63ashare offer 
stapleton said 
the takeover battle is also being waged in maine where great 
northern is incorporated georgiapacific is challenging 
antitakeover provisions in great northerns bylaws as well as 
maines corporate takeover law which forces hostile suitors to 
wait five years before merging with a targeted company

a federal judge in chevron corps suit 
over pennzoil cos alleged clandestine takeover attempt lifted 
restrictions wednesday on pennzoils ability to file countersuits 
in other courts 
us district judge thelton henderson refused to extend an order 
imposed by another federal judge dec 7 that prohibited pennzoil 
from suing anywhere on related issues without approval of the san 
francisco federal court 
henderson noted that pennzoil had denied any intention of suing 
said chevrons claims to the contrary were based on speculation 
and added that the local court had the power to prevent 
inconsistent rulings even if other suits were filed elsewhere 
the decision was a skirmish in chevrons battle to force 
pennzoil to sell its newly acquired 21 billion 88 percent share 
of chevrons stock and prohibit it from buying more stock without 
court approval 
san franciscobased chevron also is seeking to validate the 
antitakeover measures its directors took around the time of the 
disclosure of pennzoils purchases three weeks ago 
pennzoil based in houston said it was using 21 billion of 
its 26 billion net proceeds from a settlement of its suit with 
texaco as a longterm investment in chevron for tax purposes 
pennzoil said it might invest the other 500 million in chevron 
stock but denied any intention of a takeover of the nations 
fourthlargest oil company 
but chevron citing pennzoils past attempts to acquire oil 
property contended the rival firm intended a hostile merger or a 
forced restructuring 
chevrons suit accuses pennzoil of violating federal laws 
requiring advance notice and a 30day waiting period before major 
stock purchases by anyone but a passive longterm investor 
pennzoil saying chevrons suit is based on unfounded 
suspicions has asked henderson to dismiss the case a ruling is 
pending 
wednesdays decision involved an order chevron obtained dec 7 
from chief us district judge william ingram forbidding suits by 
pennzoil without approval from the local court 
chevron said pennzoil would inevitably sue to challenge the 
restrictions on takeovers and argued that restrictions were needed 
to avoid inconsistent decisions

hilton hotels corp stock plunged 
wednesday on a report that offers for the hotelcasino company are 
in the 90 range instead of the 120 some analysts had believed 
hilton would fetch 
hilton which was put up for sale last summer after the 
settlement of a dispute over the estate of founder conrad hilton 
fell 687 to close at 8287 a share on the new york stock 
exchange 
the wall street journal reported that jmb realty corp a 
chicagobased pension fund manager had offered about 90 a share 
for hilton which would bring the total offer to 43 billion 
hilton general counsel william lebo declined to comment on the 
report 
another of the bidders for hilton is millerklutznickdavisgray 
co billionaire investor marvin davis denverbased real estate 
vehicle the journal reported that millerklutznick was bidding 
about the market price for the stock which was about 90 before 
the journal report wednesday 
calls to millerklutznick and jmb were not returned 
hilton stock was trading at 63 per share when conrad hiltons 
son barron hilton settled the estate dispute in may 
in august hilton stock soared to 112 a share on reports that 
the company would consider at least two formal buyout bids at that 
time some analysts were estimating that shareholders were likely 
to get 120 per share if hilton was sold and possibly as much as 
140 
but the collapse of the junk bond market and fears of a 
recession have made it much harder to complete takeovers recently 
and the stock price has gradually fallen as no deal was announced 
hilton had its best year ever in 1987 when profits rose 43 
percent and earnings were 559 per share earnings fell to 272 
per share last year and have remained relatively flat this year 
rising 2 percent in the julyseptember quarter to 281 million or 
57 cents a share
