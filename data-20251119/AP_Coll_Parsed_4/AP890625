environmentalists and loggers are considering 
a proposal that would protect woods where the rare spotted owl lives 
but guarantee the timber industry could resume logging in other 
areas of the pacific northwest 
the proposal was made after a daylong meeting saturday attended 
by environmentalists timber industry representatives oregons 
congressional delegation and gov neil goldschmidt 
sen mark hatfield rore said at the beginning of the session 
that federal courts have blocked the harvest of 12 billion board 
feet of timber scheduled for harvest in oregon this year 
representing 28 percent of the annual harvest from federal lands in 
the state 
the courts have put off limits nearly a third of the federal 
lands usually open for logging in oregon and washington in response 
to lawsuits filed by environmentalists to save oldgrowth forests as 
spotted owl habitat 
the timber industry has estimated that 20000 jobs could be lost 
in oregon by 1991 if federal court injunctions restricting timber 
supply remain in force 
estimated to number fewer than 6000 in the northwest the 
spotted owl hunts and nests almost exclusively in oldgrowth forests 
that produce the logs most prized by the timber industry the bird 
also has been proposed as a threatened species by the us fish and 
wildlife service 
the proposal would guarantee the timber industry 8 billion board 
feet of timber from national forests in oregon and 1 billion board 
feet from bureau of land management forests over the next 15 months 
in return environmentalists would get legislation preserving 
significant oldgrowth stands and a commitment to adopt forest 
planning processes that minimize fragmentation of remaining stands 
once agreed to there would be no appeals of the type that have 
tied up timber on federal lands 
hatfield gave both sides until tuesday to decide whether to 
accept the proposal 
the meeting was the first time both sides in the 5yearold 
dispute have met 
i think what the delegation has done here is unprecedented 
said john hampton a timber company owner representing his industry 
at the summit i personally find the recommendation difficult to 
accept 
once again we find our industry asked to ramp down or reduce 
the timber base hampton said we never seem to ramp up 
thinking of the 90000 people who work in the timber industry 
i have to give it serious consideration he said 
art johnson a lawyer representing environmentalists at the 
meeting was even less encouraging 
there are a number of plaintiffs in the lawsuit he said 
we will respond as quickly as we can 
johnson repeated his suggestion to go to mediation to achieve 
agreement in the forest management dispute

the interior department has come up with a 
specific dollar value for the thousands of birds mammals and other 
animals killed in the alaskan oil spill according to the washington 
post 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it is the first time the rules have ever been applied to a 
largescale disaster such as the march 24 spill caused when the 
tanker exxon valdez hit a reef in prince william sound the 
newspaper reported in its monday editions 
for example each of the furry seals was worth 15 seagulls were 
worth 788 and canadian geese were worth 3574 each the 
newspaper reported striped bass were valued at 184 per pound 
the figures were developed from a computer model which is 
supposed to reflect the market value of the wildlife the post 
reported similar computer models will be used to determine a market 
value for the wildlife killed in three weekend oil spills in the 
waters off the continental united states the newspaper said 
the bill will eventually be sent to exxon owner of the tanker 
that spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil 
the damage assessment procedures have come under fire from 
environmentalists who argue that the rules dont account for the 
longterm damage to the environment the newspaper said 
thus far the oil has washed up on 728 miles of beaches and the 
dead wildlife count stands at 25700 migratory birds 800 sea 
otters 84 bald eagles and 20 harbor seals the post said 
but at this point it isnt yet even clear who will pay for the 
damage assessment the post said that is expected to take up to 
five years and cost 100 million but exxon has paid 15 million

nuclear regulatory commission inspectors 
told three seabrook nuclear plant employees they should shut the 
reactor down before a plant operator belatedly responded nrc 
officials said 
but noel dudley who was present as senior nrc inspector at the 
plant denied previous allegations that nrc officials had to grab 
anyone to get a response as one prominent seabrook critic alleged 
us rep edward markey dmass said friday that he was told by 
commission officials including chairman lando zech that an nrc 
official grabbed a plant operator prior to thursdays unplanned 
shutdown 
the boston sunday globe reported details of the shutdown based on 
interviews with dudley plant officials and others the shutdown on 
the 10th day of lowpower tests at the 6 billion plant prompted 
the nrc to suspend further tests pending a thorough review 
plant officials said thursdays events began when a 
malfunctioning valve on the nonnuclear side of the plant produced 
changes in readouts from a component called a pressurizer on the 
nuclear side under plant procedures the change was sufficient to 
warrant a shutdown spokesman ron sher said sunday 
one nrc inspector and then dudley approached three different 
plant officials pointing out the problem but got no immediate 
results the globe said minutes later an operator did shut down 
the plant 
they were making a conscious decision to attempt to regain 
pressure control even though plant procedures called for a 
shutdown dudley said 
sher said the operator in charge chose to continue to monitor 
plant conditions because they were returning to the test condition 
several minutes later the operator recognized that the plant 
condition was still not within the parameters of the test procedure 
and then he shut the plant down 
the globe said an unidentified nrc inspector first approached 
seabrooks startup manager about the pressure reading when the 
manager did not respond the nrc inspector approached the test 
director who was closer to the scene in the control room and the 
director agreed the plant should be shut the paper said 
but the test director then talked to the shift supervisor a 
higherranking official who said that pressure was correcting on 
its own and that there was no need to turn off the plant the 
paper said 
dudley stepped in at that point approaching a still higher 
seabrook official the assistant operators manager the assistant 
manager consulted the operations manager who acknowledged the 
information and deferred to the decision of the shift supervisor to 
continue to operate nrc spokesman steve horwitz told the paper 
spokesmen have said neither the plant nor the public was 
endangered 
a decade behind schedule and 10 times over budget the bitterly 
contested plant won permission to conduct lowpower tests earlier 
this month delayed by one malfunction the tests began june 13 and 
had been running smoothly until the shutdown

the coast guard on sunday slashed its 
estimate of the amount of oil spilled at the mouth of narragansett 
bay by more than 1 million gallons to 420000 gallons 
a wind shift blew much of the oil away from shore but a 
shellfishing ban remained in effect and beaches were closed again 
officials said they did not believe alcohol or drugs were 
involved in fridays spill but acknowledged that an initial test on 
two crew members was mishandled 
elsewhere oil was found on beaches in three states along the 
delaware river where a tanker carrying 18 million gallons of 
industrial heating oil leaked after running aground saturday the 
ship was refloated early sunday 
it was reported earlier that 800000 gallons had leaked from the 
ship but officials said that figure covered unaccountedfor oil and 
included oil still aboard the vessel 
in texas cleanup continued on the houston ship channel in 
galveston bay where about 250000 gallons of heavy crude oil 
spilled after a barge collision officials said the weather and 
currents had pushed most of it into a separate channel where it 
would be easier to clean up 
coast guard lt alan brown said the latest estimate for the rhode 
island spill from the world prodigy was estimated at 420000 
gallons earlier sunday it was estimated at 500000 to 600000 
gallons down from estimates of up to 16 million gallons made 
shortly after the greeklicensed tanker hit brenton reef on friday 
the 16 million was the most we could have potentially spilled 
if all the oil leaked from all the tanks that were holed brown 
said good amount of the product that was in those tanks did not 
leak out 
crews worked overnight to pump the ships remaining 6 millions 
gallons into barges brown said the unloading probably would take 
until monday 
alan mckin president of the cleanup company clean harbors 
worked with the world prodigys 28 crew members during the unloading 
theyre very sad about whats happened and show an awful lot of 
remorse particularly the first mate whos been working with us 
unloading the tanks mckin said he just keeps talking about 
it 
the wind shifted overnight and most of the oil was being blown 
out to sea instead of onto the states southwestern beaches and 
those beaches were reopened to swimming they were closed again 
however when the tide turned late in the day 
despite the offshore wind the coast guard reported that a sheen 
had been seen as far up the bay as east greenwich about 20 miles 
away but brown said the sheen was the lightest concentration of 
oil and not necessarily an environmental threat 
closer to newport however the damage was plain in brenton cove 
in newport harbor yellow muck had begun accumulating on the shore 
and cleanup crews used a vacuum truck booms and hundreds of 
absorbent pads 
about 200 national guardsmen 120 state prison inmates and some 
200 volunteers fought the oil save the bay an environmental group 
that coordinated the volunteers reported at least 800 telephone 
calls from people wishing to help by midafternoon authorities had 
begun to withdraw the guard and the volunteers 
thomas walsh a lawyer for ballard shipping the tankers owner 
said the company registered in liberia with operations in greece 
will pay the cost of the cleanup 
a statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect and finfishing 
and lobstering were discouraged said roger greene of the state 
department of environmental management 
biologists said oil on the surface posed the greatest threat to 
fish and lobster eggs and newly hatched offspring while adult fish 
and lobsters could swim beneath the contamination greene said 
shellfish were at greatest risk because poisons become concentrated 
in their bodies as they pump water through themselves to feed 
greene said two oilsoaked cormorants and a gull had been 
spotted and robert l bendick jr director of the state department 
of environmental management said a number of small lobsters had 
been found dead along with several birds two loons that were 
discovered coated with oil were cleaned and released he said 
coast guard officials said the results of drug tests on the 
ships captain iakovis georgudis and mate whose name was not 
immediately available would not be available until late sunday or 
monday 
petty officer ellen harrington of the coast guard district office 
in boston said the original urine sample was mishandled reportedly 
through improper refrigeration and a second sample had to be taken 
19 hours after the accident but harrington said the captain and 
mate had volunteered for the tests and investigators did not believe 
drugs or alcohol played any role in the accident 
state attorney general james e oneil said he hoped to learn if 
georgudis violated state law by approaching too near the bay without 
a pilot 
coast guard capt eric williams of the marine safety office said 
the ship was just outside the pilot zone but gov edward diprete 
said georgudis admitted his failure to wait for a pilot was a 
mistake as was a course correction that sent the ship headed for 
rocks 
on the delaware river near wilmington del the uruguayan tanker 
presidente rivera carrying 18 million gallons of industrial heating 
oil that ran aground saturday was taken to a refinery sunday and 
unloaded 
coast guard patrols found beach contamination ranging from 
heavy to light from chester pa to new castle del there was 
also some contamination on the new jersey side 
the philadelphia inquirer reported sunday that the tanker was 
having mechanical difficulties when it ran aground it didnt look 
like a navigational problem paul ives president of the delaware 
bay and river pilots association told the newspaper 
in texas coast guard chief mark kennedy said much of the oil 
spilled in the houston ship channel ended up in intersecting bayport 
channel 
because of the weather we couldnt get much booms deployed to 
direct more oil into the channel but much of it is naturally 
heading into the channel anyway he said the confinement of the 
smaller channel will make cleanup easier he said 
officials said environmental damage appeared minimal and that 
most oil that washed ashore affected industrial property 
theres no telling how long any cleanup will take but i can 
tell you this one will take less time than most others said coast 
guard petty officer bob morehead 
of the 6000 barrels spilled from the ruptured barge about 4000 
barrels had been contained in the bayport channel about 1000 
barrels already had been sucked from the channel by midday sunday 
morehead said

the defense minister told a military tribunal 
sunday that a decorated war hero charged with aiding the worlds 
most notorious cocaine ring gave cuba a stab in the back 
gen raul castro brother of president fidel castro spoke during 
the presentation of charges against division gen arnaldo ochoa 
sanchez at the first session of a tribunal of honor hearing the case 
ochoa is alleged to have had a threeyear involvement with 
colombias medellin drug cartel 
but in his speech gen castro said ochoa also was involved in 
the smuggling of ivory and diamonds a new revelation in the 
biggest scandal to rock cuban power circles in 30 years of communist 
rule 
ochoas actions represent an outrage a stab in the back to the 
fatherland and a slap in the face he said 
the 47member military tribunal of topranking officers met 
behind closed doors at the revolutionary armed forces headuarters in 
downtown havana all day the session was to resume monday 
a 40minute videotape of the hearing including gen castros 
entire speech took up most of the 8 pm news program on staterun 
television a newscaster said eight witnesses all military 
officers also testified at the hearing 
gen castro told the court that ochoa should receive punishment 
that sets an example because he was such a highly regarded officer 
authorities say ochoa was the ringleader of officers who let 
cocaine smugglers use cuban military air bases and arranged for 
drugladen boats to be escorted through cubas territorial waters 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the tribunal will decide if the general is to be stripped of 
his rank and ordered to stand trial 
on june 2 gen castro talked to ochoa alone about the accusation 
he smuggled ivory and diamonds the defense minister said he gave 
no further details about the accusations 
i hugged him and said that no matter what may happen today 
tomorrow and always we the military would be his brothers gen 
castro said 
it was later according to informaton that has appeared in the 
official newspaper granma that ochoas connections to drug 
trafficking and the medellin cartel came to light 
during gen castros speech ochoa did not once look up and 
appeared at times as if he were about to break down he sat with his 
head bowed and a tense look on his face 
among the officers on the honor tribunal are four division 
generals 31 brigadier generals a vice admiral and rear admrial 
ochoa 57 is a veteran of the cuban revolution who was decorated 
for his service as a field commander of cuban troops in angola he 
is one of only five officers ever awarded the medal of the hero of 
the republic of cuba 
he was admired lt col fidencio frias figueredo a veteran 
of the angolan conflict told radio rebelde on sunday in one a 
series of interviews on the drug scandal with soldiers and officers 
they should apply the maximum penalty frias said he has 
betrayed the principles of the revolution he has betrayed the 
revolutionary armed forces and especially he has betrayed our 
maximum leader fidel castro 
frias who returned from his second tour of duty in angola on 
june 9 said many of his comrades in arms shared his anger 
ochoas attitude makes our officers indignant he said 
along with the indignation came the realization that not even 
isolated cuba is beyond the reach of the medellin cartel 
the amount of money that they control could turn anybodys 
head these people talk about 4 million like it was nothing said 
a foreign ministry official who asked not to be named 
there were reports that us officials wanted to talk to ochoa 
the ministry official did not rule out the possibility 
these things are from top level to top level the ministry 
official said this sort of thing has been done before 
he would not elaborate 
us prosecutors say the names of some of the cuban officers 
surfaced in a 1987 probe of a smuggling ring that culminated in two 
indictments and a 1988 trial 
in addition to ochoa cuban authorities have arrested a brigadier 
general two colonels a lieutenant colonel a captain and a major 
us authorities say an undercover agent flew into cubas 
varadero air base in 1987 escorted by cuban migs and used cuban 
military frequencies 
granma the official newspaper of the cuban communist party has 
said that us allegations about cuba being a way station for 
cocaine traffickers prompted castro to order the investigation that 
led to the arrest of ochoa and the other officers

scandal for the agency which is the target of congressional 
investigations involving allegations of influence peddling in hud

making mortgage loans to federallybacked housing programs but hud 
assumes most of the losses if a project defaults the program is 
designed to encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of 
moderately priced housing

the program the post reported in its monday editions after a 
recent review by the hud inspector general found mismanagement and 
alleged fraud in the program almost 700 million worth of mortgages

the coast guard on sunday cut its estimate 
of an oil spill from the tanker world prodigy in rhode island sound 
by twothirds 
meanwhile a tanker that spilled an estimated 800000 gallons in 
the delaware river on saturday near wilmington del was floated 
early sunday patrols working overnight found beach contamination 
from the spill 
lt alan brown of the coast guard said the rhode island spill was 
now estimated at 500000 to 600000 gallons far below initial 
estimates of up to 16 million gallons the spill occurred friday 
after the tanker hit brenton reef at the mouth of narragansett bay 
the 16 million was the most we could have potentially spilled 
if all the oil leaked from all the tanks that were holed brown 
said a good amount of the product that was in those tanks did not 
leak out 
a helicopter inspection of the area sunday morning showed less 
beach damage than officials had feared the wind shifted overnight 
and most of the oil was being blown out to sea instead of onto the 
states southwestern beaches said gary ott of the national 
oceanographic and atmospheric administration 
the oil remaining in the tanks was being held in place by the 
water that rushed in through the holes in the ships bottom brown 
said crews worked overnight on the delicate task of pumping oil 
onto barges 
the coast guard reported early sunday that a sheen of oil from 
the world prodigy had been seen as far up the bay as east greenwich 
about 20 miles 
in the delaware river spill coast guard patrols worked through 
the night and found shoreline contamination ranging from heavy to 
light from chester pa to new castle del there is also some 
contamination on the new jersey side 
in a third oil spill about 250000 gallons of heavy crude oil

communist hardliners who purged party chief zhao 
ziyang appear to have skirted drastic measures that could have 
further split the party and alienated the nation 
their announcement of his replacement on saturday also indicated 
that though hardline conservatives now dominate the economic 
reforms championed by zhao and other moderates will not be abandoned 
zhaos own fate remains unclear but he may have escaped the 
worstcase scenario of a public trial 
although he was accused of backing student protesters and sowing 
discord in party ranks 69yearold zhao was apparently allowed to 
keep his party membership and was not branded a 
counterrevolutionary that is how party leaders are now labeling 
the prodemocracy activists whose movement led to zhaos downfall 
in addition in announcing his replacement by shanghai party 
leader jiang zemin party leaders made no mention of criminal 
charges against zhao 
zhao is believed to have been stripped of power after he opposed 
a decision by premier li peng and senior leader deng xiaoping to 
declare martial law in beijing and bring in troops to put down the 
student movement 
however the party central committee in announcing zhaos 
ouster acknowledged his contributions to the nations opendoor 
policy and economic reforms during nine years as premier and then 
party general secretary 
zhao has won popularity among chinese students and intellectuals 
for stressing that political reforms such as greater popular 
participation in public affairs must accompany the marketoriented 
economic reforms that china has pursued over the past decade 
like the late hu yaobang zhaos predecessor who was purged 
after smaller student demonstrations two years ago zhao was 
accused of a passive approach toward bourgeois 
liberalization or favoring western ideals 
in consolidating their control hardline party leaders cleaned 
house elsewhere over the weekend they removed moderate hu qili from 
the powerful standing committee of the ruling politburo and they 
ousted two zhao allies from the secretariat the partys 
administrative office 
however they did not accuse them of specific wrongdoings 
more zhao followers are bound to lose their positions as the 
hardliners weed out lowerranking moderates in coming weeks 
however such purges could be less sweeping than many have feared 
in addition it appears that chinas economic reforms and 
interest in foreign investment are safe 
jiang represents chinas new echelon of leaders who are 
welleducated sophisticated in world affairs and believers in the 
idea that china must maintain its opendoor policy to achieve 
prosperity 
the other two new members of the politburo standing committee 
tianjin mayor li ruihuan and economist song ping are also regarded 
as firm supporters of keeping china open to the world 
over the weekend party leaders in a communique outlined four 
important tasks 
the first task is to quell the counterrevolutionary 
rebellion it said

awaiting the supreme courts decision in a 
missouri abortion dispute is no lonely vigil 
never it seems have so many waited so anxiously or made such a 
public display of their anxiety 
the potential stakes are enormous the court is being asked to 
use the missouri case called webster vs reproductive health 
services to reverse or substantially limit its 1973 decision that 
women have a constitutional right to abortion 
such a ruling could allow states to outlaw abortion or otherwise 
curtail legal abortions which number 15 million each year 
with time running out on the courts 198889 term partisan 
lawyers gather in the hushed courtroom each day before the 10 am 
starting time to catch the first word interest groups make known 
their availability to supply instant reactions scores of reporters 
jam the courtroom press row and the courts public information 
office a floor below satellite transmission trucks are parked 
nearby 
each day the word passes quickly no webster today 
meanwhile rumors rise and then crash to earth 
at least one such erroneous rumor got into print after arkansas 
attorney general steve clark went public with the scuttlebutt 
out of washington that the decision would be announced june 19 
weve never been through anything quite like this says court 
spokeswoman toni house hectic she offers as a oneword summary 
the most senior reporter covering the court lyle denniston of 
the baltimore sun says the anticipation is rivaled only by that 
experienced before the 1976 decisions reinstating capital punishment 
and the 1978 ruling in which the court first condoned the concept of 
affirmative action 
here you have the court contemplating taking away a 
constitutional right it created itself the fact that is a real 
prospect now has captured everyones attention he said 
only two decision days remain on the courts schedule 
monday and thursday 
on the day the abortion ruling is announced the national 
abortion rights action league will conduct an 1130 am news 
conference to give its appraisal of the webster decision 
planned parenthood will host a similar affair at noon the 
congress prolife leadership and national right to life committee at 
130 the american life league at 2 the list goes on 
a special edition of washington week in review is planned for 
public television 
many such organizations for weeks have sent representatives to 
the court to harvest each days decision crop a recent days 
singlefile line stretched past 100 
messengers for the american civil liberties union the american 
bar association the national organization for women the american 
life lobby congressional subcommittees and even one representing 
columnist george will share a peaceful coexistence 
the abortion dispute officially has become the most closely 
watched case of the 1980s a record number 78 of 
friendofthecourt briefs was filed by individuals and 
organizations not part of the missouri litigation 
in a less formal and likely less effective form of lobbying 
hundreds of thousands of americans wrote and telephoned the court to 
express their views 
in the weeks leading up to the april 26 argument session 
conducted for the case more than 20000 letters addressed to the 
justices arrived daily the courts two switchboards were so flooded 
with calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated

a young british soldier accused 
of killing an unarmed civilian at a border checkpoint has returned 
to duty after being fined by the military the british army said 
sunday 
pvt david jonathan holden was 18 when aiden mcanespie was shot 
in the back in february 1988 as he walked past a british army 
checkpoint near aughnacloy half a mile from the border of northern 
ireland and the republic of ireland 
mcanespie 23 was a worker for sinn fein the legal political 
wing of the outlawed irish republican army which is fighting to 
drive the british out of the province the british army said a heavy 
machine gun slipped in holdens wet hands after it had been cleaned 
and went off by accident 
an investigation by the royal ulster constabulary northern 
irelands police force concluded one of the three shots fired from 
the gun bounced off the road and struck mcanespie in the back 
but roman catholic leaders in the predominantly protestant 
province said mcanespie had been regularly harassed by the army 
holden was charged with manslaughter but the charge was dropped 
in september for what the prosecuting lawyer said was a lack of 
evidence 
a military inquiry has since decided to fine holden and return 
him to his regiment and full duty said an army spokesman speaking 
anonymously in keeping with british custom 
he would not say how large the fine was he said holden had been 
held in civilian and military custody for six months while the case 
was being decided 
the irish government launched a separate police investigation 
into the shooting saying a member of the irish security forces saw 
the incident from across the border the result of the investigation 
was never made public 
seamus mallon deputy leader of the social democratic and labor 
party the main roman catholic party in northern ireland criticized 
the way the investigations were handled 
he said he was surprised that the army can find evidence to 
discipline him through a fine but that this evidence was not made 
available to the director of public prosecutions in relation to the 
manslaughter charge 
also sunday the outlawed ulster freedom fighters claimed 
responsibility for the fatal shooting of a roman catholic bartender 
in the city of lisburn 
the protestant paramilitary group made its claim in a statement 
to belfast news media 
police said at least three men took part in the attack saturday 
on liam mckee 36 smashing down the front door of his house with 
sledgehammers and shooting him through a bedroom door as he 
struggled to keep them out 
mckees mother and brother were in the house southwest of belfast 
at the time but were not injured the royal ulster constabulary said 
more than 2700 people have been killed in 20 years of political 
and sectarian violence in northern ireland

at dawn each day two afghans haul two 
bags of hardboiled eggs sheep and calves liver nine miles to a 
kabul suburb 
basir amiri and ismail kazami are responsible for feeding 80000 
danish rainbow trout being bred in a swimming pool and eight canals 
in a former tourist resort 
the complex was closed a decade ago when moslem guerrillas 
launched their campaign to overthrow the prosoviet government 
the war not only has left 13 million people dead and forced at 
least 5 million into exile but also has created food shortages 
animal breeding has nearly come to a standstill poultry farms have 
closed and fields of many farms have been barren for years 
the fishbreeding project is one of several projects backed by 
the united nations in afghanistan the government took over the 
resort and last year turned over parts of it to the ministry of 
agriculture 
it is a humble effort we are trying to utilize whatever 
facilities we have to provide more protein to the afghans said 
hari dewan chief of the un food and agriculture organization 
which oversees the breeding project 
the afghans are basically redmeat eaters but we are trying to 
tell them to eat fish if and when available dewan said 
in march 1988 the fao flew 200000 frozen fish eggs from denmark 
within 36 hours hatched them in indoor wooden troughs at the resort 
and transferred them to the canals that are fed by nearby kargah 
lake eighty thousand have survived 
the trout were doing very well but soon there was a problem of 
space dewan said we asked the government to give us the unused 
swimming pool 
there are now about 50000 trout in the pool 
the afghans love meat and all main dishes are supposed to have a 
large portion even though meat is available in kabul home of 225 
million people the price is often too steep for most 
the government has frozen the price of nan the flat bread that 
is the main staple of the afghan diet at about six afghanis 10 
cents at the official exchange rate 
but the price of mutton has risen about 40 percent this year a 
pound of mutton costs about 670 an unskilled laborer in 
afghanistan earns about 60 a month 
now afghans hardly get meat to eat it is very expensive 
said syed ahmed who runs a downtown restaurant 
i feel bad to ask my brothers afghans for a high price so i 
sell only a very limited amount he said 
dewan said 16 tons of rainbow trout will hit the market in a 
couple of weeks 
it will be a test case we will follow up the project depending 
on the success and response he said 
according to a un report on afghanistan most afghans are 
malnourished the average life expectancy is 41 years and the 
infant mortality rate is 200 per 1000 children 
if the project is successful it will be good news dewan 
said

china moved sunday to justify the ouster of the 
head of the communist party and reinforce the supremacy of the party 
in the face of counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the communist party is the party to fight for the interests of 
the people the official peoples daily said in an editorial one 
day after party general secretary zhao ziyang was purged for 
supporting the turmoil of prodemocracy protests 
the party decided on a series of resolute measures and finally 
was victorious in the struggle the daily said 
the party central committee on saturday announced the dismissal 
of zhao and fellow moderate hu qili from their party posts and 
appointed shanghai party boss jiang zemin the new head of the 
47millionmember party 
jiang 62 is expected to follow the party line of promoting 
chinas economic relations with the world while dealing harshly with 
political dissent at home 
the national media now firmly controlled by hardliners offered 
a drumbeat of support sunday for the central committees decisions 
the nightly television news expanded from 30 minutes to an hour 
was filled with statements from chinese supporting zhaos dismissal 
zhao 69 was reportedly forced from power by senior leader deng 
xiaoping and premier li peng after opposing their decision to impose 
martial law on beijing and use arms to crush the student 
prodemocracy movement 
i previously didnt understand zhao ziyang said one of about 
a dozen citizens interviewed on television all who supported the 
party policy now i understand the party is right 
television also showed soldiers factory workers teachers coal 
miners and party officials from around the country talking about the 
party meeting and nodding their assent to its stance on what it 
calls a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
about 1800 people have been reported arrested since the june 34 
military crackdown in beijing the crackdown of the 7weekold 
movement prompted protests in more than a dozen cities 
the state has demanded all student and worker activists turn 
themselves in and it has detained or questioned hundreds of 
journalists academics professionals and government workers who 
supported the drive for a freer china 
there has been speculation that zhao who has not been seen in 
public since may 19 would be put on trial for counterrevolutionary 
activities 
jiang the new general secretary worked actively to open 
shanghai to foreign investment and rebuild its industrial base in 
four years as mayor and party chief he was also regarded as being a 
hardliner on dissent and moved swiftly to arrest those who joined 
in disturbances in chinas largest city 
while jiang remained quiet the official media continued to urge 
all chinese to learn from a june 9 speech by deng 
the 84yearold deng in the speech to military commanders 
blamed counterrevolutionary agitators for taking advantage of the 
student unrest to try to overthrow the communist party he praised 
the army for crushing the rebellion

with no public announcement nasas director of 
flight crew operations a year ago issued the first written order 
prohibiting astronautsintraining from taking part in risky 
recreational activities 
high risk recreational activities are defined as those where 
there exists exposure of major or even fatal injury donald r 
puddy said in the order examples include but are not limited to 
auto boat airplane or motorcycle racing parachute jumping and 
snow skiing 
astronauts especially the early ones who had been fighter jocks 
often had boisterous habits that worried nasa which wanted to keep 
its highfliers safe until they could risk their necks officially 
last weekend astronaut s david griggs scheduled to be the 
pilot on a shuttle mission in november crashed and was killed in 
arkansas while practicing stunt flying for an air show he was doing 
wingover maneuvers in a vintage world war ii singleengine 
propeller plane 
the investigation into the accident is not complete and nasa has 
not determined whether griggs activities violated the rules puddy 
said friday a replacement for griggs who was just beginning his 
training for the flight will be named next week 
essentially the policy put in place in june 1988 is generally 
worded said jeff carr a spokesman for the johnson space center 
in texas it doesnt say thou shalt not do this and this it 
doesnt mention anything as specific as aerobatic flying or stunt 
flying it says hey guys use your head dont do something that 
could expose you to injury or death 
william klassen regional director of the national transportation 
safety board in kansas city said of the griggs incident we have 
no evidence of engine problems or problems with the aircraft he was 
in the process of performing aerobatics and the aircraft was 
observed flying over the runway at an altitude of 75 to 100 feet 
above ground level 
griggs was the latest in a long line of astronauts whose appetite 
for life in the fast lane extended beyond their duty hours 
gordon cooper one of the mercury seven astronauts had a 
disconcerting fondness for racing fast cars and was about to make 
his professional driving debut at the daytona international speedway 
in february 1969 when nasa ordered him to cancel 
the people in flight crew operations felt it would be better if 
cooper didnt take any risk such as auto racing especially since he 
is part of the backup crew for the important apollo 10 mission 
scheduled to orbit the moon in may the official announcement said 
they waited until the last minute to shut me off and i dont 
appreciate it said cooper he never flew in space again 
astronauts often were in the news for their various sports 
injuries james lovell a fourtime space flyer in the gemini and 
apollo programs fractured his arm and shoulder while skiing in 
kitzbuehl austria and walter cunningham of apollo 7 suffered a 
compression fracture of the vertebrae in his neck while using a 
trampoline 
the daredevil cavorting of the early astronauts was chronicled in 
the right stuff by tom wolfe in 1979 but even the publicity 
attending wolfes account failed to shame or tame the astronaut 
corps 
i can remember discussions about what was restricted and what 
wasnt but i think all those things were unwritten rules said 
alan bean who walked on the moon on apollo 12 then spent 59 days 
in skylab people were aware they should try to minimize risks 
really we got more people injured playing softball than anything 
else 
in fact puddys order cautions against nominal risk 
recreational activities where there exists exposure to injury 
included organized competitive softball basketball volleyball 
or racquetball astronauts are prohibited from taking part in those 
beginning eight months prior to launch 
puddy said he issued the order when he was new on the job so 
there would be no ambiguity to his knowledge puddy said the 
norisk rules were never written before 
brian duff former head of nasas division of public affairs 
remembers accompanying neil armstrong on a publicity tour to latin 
america long before armstrong was picked to be the first man on the 
moon 
one morning in peru he heard someone offer armstrong a chance 
to go soaring in the andes i had to sit down and ask myself 
should i let him do it duff recalls i figured he would 
probably do it anyway so i deliberately made sure i wasnt around 
when he was picked up 
astronauts didnt need to go off the reservation to do dangerous 
things preparing for the apollo 11 moon flight armstrong was 
rehearsing the descent to the moon when the simulator known as 
the flying bedstead tipped over and crashed to the ground 
the space fliers fondness for living dangerously extended to 
their children as well duff recalls that the children of pete 
conrad the commander of apollo 12 used to ride their bicycles off 
the roof of their house in texas into the swimming pool below 
griggs was the 17th astronaut to die since the manned space 
program began twelve died in the line of duty one in an auto 
accident two in private aircraft crashes one of cancer after 
leaving the space program and one of a heart attack 
the list includes the five nasa astronauts in the challenger 
explosion of 1986 but not nonnasa payload specialists gregory 
jarvis and christa mcauliffe 
just eight days before the apollo 14 moon flight in 1971 backup 
flight commander eugene a cernan survived a fiery helicopter crash 
in the indian river south of cape canaveral fla and had to swim 
for his life reports circulated but were never in the public 
record that he had been chasing a manatee a large aquatic mammal 
and got too close to the water an investigating board said cernan 
exercised misjudgment in estimating altitude 
fred haise one of the astronauts on apollo 13 which was 
crippled by an explosion on the way to the moon in 1970 crashed in 
1973 while trying to land a world war ii training plane at 
galveston texas he was critically burned 
the bt13 airplane was owned by the confederate air force an 
organization of airplane buffs to which other astronauts 
including moonwalker donald k slayton belonged 
slayton who once headed the astronaut office said he had to 
warn cooper and charles conrad about their auto racing activities 
i called them and said you guys ought not to be doing that 
youve got too much at risk 
but bill odonnell a retired nasa public affairs officer said 
he recalled rumors at the time that the two astronauts continued 
their racing under assumed names

deng xiaoping is approaching his 85th birthday in 
a role he once spurned as a largerthanlife sage in the image of 
mao tsetung 
learn from the words of comrade deng is the exhortation being 
heard around the country factory workers schoolchildren railroad 
attendants soldiers and artists are studying his statements and 
according to official reports are enlightened by his thoughts 
china has just purged the head of the ruling communist party 
zhao ziyang and elevated shanghai party boss jiang zemin to what 
ostensibly is the most powerful job in the land 
one day after his promotion jiang had yet to make a public 
statement it was still deng his picture next to or above that of 
jiangs on the front page of dailies who was the fount of wisdom 
deng who turns 85 on aug 22 has been chinas senior or 
paramount leader for a decade but it has only been in the past 
several weeks as he rallied the party behind his decision to use 
arms to quell prodemocracy demonstrators that he has approached 
being a cult figure 
the focus is a speech he delivered to military commanders june 9 
his last public appearance in which he said students involved in 
the protests were manipulated by counterrevolutionary forces 
trying to overthrow the party and the socialist system he praised 
the army for its victory over the rebellion 
deng also stressed that china must not retreat from its policies 
of economic reform and opening to the outside world but that 
greater ideological education is needed to show the people that this 
can only be done under the guidance of the communist party 
national television and radio have devoted much time every day to 
depicting groups avidly studying his words the reported response 
has bordered on adulation 
party members in northeastern liaoning province the local radio 
said praised deng for his brilliant analysis of the source and 
nature of this counterrevolutionary rebellion thus enabling us to 
understand the necessity complexity and long duration of this 
struggle 
in southern guangdong military officers read the speech with 
intense emotion soldiers in the northeastern province of jinan 
said dengs acute insight and great boldness of vision have a 
vital bearing on the life and death of the party and the country 
party members in guangxi southern china said deng is worthy of 
being the partys helmsman it is always comrade deng xiaoping who 
points the way to us at every critical moment 
use of words like helmsman go back to the days of mao 
tsetung when people sang sailing the seas depends on the 
helmsman the cult of mao reached nearhysteric stages in his 
final years when every home had its portrait or bust of mao people 
began each day reading from his red book of wisdom and young red 
guards wept at the sight of him 
deng was purged twice and suffered greatly under maos autocratic 
rule from 1949 until his death 1976 since rising to power in the 
late 1970s deng has eschewed the cult of personality there are no 
deng statues in china today no deng buttons on lapels 
he has tried to avoid subjecting the nation to a repeat of maos 
final years when a sick and senile helmsman was manipulated by 
court schemers deng has set an example for other aging 
revolutionaries by retiring from most of his official posts today 
his only public office is as chairman of the central military 
commission 
but with the nation in turmoil deng wittingly or not has 
allowed himself to be portrayed in near superhuman terms as a way of 
unifying the party and reviving the flagging support of the masses 
while much of the attention is centered on the june 9 speech the 
official dailies are also carrying frontpage excerpts of his past 
statements on sticking to the socialist road and battling 
bourgeois liberalization 
but general enthusiasm for the learn from deng campaign may 
be less than advertised 
one hotel worker said his work unit was called together at 830

coalition of the left and progress the thirdplace finisher to try 
to form a coalition new elections will be held if that party cant

previously unknown manuscript of a piano waltz written by 
19thcentury composer stephen collins foster 
the handwritten music for autumn waltz is signed with 
fosters name and dedicated to miss thalia bentel 
it is the first fresh composition by foster to surface in 60 
years according to dean root curator of the stephen foster 
memorial at the university of pittsburgh and its the first foster 
manuscript to go on the market in about 30 years 
manuscript dealer rosemary bufano of tuckahoe ny is asking 
225000 for the manuscript which she advertised in sundays 
pittsburgh press the sheet of music was found in a set of books 
from the estate of bentels heirs root verified it last year as 
fosters work 
root said autumn waltz is not distinguished and wont rival 
the pittsburghborn composers oh susannah and my old kentucky 
home 
its pleasant simple a little funny and a little quirky 
root said 
it sounds like a song youd hear at the ice skating rink very 
very cute bufano said its the kind of sweet little love hymn

hallmark 
after root verified the music for the rochester ny antique 
book dealer who owned it at the time the stephen foster memorial 
offered to buy the set of books but its offer was refused and root 
said he could not increase it because the memorial has no 
acquisition fund or endowment 
bufano wont say how much she paid for it she said she decided 
to begin her search for a buyer in pittsburgh because of fosters 
ties to the city 
foster is buried in allegheny cemetery in the citys 
lawrenceville section he died in 1864 at age 37 with only 38 cents 
in his pockets and no copyright protection or royalty rights for his 
heirs

several people who work for china in the united 
states say they have no plans to sever business ties with beijing 
although theyre unsure what the future will hold 
our professional relationship continues in effect said 
herbert hansell of jones day reavis and pogue a law firm 
headquartered in cleveland and hired by chinas embassy to do a 
range of legal and lobbying work in the nations capital 
like several others working for china hansell said there isnt 
all that much activity these days with the chinese government 
which is undergoing an internal shakeup in connection with a 
prodemocracy uprising eventually put down by the army 
although communist hardliners purged party chief zhao ziyang 
their selection of his replacement over the weekend indicated that 
the economic reforms championed by zhao and other moderates will not 
be abandoned 
it is that pattern of economic change over the past decade that 
has generated chinas need for considerable professional 
representation in the united states 
hansells law firm alone was paid roughly 38000 in the last six 
months of 1988 for work that included contacting american officials 
to express the prcs concerns and interests as well as to obtain 
information on issues such as family planning practices chinas 
sale of weapons to the middle east and the export of us satellites 
for launch according to justice department records 
the firm called or visited people at the state department and on 
capitol hill among others records show 
the departments latest filings show at least six law firms are 
registered as working for china the foreign agents registration act 
requires anyone engaging in political activities for or on behalf 
of foreign governments to disclose their the nature of the work 
and the amount they are paid 
at another law firm the recent upheaval has delayed plans to 
revive business said elliot richardson the former attorney general 
who works for milbank tweed hadley and mccloy 
we were not actively doing anything lately and the prospect of 
pursuing what we were doing has definitely been deferred 
richardson said noting his plans to attend a recent trade 
conference in beijing were scrapped 
last year milbank tweed advised china on trade relations with 
the united states and monitored the status of trade legislation in 
congress but the firm did not receive any money from china during 
the first six months of 1988 
michael daniels a lawyer with mudge rose guthrie alexander 
and ferdon said it would be premature to make any kind of 
decision about the firms relationship with chinas stateowned 
corporation that handles textile imports and exports 
we think the situation is extremely confused he said 
pointing to the bush administrations plea for patience in dealing 
with china daniels said his firm was in a holding pattern and would 
not cut ties with the chinese corporation 
sen robert c byrd dwva and other members of congress have 
urged president bush to take a tougher stand on china blocking 
trade and stopping new investments to protest human rights abuses 
bush has already suspended military sales to china and promised a 
sympathetic review of visa applications for chinese students who 
fear returning to their native land 
mudge rose which has represented the chinese corporation since 
1985 received about 35000 for its work the following year 
records show 
at laxalt washington perito and dubuc a law firm headed by 
former sen paul laxalt rnev the staff has performed minor work 
for air china which has permission to fly between chinese cities 
and new york los angeles san francisco seattle and chicago said 
carroll dubuc 
we do limited work for air china he said among other 
things the firm filed the necessary papers to change the airlines 
name from the civil aviation authority of china to air china the 
law firm reported getting paid 5341 on march 6 1989 
air china continues to fly between the united states and china 
according to jian min hhai in the airlines new york office 
the staff at garvey schubert and barer refused to discuss the 
firms work for the china ocean shipping co but us records said 
the firm performed legal work and monitored the federal maritime 
commissions rulemaking authority the firm was paid nearly 3000 
between september 1988 and january 1989 for the work 
several telephone calls to the press office at the chinese 
embassy to inquire about the governments relationship with us 
agents were not answered

military forces began preparing 
sunday for a major operation to quell an armed revolt on the 
northern island of bougainville the armed forces chief said 
joint forces commander col lima dotaona said troops would be 
deployed to restore order to bougainville where rebels have battled 
government forces for seven months and forced the closing of a large 
copper mine 
the rebels are led by a 35yearold surveyor francis ona who 
vowed last year to close the bougainville copper mine and demanded a 
referendum on seccession and nearly 10 billion in compensation for 
environmental damage allegedly caused by the mine 
if he decides to come out we are prepared to let him but it 
has to be on our terms said dotaona of ona our aim is simple 
we are going to restore law and order 
he said troops would begin moving into the bush monday morning to 
begin what was expected to be a protracted operation against the 
rebels 
its a dangerous operation and you can expect casualties he 
said once the security forces are in there if there is armed 
resistance they will respond in an appropriate manner 
in an address to the nation on radio and television friday prime 
minister rabbie namaliu said the government could not allow a 
criminal minority to threaten the unity and economic stability 
of the nation 
ona and his bougainville republican army closed the mine may 15 
and have since defied all attempts at conciliation repeatedly 
ambushing mine workers and soldiers sent to restore order 
prior to its closing the mine contributed 20 percent of papua 
new guineas total revenue 
three soldiers have died and about 20 other members of the 
security forces and numerous civilians have been wounded in the 
unrest 
tensions have been high on bougainville because local landowners 
objected to profits being made from the islands copper mine which 
ranks among the worlds 10 biggest opencut copper mines 
australias biggest mining company cra ltd jointly operates 
the mine which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland 
papua new guinea with a 35 million mainly melanesian 
population is just north of australia it gained independence from 
australia in 1975

christmas came to this eastern nebraska 
community six months early sunday at a church where worshipers 
celebrated with carols cookies and a pageant but no santa claus 
the rev craig schultz said trinity lutheran church decided to 
celebrate christmas again june 25 so that its true message could be 
heard without the distractions that usually accompany the holiday 
two trees with lights and garlands adorned the altar of the 
church about 30 miles northeast of omaha six wreaths with red 
velvet bows surrounded candles 
christmas is not only for christmastime its for all year 
round said clara druhe a longtime member of the nearly 
1800member congregation who described herself as past 70 
it should always be christmas in our hearts she said 
schultz said the service was a chance to focus on the birth of 
jesus christ the reason for christmas is a 365dayayear 
reason he said around dec 25 it gets caught up in the 
presents 
children dressed as shepherds reenacted the story of jesus 
birth in a pageant complete with a crying baby a choir led 
worshipers in the mostly filled 600seat church in songs such as 
joy to the world 
ellen lund said her family has been marking christmas on the 25th 
of each month with candles or music and was excited when the church 
decided to remember the holiday in midyear 
i think its so sad when we pack christmas up and put it away 
for a year said mrs lund 37 
in the church lobby her 5yearold daughter rachel and other 
children munched on cookies shaped like stars and bells 
katherine ruder said she thought the christmas message was more 
meaningful without all the hype of worrying about christmas gifts 
and decorations 
in his sermon schultz told worshipers he wanted them to remember 
more than the historical account of jesus birth 
christmas is a blast of fresh air in a polluted environment 
he said we need to hear the angels saying to us today to you 
is born a savior

in its first attempt at 
grassroots democracy bangladesh held district council elections 
sunday in the chittagong hill tracts a remote region of primeval 
forests and straw huts where a bush war has simmered and 
periodically flared for 14 years 
the candidates the voters and the soldiers who patrol the area 
concede the elections probably will not end the insurgency by 
buddhist tribal rebels who seek to expel bengali moslem settlers who 
arrived in the past decade 
the rebels who belong to the shanti bahini or peace force 
tried to frighten their fellow tribesmen away from the polls with 
death threats and by burning at least a score of villages in the 
last two months 
there were no reports sunday of any killings on election day but 
the government said at least 12 potential voters were killed in the 
past two months and thousands more had fled to neighboring india or 
into nearby jungles 
more than 4000 people have died since the insurrection started 
in 1974 in this region of 5200 square miles that starts 130 miles 
southeast of dhaka and stretches along the borders with india and 
burma 
election results which were not expected before monday are 
largely immaterial since the ethnic makeup of the three district 
councils was predetermined by the government and weighted with a 
twothirds majority favoring the tribes over the settlers 
for instance bengalis ran against fellow bengalis chakma 
tribespeople ran against chakmas tripura tribespeople ran against 
tripuras 
the elections were conducted on a nonparty basis and a dozen 
candidates who talked with reporters were unable to enunciate any 
platform other than they would work on a democratic basis to 
decide local affairs such as controlling new settlements levying 
local taxes and hiring local police 
the chakmas tripuras and at least 11 other tribes made up more 
than 90 percent of the chittagong hills population 40 years ago 
diluted by an influx of bengali settlers in the past decade they 
now comprise only 60 percent by government estimates 
many voters had no idea how to mark their ballots strips of 
paper printed with symbols such as fish deer teakettles and 
bicycles to represent each of the 240 candidates running for the 
three 31member district councils 
but just about everyone except the shanti bahini seemed to agree 
the elections were a step in the right direction in this nation 
which has never changed presidents via the ballot box since its 
warwon independence in 1971 
bangladesh formerly east pakistan has had nine presidents since 
the break with west pakistan each one was installed through 
military intervention usually a coup or assassination 
the incumbent hussain muhammad ershad achieved power through a 
bloodless coup in 1982 four years later he was declared the winner 
of an election that his opponents and foreign observers said was 
clearly fraudulent 
ershad who has governed bangladesh longer than anyone else has 
shown increasing sensitivity to international opinion especially 
since a devastating cycle of cyclones floods and droughts prompts 
him to seek millions of dollars in foreign aid each year for this 
overpopulated nation of 110 milion people 
with an annual per capita income of 160 bangladesh is one of 
the worlds poorest countries 
although the national parliament is elected by ballot major 
opposition parties usualy boycott the elections because they refuse 
to recognize ershad district councils have always been appointed by 
the government in the past 
there is no alternative to the elections said samiran dewan 
chakma 33 who runs a construction company in khagrachari and was 
elected unopposed to be chairman of the khagrachari district 
council after the election we will have political and cultural 
guarantees for the life of our people 
like many hills residents he uses the name of his tribe as a 
surname 
although he and several military officials predicted high voter 
turnouts there were signs the guerrillas threats had taken a toll 
in the hamlet of baradum all 10 houses stood deserted even 
though they were barely 30 yards from an army camp set up to provide 
protection lt col mohammad sadiq rumi said the families living in 
the houses fled a month ago after tribal rebels told them not to 
vote 
in naniarchar about 30 miles southeast of khagrachari hundreds 
of chakma voters fled in panic when about 25 rifle shots were heard 
a couple of miles away

company of armed guerrillas

prime minister ali kishtmand in the 27member council of ministers

afghanistan but was disgraced imprisoned and kept under house 
arrest in kabul after his brother was ousted in december 1986 
to establish peace in afghanistan our door is open to all who 
want to join us amani said

that he is further consolidating his position said one asian

rapidly growing populations threaten social 
turbulence endangering the political stability of many nations 
according to a new analysis by a private group 
west africas mauritania was rated the most potentially unstable 
nation in the world in the analysis released sunday by the 
population crisis committee which advocates birth control 
japan finished at the other end of the scale the most stable 
nation 
and the united states fell in the moderate category losing 
ground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of this 
countrys ethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment 
rapid population growth especially when overlaid with sharp 
ethnic divisions places enormous strains on political 
institutions observed the study compiled by sharon l camp 
marshall green and patricia g barnett 
many nations seem to be striving to develop democracy whether 
these fragile new democracies survive or not will depend partly on 
the intensity of population pressures and the strains they add to 
the problems of governance said camp 
green a retired ambassador observed that not surprisingly the 
two most deeply troubled areas of the globe are africa and the 
middle east with the worlds highest growth rates 
the new analysis published in the form of a wall chart 
containing a world map of population pressures and growth rates was 
compiled by establishing statistical ratings of a variety of factors 
and totaling the results 
population growth rates movement to urban areas the age 
structure of populations growth of the labor force and presence or 
absence of ethnic and language division in a country were the major 
population factors considered 
in addition the study took into account changes in government 
over the last 30 years or so political freedoms civil liberties 
ethnic or religious conflicts and an estimate of the satisfaction or 
frustration of youth in a country 
mauritania situated astride the sahara desert led the list for 
instability with a 95 score out of a possible 100 it also ranked 
high in the separate population pressure rankings scoring 71 out of 
100 
rounding out the five most unstable nations were ethiopia 
scoring 87 zaire 83 and burundi and the sudan 81 each 
all five have been through several governments and all but zaire 
scored the maximum in communal violence with bitter conflicts 
underway in several of these countries and all five also ranked 
high in the study of population pressures 
on the 100point instability scale japan accumulated only 13 
points and was also near the bottom of the population pressures 
study 
the united states by comparison accumulated 31 points in the 
instability analysis 
both nations managed a top ranking of 1 point for government 
changes political and civil rights 
in the category of ethnic and religious conflicts however while 
japan had 1 point the united states scored 10 out of a possible 20 
and in the dissatisfied youth category unemployment hurt the 
us which scored 18 out of 40 possible points compared to 9 
points for japan 
countries falling in between japan and the united states were 
norway 18 switzerland 20 italy denmark and australia 21 each 
sweden and belgium 22 each west germany 23 venezuela 24 costa 
rica 25 jamaica 28 netherlands 29 and greece canada and 
botswana 30 each 
tied with the united states at a rating of 31 were spain and 
france 
in the report the committee which advocates family planning 
concluded that it is clear from trends widely evident in the world 
that rapid growth of a countrys population along with its 
maldistribution will impose great strains on existing political 
social and economic structures and on relations between nations 
of 120 countries studied 101 showed a relationship between 
population pressures and political stability the group concluded 
it said that only a handful of governments with rapid population 
growth have maintained stable governments with good records on civil 
and political rights notably botswana jamaica costa rica gambia 
and venezuela 
china where student attempts to promote democracy recently ended 
in military violence scored a 57 rating on the index placing it in 
the high category for instability 
that score may be too low in light of recent events the 
committee said in an addendum issued with the report

the senate intelligence committees report on 
why some white house documents on the irancontra affair were not 
turned over to congress does not warrant a reopening of the overall 
inquiry senate majority leader george mitchell said sunday 
there is no basis at this time in my judgment for a 
resumption of the investigation or for the creation of a new 
investigation mitchell said 
the maine democrat had asked the senate panel to examine why 
congressional investigators never saw the six previously undisclosed 
white house memos when copies surfaced during the trial of former 
national security aide oliver north 
in a 51page report friday the intelligence panel said the white 
house sometimes handled documents in chaotic and haphazard manner 
when congress sought them for its irancontra hearings two years 
ago but the committee said there was no evidence of a calculated 
coverup by the reagan administration 
among those documents was a feb 19 1985 memo to former 
president reagan from thennational security adviser robert 
mcfarlane 
the memo recommended that reagan write honduran president roberto 
suazo to reaffirm us support for contra rebels in nicaragua and 
pledge us help in defending honduras if nicaraguan troops crossed 
its border 
located in an informal heads of state file in a box of papers 
at reagans presidential library in california the document 
suggested a quid pro quo arrangement with honduras that has been 
denied by president bush at the time congress had banned direct 
us aid to the contras 
obviously there are loose ends mitchell said sunday in an 
interview on nbcs meet the press 
not every single question has been answered and every one may 
not be answered said mitchell who served on the special 
irancontra investigating committee but there comes a question of 
balance in terms of whether one should or should not reopen the 
investigation 
mitchell said more about reagans role in the funneling of 
proceeds from arms sales to iran to the contras will likely surface 
during the upcoming trials of john poindexter who succeeded 
mcfarlane as national security adviser and former air force gen 
richard secord

batfans are not going to believe this but stephen 
batman has an assistant named robin and life is getting so crazed 
since the huge success of a certain film that hes thinking of 
getting his batphone unlisted 
our family hasnt received many crank calls since the tv series 
in the 60s batman said saturday but now i expect ill have to 
unlist my phone well wait and see 
the dallas securities dealer may be thinking of changing his 
phone number since the release of the new batman movie but he 
would not change his name 
the 33yearold is from dodge city kan not gotham city he 
says his grandfather did a genealogical study of the unusual family 
name which originated in england and found about 300 batmans or 
should that be batmen in the united states 
batman said he has some similarities with the comic book and 
cinema hero including having dark hair and being the same height 
and build 
my administrative assistants name is robin robin campbell 
he said i make a lot of speeches and presentations around the 
country and no one forgets my name i get to say im batman and 
this is my assistant robin 
and the real mrs batman is named vicki bringing to mind bruce 
waynes girlfriend in the new movie vicki vale 
i take a lot of kidding batman said i have a 3yearold 
batson my newborn baby is a batbaby i have a batdog and everybody 
at work says i drive a batmobile 
batman said he was a gradeschooler when the television series 
came out and his own popularity rocketed as the program became a 
hit although he found it a bit slapstick 
the movie starring michael keaton and jack nicholson draws high 
marks from batman who was among the first in dallas to see the show 
i think its very good he said and i think it will do 
wonders for my own career 
so batman says he intends to keep a sense of humor about his 
accidental celebrity and he does a good job 
asked if he played baseball when he was a youngster or was a 
batboy the dallas businessman has a quick retort 
were going to see the texas rangers tonight its bat night

on moslems who ransacked a shoe store to protest sandals they 
considered blasphemous and news reports said at least one person 
was killed and 50 wounded 
a witness said police charged the mob with steeltipped bamboo 
sticks police in tongi about 20 miles north of dhaka confirmed 
they opened fire but refused to give details 
similar clashes occurred friday in dhaka and mymensingh 70 miles 
to the north at least 30 people were hurt in those demonstrations 
officials said moslems attacked shops owned by the canadabased 
bata shoe co because they considered a design on the slippers 
blasphemous the logo resembles the arab characters for allah 
bangladesh was also the scene of violence earlier this year 
surrounding salman rushdies book the satanic verses which 
many moslems considered insulting to islam 
rushdie a british author went into hiding feb 14 after irans 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini declared he had blasphemed islam and 
ordered him killed 
five bata executives including local managing director george 
klass of canada were ordered to appear before a magistrate on july 
5 to answer charges they offended moslem sentiments with the shoes 
klass said sunday he was aware of some commotion near the 
bata factory and the shoe store in tongi but had no details 
united news of bangladesh a privately owned news agency said 
one person was killed and at least 50 wounded during the clash in 
tongi 
a reporter for sangram a bengalilanguage independent newspaper 
also said one person was killed but that at least 200 people were 
injured some by gunfire but most when police charged the crowd with 
steeltipped staves 
the demonstrators then threw rocks and broke windows of nearly 
100 vehicles that had been stopped by the demonstration on the busy 
tongidhaka highway according to the sangram reporter salahuddin 
babar who was at the scene 
the shoes are manufactured by bata in bangladesh protesters say 
a stylized drawing of three bells on the inner sole of the sandal 
resembles allah in the arab script 
the problem was compounded by the fact that moslems consider the 
sole of the foot a symbol of disrespect 
bata has issued a public apology saying the designs resemblance 
to the name allah is unintentional it said the design was provided 
by a bangladeshi moslem 
about 90 percent of bangladeshs population is moslem the 
government banned sales of the shoe last week and confiscated 
existing stocks 
reporters for two dhaka newspapers ittefaq and the new nation 
said police fired about 70 rifle rounds and about 35 tear gas shells 
at the tongi protesters 
they said the tongi demonstration was organized by the islamic 
action committee a coalition of several small fundamentalist 
parties 
the group called a 24hour general strike beginning at dawn 
monday in tongi bangladeshs main industrial town

a major underground nuclear weapon test was 
postponed for a second day sunday because of erratic winds at the 
nevada test site 
the test code named amarillo had been scheduled for saturday 
morning then postponed until noon after a series of delays caused 
by shifting winds 
we had the same problem as saturday an erratic wind pattern 
energy department spokesman jim boyer said sunday afternoon 
scientists want to conduct the test in calm or steady winds so that 
if any radioactive gas accidentally escaped from the site it could 
easily be tracked 
boyer said a weather briefing will be held monday afternoon and 
the test would not be conducted before tuesday at the earliest 
officials planned to detonate a nuclear device packing an 
explosive punch equivalent to up to 150000 tons of tnt at the site 
105 miles northwest of las vegas a similar test took place thursday

150 kilotons the upper limit allowed under existing treaties with 
the soviet union

the legislature doesnt know it yet but 
louisiana now has an official state possum song courtesy of the 
arcadia possum festival 
seven people entered saturdays possum singoff the main event 
of the seventh annual celebration of a slow ugly animal that never 
got its fair share of fur 
the winner was bobbie jean ellis who bested entries such as 
glory glory possumluia and possum rock with her gospel 
ballad youve got a friend in a possum 
it celebrates the opossum as the critter is most often seen 
poor fast fuzzy he got killed 
they tell me he died with a goodyear tattoo 
now how would you like for that to have been you 
wayne dring a newspaper editor and some of his drinking buddies 
in this north louisiana town dreamed up the festival while swapping 
stories about road kills and other cultural relics 
they formed possums unlimited a takeoff on the hunters 
conservation group called ducks unlimited and organized the 
festival 
it hasnt gotten real big yet but it has left its mark on the 
town that previously has been known only as the spot where federal 
agents killed outlaws bonnie parker and clyde barrow in 1934 
to echo a tombstonestyle marker on the outskirts of town where 
bonnie and clyde were ambushed a gravestone was erected in the 
center of town sporting the inscription in memory of all departed 
possums 
many attractions at the possum festival are moreorless standard 
fare arm wrestling a domino tournament a golden girls pageant a 
weed arrangement contest featuring roadside wildflowers 
but the main event is always something different and this year 
it was the song contest last year townsfolk competed in a possum 
funeral preachoff the year before a man was tried for 
intentionally hitting an opossum with his car 
we wrote a story that said the man intentionally ran over a 
marsupial local folks read that and didnt know what he did said

communist reformers apparently 
strengthened after a crisis meeting of the policysetting central 
committee seem determined to push through democratic policies to 
bolster the party in next years elections 
on sunday the staterun mti news agency reported that one of the 
most influential of dozens of independent political groups the 
hungarian democratic forum proclaimed itself a political party 
the promotion on saturday of economic reformer rezsoe nyers to 
communist party chairman and the formation of a fourman presidium 
dominated by advocates of democratic change indicated the growing 
strength of party reformers 
nyers minister of state imre pozsgay and premier miklos nemeth 
all wellknown reformers will now run the party along with general 
secretary karoly grosz the power of grosz party chief for 13 
months has been severely curbed 
the four will lead the party on a provisional basis until a 
crucial party congress set for oct 7 when communists will choose 
who will lead the party as hungary prepares for its first free and 
competitive elections next year 
it was a maintaining operation ensuring the party to hold on 
and preventing it from falling apart before the oct 7 congress a 
western diplomat said 
the choice of a leader at the congress is considered crucial to 
the partys attempts to hold power when the elections are held 
the independent daily mai nap on sunday quoted an unidentified 
party official as saying this was a conscious compromise in which 
everybody knew the rules of the game previously compromises were 
made in secret but at the congress well speak openly 
increasingly open conflicts between reformers and conservatives 
left grosz little middle ground several party reform groups called 
for his ouster ahead of the twoday central committee meeting 
his inclusion in the new leadership suggested the reformers who 
are popular in the country at large had been forced to strike a 
balance with disgruntled conservatives who are still powerful in the 
party 
the first act of the new leadership was to revamp the nineman 
party politburo expanding its membership to 21 and renaming it the 
political management committee 
the new politburo contained all nine members of the old body but 
added reformers such as foreign minister gyula horn influential 
historian maria ormos and csongrad county party boss pal vastagh 
the reformers believe that only their more democratic policies 
can give the party hope of emerging as the strongest force from next 
years elections and then forming a coalition government with the 
strongest of some 30 democratic opposition groups 
a public opinion poll last month conducted by two leading 
sociologists showed that only 365 percent of those queried would 
vote for the hungarian socialist workers communist party if free 
elections were be held within one month 
according to the survey the ruling communists together with the 
social democrats would muster just about 50 percent enough to form 
a leftist coalition cabinet 
others support the independent groups such as the hungarian 
democratic forum 
earlier this month zoltan biro a member of the 15man 
presidium told a conference the forum would call for elections now 
expected in june 1990 to be moved up 
it has become increasingly clear that the communists are 
unable to lead hungary out of its current economic and social crisis 
alone mti quoted him as saying

yesterdays shouting can become todays snores 
a case in point is the lincoln center theaters production of 
ubu an adaptation of alfred jarrys ubu roi which opened 
sunday at the mitzi newhouse theater 
the play with its scatalogical language incessant cruelty 
smutty jokes and haphazard dramatic structure caused a major dustup 
when it was first presented in paris in 1896 a shocked bourgeois 
fled but the avantgarde embraced it through the years the play 
has been championed by such diverse theater people as peter brook 
and lynne meadow and such cultural institutions as the living 
theater and the san francisco mime troupe 
but the new lincoln center production wont win ubu many new 
fans theatergoers at a recent preview performance appeared more 
bored than scandalized most of them gamely waited out director 
larry sloans 85minute production which at least has a sense of 
style if not substance 
although its still possible to shock an audience today ubu 
doesnt it seems almost quaint and inevitable in its defiance 
of authority the story is cartoonish even childish but then the 
play was written when jarry was a teenager it concerns pere ubu 
an egotistical tyrant who murders the king of poland and then takes 
over the country slaughtering its noblemen lawmakers and 
businessmen in his quest for more power 
ubu is sort of a dungheap macbeth but without the wisdom 
shakespeares king gains from his downfall jarrys title character 
flees at the end of the play learning nothing from his excesses 
neither does the audience but that may be jarrys point 
sloan who adapted the play with doug wright has added the 
character of ubus conscience present in another jarry play about 
ubu to this production but its a voice the king repeatedly 
ignores and finally silences forever 
ubus wife resembles a dance hall floozy while a dozen or so 
other actors play an assortment of kings queens nobles lawyers 
soldiers and even a bear 
its hard to judge the acting in such a comicstrip atmosphere 
but oliver platt is terrific in the title role he looks like porky 
pigs evil twin a porcine bully harassing the weak but running away 
from the strong he makes sympathy for the character out of the 
question something jarry probably would agree with completely 
jodie markell is equally unpleasant as ubus wife and barnabas 
miller is dead on target as the whining nerd of a prince who 
challenges ubu 
in one novel bit of casting playwright and sometimeactor 
christopher durang author of sister mary ignatius plays 
ubus conscience but the only person durang appears to be 
impersonating is himself 
the set by douglas stein is a huge whitetiled room with a 
walkway above the thrust stage and a bright red backdrop to comment 
on the bloody action 
lincoln center should be applauded for attempting ubu a work 
rarely seen in mainstream theater they have given it the best 
possible production but the play doesnt support their efforts

two vassar college students say theyre serious 
about their new club future housewives of america and hope to deal 
with the rights and responsibilities of women who choose to stay 
close to the hearth 
regina peters and jennifer harriton also plan to offer a few more 
practical sidelights like tupperware parties a dating service and 
cookbooks 
peters and harriton both 21 said they founded their club in 
response to the poughkeepsie ny schools radical feminist 
faction which the women said was too vocal in its opposition to 
traditional values they plan to seek official school recognition 
for the group this fall 
the last straw the women said was the campus womens center 
which they found disgustingly sloppy the upstart future 
housewives decided theyd make a statement by showing up one day 
with vacuums and disinfectant in hand 
the center was a pigsty and that seemed wrong because at the 
very least the place where women gather should be pleasant 
harriton said 
our mottos are coming out of the closet with a mop in 
your hand and together we stand united by lysol harriton said 
the vassar seniors both of whom describe themselves as 
feminists said some people have dismissed their organization as a 
hoax but they take it seriously 
the founders of the 15member club may be interested in 
tupperware and matchmaking but they said the club would also 
address more sobering issues 
its time we learn not to tolerate things like wifebeating 
violence against children and drugs said harriton an american 
culture major 
to bring the family back is an important means of bringing more 
harmony back into society peters added in a telephone interview 
from her home in pembroke 
ellen convisser president of the national organization for 
womens boston chapter said her group supports every womans right 
to choose whatever path she prefers but she stressed that whether 
women are inside or out of the home should not be linked with the 
incidence of domestic violence 
even if by staying home women could in some way eliminate 
domestic violence the fact remains she said that only 6 percent 
of the population can afford to have one partner stay at home 
harriton said social pressures today are such that regardless of 
their financial status women feel they cant stay at home with 
their children without being stigmatized 
we want to promote the art of homemaking so people realize its 
ok not to want to run out and become a lawyer or a doctor 
harriton said in a telephone interview from her familys summer home 
on new yorks long island 
anne constantinople a psychology professor said women who value 
certain aspects of feminism but are put off by a radical approach 
might welcome the future housewives perspective 
she said she suspected the groups organizers might be spoofing 
themselves to some degree but she noted as many as 80 percent of 
vassars graduates would work in the home at some point in the 
future 
dixie sheridan vice president for campus relations said that 
without official recognition the club is a larky idea dreamed up 
on a spring afternoon 
but harriton and peters said they plan to seek recognition this 
fall through the vassar student association and already had lined up 
a professor to speak on the impact of tupperware on us society

a suburban boston prosecutor says he will seek to 
charge hundreds of antiabortion demonstrations with a violation of 
the states civil rights act instead of merely with disorderly 
conduct 
norfolk county district attorney william delahunt said the new 
charges would represent the first time in massachusetts and probably 
in the nation that interfering with a womans right to an abortion 
would be interpreted as a civil rights violation 
he said he would drop disorderly conduct charges monday and file 
the civil rights charges which would have to be considered later by 
a grand jury 
civil rights violations can bring a jail term of up to a year and 
a fine of up to 1000 disorderly conduct is just a misdemeanor and 
rarely brings more than a relatively small fine 
delahunt said he hoped the prospect of stricter penalties will 
serve as a deterrent to antiabortion demonstrators 
we maintain a woman has a right to have an abortion he said 
saturday to be intimidated or coerced amounts to a violation 
of that right 
prolife activists who have staged demonstrations outside 
abortion clinics around the state and particularly in brookline 
during the past year said the possibility of being faced with a 
civil rights violation wouldnt deter protesters norfolk county 
includes brookline and other suburbs south of boston 
people feel so strongly about this that they will do whatever 
it costs to save lives said denise duda of mashpee who has been 
arrested along with her husband george in at least two 
antiabortion demonstrations i think it will be harder to prove a 
violation of civil rights 
delahunt said there were current charges against about 360 people 
arrested in antiabortion demonstrations 
he said he was basing his actions on a recent supreme judicial 
court ruling that limited the application of disorderly conduct laws 
in demonstrations 
the april 4 ruling involving a protest at falmouths otis air 
force base in 1986 said a demonstrator involved in a legitimate 
political protest could not be considered to have committed a 
criminal act under the disorderly conduct statute 
proceeding against hundreds of demonstrators on idle and 
disorderly conduct charges was not effective in the past delahunt 
said given their level of commitment its not effective for the 
future

helping his abductors compose a letter demanding freedom for seven

neal keny regional director for save the children said in a 
telephone interview that george was debriefed three times by 
soldiers since his captivity and in the presence of us embassy 
officials 
these allegations are outrageous and without basis chris is 
completely cooperating with the investigation keny said george 
was away for the weekend and could not be reached for comment

an indian checkpoint near this border city 
on sunday blocked 110 tanker trucks carrying fuel to nepal hit by 
acute shortages caused by a threemonthold trade and transit 
dispute between two countries 
the 3300gallon tankers carrying gasoline kereosene and diesel 
oil from singapore were lined up at the checkpoint at raxaul in the 
eastern indian state of bihar 
shyam bihar rai the driver of one indianregistered tanker 
truck said the convoys documents were cleared by calcutta port 
customs in eastern india yet these people indian customs 
officials at raxaul are not allowing us to cross the border to 
enter nepal 
indian customs officials say each truck would be allowed to carry 
only 106 gallons of fuel in its own fuel tank to reach its 
destination in nepal one official said this was a precaution 
against possible smuggling 
but the drivers said they needed more than that in their fuel 
tanks to make the return journey to calcutta 
india and nepal have been embroiled in a dispute since march 23 
when their trade and transit treaties expired the indian government 
has closed 13 of the 15 trade points along its 1000mile border 
with landlocked nepal 
one of those still open is raxaul connected by a small wooden 
bridge with birgunj 75 miles south of katmandu 
a senior nepalese officer said the indian move to stop the 
imports from singapore was intended to further pressure his country 
it was a surprising move they even stopped releasing the cargo 
imported by nepal from a third country zonal administrative 
commissioner tek bahadur thapa told reporters it seems the action 
has been taken to create more hardships for the nepalese 
india traditionally has been a supplier of petroleum products to 
nepal but after the trade and transit agreements expired the 
indian oil corporation stopped handling petroleum products for nepal 
the resulting shortages have led to fuel rationing in nepal a 
car owner is allowed to buy only 26 gallons a week 
nepal has imported some petroleum products through neighboring 
tibet and airlifted some from bangladesh

andrei d sakharov came to norway sunday 14 
years after the soviet human rights activist won the nobel peace 
prize but was not allowed to travel there to accept it 
better late than never said sakharov who is on a tour of 
western europe i should have been here in 1975 but i was delayed 
by a few years 
soviet authorities denied him permission in 1975 to travel to 
oslo to receive that years nobel peace prize from the norwegian 
nobel committee his wife yelena bonner accepted it on his behalf 
sakharov 68 spoke briefly with reporters upon arrival at an 
oslo airport from london he and his wife were invited to norway by 
the nobel committee and other organizations 
its a very happy moment for us said jakop sverdrup the 
norwegian nobel committees permanent secretary he is 14 years 
too late but we are glad he finally made it 
during sakharovs sixday visit he is scheduled to meet with 
prime minister gro harlem brundtland foreign minister thorvald 
stoltenberg and soviet embassy officials 
the nuclear physicist who helped develop soviet nuclear weapons 
also will visit research institutes in oslo and the michelsen 
institute for science and intellectual freedom in bergen 
my wife was norways guest a few years ago and what she told me 
of the visit made me anxious to visit said sakharov speaking 
russian to a norwegian interpreter 
the couple made an earlier stop in the netherlands they leave 
norway for switzerland on july 1 
sakharov was elected to the newly formed congress of the peoples 
deputies by the soviet academy of sciences in april three years

gasoline prices across the nation dropped for 
the second time in four weeks according to a survey of retailers 
released sunday 
but an analyst who conducts the poll said new federal regulations 
will slow or stop the trend 
the bimonthly lundberg survey of 12000 gasoline stations 
concluded that average prices for all grades of gasoline and all 
types of service went down about a third of a penny to 11761 cents 
survey publisher trilby lundberg said sunday 
prices dropped twice as much earlier this month a june 9 survey 
concluded the survey released sunday covered a twoweek period 
which ended friday 
lundberg said the price dropped because refiners terminal 
operators and importers had stored an extra supply to meet the 
challenge of new federal environmental protection agency 
requirements 
the epa recently instituted new volatility standards for 
gasoline the idea is to have refiners make cleanerburning gasoline 
during summer months when sunlight cooks exhaust fumes into smog 
refiners had extra gasoline on hand in case they failed to meet 
the new regulations and had to refine additional batches but with 
successful compliance refiners found they had reserves available 
creating a surplus which lowered prices 
cleanerburning gasoline costs more to produce and the toughest 
standards are being imposed in july and august which also happens 
to be the peak holiday demand time for gasoline lundberg said 
in addition to the federal standards some states have adopted 
even stricter rules and refiners have begun referring to summer 
gasoline and winter gasoline lundberg said 
this price drop could be the last for a while said lundberg 
the rules are even tighter for july 1 than june 1 and it makes 
gasoline more costly to make 
according to the survey average prices per gallon at 
selfservice stations were regular unleaded 10779 cents premium 
unleaded 12322 cents and regular leaded 10724 cents 
at full service stations average prices were regular unleaded 
13293 cents premium unleaded 14464 cents regular leaded 13045 
cents 
all the grades of gasoline fell slightly from the previous 
survey lundberg said

leaders of the 12nation european economic 
community meet monday for an epic battle with familiar lineups 
margaret thatcher vs the rest of europe 
but at this twoday summit the british prime minister for the 
first time confronts her allies looking like something of a loser 
trounced in this months european parliament elections and presiding 
in britain over 83 percent annual inflation and 14 percent interest 
rates 
in london a poll published sunday in the observer newspaper 
indicated her conservatives trail the opposition labor party by 14 
points it said 42 percent of those polled believe labor will win 
the next general election 
critics including some within her own conservative party think 
mrs thatcher is cornered 
they argue that if she continues blocking eec proposals for a 
single european currency and a social charter on workers rights 
and welfare britain will find itself sidelined 
there is nothing whatever the united kingdom can do to stop 
this said lord cockfield whom mrs thatcher removed last year as 
one of britains two representatives at eec headquarters in 
brussels belgium 
all it can do is to leave itself sitting lamentably by the 
wayside we need to take a more honest and humbler view of our 
circumstances perhaps after all we need europe more than europe 
needs us he said in a speech last week 
mrs thatcher believes the social charter smacks of socialism and 
the monetary union infringes on british sovereignty she shows no 
sign of changing her mind at the madrid summit 
mrs thatcher met sunday evening with dutch prime minister ruud 
lubbers a possible ally in the monetary dispute a british official 
said later they have a lot of common ground both sides want 
a pragmatic approach to the issue and to get an agreed resolution 
at the summit 
but he said mrs thatcher remained adamant that britain would not 
be pulled into any process that would lead inevitably to a single 
central bank and one currency for the 12 nations the official spoke 
with the condition of anonymity 
west german government spokesman hans klein saw some hope he 
said sunday it appeared british officials are not being as 
hardline as they were before lutz stavenhagen a senior aide to 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said i see possibilities that 
well come to a common position 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez said he will press the 
other leaders to make sweeping changes in monetary policies that 
would lead to a single currency and central bank 
were not trying to exclude anyone gonzalez said in an 
interview published in madrids el pais newspaper but neither 
should anyone have the right to hold back the desire of those who 
want to advance toward a monetary union this message should be 
understood 
in a signal last week that they will force mrs thatchers hand 
foreign ministers roland dumas of france and hansdietrich genscher 
of west germany declared they want a decisive political impulse to 
be given in madrid in favor of economic union 
on the social charter genscher said the eec must go further than 
the single market of 320 million people to be created when trade 
barriers are dismantled in 1992 
workers in the 12 states must feel at home in this europe he 
said 
the eec proposals encapsulate what mrs thatcher dismisses as 
grandiose and impractical moves toward some kind of united states of 
europe 
she says that a proposal to harmonize welfare levels would mean 
britain and west germany the two big net contributors to the 
community budget would subsidize the poorest members spain 
greece portugal and ireland 
on closer monetary cooperation mrs thatcher is showing some 
signs of flexibility she does not rule out britain joining the 
exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system which links 
the main european currencies 
but she opposes a central european banking system and the common 
currency 
the labor and economic proposals would need unanimous approval at 
a special eec conference but britain cannot stop the other member 
countries from at least calling such a conference or giving broad 
approval to the social charter 
even at home eurobashing no long appears to be a votegetter 
for mrs thatcher 
a gallup poll in midmay showed that 55 percent of 1274 britons 
questioned said the eec is a good thing compared with 21 
percent in 1980 
in elections for the european parliament this month labor handed 
mrs thatcher her first defeat in a national ballot overturning the 
conservatives 4532 majority of british seats in the strasbourg 
assembly 
the british people may lack enthusiasm for integration but her 
kind of chauvinism is plainly passing out of fashion wrote 
columnist peter jenkins in the independent newspaper she heads 
for madrid denied a popular mandate for waging further war

baseball legend pete rose gained a reprieve 
sunday from a judge who blocked baseballs commissioner from holding 
a hearing that could have banned the cincinnati reds manager from 
the game for gambling 
common pleas judge norbert nadel deciding commissioner a 
bartlett giamatti has prejudged rose granted rose a temporary 
restraining order that put mondays hearing on hold until at least 
july 6 
giamatti could not be impartial the judge said 
nadel said no action may be taken against rose for two weeks the 
judge said he will consider on july 6 a motion for a preliminary 
injunction that would put the case on hold while nadel decides 
whether he or giamatti should decide roses fate 
the judge said he though roses career would be irreparably 
harmed if mondays hearing were held nadel found that baseball and 
the public interest would not be hurt if the hearing were not held 
monday 
rose could be suspended for a year if giamatti determines he bet 
on majorleague games he could be banned for life if he is found to 
have wagered on reds games 
rose was not in the packed courtroom for the decision he was at 
nearby riverfront stadium for sundays game against los angeles 
in a pregame interview with radio station wlw rose said he was 
very happy with the ruling 
i think they proved giamatti already made up his mind rose 
said it just wasnt going to be a fair hearing in my eyes it 
was obvious he believed my accusers 
i think we got justice said roses attorney reuven katz 
giamatti the former president of yale university issued a 
statement saying i regret the judges decision i have absolutely 
no prejudgment or prejudice regarding pete rose we will contest 
this matter tooth and nail 
louis hoynes who presented baseballs case against rose said 
its an erroneous ruling its a problem a serious mistake 
the unprecedented decision came two days after a hearing in which 
baseball special investigator john dowd revealed that he has 
evidence that rose bet on majorleague games including reds games 
in 1985 1986 and 1987 
on sunday nadel after reading a letter that giamatti wrote in 
behalf of roses chief accuser ronald peters said it appears to 
this court that the commissioner has prejudged peter edward rose 
the judge got the case after roses lawyers sued june 19 
asserting rose had been denied a fair investigation by dowd they 
also said giamatti had already decided that rose is guilty and they 
asked that the court not giamatti determine whether the manager 
bet on baseball 
the first step in the case was roses request to halt his hearing 
with giamatti 
over the years charles o finley ted turner and other team 
owners had gone to court to challenge the broad powers given to 
baseballs commissioners but none had succeeded nadel admitted 
friday that allowing a court to intervene would be going into 
previously uncharted waters 
joseph tomain a university of cincinnati law professor said he 
believed nadel went further than necessary in finding in favor of 
rose 
i think he went further than he had to go tomain said i 
understood him to say on his last point that giamatti was prejudiced 
and that really should have been the issue at the preliminary 
hearing in two weeks 
tomain said nadel could simply have said there was evidence that 
rose would not have received a fair hearing and issued a restraining 
order to allow for a coolingoff period 
fans en route to the reds game remained solid in their support 
for rose 
im glad about what the judge did said dougie fresh of 
cincinnati giamatti has made up his mind theres no question i 
think they should leave the man alone 
he said his opinion of rose has not changed despite allegations 
that rose bet on his own team 
bo hussey of charlotte nc said he was pleased with nadels 
ruling because they havent proven anything hes an innocent man 
until proven otherwise

a 40yearold former geisha whose identity had been 
withheld appeared on television sunday and said she was paid by 
prime minister sousuke uno to be his mistress in 1985 
mitsuko nakanishi said uno was highhanded with her she was 
shown in an interview with the tokyo broadcasting system at a temple 
in kagoshima prefecture in southwestern japan 
i think a person who does not understand the weak could not 
conduct good politics she said 
ms nakanishi said she had not expected her story first 
published in a weekly magazine would generate so much interest the 
report in the magazine sunday mainichi did not name her 
i just wanted to tell the facts ms nakanishi said 
after the story appeared opposition parties and some womens 
groups demanded an explanation from uno they said they were 
concerned the reports might damage japans reputation abroad 
uno has refused to talk publically about the alleged affair 
saying it is a private matter 
uno was the head of research committee of the ruling liberal 
democratic party in 1985 when ms nakanishi said she became his 
mistress she said a contract was signed with her geisha house and a 
small ceremony was observed 
she said in the interview that under the contract uno paid the 
equivalent of 14280 to the house and later gave her 7140 that 
was in addition to monthly payments of 2100 over four months ms 
nakanishi said 
uno became foreign minister in 1987 and on june 2 was chosen 
prime minister after a long search for a politician with a clean 
image to help the liberal democrats overcome a widespread 
influencepeddling scandal 
in the interview ms nakanishi said she kept her silence when 
uno became foreign minister but was indignant when he emerged as 
prime minister 
when the interviewer asked whether keeping silent about relations 
with customers was a rule among geishas ms nakanishi said she was 
not a criminal for disclosing her relationship with uno 
there should be no discrimination by job even the geisha 
pays taxes she said mr uno is a public figure 
ms nakanishi said she was no longer a geisha although she did 
not specify her current job except to say that she worked for a 
company 
the interviewer said ms nakanishi had gone to the temple for 
purification rites and had been advised by a priest to tell her 
story on television 
the earlier story involved a break with the usual japanese 
practice of not releasing information abouat the private lives of 
politicians some editors have said they believe the publics 
attitude toward the countrys leaders is becoming stricter 
contrary to some beliefs geisha are not prostitutes but highly 
trained entertainers most work in traditional restaurants where 
guests are primarily male some become the mistresses of favored 
patrons 
in the late 1970s geisha numbered about 17000 but their number 
is believed to have dwindled

when he cut his buyout offer for prime computer 
inc at the eleventh hour takeover specialist bennett s lebow was 
driving a hard bargain maybe too hard 
on friday jh whitney amp co the nations oldest venture 
capital firm rode into battle as a white knight friendly to 
primes management in a deal valued at about 125 billion 
would whitney have jumped in if lebow hadnt cut his price 
i dont know said don e ackerman a general partner in the 
new york city firm he dropped his offer at about the same time we 
were coming to grips with a decision so we never had to think about 
it 
wall street professionals had fewer doubts 
by playing cute lebow blew it one arbitrager said flatly 
speaking anonymously 
whitney announced an agreement with primes board of directors to 
buy the company for cash and securities 
the 125 billion value placed on the package by wall street 
analysts was roughly the same price that lebow had initially offered 
last november but at least 120 million more than the revised offer 
he made june 1 
peter rosenthal a spokesman for mai basic four inc the tustin 
calif computer firm that lebow heads said friday that lebow would 
not comment on the whitney deal 
before lebow cut his 20pershare offer prime had solicited 
more than 50 companies including whitney for a higher offer when 
no one came forward in april or may it appeared mai basic had the 
deal sewn up 
then lebow dropped his price to 1950 in cash for about 75 
percent of primes shares and a package of bonds and preferred stock 
for the remainder analysts valued that offer at about 18 a share 
or 113 billion and prime immediately postponed its annual meeting 
from june 14 to july 26 to try again to get a better price 
some analysts say lebow was justified in cutting his price 
because primes earnings forecasts had dropped in the first half of 
1989 as the computer industry slumped and the costs of the takeover 
battle mounted 
the value of the company went down said barry f willman 
who follows prime for sanford c bernstein amp co in new york 
on thursday shortly after prime indicated it had found a white 
knight lebow announced that he would raise his price but as of 
friday evening he had not said how much more he would offer 
boosted by the whitney announcement and the possibility of a 
bidding war prime stock shot up 312 to close at 19 a share 
friday on the new york stock exchange mais stock dropped 12 cents 
to 625 
the merger would be the largest single investment ever for 
whitney a private new york firm founded in 1946 by wealthy 
industrialist john hay whitney 
prime based in suburban natick makes minicomputers and is the 
secondlargest producer of computer aided design and manufacturing 
systems surpassed only by international business machines corp it 
has 11200 employees and had sales of 16 billion in 1988

hotel queen leona helmsley is due in federal 
court monday to face charges that she evaded taxes by billing 
personal luxuries including a marble dance floor for her mansion 
as business expenses 
shell face the charges without her 80yearold billionaire 
husband harry who has been found incompetent to stand trial 
because of memory and reasoning problems caused by several slight 
strokes two former aides are also on trial 
mrs helmsley 68 and her husband were indicted in april 1988 on 
charges that they evaded personal income taxes by allegedly 
disguising about 4 million in renovations to their greenwich 
conn mansion 
jury selection begins monday with opening arguments expected 
july 5 
joseph brodsky lawyer for helmsley aide frank turco has been 
given permission to hand potential jurors a questionnaire asking 
their incomes and attitudes toward the wealthy the new york post 
reported sunday 
brodsky said he wants to know if the potential jurors are 
biased against rich people 
or whether theyve seen mrs helmsleys ads in the newspapers 
and they think shes an ogre he said 
the couple head a 5 billion real estate and hotel empire 
mrs helmsley is portrayed in advertisements as the queen of 
the helmsley hotels the ad campaign calls the luxury helmsley 
palace in manhattan directly behind st patricks cathedral the 
only palace in the world where the queen stands guard but some 
disaffected former employees have accused her of being demanding to 
the point of being abusive 
the other defendants turco and joseph v licari are charged 
with helping create false invoices to make it appear that the costly 
renovations on the 8 million 28room mansion were taxdeductible 
improvements on business properties 
among the renovations cited in the indictment was a marble dance 
floor installed above a swimming pool a breakfast room an 
indooroutdoor stereo system more than 370000 in landscaping and 
an assortment of furniture and paintings 
the indictment said a 45000 silver clock in the shape of the 
helmsley building a gift for harry helmsley was billed to and 
paid by their park lane hotel four jade art objects worth half a 
million dollars were paid for by four hotels as furniture purchases 
the indictment said 
its not the first tax case mrs helmsley has been involved in 
several years ago there were reports that she failed to pay more 
than 38000 in sales tax for jewelry at van cleef amp arpels 
she was never charged and was given immunity for her cooperation 
with authorities and her testimony in cases against merchants of 
expensive luxury items including jewelry stores were accused of 
shipping empty boxes to addresses out of state so customers could 
take goods with them but avoid paying state and city sales taxes 
the tax evasion case comes to trial after a lengthy pretrial 
period during which defense lawyers filed numerous motions to 
overturn the 47count indictment or remove one or both of the 
helmsleys from the case 
one bid to throw out the indictment went to the us supreme 
court which in april rejected the motion that alleged prosecutorial 
misconduct for alleged grand jury leaks to the news media 
last fall the helmsleys lawyer gerald feffer claimed that the 
false invoices were used by turco and licari to enable them to 
steal blindly from the helmsleys thats crucial to our defense 
earlier this month us district judge john walker found harry 
helmsley unable to assist in his own defense because of the 
strokerelated problems the ruling did not dismiss the charges 
against helmsley but indefinitely delayed his trial 
the judge noted that medical experts believed helmsleys mental 
deterioration would continue and said it was unlikely he would be 
tried

chicago options trader joseph ritchie has challenged 
eastern airlines chairman frank lorenzo to let an independent expert 
decide whose rebuilding plan for the strikehobbled carrier is 
better 
im willing to put my money where my mouth is and i 
respectfully request mr lorenzo do the same ritchie said in a 
telephone interview over the weekend from his chicago home 
ritchie said his unionbacked plan could still save eastern 
while he considers lorenzos rebuilding plan to be a disguised 
liquidation 
my plan has an immediate rampup with all the workers coming 
back motivated ritchie said saturday 
lorenzos plan which calls for the sale of 18 billion in 
eastern assets to reduce the airline to about twothirds its 
prestrike size goes against industry opinion and even lorenzos 
own past philosophy because it shrinks instead of enlarges the 
airline ritchie said 
texas air corp easterns parent company rejected ritchies bid 
for eastern earlier this month but the bankruptcy court gave 
ritchie permission to continue pursuing his bid while lorenzo seeks 
approval for his rebuilding plan from easterns creditors 
ritchie is the latest in a series of wouldbe eastern buyers and 
lorenzo last week called the effort to sell the carrier intact a 
joke promoted by the unions to keep members from crossing picket 
lines in the 3monthold strike 
ritchie said he had been keeping his ongoing efforts private but 
lorenzos comments prompted him to challenge the chairman publicly 
if its a joke i would be happy to let a neutral third party 
set us straight ritchie said if i didnt believe this can 
work i wouldnt be spending all this time and money 
ritchie said though that lorenzo wouldnt willingly allow an 
independent party assess ritchies plan 
eastern spokesman robin matell said saturday that ritchies plan 
had already been studied by an independent party the bankruptcy 
court examiner and his analyst 
the ritchie plan is a colossal joke entering into a charade 
by submitting it again to another third party just prolongs the 
agony of false hope for the striking unions and their members 
matell said he called easterns own plan clearly in the best 
interests of all parties involved 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland who has had jurisdiction 
over eastern since the company filed march 9 for chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization has declined union requests to appoint a 
trustee to take over management of eastern from lorenzo 
the unions took heart last week from a request by us rep newt 
gingrich rga that transportation secretary samuel skinner look 
into the eastern situation while other house members set an 
aviation subcommittee hearing on eastern for thursday 
ritchie said though that eastern is nearing the point of no 
return because of managements steady asset sales eastern has 
announced nearly 900 million in sales either approved or pending 
approval in court 
by the time the truth comes out it might be too late 
ritchie said if hes allowed to continue selling off assets hes 
going to make it untenable for anybody 
ritchie declined to give details of his bid but he said lorenzo 
wants a price far in excess of what he believes eastern is worth and 
that would leave eastern in a nearly impossible cash position 
ritchie reportedly has been improving his earlier bid by coming 
up with more cash up front according to the reports he would offer 
about 100 million cash with substantial union concessions starting 
with 250 million in the first six months other backing would come 
through debt and equity financing 
our offer is very substantially above what we believe to be the 
value of the company ritchie said

jerry tucker stood before his troops in a 
ballroom at the jolly roger motel rallying them to keep up their 
dissent after a week of losing fights on the united auto workers 
union convention floor 
the 300 or so new directions movement members were licking their 
wounds as the weeklong convention here wound down but they said 
uaw members should stay tuned the dissident group had things 
planned 
when we leave anaheim we will be intact and growing in the uaw 
across the country tucker said last week 
the next time new directions members confront the unions 
leadership publicly may not come until next spring when the union 
holds its bargaining convention to set policies for negotiations 
with the big three automakers in the summer of 1990 the uaws 
contracts with the companies expire sept 14 1990 
new directions claims proportionately more members in the 
rankandfile than were among the 2100 delegates at the triennial 
convention 
weve gotten here by coming up through the shop floor tucker 
said they have come down from unreachable solidarity house the 
uaw headquarters and have imposed directions on us 
tuckers words came in the aftermath of defeat 
new directions lost attempts at the convention to alter the 
makeup of more than a dozen of the hundreds of convention 
delegations claiming some delegates won illegal local elections 
there is a chance that the movement will go to the labor department 
to seek new elections 
the dissidents suffered their second setback when the convention 
turned back an effort to change the method of electing top national 
officers officers currently are elected by a vote of convention 
delegates new directions wanted it changed to a unionwide 
referendum of rankandfile members that the group said would 
provide more democracy in the union 
new directions also attempted to limit the use of 
labormanagement joint programs in factories saying it eroded the 
traditional role of a union that failed too 
tucker himself also suffered a big loss roy wyse was elected uaw 
director from region 5 thwarting a reelection bid by tucker to the 
same seat 
at the time wyse said the defeats signaled the beginning of 
the end for the new directions movement 
later tucker said i think brother wyse will soon find that 
new directions is reaching an acceleration that will worry the 
administration down the road until these very people are traded in 
uaw president owen bieber and his administration caucus denied 
all of new directions charges but acknowledged they made an impact 
on the convention 
this group was perhaps better organized that dissident groups 
of the past bieber said 
just after tucker lost his reelection bid bieber suggested that 
some of the new directions arguments have little substance 
i think a lot of that rhetoric out there was designed to 
promote peoples political futures the union president said 
but tucker and his backers rejected that suggestion saying their

the bush administration will ask congress to allow 
automakers more flexibility in meeting pollution standards a 
federal official said 
the presidents air pollution control bill will propose 
eliminating a requirement that nearly every passenger car meet the 
same pollution limits said richard wilson director of the 
environmental protection agencys office of mobile sources 
wilson said emissions averaging would allow automakers to 
make lowpolluting cars that would offset other vehicles that fail 
to meet federal pollution standards 
the provision will be included in bushs proposed clean air act 
which will be submitted to congress within the next two weeks the 
detroit free press reported saturday 
auto industry officials declined to comment on the bush plan 
which is similar to proposals they have made in the past 
william noack a general motors corp spokesman in washington 
said the companys policy is not to comment on legislation it has 
not reviewed however he said we favor those systems which allow 
for flexibility in marketbased incentives when asked for general 
comment on emissions averaging 
environmentalists oppose any such plan 
we are not enthusiastic about the idea said david hawkins 
senior attorney for the natural resources defense council we 
dont like the idea of being able to sell dirty cars in one location 
in return for a manufacturer being able to sell cleaner cars in 
another location

mexico wants to hold out for the maximum 
reduction in its towering foreign debt in talks with banks but at 
the same time needs an agreement soon to be able to promote economic 
growth and stability 
for mexico what is at stake in the negotiations under way in new 
york goes beyond how much the country can save in payments on its 
1074 billion foreign debt the second highest in the developing 
world after brazils 
if banks balk at what mexico considers a good agreement the 
governments alternatives are to accept less favorable terms or 
suspend payments to try to force more concessions something 
considered a last resort 
mexico went into the talks seeking a 55 percent reduction in the 
prinicipal it owes commercial banks and has come down to 45 percent 
sources close to the talks say the committee representing more than 
500 creditor banks has offered 22 percent and is moving toward 30 
percent 
its not a matter of being able to pay its being able to 
grow said jonathan heath of macro asesoria economica a 
consulting firm 
the government wants to reduce the payments from 7 percent to 2 
percent of the gross domestic product 
during the six years after the end of the oil boom in 1982 the 
country averaged virtually no economic growth workers salaries buy 
only half as much as they did since he took office dec 1 
president carlos salinas de gortari has emphasized renegotiation of 
the foreign debt as an important part but not the entire solution 
to the economic crisis 
in a recent interview with executives and members of the 
associated press salinas said negotiations were going more slowly 
than he would have liked he said they were likely to take weeks and 
perhaps even months more 
theres not much time because the social demands are there at 
the same time its a very complicated negotiation he said 
if mexico reaches its goals on reduction of principal fresh 
funds and other results of the negotiations the nation hopes to 
save about 7 billion a year on interest and principal payments 
without an agreement it would spend an estimated 16 billion this 
year 
more than as a source for financing projects the government is 
counting on the agreement to stimulate the private investment needed 
to shake the economy out of stagnation its target is 6 percent 
growth by 1994 
to reduce capital flight during the prolonged negotiations the 
government has held interest rates high even so some analysts say 
some money has trickled out 
when it became apparent that its july target for an agreement 
wouldnt be met an 18monthold antiinflation agreement with 
labor the private sector and farmers was renewed early to calm 
anxiety it includes a continuation of the onepesoaday 
devaluation rate through march 1990 
a favorable agreement would help protect the currency against 
further devaluation reduce the need for government borrowing and 
thereby free up the credit for others and relieve pressure on 
interest rates cutting expenses for both the government and private 
borrowers economists said 
with only moderate relief from the banks there is greater risk 
of renewed inflation devaluation big deficits and other problems 
that would thwart growth said abel beltrandelrio director of 
ciemexwefa economic consultants in philadelphia 
banks argue that too liberal an agreement would pose serious 
financial trouble for some of them 
mexico is breaking ground for a line of third world debtor 
countries seeking to renegotiate each one is certain to want better 
terms 
of the estimated 70 billion of mexicos debt in foreign 
commercial banks 38 billion is being renegotiated in the talks 
while no one is saying a suspension of payments is imminent the 
government has the political groundwork prepared labor farm and 
even some governmentaligned business leaders have said they would 
support salinas if a moratorium is needed 
some private economists also support a strong stand 
a rapid bad solution worries me more than a solution that 
takes longer but that is solid said manuel sanchez director of 
the center for economic analysis and research a private think tank 
the country cannot continue making sacrifices and the advances 
in the stability program cannot be interrupted 
if it suspends payments the government would be able to use the 
money it spends on debt service but the savings could be exceeded 
by a spree of dollarbuying by investors 
mexico has been considered an exemplary debtor its kept up with 
service payments and in addition to the antiinflation program the 
government has begun restructuring the economy weaning it from 
dependence on stateowned companies subsidies and protectionism 
salinas has complied on the political front attacking the 
corruption and drug trafficking so strongly criticized in the united 
states the bush administration has responded as mexico hoped by 
pressuring the banks to give mexico more economic relief sources 
close to the talks say

wildcat coal strikes around the nation 
that have left some tempers flaring cooled over the weekend and 
police are hoping they stay that way 
everybodys pretty tired said state police sgt cr 
smithers of the beckley detachment based in the heart of coal 
country weve all been working pretty hard to keep up with this 
the strikes which enter their third week monday began in west 
virginia on june 12 as union miners walked off the job to express 
sympathy with other united mine workers members striking pittston 
coal group inc as of sunday about 43000 miners in nine states 
remained off the job 
in addition to west virginia wildcat strikes are being staged in 
illinois pennsylvania alabama ohio indiana kentucky virginia 
and tennessee 
about 350 strikers in missouri announced they would return to 
work monday 
on sunday officials at citizens gas and coke utility in 
indianapolis said they will respond to the strike by cutting coke 
production by about one third beginning monday 
spokesman steve scott said indianapolisarea foundaries will be 
affected but said the cutbacks will not affect the companys 
220000 residential gas customers 
scott said the cutbacks will extend the utilitys reserves from 
one month to about 50 days citizens gas primary coal supply comes 
from west virginia other indiana utlities have reported adequate 
coal reserves 
the umw has offered no explanation for the wildcat walkouts 
which coal producers say violate the unions national contract and 
it doesnt officially recognize them but miners who walked off the 
job in appalachia and the midwest say theyre striking in sympathy 
with the pittston strikers 
that strike which began april 5 in virginia and west virginia 
and spread to kentucky on june 19 has idled 1900 workers the umw 
struck pittston when contract negotiations stalled over wage and 
benefit disputes the miners had worked for 14 months without a 
contract 
several coal companies have gone to court in at least three 
states in an effort to force the miners back to work lester weist 
spokesman for umw local 5179 in oakland city ind said sunday 
those legal efforts could end up prolonging the strike in indiana 
where all 1750 union miners have been out since june 16 
if there is anything they can do to strengthen the resolve of 
the strikers thats it weist said 
another umw official in indiana however said he hopes the 
miners will be back on the job later this week 
weve encouraged them to return to work daily so well just 
have to wait and see said roger myers an executive board member 
for umw district 11 
scattered incidents of violence have been reported during the 
strikes in alabama and west virginia shootings were reported last 
week with a west virginia teenager grazed by a bullet however 
police reported relative calm throughout the coal fields this 
weekend 
smithers said authorities have been trying to prevent incidents 
such as the one in which jamie blankenship 19 suffered a minor 
head wound thursday at a nonunion mine in the southern west 
virginia coal fields authorities say they dont know who fired the 
shot 
but the trooper said its hard to prevent such violence in a 
region where strikes often have turned bloody 
it can certainly get a lot worse smithers said 
the end of the walkouts apparently hinges on the outcome of the 
umws negotiations with pittston and the company and the union 
currently arent at the bargaining table 
federal mediators were called in earlier but the union dropped 
out of those negotiations june 7 and pittston later declared an 
impasse and implemented its own contract 
umw president richard trumka this weekend blasted pittston for 
the failure in negotiations 
the pittston coal co over a 17month period has been 
absolutely intransigent he said theyve rebuffed every offer 
company officials have called the unions demands unrealistic
