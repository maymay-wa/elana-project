five central american presidents announced 
agreement monday on a plan to end the war in nicaragua within 120 
days by demobilizing 11000 usbacked nicaraguan rebels based in 
the mountains of honduras 
we desire and hope that the contras rebels will return to 
live in peace in nicaragua president vinicio cerezo of guatemala 
told a news conference after signing the accord designed to end the 
9yearold conflict 
the agreement signed by presidents daniel ortega of nicaragua 
jose azcona of honduras alfredo cristiani of el salvador oscar 
arias of costa rica and cerezo also calls for a ceasefire in el 
salvador 
it sets no timetable however for an end to the salvadoran 
fighting between the government and leftist guerrillas of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
the accord asks the international community for support 
said azcona reading a communique at the end of the threeday 
summit 
in mexico city where he met with mexican officials us 
secretary of state james a baker iii said he could not comment 
because he had not seen a text of the pact 
the agreement calls for the united nations and the organization 
of american states to set up a verification commission within 30 
days to plan and monitor the demobilization and help avoid any 
border incidents 
the plan then sets a 90day timetable for the demobilization and 
resettlement in nicaragua of the contras who would surrender their 
arms to a force made up of spanish west german and canadian 
troops azcona said 
the 120day period begins monday and would be up dec 5 the 
presidents agreed to meet again after dec 5 to review progress 
central american agreements on deadlines have a history of 
slippage when the presidents met in february they set a 90day 
deadline to make final the plans for the contras removal the 
deadline was hardly noticed when it expired in may 
plans now call for resettling elsewhere the 11000 contras and 
12000 dependents living in honduras along the nicaraguan border 
the contras have been fighting the leftist sandinistas since 1981 
saying they betrayed the goals of the revolution that ousted 
president anastasio somoza in july 1979 
fighting has been reduced to sporadic clashes since last year 
when the united states cut off military aid the nicaraguan 
government says 50000 people have been killed the conflict 
if central american nations stick to their plan to dismantle the 
contras the rebels would face huge obstacles in remaining a 
significant force most of their supplies come from the united 
states the bulk entering by truck over a single dirt road that 
winds 60 rough miles from the nearest paved highway 
this is a very difficult situation for the nicaraguan people 
we have been fighting for ten years to achieve peace and democracy 
for our country and now we feel abandoned contra advisor azucena 
ferrey said in miami 
ortegas government has set elections for next february the 
domestic opposition has agreed to a call for disbanding the contras 
in return for democratic reforms 
the summit communique asked the nicaraguan resistance to accept 
the plan although adolfo calero a leader of the resistances 
political directorate said monday the contras would not disarm 
until free elections were held in nicaragua a position the united 
states has supported 
were ready to exchange arms for democracy but not for 
promises said calero in a speech in madison ala shortly 
before the accord was signed 
i expect the united states government to give total support to 
this agreement said ortega after the signing he said us funds 
now being spent on aid to the contras should help pay for the 
demobilization 
baker noted that the esquipulas agreement a central american 
accord signed two years ago says any demobilization of the 
nicaraguan resistance must be carried out under conditions of 
safety and democracy in nicaragua and must be voluntary 
i dont think the central american democracies would do 
anything to change the terms of the agreement that they have put 
forth baker said 
nicaragua and honduras promised as part of the accord to prevent 
their territories from being used to launch attacks on other 
states and nicaragua agreed to drop a suit against honduras in the 
international court of justice the suit accuses honduras of 
allowing the contras to operate on honduran soil 
the sandinista government repeated its promise to implement more 
democracy in nicaragua it also promised to negotiate directly with 
the nicaraguan resistance on how the contras can be voluntarily 
repatriated and reintegrated in the political process 
contras who do not want to return to nicaragua can settle 
elsewhere and costa rica el salvador and guatemala all promised 
they would accept refugees 
the united states was not mentioned although presumably some 
contras would want to settle there 
earlier monday nicaragua had accused the united states of 
trying to scuttle an agreement 
the united states is exerting great pressure so no agreement 
is reached ortega told reporters they are in direct contact 
with all the delegations except nicaragua 
cristiani denied being pressured by the united states 
the presidents agreed in february to dismantle the nicaraguan 
rebels but delayed a decision on the mechanics and timetable until 
this meeting 
ortega gave the other presidents a letter from the salvadoran 
rebels asking their cooperation in negotiating an end to the war 
cristiani said his government was willing to negotiate with the 
rebels on condition that once the talks begin that they not look 
for excuses to break them 
the us government had four observers at the meeting but they 
were meeting delegates outside the talks not attending the 
sessions

it took 10 years for gregg francis 
braun to change from a stocky popular high school football player 
into a frail erratic man suspected of shooting five people to 
death in four states 
his friends in this booming southwest kansas cattle town say 
drugs alcohol and a frightening temper were the signposts along 
that downhill road 
braun 28 is charged with three killings of convenience store 
clerks in kansas and new mexico and is the primary suspect in two 
other slayings in texas and oklahoma 
although another man was briefly charged with two of the crimes 
authorities later dropped the charges and said it was a case of 
mistaken identity the other man they said looked enough like 
braun to be his twin 
brauns real brother glenn braun a prosecutor in hays makes 
no effort to defend braun 
if the news reports are accurate and i assume they are then 
it would be unproductive to try to look at this all as some big 
mistake he said 
eddie partin who has known gregg braun since junior high 
school said his friend was wellliked in school classmates and 
teachers said braun the youngest son of lelyn j braun a 
successful lawyer was quiet and didnt particularly stand out 
but signs of trouble surfaced early 
expelled from a catholic prep school as a freshman braun 
started having serious problems with drugs and alcohol while at 
garden city high school 
a report from a substance abuse treatment center at st johns 
hospital in salina states that braun first got drunk at age 13 and 
first smoked marijuana at 15 
his loss of control over his chemical usage was as a junior in 
high school approximately 16 years old the report said he 
would smoke before going to high school and also take amphetamines 
before going to work 
braun spent a month at the salina center in central kansas 
after being arrested for drunken driving following his freshman 
year at the university of kansas braun got a bachelors degree in 
administration of justice from wichita state university in july 
1988 after attending classes there six years 
he spent time in various odd jobs quitting a feedlot the day 
after the garden city killings 
in wichita he was charged with aggravated assault in january 
after threatening a woman with a 25caliber pistol braun also had 
convictions in wichita for drunken driving soliciting a prostitute 
and careless driving 
partin remembers seeing braun in january for the first time in 
several years he didnt recognize his old classmate at first 
hed probably lost 50 pounds partin said he didnt look 
healthy 
twice during the next few months partin a hilton inn night 
manager had to order braun to leave the hotel after he fell asleep 
on a couch outside the lounge 
braun threw a coffee cup through a tv screen in the bar after he 
was refused a drink on may 30 according to partin who said he 
confronted braun as he stormed out he was beyond any control he 
had lost reality completely a month later braun was barred from 
another garden city nightspot the grain bin saloon and charged 
with disorderly conduct after a confrontation with another customer 
the first killings took place july 19 in garden city two 
convenience store clerks were abducted from separate stores and 
shot to death their bodies dumped three miles apart outside the 
city 
on july 20 the owner of a pampa texas photo processing shop 
was killed on july 21 a flower shop employee in ardmore okla 
was killed and two coworkers were wounded on july 23 a 
convenience store clerk in springer nm was slain 
all were women except the texas shop owner and all were shot 
once in the head with a 25caliber semiautomatic pistol 
authorities said 
braun is charged with double counts of murder aggravated 
kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the kansas case and with 
murder in the new mexico case he is the prime suspect in the texas 
and oklahoma killings 
what motive could braun have had for killing five people he 
apparently never knew 
there isnt any explanation glenn braun said its futile 
to look for that answer and in its own way its maddening 
the prosecutor said his brother has not contacted his family for 
help he added that he has tried to reassure his parents that they 
are not to blame for his brothers troubles 
nobody can raise a child to commit these kinds of heinous 
acts he said i dont think anyone can raise a child to 
prevent them either 
my folks are good people theyre not responsible for what my 
brother did there are some people who want to blame them but its 
not their fault he on his own for whatever sick bizarre reason 
did what he did

senate majority leader george mitchell says a 
shift away from islamic fanaticism by the new president of iran 
is welcome but it may also weaken his influence over terrorists 
holding americans hostage in lebanon 
mitchell also said sunday that ultimately the hosage crisis 
will not be solved until the lebanon crisis is solved 
the maine democrat interviewed on abcs this week with david 
brinkley called for pressuring syria to stop letting terrorists 
operate with impunity in lebanon 
the white house offered no comment sunday on the reported offer 
by captors of american joseph cicippio to free him in exchange for 
a shiite moslem cleric and several hundred shiite and palestinian 
prisoners held by the israelis 
bill harlow a white house spokesman said we wouldnt 
comment on it in any way we try not to react to each individual 
rumor or report its a very fluid situation and that doesnt do 
any good 
the diplomatic efforts continue said harlow 
secretary of state james a baker iii in mexico city for a 
conference of us and mexican cabinet members was asked about the 
demands for cicippios release and said our wellestablished 
policy is not to negotiate with terrorists 
if the united states were to get into that game wed simply 
see a lot more americans taken hostage around the world baker 
said 
mitchell said that with the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
and the election of hashemi rafsanjani as irans new president 
there is a movement within iran away from islamic fanaticism and 
more an attempt toward moderation 
thats a welcome development from our standpoint mitchell 
said but it may also reduce their direct control over these 
groups no one can say for sure that each and every order by 
rafsanjani will be followed precisely by the hezbollah 
moshe arens the foreign minister of israel predicted on abc 
that if israel and united states keep talking and acting tough to 
terrorists and the states that back them we may not see many 
more abductions in the middle east 
hussein mousawi a leader of the proiranian hezbollah told 
reporters sunday in lebanon that his group may kill an israeli 
prisoner unless israel returns sheik abdul karim obeid 
israel has offered to swap obeid and 150 shiite prisoners for 
all western hostages and three israeli soldiers held in lebanon 
israeli commandos abducted obeid on july 28 three days later a 
group called the organization for the oppressed on earth claimed to 
have executed marine lt col william higgins in revenge 
arens said obeid was of some importance amongst those band of 
criminals we seem to be holding an important card which may 
make it possible to release all of the hostages but he 
cautioned against expecting an early release 
yitzhak rabin israels defense minister said on cbs face 
the nation that we will not separate anything in the proposed 
exchange of hostages but the israeli soldiers are our first 
priority 
rabin said he felt more responsibility for his three captured 
soldiers than cicippio an american that converted to islam and 
decided to stay in lebanon 
sen william s cohen rmaine a key member of the senate 
intelligence committee said on nbcs meet the press that bush 
was doing the correct thing pursuing every conceivable 
diplomatic initiative 
however cohen said patience in the face of prolonged 
savagery really is not patience at all but its a policy of 
appeasement he urged the west to form a united front against 
states that back the terrorists 
former us secretary of state henry kissinger said on abc that 
we have to devalue the hostages and convince the terrorists 
that the united states will not let itself get jerked around 
every year or every six months by threats of murder

a record 20675 americans were murdered in 
1988 for an increase of 29 percent over the previous year the fbi 
says while the number of aggravated assaults rose by 64 percent 
to 910000 
the uniform crime reports for 1988 released sunday said the 
number of all violent crimes including rape and robbery 
increased 55 percent to a new high of 156 million the previous 
high for violent crimes was 148 million in 1987 
property crimes burglary larcenytheft and motor vehicle 
theft rose 28 percent to 1236 million for a combined total of 
139 million 
when the population increase was taken into account the rate of 
crimes per 100000 people in 1988 rose 21 percent the fbi said 
with the violent crime rate going up 45 percent and the property 
crime rate increasing 18 percent 
the greater increase in violent crimes could be attributed to 
the aging of the nations population said criminologist alfred 
blumstein dean of the school of urban and public affairs at 
carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh 
when you look at the age profile of offenders what you see 
is in the property crimes a very sharp peak between say 14 and 
20 he said thats the age at which the population size is now 
shrinking whereas violent crimes have a much broader peak 
extending well into the 30s 
blumstein said battles among drug dealers may provide another 
reason for the growth in violent crime 
the reports from law enforcement agencies nationwide combined 
in a publication called crime in the united states do not 
reveal the impact of drugrelated violence notes fbi director 
william s sessions 
at all levels of government from the white house to the 
smallest townships the ongoing war on crime includes daily 
battles involving illegal drugs and drugrelated crime sessions 
said in the report 
while violent crime known to law enforcement reached an 
unprecedented high in 1988 there is currently no way to measure 
accurately drug involvement in these unwelcome statistics he 
said 
the slayings took place primarily in the nations cities which 
experienced a 4 percent increase in the number of murders while 
suburban and rural areas saw a 2 percent reduction in the number of 
killings the report says 
the murder counts increased 10 percent in the northeast 4 
percent in the south and 1 percent in the west while the midwest 
had a 3 percent decline in the number of slayings 
among the 18269 murder victims for which details were 
available 13632 were male 4611 were female and the sex of 26 
was unknown some 493 percent were white 481 percent were black 
16 were other races and the race of 1 percent was unknown 
more than half the victims were related to or acquainted with 
their assailants 12 percent were slain by strangers and the 
relationship was unknown for 33 percent 
the nations overall murder rate was 84 per 100000 but the 
major city with the highest rate washington dc suffered a rate 
more than seven times as high 595 the fbi report said 369 people 
were killed in the nations capital last year while city police 
have reported 372 were slain 
in second place among cities with populations of 400000 or more 
was detroit with 579 killed per 100000 atlanta was third at 
488 according to calculations based on information in the report 
among the 34 cities with at least 400000 residents the lowest 
murder rate was in honolulu with 28 slayings for a rate of 33 per 
100000 people the second lowest was san jose calif with 37 
homicides for a rate of 51 per 100000 
in overall crime rates atlanta led the list with 1762 crimes 
per 1000 residents followed by fort worth texas at 1724 and 
dallas 1688 at the bottom of the big cities list was san jose 
with 529 crimes per 1000 people and honolulu 594 
as for metropolitan statistical areas which include 
surrounding suburbs and in some cases substantial cities the 
area with the highest murder rate was albany ga with 241 per 
100000 people followed by new york with 227 at the bottom of 
that list was duluth minn which includes st louis county 
minn and douglas county wis with a murder rate of 04 per

the democraticcontrolled congress is on 
summer vacation having calmed its internal strife but still 
searching for a political agenda to steal thunder from a popular 
president 
with the scandal and resignation of house speaker jim wright two 
months behind them democrats feel very positive i think were 
back on top we feel were in control said rep mike synar 
dokla 
democrats cite a rush of spending bills and other routine 
legislation in the past few weeks as evidence of effective 
leadership from senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
and especially speaker thomas s foley who took over when wright 
resigned 
i must say that since tom foley came on things have fallen 
into place around here in a remarkable sort of way concedes rep 
robert michel of illinois the republican leader 
but the democrats havent found victory on the kinds of issues 
they hoped would help define their party and chip away at the gop 
lock on the white house the president has proved to be an elusive 
target 
i think the real difficulty is drawing a line or delineating 
the difference between this administration and the democratic 
congress said sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate 
budget committee 
in the senate democrats beat bushs nomination of john tower 
for secretary of defense and more recently the nomination of 
william lucas to head the justice departments civil rights 
division but those were hardly the ideological battles of the 
former president reagans era 
on minimum wage democrats could not override bushs veto they 
then failed to paint him as being meanspirited on the issue 
because unlike reagan bushs position wasnt extreme opposition 
but simply supporting a smaller increase than the democrats 
preferred 
the house democratic leadership attempted to make a class issue 
of bushs support of a capital gains tax cut but conservatives in 
their own party have sided with the white house 
politically murkier still for the leadership was bushs threat 
last week to veto his huge savings and loan bailout plan if it 
contained a democratic plan for financing the scheme bush won 
concessions as democrats couldnt muster vetooverride strength 
the house has shredded bushs defense budget and voted to ease 
abortion spending rules for the district of columbia but new veto 
threats could reverse those outcomes 
michael robinson a professor of government at georgetown 
university said bush is adept at handling congress but also the 
most acquiescent toward congress since eisenhower or even before 
he said 
i like to call him the mr rogers president robinson 
said referring to the childrens television program congress is a 
neighborhood where he is comfortable and he doesnt want to tackle 
issues that make enemies 
were going to work on the margins for the next several years 
environment campaign reform welfare policy its going to be 
a time of tinkering robinson said the press is going to find 
this particularly boring to the point of loathsome 
democrats who control the two chambers of congress personally 
like bush and although wary of some of the political operatives 
bush employs they talk about an era of bipartisan cooperation on 
legislation on clean air and child care 
if the country does well i think the democrats will do 
well says majority leader mitchell citing progress on his 
senate legislative agenda 
but some democrats hope to find a popular message a theme for 
the party to campaign on nationally 
theres a lot of soulsearching going on and a lot of deep 
thinking as to just what should be the honeddown democratic 
agenda sasser said

landmark savings and loan legislation awaiting 
president bushs signature will touch the lives of everyone who 
pays taxes owns real estate or deposits their money in a thrift 
institution or bank analysts say 
the 1000page bill adopted by congress early saturday is the 
most significant financial law adopted since the depression as the 
largest government bailout ever it will cost each taxpayer about 
1000 over 30 years to close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrift 
institutions hemorrhaging losses at the rate of 20 million a day 
it provides the most sweeping reorganization of the regulatory 
bureaucracy in 50 years beyond that it means fewer thrift 
institutions lower deposit rates for savers and reduced property 
values in some regions 
no doubt it will take years if not decades to determine what 
good and what evil this legislation has wrought said kenneth 
a guenther executive vice president of the independent bankers 
association of america it is of historic scope 
the first and most visible result likely will be noticed by 
depositors in failed institutions that will soon come under new 
ownership the thrifts now must offer highyielding certificates of 
deposit just to keep enough cash coming in to stay afloat 
when regulators finally get the money to close or infuse cash in 
the institutions they will have less need for deposits and will be 
able to let deposit rates slip more importantly that will give 
their healthy competitors both banks and sampls room to lower their 
rates as well 
from a depositors viewpoint its the last chance to catch the 
highyielding cd certificate of deposit train said alex 
sheshunoff a financial institutions consultant in austin texas 
if somebody wants to get on it they better get on it within 
the next month the government is going to move as quickly as 
possible against those thrifts that are paying exorbitantly high 
rates he said 
that in turn may allow savings and loans and banks to charge 
borrowers slightly lower rates he said 
another provision that could potentially hurt depositors nearly 
doubles the insurance premiums charged banks and boosts the already 
higher rates charged to thrifts by 10 percent 
bert ely an analyst based in alexandria va said institutions 
will be loath to pass on the fees to big depositors who move their 
money in and out of accounts in chunks of 100000 or more 
small depositors and checking account customers more likely will 
feel the pinch he said 
as many as twothirds of the nations nearly 3000 sampls will be 
bought out or closed ely said predicting massive consolidations 
all over the country 
the first round will come through government action against 
failed thrifts but the second round will come as commercial banks 
begin buying weakened but stillsolvent thrift associations he 
said 
the bill for the first time since the scheme of the us 
financial system was set in the 1930s permits banks to buy solvent 
sampls 
im amazed at how many banks even small banks are interested 
in buying a thrift said guenther whose organization represents 
small banks 
by restricting thrifts more closely to home mortgage lending 
and discouraging diversification into areas considered more risky 
but also potentially more lucrative the bill makes it more 
difficult for thrifts that do not become part of a larger banking 
organization to remain profitable guenther said 
the legislation not only shakes up the financial industry it 
will rattle the real estate business unsettling markets 
particularly in depressed oilproducing areas of the southwest 
but also providing unprecedented opportunity for real estate 
investors and consultants to make a killing 
texas louisiana colorado oklahoma and arizona are among the 
states most vulnerable if regulators embark on a real estate fire 
sale 
that is one of the major hidden impacts of the bill 
sheshunoff said to the extent that the government disposes of 
real estate unwisely its going to drive down prices in some 
areas

house democrats seemingly invulnerable with 
an 80vote majority are on the verge of seeing a handful of 
dissident party members seal a major tax victory for president bush 
its not a new position for the majority democrats they watched 
helplessly eight years ago as conservative members of their party 
provided the victory margin for president reagans acrosstheboard 
tax cut an act many democrats blame for todays budget woes 
now the issue is cutting taxes on capital gains and just as 
democratic leaders engaged in a bidding war in 1980 in an 
effort to block reagans tax cut they have been forced to propose 
their own capital gains reduction 
with congress in recess for a month there is time for house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash and rep dan rostenkowski 
dill chairman of the ways and means committee to turn the 
momentum and defeat the bushbacked plan that victory still 
would leave democrats solidly behind a cut in capital gains taxes 
just as bush called for in last years campaign 
in a sept 30 debate with michael s dukakis bush declared 
when you cut capital gains its not going to cost the 
government money its going to increase revenues to the federal 
government and its going to create jobs 
the plan which would cut the 33 percent top tax rate on capital 
gains to 15 percent was assailed by dukakis as a tax cut for the 
wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country an average of 
30000 that were going to give to people making 200000 a year 
when bush forwarded his bill to congress it was widely endorsed 
by republicans but drew little support among democrats 
rostenkowski said there was no way he would allow chicago 
stockbrokers to pay a lower tax rate on their investments than 
bluecollar workers pay on their wages and it appeared the bill 
was dead 
but an unusual public change of heart by rostenkowski revived 
the proposal finding it increasingly difficult to put together a 
deficitreduction plan because of bushs opposition to a tax 
increase rostenkowski announced on june 7 that he would consider a 
capital gains cut if bush would get behind some unspecified 
democratic tax initiatives 
there was no evidence that bush budged an inch but backers of a 
capital gains cut took the opening and by the time the panel began 
its work the 13 ways and means republicans and six of the 23 
democrats united behind a new proposal 
unlike bushs bill the new plan sponsored chiefly by rep ed 
jenkins dga would benefit investors in commercial buildings and 
timber it would reduce the top capital gains rate to 196 percent 
for two years and then raise it to 28 percent and index certain 
assets so that artificial gains created by inflation would not be 
taxed 
facing certain defeat rostenkowski refused to bring capital 
gains to a vote foley calling a cut unwise inequitable and 
illtimed weighed in with a warning to bush drop the push for a 
capital gains reduction or face the prospect of deadlocked 
negotiations on 1991 deficit reductions 
a closed caucus of all house democrats last week confirmed that 
although well over half the party members opposed a cut there were 
enough dissenters to ensure with a solid bloc of republicans a 
victory for bush 
foley while opposing a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
emphasized that he could consider some sort of indexing to 
ensure that profits generated solely by inflation would not be 
taxed 
rostenkowski quickly came up with an alternative built around 
indexing it would go further allowing investors in times of low 
inflation to avoid tax on 25 percent of the price for which they 
sell stocks buildings timber or other assets held for more than 
five years 
the proposal failed to attract immediately any of the six 
dissident democrats or the 13 ways and means republicans and there 
is no assurance that the other ways and means democrats will go 
along when they return to work next month no matter how the 
proposal is worded it still would reduce the tax bite on capital 
gains 
rep jj pickle dtexas a ways and means member who wants a 
capital gains cut noted that dozens of other issues are facing the 
committee aiding the poor child care health care and the like 
im hoping we dont continue to call this a party issue 
pickle said the money from a capitalgains reduction will be 
used to finance programs the democratic party needs and endorses

americas cows may be in for a treat 
europeanstyle seafood dinners that scientists say could prove the 
secret to a substantial increase in milk production 
fish meal is a super cocktail of amino acids for cows 
boasts kelsey short marketing manager for a louisianabased 
oceanfishing company gearing up for sales to the dairy industry 
cows need hefty doses of protein to produce the amino acid 
building blocks required to make milk protein 
those who favor fish meal say cows can make better use of the 
protein it contains than the proteins in the solvent soybean meal 
supplement often on the menu at the nations dairy farms 
the complex fourpart digestive tract of the cow finds it 
easier to transform fish meal into amino acids 
european cows have been getting the fish meal supplement for 
some time and results of a recent study of 20 holstein cows at the 
agriculture departments us dairy forage center in madison wis 
were favorable 
cows produced an additional 3 pounds or 14 quarts of milk 
daily when fed with highquality alfalfa silage mixed with one 
pound per day of fish meal protein supplement according to glen a 
broderick a dairy scientist with usdas agricultural research 
service 
the cows themselves seemed contented enough with the new diet 
the department said it said fish meal is acceptable to the animals 
when mixed into their regular feed ration 
and dairy farmers may be contented too when they see the price 
tag 
fish meal does cost 11 cents more per day than solvent soybean 
meal but tests showed the cows were producing an additional 36 
cents worth of milk a day a current prices according to broderick 
he said the 25cent difference would amount to 12 a day for the 
average wisconsin farm with 48 cows cows fed on fish meal in the 
study also gave milk with 4 percent more protein meaning it would 
yield slightly more cheese the main use for dairy production in 
the upper midwest 
as for consumers marketing manager short scoffs at the notion 
that they would notice any difference 
the two most common myths about feeding cows fish meal are 
that the cows wont eat it and that the milk will taste fishy he 
said both of these myths have been thoroughly researched and 
found to be untrue 
meanwhile broderick plans future studies to compare fish meal 
with other highprotein feeds such as expeller or heated soybean 
meal and roasted soybeans

farmers are disgusted at what they see as 
slack regulation of commodity futures trading markets by the 
commodity futures trading commission says national farmers union 
president leland swenson 
too often decisions are made that smack of collusion at worst 
and a goodoldboy network at best swenson said in a letter to 
members of congress following wednesdays indictment of 46 traders 
in chicago in the aftermath of an fbi sting operation 
fraud racketeering and filing false tax returns were among the 
charges against the traders 
the national farmers union is an 18state organization that 
claims more than 30000 farm families among its members 
farmers are disgusted and frustrated with a futures system 
that they have little control over and that virtually dictates the 
price they receive for commodities produced swenson said 
swenson also wrote to other farm and commodity groups to suggest 
they join forces in seeking major changes in commodity futures 
regulation 
if they exchanges are ever to gain the confidence of 
producers then producers must have a role in the oversight of 
their operations he said these latest revelations 
exacerbate the mistrust that producers have of the futures markets 
being a credible pricesetting mechanism

foreign countries are gaining access to us 
government technology that could help them develop atomic weapons 
says a congressional report that blames the situation on 
conflicting laws and erratic enforcement 
despite laws limiting the release of such data sensitive 
countries have obtained information dealing with detonators 
explosives and firing sets that could assist or enhance nuclear 
weapons development said the report by the general accounting 
office congress investigative arm 
sensitive countries were defined as communistruled or those 
suspected of clandestine nuclear weapons programs of these iraq 
israel pakistan india argentina south africa south korea 
taiwan bulgaria and china were named as buying sensitive 
nuclearrelated data from the us energy department through 
routine orders or subscriptions along with nine other countries 
including major allies 
many experts believe that the united states indirectly 
assisted india through the liberal publication of unclassified 
fuel reprocessing information to stage its explosion of a 
peaceful nuclear device in 1974 the report noted 
the gao cited no concrete example of us information enabling a 
country to make atomic bombs but it said it has found that 
weaknesses exist that raise questions about the department of 
energys ability to effectively protect national security and meet 
this countrys nonproliferation policies 
the study was sent to congress in june and under gao 
regulations made public 30 days later 
the gao and sen john glenn dohio who requested the report 
said the problem centers on the flow of information considered 
sensitive but not formally classified as secret or restricted 
the department of energy must stop dragging its feet on 
issuing guidance to its atomic weapons laboratories on 
identifying and limiting dissemination of unclassified controlled 
nuclear information glenn said in a statement 
he said his governmental affairs committee plans hearings later 
this year on the issue as well as other serious security 
weaknesses at the doe weapons labs 
the gao study said the energy departments failure to issue 
guidelines on unclassified material is resulting in the release 
of sensitive information to proliferationrisk countries useful for 
the design manufacture or use of nuclear weapons glenn said 
energy department spokeswoman janie shaheen said the department 
received the report july 27 and planned no comment during the 60 
days allowed for reviewing it 
the doe faces a dilemma the gao said because under different 
laws it is expected both to control and disseminate nonclassified 
nuclear information 
the 1978 nuclear nonproliferation act and other laws require 
information controls but various technology transfer legislation 
requires doe and the weapons laboratories to collaborate with the 
private sector to disseminate unclassified research results the 
gao said 
further the freedom of information act requires doe to make 
most unclassified information available to anyone domestic or 
foreign who requests it it added 
doe weapons laboratories produced 39000 research reports in 
198687 of which more than 60 percent were available by sale or 
subscription the gao said 
it found that 68 percent of 30 nuclearrelated studies it traced 
went to overseas recipients and that iraq israel and pakistan 
requested six copies each while the largest total number of copies 
71 went to china 
one of the reports sold abroad discussed methods to improve a 
detonator used in most us nuclear bombs another described 
methods to shape the explosives in such weapons the gao said 
doe scientists also respond directly to dear colleague 
requests for published information from foreign nationals 
including those from sensitive countries the gao said when 
the request is routine doe allows the laboratories to send the 
information without prior approval even though routine requests 
are not officially defined 
several examples demonstrate confusion the gao said 
describing disagreements among scientists whether specific reports 
merely summarized wellknown techniques or provided new material 
specifically useful for developing atomic weapons

sensitive 
it found that between january 1987 and april 1988 the national 
technical information service sent 360 copies to addresses in 20 
foreign countries and 132 to us addresses the gao reported 
varying opinions among department of energy scientists whether the 
reports could help recipient countries develop nuclear weapons 
the 30 research reports dealt with six subjects 
modifying high explosives 
improving ultrafast cameras used to study the effects of a 
nuclear detonation

richard m nixon quit as president 15 years 
ago this week and the presidency hasnt been the same since in the 
view of historians and political observers 
they say nixons departure was a painful event which ultimately 
strengthened the republic by establishing that no president is 
above the law 
what was good for the republic was that it showed the capacity 
of a constitutional system to severely punish the top dog who 
appears to have violated the rules of the game says thomas e 
mann director of governmental studies at the brookings institution 
even if the presidency suffered in the short term says 
historian richard s kirkendall of the university of washington 
it would have left us with more serious problems if nixon had 
been able to get away with it 
nixon resigned aug 9 1974 a few days after surrendering the 
smoking gun watergate tape recording it showed that he had 
discussed ways to cover up the 1972 breakin of democratic 
headquarters at the watergate within a week of its occurrence 
once he made that evidence public a previously divided house 
judiciary committee unanimously agreed to recommend his 
impeachment republican support withered and nixons removal from 
office appeared a certainty 
i think the initial effect was to make presidents much more 
sensitive to the concerns of the public said washington lawyer 
philip buchen who served as an adviser to gerald r ford nixons 
successor that was true of ford and jimmy carter it began to 
slip at the end of the reagan administration or we wouldnt have 
had the irancontra affair 
even during the irancontra affair reagans advisers were 
cognizant of the possibility of impeachment says mann he says the 
record shows that privately they weighed that possibility 
even a strong president like reagan found himself 
substantially constrained by an active congress and a whole new set 
of statutes restricting presidential power mann added 
laws dealing with freedom of information limits on a 
presidents war powers campaign finances and presidential 
impoundment of funds grew out of the watergate experience 
colin campbell author of managing the presidency says the 
experience left nixons successors pretty skittish for a while 
he thinks carter for one was overly cautious 
political scientist jim reichley of the brookings institution 
says nixons resignation strengthened congressional willpower and 
congress has been intruding on executive functions ever since 
bob hartmann who served as fords white house counselor 
considers the nearimpeachment of nixon an unfortunate event 
there are other political remedies which are more routine and 
which can make presidents toe the mark and put the fear of god in 
them if theyre overreaching hartmann contends if a president 
oversteps the line congress can so fix his clock that he cant 
do anything he says 
buchen however says nixons continued tenure was having an 
adverse effect on the morale of the country and its status around 
the world it could have led to a threatening international 
incident we did not have a president who was actively governing 
austin ranney chairman of political science at the university 
of california at berkeley said while it is never good to have a 
lawbreaking president it was a wonderful thing that our system 
of justice and separation of powers worked to remove a president 
without an assassination or violence of any kind 
but campbell a georgetown university political scientist says 
the lesson of watergate didnt last long he says he finds it 
almost alarming that it came to the point that we almost had to 
do the same thing with ronald reagan 
only reagans age his popularity and his nearness to finishing 
his term saved him from an impeachment attempt campbell says and 
he finds reagans escape worrisome very seriously damaging to 
the fiber of the republic 
ranney says the difference between watergate and irancontra is 
that nixon knew what was happening while reagan always denied 
that he knew what was going on 
kirkendall said president bushs conduct in office shows that 
bush has learned watergates lesson he noted bush consults 
conspicuously with congressional leaders and allies before making 
major moves he makes a big thing of it he said

tompkins square park has the features of any of 
the small patches of green in new yorks dense inner city children 
laugh on swings old men play cards couples snuggle on benches 
but recently it has become less an oasis than the front line in 
an ugly battle over one of the citys most diverse neighborhoods 
a year ago on the night of aug 67 the park in the heart of 
the east village was bloodied by a fourhour clash between 
demonstrators and police that left 52 people injured and led to the 
filing of more than 110 claims of police brutality 
police on sunday arrested six people on disorderly conduct 
charges at the end of a rally by about 100 people observing the 
riots first anniversary 
the park remains a war zone although the nature of the conflict 
is in dispute is it a struggle by the homeless for a place to 
live or a neighborhoods battle for control of its park 
the melee last year began when police decided to enforce a 1 
am curfew in the park which some residents said had become a 
noisy center for drug use 
although no one disputes that drugs are used in tompkins square 
and other parks activists many of them selfproclaimed 
anarchists saw the police action as part of a wider move to 
sanitize the neighborhood making it safe for yuppies and too 
expensive for many others 
as many as 250 people sleep in the park on any given night most 
of them homeless but a few are activists with the political agenda 
of demonstrating the inadequacies of the citys housing policies 
mayor edward i koch has said he wants to rehabilitate thousands 
of abandoned apartments in the neighborhood half at subsidized 
rates for poor people and half at market prices to pay for the 
subsidy 
we dont want to keep an area in permanent poverty which is 
i think what the anarchists would like he said last year 
many longtime residents are opposed to the actions of the more 
radical activists including the construction of a tent city in the 
park and the holding of frequent marches and rallies 
i have never seen such a mess like this said a ziggy 
skrnyk a longtime resident today this is a jungle a real 
jungle 
the east village part of lower manhattan called the lower east 
side has seen wave upon wave of immigrants and is currently home 
to hispanics and eastern europeans as well as drug dealers and 
users artists and punks among others 
many abandoned buildings have been illegally occupied some by 
addicts who squat in the bare premises to use drugs others by 
urban pioneers willing to make major repairs to escape high rents 
elsewhere in the city 
over the years the grubby chic of the area has attracted 
wealthier tenants leading to rent hikes activists feel the 
police responding to the complaints of these tenants are the 
enforcement arm of a city administration bent on transforming the 
neighborhood by removing undesirables 
police have been careful since last years riot rarely 
enforcing curfew in the park and avoiding violence when they remove 
tents or make arrests more than 11000 city police officers have 
been retrained in crowd control 
on july 5 police tore down a tent city and evicted more than 
130 people they were greeted by a volley of bottles eggs and 
sticks but did not retaliate last week police removed eight 
tents over the protests of more than 70 people three were 
arrested 
you wont see excessive violence on the part of police 
officers said deputy inspector michael julian commanding 
officer of the ninth precinct 
the rev frank scanlan of st brigids catholic church agreed 
that police had become very sensitive but said they were prone 
to massive displays of manpower 
when the city evicted squatters from two abandoned buildings 
last spring police blocked access to several blocks around the 
park including doorways and his churchs parking lot 
i a priest had to ask permission to go into my parking 
lot scanlan said 
many residents believe anarchists and marxists could help ease 
tensions by leaving 
i think that some people in the park would want nothing more 
than another big confrontation said kate walter a founder of 
the st marks place block association some of them are white 
middleclass people with homes who come here to rabblerouse while 
the homeless sit around with a bottle

these are among the developments in campaign finance reform 
around the nation this year 
alaska gov steve cowper introduced a bill to prohibit direct 
donations to candidates by corporations unions and political 
action committees they currently are limited to contributions of 
1000 under cowpers bill which remains in a legislative 
committee they could contribute to political parties only 
california a court battle will determine the validity of two 
campaign finance reform measures passed by voters last year 
proposition 68 limited campaign spending and created public 
financing of campaigns proposition 73 which received more votes 
and therefore superceded proposition 68 set limits on 
contributions and banned public financing 
florida legislators passed a bill to regulate slush funds 
managed by the house speaker and senate president 
illinois the general assembly approved legislation that would 
allow insurance companies and horse racing organization licensees 
to contribute to political campaigns in the state in the past 
gov james r thompson has vetoed similar legislation 
iowa a task force named by gov terry branstad released 
tentative campaign reform recommendations that include a ban on 
campaign contributions while the legislature is in session and 
limits on pac contributions the legislature is also studying the 
issue 
kansas the 1989 legislature passed a sweeping overhaul of the 
states campaign finance act the legislation lowered the limit on 
contributions by onethird and applied the limits to pacs or 
corporations and their subsidiaries together it also limited 
national party organizations from giving state parties more than 
25000 a year and more than 1500 to candidates in an election 
cycle and required the filing of annual campaign spending reports 
rather than just before and after elections 
maine legislators tinkered with reporting requirements but the 
major development will be a statewide referendum nov 7 on a common 
cause plan to establish public financing for gubernatorial 
candidates willing to accept spending curbs 
massachusetts two bills are pending to give more power to the 
campaign and political finance office and place caps on pac 
contributions 
michigan a new law will raise from 24 million to 36 million 
the amount that gubernatorial candidates may spend for both a 
primary and general election if they accept public funding 
montana legislature ordered campaign reports to be filed 
quarterly in the year preceding an election year previously the 
law required the financial reports to be filed beginning in the 
election year 
nevada a new law requires separate accounts so that campaign 
funds arent comingled with a candidates personal funds 
new mexico a new law requires offyear campaign contributions 
and expenditures to be reported 
new york new york city is holding its first publicly financed 
elections this fall

an obscure law nearly 200 years old will be 
pivotal in deciding civil lawsuits accusing former philippine 
president ferdinand marcos of instituting a reign of terror in his 
homeland lawyers for both sides say 
the attorneys debated sunday whether deposed dictators should be 
held responsible in american courts for human rights abuses 
allegedly committed in their homelands the discussion was part of 
the american bar associations convention here 
last month the us 9th circuit court of appeals reinstated 
damage suits accusing marcos of ordering the imprisonment and 
torture of numerous philippine citizens during his 20year rule 
the suits had been dismissed by us district courts in hawaii 
and california on the grounds that marcos alleged actions were 
acts of state immune from lawsuit under a doctrine that courts 
in one nation cannot judge the sovreign acts of another 
we feel these suits are the only way the victims will be 
able to obtain justice said sherry broder a honolulu attorney 
representing the alleged victims 
obviously the victims couldnt seek justice in the 
philippines during marcos rule and now that hes here this is 
the proper place to file she said 
richard hibey a washingtonbased marcos attorney said the 
circuit court ruling would be appealed to the us supreme court 
he contends the united states has no jurisdiction in the case and 
that marcos still holds immunity as a head of state despite his 
ouster in february 1986 during a civilianmilitary revolt 
these cases do not belong here they are not the judicial 
business of the united states said hibey what you have here 
is aliens suing aliens not one of the acts was alleged to have 
occurred in the united states 
however jon van dyke a law professor at the university of 
hawaii and broders cocounsel said international law holds that 
government officials cannot mistreat their people and if they 
do they can be sued wherever they can be found 
van dyke and broder said an alien tort statute enacted in 1790 
set the precedent for one foreigner to sue another in the united 
states and would be used to prove marcos was liable 
however hibey said the statute was based on an altercation 
between two frenchmen in the united states and therefore was 
irrelevant in the marcos case in which the alleged abuse occurred 
in the philippines he said the law would help him prove that the 
cases against marcos should be heard in the philippines 
hibey said the us solicitor generals office had filed an 
amicus brief agreeing that marcos should not be sued in the united 
states for civil cases he called that significant because there 
is virtually nothing the united states and i agree on in respect to 
these marcos cases 
last october the us government indicted the 71yearold 
marcos and his wife imelda on criminal racketeering charges 
accusing him of stealing more than 100 million from the philippine 
treasury and stashing it in the united states 
marcos has been separated from the case because of respiratory 
heart and kidney problems that have kept him hospitalized since 
jan 15 he remained in critical condition sunday at st francis 
medical center where he remains on lifesupport equipment a 
hospital spokeswoman said

last weeks surprise house vote against 
restrictions on abortion funding doesnt mean the chamber now backs 
abortion rights but lawmakers say it does signal an awareness that 
voters are watching 
there is widespread agreement that following the supreme courts 
july decision granting states more muscle to block abortions the 
issue has become extremely highprofile and fraught with 
political consequences 
people will be watching these votes very closely said rep 
jim kolbe rariz who voted with the majority wednesday to reject 
a ban on public financing of all abortions in the district of 
columbia 
it makes people wonder how will this be used in a 10second 
or 30second commercial against me kolbe said 
the houses 219206 vote against the financing ban was a 
surprise to both sides it was a reversal of last years 222186 
vote approving similar restrictions and marked the first time 
since 1980 that the house rejected an effort to restrict abortion 
twentythree lawmakers switched from an antiabortion vote in 
1988 to a vote backing abortion rights vote last week and several 
gave varying reasons 
the way the measure was crafted did not help the proposal 
introduced by rep robert dornan rcalif allowed no exceptions 
to a ban on public aid for abortions even if the mothers life 
were endangered 
dornan said the exception for the mothers life was omitted only 
for procedural reasons and conceded after the vote that the 
omission cost him votes and was a tactical mistake not only did 
dornan lose but those who supported him left themselves vulnerable 
to opponents next year 
theyve got some of their colleagues hung out on a record vote 
to deny money for abortions even when the life of the mother is at 
risk said rep les aucoin dore one of the houses prime 
prochoice advocates if they dont think the democratic party or 
prochoice groups will run political commercials on that theyre 
living in dreamland 
aucoins prediction reflects a change in momentum on the 
abortion issue attributable to the supreme court decision webster 
vs reproductive health services advocates of abortion rights say 
their supporters have been galvanized by that ruling and their 
opponents concede that things are different for now 
some members particularly some democrats have been hearing 
quite a lot of noise from the other side recently and went to the 
floor a little more disposed to listen to the other side douglas 
johnson lobbyist for the national right to life committee said 
last week 
i dont think it means in most cases that theyre permanently 
shifting to the other column he said it does mean we need to 
sit down with them again 
even most lawmakers who back abortion rights agree that most 
house members will continue to support abortion restrictions 
we dont suddenly have a surprise prochoice majority here 
aucoin conceded 
antiabortion legislators said they faced another problem during 
the wednesday vote dishonest lobbying by the abortion rights bloc 
dornan and his supporters accused aucoin and his allies of 
misleading lawmakers by telling them dornans proposal would have 
ended public aid in the district for contraceptives which they say 
is not true 
of several lawmakers who changed their votes from antiabortion 
in 1988 to the prochoice side last week the explanations varied 
kolbe describes himself as backing the right to abortion but an 
opponent of using federal money for abortions he said he fell 
off the wagon last year but now believes congress should not 
impose its will on the district government 
rep jim slattery dkan said he was swayed by dornans 
failure to exempt abortions involving endangered mothers and a 
fear that contraceptive aid would end 
i couldnt vote against providing money for all abortions 
he said

while president bush talks about it and congress fights over it 
some state legislatures have actually begun to do something about 
the high cost of running for office 
faced with a campaign spending arms race that has pushed the 
cost of elective office to heights that couldnt have been imagined 
a decade ago legislators around the country are gingerly calling a 
truce 
at least a halfdozen states have passed some form of campaign 
finance reform so far this year and reform proposals are alive in 
many others 
i think theres more of a recognition at least at the state 
level that the problem of the cost of campaigns is a very serious 
one said ronald michaelson executive director of the illinois 
state board of elections who studies campaign finance developments 
nationally 
the problem varies widely from state to state but is raising 
concern almost everywhere 
what seems expensive in kansas where the average campaign for 
the state house of representatives cost 18000 last year may be 
pocket change in california where legislative seats cost an 
average of 600000 but the trend is similar campaign costs have 
doubled in kansas and nearly tripled in california in the past 10 
years 
experts cite several reasons politicians have become more 
reliant on expensive forms of campaigning such as direct mail and 
television competition has escalated and political action 
committees are pumping more money into the political process 
so long as the pac money is available politicians will take it 
listen to ross johnson a republican who is minority floor leader 
of the california assembly and an advocate of contribution limits 
why do you climb the mountain because its there why do you 
spend the money because its there 
and how do you keep the mountain from rising the usual answers 
fall into three categories disclosure contribution limits and 
public financing 
so far this year at least four states kansas maine montana 
and new mexico have strengthened their rules for campaign finance 
disclosure such rules presume that the public should at least know 
who foots the bills for their public servants 
this years changes generally require more frequent reporting 
contribution limits also are being tightened kansas lowered its 
ceiling for political contributions in statewide races from 3000 
to 2000 and changed the rules so that a pac or corporation with 
say three subsidiaries can only donate 2000 once not four times 
contribution limits are under consideration in several other 
states most notably alaska where gov steve cowper has proposed 
prohibiting direct donations to candidates by corporations unions 
and pacs 
such donations often are given by lobbyists if money is the 
mothers milk of politics said cowper the people of alaska 
will not tolerate lobbyists owning the dairy 
contribution limits are designed to turn down the spending 
spigot or at least ensure that no single donor controls it but 
critics question whether it lowers the spigot or just forces 
candidates to find more wells 
if you just cut the size of the contributions you just 
make the candidate run harder for the money said walter zelman 
director of the california chapter of common cause the public 
interest lobbying group they become more obsessed than ever 
one cure for the obsession is a limit on actual campaign 
spending but the supreme court has ruled that states can do this 
only if they also provide public financing to the candidates this 
is the solution preferred by many reformers 
so far 22 states have some form of public campaign funding 
according to herbert alexander a political science professor at 
the university of southern california maine voters will decide in 
november whether to add their state to the list 
several cities have enacted public financing including new york 
city which is in the midst of its first taxpayerfinanced 
campaign if nothing else it has proven that there is nothing 
sterile or dull about publicly financed campaigns and that they 
arent necessarily cheap 
under the new york law publicly financed candidates for mayor 
can spend 6 million in the primary and general elections combined 
they can get up to half that money in public funds if they take the 
rest in small amounts from individual voters 
this law helps ensure that it is the breadth of a candidates 
support not the depth of their pocketbook that makes a viable 
campaign said city councilwoman ruth messinger who has received 
281000 in public funds so far in her race for manhattan borough 
president 
even with public funding its clear that money and politics 
have formed a lasting partnership that worries many people but 
uscs alexander is not among them 
im in favor of public funding but im not concerned about 
the high cost of politics he said politics is pretty cheap 
compared to other things we do in this country you know we spend 
more on chewing gum than we spend on politics

in the golden glow of the kalahari 
desert the bushmen live in nomadic simplicity virtually unchanged 
for thousands of years 
at the seaside resort of swakopmund descendants of german 
settlers converse in their mother tongue over wiener schnitzel and 
beer at sidewalk cafes 
in the dusty town of rehoboth virtually all 20000 residents 
are of mixedrace and insist on being called bastards 
namibias vast rugged landscape has only 13 million people 
but they make up an anthropological laboratory of 11 ethnic groups 
who often put tribe before country and are linked not by culture 
nor tradition 
with independence from south africa expected early next year 
namibians still are searching for a sense of nationhood to bond 
people who share little but common boundaries 
witchcraft cases are tried under a western legal system 
mercedesbenzes and donkeydrawn carts kick up dust along the same 
rural roads black women with a weeks worth of groceries perched 
on their heads shop alongside white women in fur coats in this 
modern capital 
at political rallies arranged by the southwest africa peoples 
organization the faction favored to win novembers 
preindependence elections speeches are delivered in english then 
translated into four african languages 
namibia is not a nation at this point said hans diergaardt 
leader of the rehoboth basters there are too many different 
groups that have been kept apart for too long 
diergaardt and his fellow basters the afrikaanslanguage word 
for bastards epitomize the stubborn independence that 
permeates namibias multitribal society 
the product of liaisons between whites and blacks in south 
africas cape province the basters left that region in search of 
farmland and independence in 1868 and settled the deserted 
missionary village of rehoboth about 60 miles south of windhoek 
they identify with neither whites nor blacks and have 
steadfastly refused to recognize the authority of the german 
colonialists or their south african successors 
they now oppose namibias planned oneperson onevote elections 
a unitary state in namibia is not going to work said 
diergaardt a husky farmer whose weathered face speaks of years 
spent in the african sun 
diergaardt has threatened to unilaterally declare rehoboth an 
independent state if the basters are dissatisfied with namibias 
elected government 
for the past several years the basters have prepared for such a 
move by purchasing land that separates their territory from 
atlantic port of walvis bay about 180 miles away theyve bought 
250000 acres and need about 5 million to secure enough land for a 
corridor to the sea diergaardt said 
like the basters the diminutive bushmen have found little in 
common with other namibians 
entirely selfsufficient the bushmen thrive in the seemingly 
inhospitable kalahari with extraordinary hunting and gathering 
skills 
they are among the most primitive people on earth rarely 
building fixed settlements or making regular contact with other 
groups 
most of namibias 30000 bushmen have begun to join the modern 
world including hundreds employed by the south africanled 
security forces as trackers in the 23yearold bush war against 
swapo guerrillas 
equally untouched by western culture are the himbas of namibias 
barren northwest corner who wear minimal clothing and smear their 
bodies with a rancid mixture of butter and ochre that gives them a 
distinctive orange tint 
the himbas have repeatedly rejected western missionaries while 
their cousins the hereros accepted them to such an extent that 
the women still dress in brightly colored 19thcentury victorian 
dresses that seem incongruous in namibias scorching climate 
most of the original missionaries and settlers were germans 
whose influence remains strong 
the atlantic town of swakopmund features turnofthecentury 
german architecture set against the alien terrain of the namib 
desert visitors are more likely to be greeted in german than the 
official languages of english and afrikaans 
german descendents who account for about 20000 of namibias 
75000 whites are prominent in business throughout the territory 
but generally stay out of namibias tangled politics which until 
recently included 47 parties 
far from swakopmunds european charm the kavango people of 
northeastern namibia remain wedded to tribal customs 
in one case a suspected kavango arsonist received the 
traditional punishment from his tribal elders he was ordered to 
dig his own grave then lie in it where he was buried alive 
according to court records 
three tribal elders were convicted of the killing but received 
only suspended sentences 
suspected witches have been thrown into rivers with stones tied 
around their necks if they drown it is considered proof they were 
witches if they survive then they were falsely accused according 
to tradition 
namibia abandoned most of its segregation laws in the late 
1970s and early 1980s and the racial climate is more relaxed 
than in neighboring south africa 
but under south africa rule namibias tribal differences were 
formalized with the creation of 11 separate ethnic governments that 
had considerable autonomy 
namibias first independent government will face the difficult 
task of establishing itself as a national authority that remains 
sensitive to local customs

the national park services chief 
historian says the site of one of the worst indian massacres 
deserves national landmark status 
edwin c bearss also said he supports renaming the event now 
known as the battle of bear river as the bear river massacre 
more than 400 indian men women and children were slaughtered 
during the little known fight between the northwest shoshoni tribe 
and us army california volunteers on jan 27 1863 
the attack took place after white settlers complained of cattle 
thefts and the abduction of a boy who later was retrieved and 
returned to his family 
the soldiers struck before dawn as the indians slept going from 
tepee to tepee and shooting the victims fourteen soldiers were 
killed 
bearss told some 50 residents on saturday that he would 
recommend landmark status for the site to the secretary of the 
interior and undertake a study for the park service at the request 
of sen james mcclure ridaho 
legislatures in utah and idaho have passed resolutions 
supporting national landmark status for the area in the northern 
end of the cache valley which lies across the state line 
bearss said the only thing that would stop him from pursuing 
landmark designation would be major opposition from the owners of 
the 600 to 800 acres of land in the vicinity 
during the meeting several property owners asked about 
management of the property if it is designated a landmark 
bearss said people who live and farm in the area can go on 
with their current activities and future development directly 
related to farming would not be prohibited by the designation 
although landmark status is prestigious the park service gives 
only a certificate and plaque once it has been granted he said 
there is no federal funding for development which would only 
occur if your congressional delegation can get legislation passed 
supporting national monument status bearss said 
allie hansen president of the bear riverbattle creek monument 
association formed last year to work for recognition of the 
massacre said all members of our committee feel it is important 
that the study tells the indian side of the story

contra leader adolfo calero said he wont 
ask the guerrilla group to disband before the february elections in 
nicaragua which he said he did not expect to be free despite a 
pledge by the sandinistas 
we are ready to exchange our weapons for democracy said 
calero a leader of the contra directorate but we are not ready 
to exchange weapons for promises 
calero spoke saturday to the annual convention of the civilian 
materiel assistance a group based in decatur ala that has 
furnished supplies to the contras since 1983 
five central american presidents at a summit meeting sunday 
failed to agree on a timetable for their earlier agreement that the 
nicaraguan rebels be dismantled 
calero said he is prepared to return to nicaragua to be a 
candidate in the elections but said the contras will remain in 
the hills regardless of what president daniel ortega or the us 
government decide 
the bush administration has said it wants to have the contras 
most of whom are based in honduras remain intact until the 
elections 
civilian materiel assistances chairman tom posey was indicted 
with five other men for violating the us neutrality act in 1984 
and 1985 the charges were dismissed july 13 by a miami judge who 
noted that the us government was waging an illegal war organized 
by national security official oliver north at the time 
calero said poseys group made a great difference because it 
provided american support at times when congress refused to provide 
aid 
the cma people believe freedom just doesnt happen said

stymied by repeated attempts to reach 
agreement on a timetable to disband the usbacked nicaraguan 
rebels five central american presidents meet today to conclude 
their threeday summit 
there is no accord about a timetable but there is agreement 
on mechanisms the president of honduras jose azcona said 
sunday night in this beach resort 
azcona and the presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala 
and costa rica agreed in february to engineer the demobilization of 
the usbacked rebels known as contras but they put off coming 
up with a specific plan until this meeting 
the us government was not invited to participate in the talks 
but sent four observers 
about 11000 contra fighters and their families are in camps in 
honduras near the nicaraguan border 
azcona said the talks had three main points a timetable on the 
contras el salvadors 9yearold civil war and nicaraguas case 
against honduras which has let the contras operate from its 
territory for years at the world court in the hague 
azcona did not provide details about the talks nor did foreign 
ministers questioned by reporters sunday during breaks in the talks 
at the hotel telamar a collection of weatherbeaten woodframe 
bungalows 200 miles north of tegucigalpa the capital 
there are two plans for demobilization azcona said we 
need to finalize them and create one 
costa rican president oscar arias who won the 1987 nobel peace 
prize for initiating regional peace talks said nicaraguas leftist 
government must open talks with the contras because its not 
possible to achieve a voluntary demobilization without a dialogue 
he added that the world is expecting much from us 
principally the 28 million central americans who dont want war 
not to advance would be to betray those hopes 
nicaragua came to the summit armed with an accord with its 
internal opposition parties calling for contra demobilization the 
accord also calls for the sandinista government to free elections 
next february 
ortega has said he expects a gradual resettlement of the 
contras 
el salvadors new rightist president alfredo cristiani came to 
the talks hoping to link contra demobilization to the civil war 
with leftist rebels in his country el salvador accuses nicaragua 
of arming the rebels 
ortega presented his counterparts with a letter from the 
salvadoran rebels asking for help in negotiating their conflict 
the bush administration lobbied central american governments to 
keep the contras intact until the feb 25 1990 elections in 
nicaragua 
meanwhile contra leader adolfo calero said he wont ask the 
guerrilla group to disband before the february elections which he 
said he did not expect to be free despite a pledge by the 
sandinistas 
we are ready to exchange our weapons for democracy said 
calero but we are not ready to exchange weapons for promises 
calero spoke saturday in madison ala to the annual convention 
of the civilian materiel assistance an alabama group that has 
furnished supplies to the contras since 1983 
azcona said the us government had supplied documents to the 
leaders but had not tried to influence events despite the presence 
of the us observers 
there was no pressure he said 
paul reichler an american who advises the nicaraguan 
government said demobilizing the contras would be good for the 
united states 
if this plan works it will solve a major problem for the 
united states on what do do with the stranded contras 
a shaky ceasefire has been in effect between the sandinistas 
and the contras since last spring when us military aid ended 
humanitarian aid continues 
the contras have been fighting the leftist sandinistas since 
1981 alleging the government betrayed the goals of the 1979 
revolution that ousted dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 
el salvadors civil war has left 70000 dead while 50000 
people have been killed in nicaraguas conflict

a hot air balloon that collapsed and 
plunged 2000 feet killing its pilot had one torn seam and others 
virtually coming apart a national transportation safety board 
investigator said 
robert mock 52 of paonia colo died shortly after saturday 
nights competition began at the national hot air balloon 
championships his wife said mock would have wanted the matches to 
go on through aug 13 as scheduled at the state fairgrounds in 
baton rouge 
he would not have wanted this to end the competition said 
charlene mock 
some of roughly 100 competing balloonists said they were eager 
to resume the matches but not quite so venturesome 
were like sand fiddler crabs well be out in the morning we 
may not fly as high though said johnny kreger a balloonist 
from high point nc 
on sunday ntsb investigator armond edwards displayed a rip in 
mocks balloon named chariot of fire too 
that started to open up on its own edwards said in an 
interview with wbrztv 
he said the rip might have stemmed from the age of mocks 
balloon 12 years compared with a normal life span of 10 for such 
craft and maneuvering that can put excessive stress on a balloon 
weve been told that people who have observed him that 
basically during a terminal descent and stopping a descent by 
burning a lot of hot air you can damage the balloon and 
eventually it becomes very weak edwards said 
investigators also found other seams where its virtually 
coming apart right now he said 
edwards said the balloon was being shipped today to dallas for 
testing 
mock radioed before the 555 pm crash to say a flap near the 
top of the balloon wasnt sealing properly and to warn spectators 
away mrs mock said 
he said it doesnt look good and i didnt bother him 
she said 
a short time later she related he said clear the people 
out from underneath 
mocks balloon crashed on a strip of grass between traffic lined 
up near the fairgrounds entrance he died 30 minutes later at our 
lady of the lake medical center of what a hospital spokeswoman 
called massive trauma 
as many as 10000 spectators may have seen the crash said capt 
robert shortess of the east baton rouge sheriffs department 
one witness southern university professor moriba a karamoko 
said mock continued to work the balloons butane burner controls in 
an apparent effort to reinflate the craft as it fell 
he was a lot more in control than i would have been 
karamoko said

prime minister david lange made a 
rapid rise from a backstreet lawyer championing the rights of poor 
clients to a controversial leader of international standing 
lange who announced his resignation today amid a crisis within 
his labor party had incurred the wrath of both the united states 
and france over his outspoken antinuclear views 
born in auckland in august 1942 lange celebrated his 47th 
birthday last friday 
he became new zealands youngest prime minister this century and 
the second youngest ever when he won the snap election called by 
his national party predecessor robert muldoon in july 1984 
known for his oratorial skill lange governed through a time of 
dramatic change for the south pacific nation of 33 million 
langes labor government put new zealand on the map when it 
refused to bow to two of the worlds five nuclear powers 
during his government he proclaimed new zealand nuclearfree 
lost the support of the united states and took on france over the 
bombing of the greenpeace ship rainbow warrior in auckland harbor 
he also rattled france with continued criticism of french 
nuclear testing in the region 
langes political rise began in 1977 when he won the safe labor 
seat of the northern town of mangere outside auckland during a 
byelection two years later he became the deputy leader of the 
labor party under leader bill rowling 
in 1983 he was elected labor leader and 16 months later led his 
traditionally leftleaning party to victory 
during labors first term langes finance minister roger 
douglas proceeded with measures previously unseen in new zealand 
farm and export subsidies were removed the dollar floated tariffs 
reduced or phased out and six of the governments biggest trading 
departments turned into corporations causing the loss of thousands 
of jobs 
langes government was reelected in 1977 and immediately cracks 
began to appear in the langedouglas relationship 
in december 1987 douglas announced plans for a flat rate of 
income tax a guaranteed minimum family income scheme and proposals 
to make the welloff pay for health and education services 
lange denounced the proposals setting off a cold war between he 
and the douglas camp 
douglas resigned his post late last year but was reappointed to 
the cabinet last week a decision that angered lange 
despite the ongoing rift and the reemergence of douglas which 
political observers are citing as the true reason for langes 
resignation the former finance minister offered praise for lange 
today 
in a statement issued in wellington douglas said lange led new 
zealand with extraordinary distinction through the most difficult 
period of its postwar history 
no labor government since world war ii has accomplished more 
than this labor government under his leadership said douglas 
a methodist laypreacher and teetotaler lange spurned the 
trappings of official life by not moving into the official 
wellington residence of vogel house 
instead he rented a small apartment across the road while his 
englishborn wife naomi and their three children maintained a 
modest home in auckland 
citing poor health as one of the reasons for his decision to 
resign lange was treated in hospital last year for a heart 
condition and in 1983 underwent a stomach stapling operation in a 
successful attempt to lose weight

a suspected drug smuggler eluded federal agents by 
bailing out over the dark interior of the everglades during a night 
chase and allowing his singleengine plane to fly out over the gulf 
of mexico and crash offshore 
authorities came across the pilots parachute and some of his 
clothing during a subsequent ground search but the suspected drug 
smuggler apparently escaped said petty officer joe adams a 
spokesman for the coast guard in miami 
the guy was never found adams said today we found the 
chute but unfortunately we didnt find the jumper 
petty officer luis diaz said the parachute was found shortly 
after dawn sunday near the border of everglades national park and 
about one mile south of the tamiami trail the southernmost 
eastwest route across florida 
diaz said the small plane was first picked up by us customs 
radar as it skimmed low across the gulf of mexico heading for 
southwest florida by the time it crossed the coast between the 
naples and fort myers several pursuit aircraft from customs and 
the coast guard were on its tail diaz said 
after he got over the everglades the plane began gaining 
altitude and began turning diaz said he said an infared video 
camera then taped a big object jumping out of the side of the 
aircraft at 420 am est 
as a coast guard helicopter zoomed in on the drop area us 
customs aircraft followed the plane as it flew back toward the gulf 
after the suspected pilot left the aircraft we closed in to 
take a close look and we couldnt see anyone aboard said robbie 
viator a group supervisor with the customs air wing stationed at 
homestead air force base southwest of miami 
he said customs broke off from the aircraft about 70 miles 
offshore the plane later crashed about 80 miles east of marco 
island south of naples he said 
the empty parachute was later spotted diaz said 
the chase was similar to one in april in which a parachuting 
pilot was later captured and charged with smuggling marijuana by 
aircraft in that daytime case federal aircraft chased the plane 
until it crashed 
sundays jump site was about 30 miles southwest of where a 
cocaineladen plane crashed early saturday killing the pilot 
the wreckage of the singleengine cessna 210 plane which 
contained 972 pounds of cocaine was spotted in the everglades 
several hours after a small plane was spotted on radar traveling in 
from the gulf said cliff stallings customs spokesman in miami 
the pilot apparently was trying to land in a clearing he said

two men who posed as physicians may have treated 
as many as 45000 patients before authorities indicted them along 
with four others in medicaid fraud schemes 
two doctors two pharmacists and two other men who posed as 
physicians were involved in defrauding the state of more than 
500000 attorney general neil f hartigan said sunday 
four clinics and pharmacies in chicago chicago heights robbins 
and midlothian were also implicated in the schemes 
the six men were indicted on felony charges of vendor fraud and 
theft by deception 
two of the men also were charged with practicing medicine 
without a license oscar hosenilla 48 and babu rao surapaneni 
47 performed examinations prescribed medications and ordered lab 
tests and xrays at health care clinics hartigan said 
surapaneni practiced at two clinics in south suburban robbins 
and midlothian from january 1986 to december 1988 with dr chowdary 
adusumilli 50 who also was indicted they are charged with 
billing the state for more than 40000 in fraudulent claims 
hartigan said 
hosenilla worked for dr henry pimental 52 at the reymar 
clinic and englewood clinical laboratory in chicago from july 1985 
to april 1988 the clinic was contracted through the chicago health 
maintenance organization to provide care to hmo members the two 
are charged with billing the state for more than 150000 in false 
claims 
the indictments were returned by a cook county grand jury late 
friday hartigans office said 
these defendants have not only put peoples lives in danger 
but robbed the state of vital funds to provide health services to 
people who are most needy hartigan said 
george smith head of the states medicaid fraud division said 
the phony doctors treated an average of 30 patients a day over a 
two and threeyear period he knew of no reported injuries or 
malpractice as a result of the fraudulent care 
i consider this scandalous hartigan said people who sign 
up rely on the hmos good faith to provide quality medical 
service 
he said his office was investigating chicago hmo to determine 
whether criminal negligence was involved and whether hmo officials 
should have known a phony doctor was practicing in a clinic 
sanctioned by them 
if found guilty the defendants would have to return the money 
they billed the state and could be sentenced to 14 years in prison 
and be fined 10000 for each offense 
in another case dr nathan potkin 74 the pharmacist for the 
rivera nursing home in suburban chicago heights billed the state 
for highpriced medications which were never ordered by the 
patients physicians and never given to patients hartigan said 
adding that potkins fraudulent claims amounted to more than 
250000 
in addition pharmacist larry white 54 submitted fraudulent 
vouchers for more than 61000 for drugs that were never prescribed 
at the larr pharmacy in chicago the attorney general said 
attempts sunday night to reach those named in the indictments 
were unsuccesful messages left with answering services for potkin 
and pimental were not immediately returned and phone numbers could 
not be found in the chicago area for the other men

demands for freeing jailed terrorists in a 
prisonerhostage swap has angered many in israel where 20 months 
of violence in the palestinian uprising has hardened attitudes 
toward arabs 
the anger however is tempered by israels tradition of gaining 
freedom for its captured soldiers at almost any price 
the proiranian hezbollah believed to be an umbrella for groups 
holding hostages has demanded that israel free kidnapped shiite 
clergyman sheik abdel karim obeid and 450 arab prisoners 
the prisoners include two palestinians charged with slayings 
that caused highly emotional public outcry 
nidal zaloum 28 stabbed two elderly israelis to death at a 
jerusalem bus stop on may 3 
abdel hadi salman rassem ghanem 23 forced an israeli bus 
into a ravine on july 6 killing 16 people 
israeli newspapers ran editorials and columns urging the 
government to bargain toughly and avoid a lopsided deal like the 
one in 1985 in which 1050 palestinians were freed from jails in 
exchange for three israeli soldiers 
israel shall have to hold fast to its position and consider 
the price so as not to repeat the mistake of four years ago the 
liberal haaretz daily wrote 
the rightwing tehiya party called for a special session of 
parliaments defense and foreign affairs committee to set rules for 
prisoner swaps that would block such an exchange 
ariel merari an expert on terrorism at tel aviv university 
noted in an interview that many of the palestinians set free in 
1985 became leaders of the palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation which began in december 1987 it has claimed the lives 
of 529 arabs and 38 israelis 
i think the government made a terrible mistake in 1985 this 
was a trauma for israel merari said israel paid dearly and 
proved a very unable negotiator 
a similar swap this time would cause a public uproar he said 
some israelis interviewed sunday at the site where zaloum staged 
his attack opposed a swap 
i am very much against it said theresa terry an immigrant 
from london as she waited at the bus stop where zaloums victims 
had sat 
they are criminals and murderers who shouldnt be free its 
ridiculous to even consider it we should swap more moderate 
people mrs terry said 
some analysts said that even though opinion polls show israelis 
favor a harder line toward arabs because of the uprising many 
would ultimately support government efforts to win freedom for 
israeli soldiers captured in lebanon 
people will be torn apart but they will do it theyll see 
the families on television reuniting with their loved ones and that 
will do it it will be accepted said eugene weiner a 
sociologist at haifa university 
israel has a long record of freeing large numbers of arab 
prisoners for small groups of soldiers this stems from a tradition 
of keeping morale high in the army by making extraordinary efforts 
to rescue soldiers from the battlefields or enemy jails 
since november 1983 during the lebanon war the government has 
released 6024 arab prisoners for only 15 israelis 
the servicemen whose return is now sought are rahamim alsheikh 
and yossi fink captured near the south lebanese village of bint 
jbeil in february 1986 and ron arad an air force navigator whose 
plane went down near sidon in october 1986 
aryeh naor a former aide to retired rightwing prime minister 
menachem begin predicted protracted negotiations but said the 
warweary public would be willing to pay the price 
people are sick of everything and want to see some quiet 
after the 1985 deal people get used to things naor said 
one of the israelis who waited at the bus stop concurred i am 
willing to make this trade with a heavy heart but the most 
important thing is for our boys to come back home said yaffa

a senior hezbollah leader says his 
proiranian group has influence over kidnappers of western hostages 
in lebanon 
the admission sunday by hussein mousawi was the first time 
hezbollah or party of god has acknowledged its relations with 
groups holding the 16 captives 
if america is able to help itself and help its hostages by 
stopping its support for israel and by not participating in 
anything that hurts moslems in lebanon this could encourage 
hezbollah to think of a way to help resolve the hostage issue 
mousawi said 
he also said hezbollah might kill a captured israeli soldier 
unless israel frees an abducted shiite moslem cleric 
mousawi spoke at a meeting with foreign reporters arranged by 
hezbollah in the ancient town of baalbek 50 miles northeast of 
beirut 
reporters asked what would happen to two israeli soldiers the 
group holds if israel does not free sheik abdul karim obeid a 
hezbollahaffiliated cleric 
if we find out that the interests of islam and moslems and the 
interests of the oppressed dictates that one of the israeli 
soldiers be killed so will it be mousawi responded 
israel refused comment on his statement 
mousawi said some members of proiranian organizations holding 
the 16 western hostages in lebanon are known to us and we hold 
consultations with them from time to time 
there are telephone calls hellos between us he added 
hezbollah consistently has denied it has anything to do with the 
abductions but the party generally is believed to be the umbrella 
for shiite moslem extremists holding most western hostages 
the kidnappers may listen to us more than they would to 
algeria because our voice is closer to them and were living 
together in the same areas mousawi said 
algerias ambassador to lebanon khaled hasnawi has said his 
country is undertaking a new initiative to free all the western 
hostages 
mousawi denied there have been any negotiations on an israeli 
offer to trade obeid and shiite prisoners for three israeli 
servicemen and all the western hostages 
let them the israelis kidnap 250 more clerics there will be 
no negotiations let them kidnap twothirds of hezbollah if they 
could there will be no negotiations he said 
israeli commandos on july 28 abducted obeid 33 with two 
companions from his house in southern lebanon 
the organization of the oppressed on earth another proiranian 
group said it killed us marine lt col william r higgins on 
july 31 because israel refused to free obeid 
higgins 44 helped command un peacekeepers in south lebanon 
until he was kidnapped on feb 17 1988 a un envoy marrack 
goulding has been in lebanon trying to find higgins body and

labor union the organization said that large and small carriers 
have hired 12000 pilots so far this year compared to 9800 for 
all of last year

an informal ladder to flying the most sophisticated commercial 
jets resulting in an exodus among military pilots and turnover of 
up to 120 percent a year for small carriers flight schools also 
are seeing more trainers leave to enter the cockpit according to 
the union known by the acronym alpa 
the military and the regional airlines together continue to 
supply a large share of the major airline pilot workforce but they 
cannot meet the present or future demand said henry a duffy 
president of the 41000member pilots union 
airline industry analysts estimate that between 40000 and 
60000 new pilots will be needed over the next decade

the captain of a norwegian hovercraft 
that sails daily between cyprus and lebanon said syrian gunners 
tried to sink the vessel when they fired dozens of rockets into the 
sea off the lebanese christian port of jounieh 
two lebanese sisters aged 15 months and 2 years drowned when a 
boat ferrying 16 passengers out to the hovercraft capsized in the 
waves churned up by the barrage before dawn sunday 
i believe we were the target firing 40 rockets isnt to scare 
you its to hit you capt sundsford asbjorn said in an 
interview in the port of larnaca 
there was no immediate comment from syrian forces who have 
besieged the enclave where 1 million christians live for five 
months they shell the coastline daily to prevent supplies of 
weapons fuel and food from getting through 
the siege started in march in retaliation for gen michel aouns 
blockade of illegal ports operated by syrianbacked moslem militias 
south of beirut he was hoping to recover an estimated 100 million 
lost annually in customs dues 
the hovercraft service began in may after regular passenger 
ferries decided it was too dangerous to continue sailing to 
jounieh under normal conditions it takes 3 hours to make the 
100mile voyage 
the blueandwhite hovercraft usually whirs into the dock at 
jounieh under cover of darkness 
but when the syrians started shelling it moved offshore and the 
passengers were ferried out in small craft 
at 2 am sunday the 320seat santa maria headed out to sea to 
avoid the shelling but turned back when the boat flipped over about 
300 yards offshore 
no matter what risks are involved you must save people so i 
turned back and put on the lights and gave the crew permission 
to jump into the sea the bearded skipper said 
navigation officer cesar abi aql 25 swam back and forth to the 
raft pulling people to safety but said he couldnt manage to save 
the baby girls 15monthold maya azar and her sister roba 
i saw the baby girls but i had another passenger clinging to 
me he said when i went back theyd disappeared 
the girls were later found and pronounced dead on arrival at the 
hospital in jounieh 
lebanese passenger jack nassar 50 and his wife jumana who 
suffered a broken leg said they struggled in choppy waters for 20 
minutes their 10yearold daughter miryam and son maroun 7 were 
among those taken back to jounieh 
i could hardly talk because i had swallowed a lot of water and 
my leg was broken my husband was weeping and screaming because 
he thought they were dead mrs nassar said at larnaca general 
hospital 
the passengers suitcases were left floating in the sea

reports said 
the death toll for the past two weeks of flooding stood at 164 
according to newspaper reports the governments body count stood 
at 30 but officials usually are slow in releasing death figures

thousands of mud and straw houses were destroyed according to the 
relief ministry officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
new floods hit 30 villages in the area on sunday killing six 
men and three children and marooning 100000 others the annual 
deluge had already stranded about 300000 people across a 
400squaremile area

relief ministry official two helipads that had been built in the 
area for relief operations were under 2 feet of water and roads 
and telecommunications were cut he said 
officials said the most severely hit region was the teagrowing 
zakiganj area in sylhet district 120 miles northeast of dhaka

prime minister david lange whose 
opposition to nuclear weapons resulted in the banning of us 
warships from his country today announced his resignation 
the surprise announcement came one day before a meeting of his 
leftleaning labor party which last week elected his chief rival 
former finance minister roger douglas to the cabinet 
citing poor health the 47yearold prime minister said he will 
step down tuesday lange hospitalized last year for a heart 
condition said he is looking forward to a healthy future 
it will not however be as prime minister lange told the 
news conference in the capital of this former british colony in the 
south pacific with a population of 33 million 
he said he had stopped the juggernaut of the new right a 
barb at douglas who was dismissed by lange last year following a 
public row over the direction of economic policy 
it was good to walk out of there the cabinet while they 
still clapped me said lange who stepped into the limelight in 
1984 by declaring nuclear warships unwelcome and stepped down when 
disputes over internal economic policies refused to go away 
australian prime minister bob hawke said that despite some 
policy differences we cooperated very closely and effectively in 
bilateral and south pacific issues 
papua new guineas prime minister rabbie namaliu said from 
port moresby that lange brought commonsense to western politics 
insofar as it affected the pacific region 
even though his tough stand on issues such as nuclear 
disarmament and the environment made him unpopular with most 
western leaders he pursued his policies in the interests of the 
pacific region and its people namaliu said 
while political observers said douglas reemergence was the 
true reason for langes resignation the exfinance minister 
sounded conciliatory in a statement today 
douglas said lange led new zealand with extraordinary 
distinction through the most difficult period of its postwar 
history and that no labor government since world war ii has 
accomplished more than this labor government under his leadership 
lange said his successor would be chosen at the party meeting 
the new zealand press association said lange had been expected 
to announce today a new job for douglas a conservative who was 
elected to the cabinet last week lange and douglas have publicly 
feuded since douglas resigned late last year 
lange allowed douglas to deregulate industries remove subsidies 
and privatize government departments lange however opposed 
douglas proposed flat tax for hitting the poor hardest while 
douglas alleged the prime minister was governing in a presidential 
style and making unilateral decisions 
political observers in new zealand say douglas was voted back 
into the cabinet more because of his skills as a hardnosed 
tenacious politician than his political leanings 
lange made it clear today that while he will stay on in 
parliament representing mangere an auckland suburb he would not 
be talked out of his decision to resign and would not accept a 
cabinet post 
the new zealand press association citing unidentified sources 
reported that two centrists thirdranking cabinet minister mike 
moore and deputy prime minister geoffrey palmer were the 
frontrunners to succeed lange douglas also was seen as a 
contender 
lange survived two leadership challenges the past year both led 
by supporters of douglas in december douglas ran against lange 
and was defeated 3515 commerce minister david butcher moved a 
vote of no confidence in june and lange survived the challenge by a 
margin of less than 10 votes 
lange a lawyer entered parliament in 1977 and six years later 
became labor party leader 
at 41 he became new zealands youngest prime minister of the 
century and the second youngest ever after he led the labor party 
to a landslide 1984 election victory over the national party 
in 1987 he became the first labor party leader in 49 years to 
win a second straight threeyear term and was expected to dominate 
the pacific nations politics beyond the 1990 election 
as prime minister lange gained international publicity over his 
firm antinuclear stance which effectively put an end to the 
berthing of us warships in new zealand ports 
lange announced that his government would not allow nuclear 
ships to visit new zealand ports despite us objections his 
action amounted to a fundamental shift in usnew zealand policy 
and new zealand was excluded from council meetings of the 
australiannew zealandus defense alliance known as anzus 
however that country has not formally withdrawn from the 
ministerial council despite a threat in april by lange 
in domestic issues langes government eliminated farm price 
supports and turned governmentowned enterprises such as railroads 
coal mines electricity the post office and telecommunications 
into profitmaking corporations

hubert beuvemery who founded le monde in 1944 and 
made it frances leading daily has died at age 87 the newspaper 
announced today 
beuvemery died sunday night in fontainebleau where he had been 
hospitalized for the past week after a serious fall le monde said 
he was a great leader jacques fauvet beuvemerys 
successor as editorinchief and publisher of le monde said on 
french radio he had great independence of spirit and moral 
authority at the same time 
the austere tabloid its grey expanses only rarely broken by 
photographs became known for its authoritative and complete 
coverage of foreign and domestic affairs complete with footnotes 
in tiny print 
only a constant emulation between those who read a newspaper 
and those who edit it can permit the pursuit with some chance of 
success of this quest for truth which is our principal reason for 
being beuvemery wrote on his retirement in 1969

syrian and christian forces fought 
nightlong duels with artillery and tank fire across the capitals 
dividing green line and five people were killed police said today 
two of the overnight fatalities were in christian east beirut 
and three in the moslem west side said a police spokesman who 
cannot be named under standing rules he said 16 people were 
wounded 
it was the 12th straight night of random bombardment that has 
forced more than one million of beiruts 15 million inhabitants to 
flee to safer areas in lebanon or abroad 
the latest casualties raised the overall total to 547 killed and 
1300 wounded since the latest round in lebanons 14yearold civil 
war erupted march 8 
the captain of a norwegian hovercraft that sails daily from 
cyprus to lebanon said syrian gunners sunday tried to sink his 
vessel by firing 40 rockets into the sea off the christian port of 
jounieh 
two lebanese sisters aged 15 months and 2 years drowned when a 
boat ferrying 16 passengers to the hovercraft capsized in waves 
churned up by the syrian barrage 
syrian gunners bombard the enclaves coastline daily in order to 
prevent supplies of weapons and fuel reaching the christians 
the latest round in lebanons 14year civil war erupted in 
march when christian army commander gen michel aoun blockaded 
illegal ports operated by syrianbacked moslem militias south of 
beirut that deny the state treasury of aorund 100 million a year 
in lost customs dues 
the syrians joined their militia allies in shelling the 
christian enclave and also blocked its land exits 
police said the syrian army on saturday brought dozens of t62 
tanks and bm21 multirocket launchers that can fire 40 rockets a 
minute into west beirut and the hills overlooking the capital 
the reinforcements arrived amid rumors that aouns 20000 troops 
might storm west beirut to seize lebanons central bank where most 
of the nations hard currency and gold reserves are stored 
around 40000 syrian troops have been stationed in lebanon since 
1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
but aoun charges the syrians lost their credibility as 
peacekeepers by siding with the moslems in their fight for an equal 
share of power with the traditionally dominant christians 
the 54yearold maronite catholic general has vowed a war of 
liberation to drive the syrians out 
king fahd of saudi arabia king hassan ii of morocco and 
algerian president chedli bendjedid agreed at an arab summit 
conference at casablanca morocco in may to mediate for a 
settlement of the civil war 
their foreign ministers shuttled between beirut and damascus for 
two months with a mandate to arrange a peace settlement by 
november but announced two weeks ago that the peacemaking efforts 
had reached a dead end

ten years after gleaming silver trains started 
rolling along the souths first rapidtransit system a 1582mile 
network of 150 bus routes and two rail lines with 29 stations 
carries a quartermillion passengers a day 
the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority has been hailed 
for its safety and cleanliness marta celebrated its trains 10th 
birthday with a freeride day on july 4 that drew a record 435000 
passengers a revitalized underground atlanta draws up to 100000 
extra passengers a week many of them firsttime riders 
but marta has a problem it increasingly goes where much of 
atlanta isnt 
when marta was launched in 1971 the three suburban counties 
that refused it cobb to the northwest gwinnett to the northeast 
and clayton to the south were largely rural and it was hard to 
imagine subway cars rolling past farms and forests those three 
counties now hold nearly 900000 people threefourths the number 
in the two central counties fulton and dekalb where marta runs 
despite suburban traffic that is getting worse and suburban jobs 
that go begging because carless workers cant reach them 
opposition to expanding the system remains joining would almost 
surely mean higher taxes and suburban politicians have been loath 
to submit to decisionmakers in atlanta 
but the chief reason given by many opponents is the fear marta 
will bring crime to their tranquil neighborhoods that feeling is 
widely seen as racism martas passengers reflect central atlanta 
which is predominantly black 
atlantans may not like to discuss it but few havent heard the 
acronym explained as moving africans rapidly through atlanta 
the people you hear opposing marta in cobb and gwinnett 
theyve been pretty open about it they dont want black people 
coming into their areas said the rev joseph lowery a civil 
rights leader and a member of martas board since 1975 its 
blind prejudice and fear 
we feel its in everyones interest to have a regional transit 
agency providing all the service said general manager kenneth m 
gregor it makes sense its much more costeffective 
unencumbered by the problems of numerous political jurisdictions i 
think that position ultimately will prevail 
i think martas future is contingent on that said lowery 
its maximum potential will never be realized until we go north to 
cobb and gwinnett and south to clayton we at least need five 
counties 
endoftheline stops on martas crossshaped rail system do a 
booming business as thousands of cobb and gwinnett residents drive 
across the county line and hop on the train some luxury hotels in 
cobb have even sent vans to ferry workers across the chattahoochee 
river which marks the county line 
but marta trains and buses arent going to cross that bridge 
anytime soon 
theyre pretty much against it at least in my end of the 
county said gwinnett county commissioner curtis mcgill a 
number of the people who have moved into the south end are 
transplants from dekalb county and a lot of them feel like marta 
ran them out of town 
without being obvious people say that ease of transportation 
would bring in the undesirables and crime said gwinnett county 
commission chairman lillian webb who has advocated at least a 
trial run of marta buses 
even talking about marta can be tricky in the suburbs a 
discussion group with cobb county leaders in 1980 had a code name 
so folks wouldnt know about it gregor said 
but more and more suburban atlanta may be coming to the 
conclusion that something must be done a onemile trip down a 
major thoroughfare in cobb or gwinnett can take more than a 
halfhour and residents of those counties named traffic as their 
no 1 problem in a recent atlanta journalconstitution poll 
the poll found between 54 percent and 60 percent of cobb 
gwinnett and clayton county residents favored marta trains in their 
communities although only in cobb county were a majority willing 
to pay the 1 percent sales tax that fulton and dekalb county 
residents pay for marta 
meanwhile cobb county last month launched its own fiveroute 
bus system ten thousand people used it the first week more than 
twice the volume expected for the first three weeks forcing 
officials to drop a radio advertising campaign for fear they 
wouldnt be able to meet the demand 
the busiest cobb community transit route is one dropping 
commuters at a midtown atlanta marta subway station ultimately 
the service plans 10 routes including three more atlanta express 
runs riders get free transfers to marta under a deal that allows 
marta riders to hop on cobb countys buses 
the system costing the county an estimated 2 million a year 
makes more sense than giving marta an estimated 65 million a year 
in local sales taxes said craig aronoff chairman of the cct 
advisory board it doesnt look like it would make sense to 
provide more than we provide martas the best system in the 
country but it doesnt have all the answers 
in my judgment theyre fooling themselves gregor said 
ten bus routes arent going to even dent arent going to put an 
infinitesimal impact on their traffic congestion and starting a 
bus system that brings four routes in the city of atlanta aint 
going to do it 
clayton county has no public transportation gwinnett which has 
none either will vote next year on some sort of mass transit 
referendum mrs webb hopes it will once and for all answer 
questions like what the county wants and will pay for 
i hope theyll use reason and understanding rather than 
illogical rationale she said pointing out that the countys 
330000 population will more than double in the next 20 years 
the sheer mathematics of it says we have got to come up with some 
method of handling all those people 
its inevitable its time to fish or cut bait

black lay catholics attending a threeday meeting 
took no stand on whether to endorse a separate africanamerican 
rite within the church 
leaders of the national office for black catholics and the 
national black lay caucus said sunday they would study written 
comments collected at the conference before issuing a statement on 
the rite 
members of the national black catholic clergy caucus 
representing priests and monks endorsed at a meeting july 27 in 
milwaukee the study of such a rite which would have its own 
liturgy and its own hierarchy of priests and bishops 
black catholics questioning of their role in the american 
church intensified last month when the rev george a stallings a 
washington dc priest was suspended for forming a separate 
black congregation over the objections of his archbishop cardinal 
james a hickey 
the executive director of the office for black catholics walter 
hubbard said he expects the tone of the statement to be 
conciliatory 
there must be some reconciliation hubbard said there 
must be some healing i think cardinal hickey has been an 
outstanding shepherd for his flock but theres also a deep respect 
for father stallings we want to extend our hands to both of them 
hubbard said black lay leaders have plans for an institute to 
train lay members he said a faculty and curriculum are being 
formed but no site has been chosen 
the need for greater lay involvement in the church was echoed 
throughout the atlanta conference whose theme was creating a 
spirit of africanamerican leadership 
plans for a national day of prayer for africanamericans on the 
first sunday in february were announced by the rev james goode 
pastor of st paul of the shipwreck church in san francisco

israeli officials speaking after radical 
shiites in lebanon proposed to swap a us hostage for 450 arabs 
held by israel said today there would be no exchange unless three 
israeli servicemen were freed 
if we wont get the israelis there wont be a deal said 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel 
there were also rightwing calls for retaliation if any israeli 
captives were harmed rafael eytan an exchief of staff said that 
if proiranian guerrillas carried out a threat to kill a captured 
israeli soldier israel should retalitate by executing 10 of 
theirs 
israel officials said those remarks carried no authority and did 
not represent the views of the government 
defense minister yitzhak rabin speaking on the cbs face the 
nation program sunday said israel would not accept dealing only 
for the 16 western hostages 
avi pazner a top aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
it is obvious we will not agree to a partial exchange 
an israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
israel would not even start negotiations unless israeli prisoners 
were part of the deal 
israeli officials said however that while diplomatic contacts 
were being made no official negotiations had begun and israel had 
not yet been delivered any demands through the international 
committee of the red cross 
asked about the threat made by a shiite leader hussein mousawi 
to kill an israeli soldier liel said israeli policy was to hold 
iran and syria responsible for the safety of the prisoners 
we see hezbollah and countries that are its patrons as 
responsible for the fate and safety of the hostages said liel 
officials said iran provides money and guidance to hezbollah 
the umbrella for shiite groups believed to be holding hostages in 
lebanon syria they noted controlled the territory on which 
hostages were held and could put military pressure on the groups 
ehud olmert the cabinet minister responsible for arab affairs 
said there would be a reaction if israeli pows were harmed but 
he declined to give details saying that could be harmful to 
negotiations 
in addition to the 150 lebanese and 300 palestinian prisoners 
hezbollah wants israel to free sheik abdul karim obeid a lebanese 
shiite clergyman with ties to hezbollah who was kidnapped from 
southern lebanon by israeli troops on july 28 
olmert reiterated that israel would not free obeid unless 
israeli prisoners were part of an exchange 
israeli spokesmen said their comments were statements of policy 
and not in response to hezbollahs offer to free us hostage 
joseph cicippio for obeid and the arab prisoners 
i dont think we should relate to each and every statement the 
hezbollah is making pazner said when asked about the offer 
another official said of the various messages from lebanon we 
dont know how authorized those statements are 
eytan who commanded israels 1982 invasion of lebanon 
suggested israel should kidnap additional shiite leaders if more 
bargaining chips were needed for a prisoner swap 
we have one good bargaining card eytan said on israel 
radio referring to obeid if one card is not enough we have to 
go in one night and bring back a few more cards and again the next 
night if they threaten well threaten back lebanon is a box full 
of cards 
if they god forbid execute one of our people we have to kill 
10 of theirs eytan added 
israel army radio quoted geula cohen a legislator of the 
rightwing tehiya party as calling on rabin to put obeid on trial 
and demand the death penalty if any israeli soldiers are harmed 
cohen also criticized the government for proposing to release 
all the shiite prisoners held by israel she said a lopsided swap 
in 1985 in which 1050 arabs were released for three israeli pows 
planted the seeds for the palestinian uprising in the west bank and 
gaza strip 
according to unofficial estimates israel holds about 400 
shiites more than 8000 palestinians are in israeli jails in 
connection with the 20monthold palestinian uprising 
army spokesman declined comment on a cbs report that israeli 
troops were on alert along the northern border following a threat 
to israeli captives the situation

us and soviet negotiators today ended the first 
talks on cutting longrange nuclear forces since president bush 
took office and a soviet representative said they failed to bridge 
major disagreements 
soviet chief envoy yuri nazarkin said the sevenweek session 
made progress on some technical points however he added 
whatever progress has been made does not involve to my regret 
solutions to major outstanding issues 
responding to a bush administration proposal nazarkin said 
testing anticheating measures before a treaty is complete could 
be helpful he said moscow is reviewing the proposal 
the 4yearold negotiations which include spacebased missile 
defenses will resume sept 25 after a sept 1920 meeting between 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze in the united states they are expected to 
discuss arms control 
both sides have acknowledged that full agreement on a strategic 
arms reduction treaty is not in sight 
a major dispute from the beginning has centered on us plans 
for spacebased missile defenses known as the strategic defense 
initiative or star wars moscow links a treaty to what washington 
considers crippling restrictions on such a system 
disagreement also persists on longrange nuclear crise missiles 
based at sea moscow wants to include them under the treatys 
limits washington refuses saying their presence cannot be 
monitored reliably progress was reported on monitoring provisions 
for mobile missiles but the sides still disagree on whether they 
should be allowed at all the united states wants to ban the 
weapons which it does not have the soviets who have such 
missiles reject a ban 
however many details of an agreement have already been worked 
out including mutual limits of 6000 nuclear warheads 
the draft treaty covers nuclear forces with ranges above 3400 
miles including intercontinental missiles and heavy bombers

the weather outlook improved greatly 
today as a blackedout countdown advanced toward a tuesday launch 
of space shuttle columbia on a mission to put a spy satellite into 
orbit 
the mission will be columbias first flight in 3 years during 
which nasas oldest shuttle was used for spare parts 
forecasters said there was only a 5 percent chance of 
unfavorable weather interfering with the launch that was down from 
sundays prediction of 20 percent to 40 percent based on the 
possibility of clouds lingering in the area 
its looking very good said capt ken warren an air force 
spokesman 
the five astronauts received briefings on launch preparations as 
sources reported the countdown today entered a planned 17hour 
hold a period reserved for catching up on any lagging work the 
sources reported there was little catchup to do 
because the mission is classified the pentagon will permit nasa 
to say only that liftoff will occur between 730 am and 1130 
am tuesday 
the space agency will make the countdown public just nine 
minutes before launch and will provide only three brief 
announcements during the fiveday mission on the spacecrafts 
condition and on the landing time at edwards air force base in 
california 
the defense department has determined that the longer we can 
keep the launch time and the type of payload under wraps the less 
chance anyone has of tracking it and learning what it is warren 
said 
published reports and sources who requested anonymity have said 
the astronauts will put into orbit a sophisticated satellite to 
gather intelligence over the soviet union china the middle east 
and other areas of military interest 
commanding the crew is air force col brewster shaw a veteran 
of two earlier shuttle flights including a 1983 trip on columbia 
the other crew members are navy cmdr richard richards navy cmdr 
david leestma army lt col james adamson and air force maj mark 
brown 
columbia the oldest shuttle will be making its eighth flight 
but its first since it was launched just 16 days before the 
challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts on jan 28 1986 
following the accident nasa concentrated first on making safety 
modifications to sister ships discovery and atlantis and each has 
made two space trips since flights resumed last september 
returning the veteran columbia to flight status will give nasa 
three orbiters to handle an increasing flight rate three more 
missions are planned this year and nine in 1990 
asked by reporters saturday if he had confidence in riding in a 
shuttle that had been grounded so long commander shaw replied 
absolutely you bet i do i wouldnt fly it if i didnt i 
flew columbia a long time ago its a great machine and it will be 
great again

a senior un official said today after 
meeting with moslem leaders in lebanon that circumstances might 
be more conducive now to resolve the problem of western hostages 
held there 
but un undersecretarygeneral marrack goulding said that could 
be brought about only through a long process of quiet and patient 
diplomacy in which many governments and organizations would have 
to take part 
officials in israel which last week captured a moslem cleric 
sheik abdul karim obeid reiterated today there would be no 
exchange of captives unless three israeli servicemen were part of 
the swap 
if we wont get the israelis there wont be a deal said 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman alon liel in jerusalem 
rightwing legislators also called for retaliation if any israelis 
were harmed 
kidnappers holding us hostage joseph cicippio on sunday 
offered to release him immediately if israel frees obeid and 450 
arab prisoners and allows 55 palestinian deportees to return home 
goulding spoke after two meetings he held in west beirut with 
acting moslem prime minister salim hoss and sheik mohammed hussein 
fadlallah spiritual guide of hezbollah or party of god 
the shiite moslem fundamentalist party is believed to be the 
umbrella of proiranian extremist factions holding most of the 
western hostages in lebanon 
hezbollah leader hussein mousawi said an israeli soldier his 
group holds could be killed if obeid kidnapped by israeli 
commandos july 28 is not released 
goulding who heads un peacekeeping operations said he has 
completed his fiveday mission in the middle east to determine 
whether us marine lt col william r higgins has been killed by 
his proiranian captors 
the un envoy said he did not obtain any solid evidence that 
higgins is dead or alive higgins captors last monday said they 
killed higgins and released a videotape purportedly showing him 
hanging from a scaffold but no body has been released 
goulding said he would fly back to new york fairly soon to 
report to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
i would say without claiming to be optimistic this is 
something that many people have said to me that there are certain 
tendencies certain trends in the international climate which 
suggest that circumstances may be more conducive to a settlement to 
the hostages problem now than they have been sometime in the 
past he said without elaborating 
algerian ambassador khaled hasnawi who also has been trying to 
win the release of western hostages met with hoss and later with 
sheik sobhi tofaili a senior hezbollah leader but declined to say 
if any progress was made 
cicippios lebanese wife elham ghandour a secretary at the 
us embassy in beirut said she felt encouraged by sundays offer 
from her husbands kidnappers the revolutionary justice 
organization 
however one of cicippios brothers thomas said from 
norristown pa that he was not happy with the offer because it 
did not mention freedom for the other foreigners held hostage in 
lebanon 
a poll released sunday indicated that most americans believe the 
united states should negotiate to free the hostages and should 
refrain from bombing terrorist hideouts in lebanon 
of the 500 people surveyed in the time magazinecable news 
network poll 58 percent support negotiations while 39 percent 
oppose such talks asked whether they support bombing terrorist 
hideouts if innocent people might be killed 60 percent said no 
and 33 percent said yes 
bush reportedly asked algeria to intercede to stop cicippios 
captors from killing him but the united states has refused to 
negotiate with what it considers terrorists it takes no position 
on israels policy of offering to negotiate with hostagetakers for 
the release of captives in lebanon 
secretary of state james a baker iii in mexico city for a 
conference of us and mexican cabinet members reiterated the 
policy sunday when asked about the demands for cicippios release 
if the united states were to get into that game wed simply 
see a lot more americans taken hostage around the world he said 
the proposal by revolutionary justice was contained in a 
handwritten statement in arabic and delivered to the independent 
beirut newspaper annahar the statement was accompanied by an 
instant photograph of american hostage edward tracy whom the group 
also holds 
it was the first time revolutionary justice has said it would 
free cicippio 58 a hostage since sept 12 1986 
the group threatened last week to kill cicippio if obeid was not 
freed israel says obeid instigated attacks on the jewish state 
less than an hour before the deadline set for cicippios death

and freedom for palestinian and lebanese guerrillas held by israel 
mousawi told reporters that if the united states is able to 
help itself and help its hostages by stopping its support for 
israel and by not participating in anything that hurts moslems in 
lebanon this could encourage hezbollah to think of a way to 
help resolve the hostage issue 
he also said some members of proiranian organizations holding 
hostages are known to us and we hold consultations with them 
from time to time 
it was the first time hezbollah has publicly acknowledged it has 
contacts with such groups 
of the 16 foreigners held in lebanon eight are americans held 
longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani today denied a british

secretary of labor elizabeth dole urged civil 
rights leaders today to join in an effort to assure blacks of the 
education and skills needed to compete in the presentday world 
i firmly believe that we will not totally eliminate 
discrimination from our society until we have stamped it out of our 
economy mrs dole said in a speech to the annual conference of 
the national urban league 
and we will not stamp it out of our economy until every black 
american has the chance to gain the education the skills and the 
training required to compete and succeed in todays complex global 
market 
mrs dole spoke a day after john e jacob president of the 
urban league accused the supreme court of playing dice with the 
lives of americas minorities and said the league will look to 
president bush and congress for progress in civil rights 
we have disagreed with the new bush administration on a number 
of important policy issues jacob said in his keynote address 
sunday at the opening of the leagues annual conference 
but we welcome the fresh winds of openness it has brought to 
our government jacob said 
mrs dole noted that on july 25 she announced 14 planning grants 
to 12 cities and two rural areas to be used to develop blueprints 
for getting atrisk youth into the economic mainstream 
this is just the type of mobilization that you in the urban 
league have been doing so well for so long she said with all 
you have accomplished however today i ask you to do more 
there is an urban league affiliate in each of the 12 major 
cities that received a grant mrs dole said i am requesting 
that these affiliates contact civic leaders to become involved in 
the planning process 
the cities receiving the grants are chicago washington 
baltimore new york philadelphia atlanta miami columbus 
cleveland detroit los angeles and san diego 
jacob implored congress and the bush administration to lessen 
the impact of recent high court rulings that he said were 
anticivil rights 
unless these decisions are rolled back jacob said women and 
minorities wont be allowed to play catchup theyll be stuck 
with the effects of past discrimination 
he cited recent court rulings against contracts set aside for 
minority businesses preventing women and minorities from 
challenging standing seniority systems limiting the use of 
statistics in proving patterns of discrimination and putting 
greater burdens of proof on victims of discrimination 
the court is playing dice with the lives of americas 
minorities and its loading the dice against them jacob said 
we call on the president and the congress to carefully review 
the courts anticivil rights decisions and to frame corrective 
legislation he said 
the urbaan league president also called for a war against drugs 
adding that it doesnt mean a just say no campaign although we 
will teach our children to say no 
he said the league will press congress for real action to stop 
drugs from coming into the country and for resources for 
treatment centers so that anyone on drugs can get off them

the frontrunner in japans race for prime minister 
said today the nation should play a greater role in the world 
including helping soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reform 
efforts 
a second candidate suggested a global new deal policy using 
japans wealth to benefit other nations 
all three candidates agreed japans governing party is in need 
of rescue following money and sex scandals which contributed to its 
losing its majority in parliaments upper house voters also were 
angered by a new 3 percent sales tax 
prime minister sousuke uno announced his resignation to take 
responsibility for his liberal democratic partys july 23 election 
defeat 
on tuesday the party votes for a new leader who will become 
prime minister because of the governing partys majority in the 
more powerful lower house 
the candidates presented their positions today in speeches to 
party members that were nationally televised 
toshiki kaifu 58 seen as most likely to win because of backing 
by major party factions said it is not enough for japan to 
simply maintain the security treaty with the united states and not 
to play a more responsible role now that japan has grown so 
powerful and economically affluent 
we are responsible for fulfilling the worlds expectations of 
japan said kaifu a former education minister 
aside from the soviet unions restructuring plan kaifu 
suggested japan could contribute to the opening of east european 
countries 
he stressed his determination to rescue the governing party 
adding i believe the ldps resurrection is the only way for 
japan to maintain freedom democracy peace and affluence 
kaifu is running against shintaro ishihara 56 a former 
transport minister from the partys nationalist wing and former 
welfare minister yoshiro hayashi 62 none of the three has a 
strong personal power base in the party but most senior party 
leaders have been tainted by an influencepeddling scandal 
parliament is expected to confirm the new party leader as prime 
minister on wednesday he will be japans third prime minister in 
slightly more than two months noboru takeshita stepped down on 
june 2 because of the influencebuying scandal 
hayashi proposed the global new deal to aid other nations 
but gave no details 
he also stressed the need to clean up the party image 
public anger toward the party has not calmed down even after 
our election defeat he said there seems to be persistent 
distrust and anger among the people 
ishihara a bestselling novelist declared the partys 
leadership still lacks a sense of crisis it seems as though the 
prime concern for many party members is no more than 
selfprotection i think the ldps decline has come to the point 
where it cant fall any further 
ishihara is coauthor of a recently published book the japan 
that can say no and he repeated that theme of independence today 
i am never an antiamerican but we have to get up and say 
what we have to say we should cooperate when we can cooperate and 
we have to say no when unreasonable demands are made he said

hes getting older and he trains on 
cookies for breakfast and hamburgers for lunch by mike bender is 
still the toughest cop alive 
thats the title he brought back from the world police and fire 
games a weeklong competition last week in vancouver british 
columbia bender has won the title every time since the biennial 
games began in 1985 
it was a killer he said but it was worth it because this 
shows that cops from a small town can beat the entire los angeles 
police department 
bender is a detective with the simi valley police department in 
this suburb of about 100000 residents 35 miles from downtown los 
angeles 
although hes 34 bender asked to enter the category for men 29 
and under considered the competitions toughest he then climbed 
a 20foot rope faster heaved a shot put farther ran faster and 
did more pullups 38 than any of his competitors there were 166 
competitors from us police departments big and small 
bender said this years competition may be his last ive had 
my fill of competing he said i look forward to helping judge 
the contest in 1991 
sgt tony harper benders former supervisor is skeptical 
noting the detective has said the same thing before 
one thing about police work is that we keep getting older but 
the crooks are always about 19 or 20 harper said its nice to 
have someone fit like mike around

clovis maksoud the arab league observer at 
the united nations expressed optimism today that intense 
diplomatic efforts will lead to the freeing of all hostages in 
lebanon 
i think the prospects of success are much more preponderant 
than at any time before maksoud told a news conference at the 
national press club here 
the negotiations have been intensified he said there is 
a better chance to return all hostages 
maksoud credited what he said is an improved diplomatic 
environment new developments in iran and the involvement of 
algeria syria and the international red cross 
he contended that the abduction by israeli commandos of shiek 
abdul karim obeid a militant moslem cleric is not a factor in the 
potential release of hostages 
if there is to be a release of all the hostages it is not 
because israel did the kidnapping of obeid he said 
the release of the hostages would be the result of mediation 
efforts he said

an estranged couples battle over the 
fate of seven fertilized human eggs went to trial today with the 
womans lawyer contending the embryos are preborn children 
with rights of their own 
the question of how we classify these embryos is vital jay 
christenberry said in his opening statement at the unprecedented 
divorce trial while the couples rights are important there are 
other rights we must consider 
he is attorney for mary sue davis 28 of maryville her husband 
of 10 years junior lewis davis filed for divorce in february 
he is seeking to block her from attempting to become pregnant 
with any of the eggs fertilized when the couple took part in an 
invitro fertilization program six years ago in an unsuccessful 
effort to have a child davis says that now that they are 
divorcing he does not want to have a child with her 
the position of junior lewis davis is that no disposition of 
the preembryos should be made until he and mary davis agree that 
their rights in this very unique material are joint and equal 
said charles clifford davis attorney 
before the trial opened circuit judge w dale young said he was 
troubled by the fact that i dont have any guidance to help me 
ferret out the right decision in this case 
but thatll come along and im comfortable that itll be done 
in a professional manner he told cbs 
in his opening statement christenberry said that a central 
question in the case is where life begins he said the frozen 
eggs should be labeled preborn children 
shortly after the divorce case was filed mrs davis said that 
the eggs are the result of years of surgery tests and injections 
and are her best chance at having a child 
i consider them life she said she also said she would 
consider raising the child by herself and not asking for child 
support 
davis countered at the time that it would be unsettling to 
know that 10 years from now i could be walking down the street 
and bump into my child and not know it 
mrs davis says she had five tubal pregnancies after the couple 
were married in 1979 one resulting in a ruptured fallopian tube 
surgery was done to tie the other tube before the davises entered 
the testtube baby program administered by dr i ray king 
there originally were nine fertilized eggs two were 
unsuccessfully implanted before the couples marriage broke down 
king is recommending the other eggs remain in his control later 
to be donated anonymously to an infertile couple 
the davises did not sign a contract saying what should be done 
with the embryos in the event of divorce or the death of one or 
both partners king says that was an oversight but that such an 
agreement probably could be contested in court anyway 
the lack of such a contract and the absence of precedents 
leaves young with little guidance 
attorneys said the case is the first of its kind in the country 
apparently the only state with a law on the rights of embryos is 
louisiana which says they are entitled to the full protection of 
the law and cannot be owned or destroyed

blacks are now swimming in what had been a 
whitesonly pool and some said the opening of the waters was long 
overdue 
its about time said bernard daniel 34 who stopped on his 
way to a wedding saturday to witness the end of the saluda swim and 
tennis clubs segregation policy 
a few black families bought memberships which were sold for 
half price because the summer is half over about five blacks swam 
as did about the same number of whites the parking lot was filled 
though with people who stopped for a glimpse 
janet sibert brought her two children and purchased a membership 
saturday im happy the kids will be able to swim said mrs 
sibert who works in saluda but lives in greenwood about 28 miles 
away 
i want my children to feel good about themselves and know they 
can swim where they want to she said 
the pool in this town 45 miles south of columbia was closed july 
26 following publicity about the clubs refusal july 13 to admit 
three black youths who were part of a church group that had 
arranged to use the pool 
the land on which the club stands was deeded to the town in 1933 
with the stipulation that it was for the use by the white 
children of the county and town of saluda the stipulation 
remained when the town sold the land to the saluda jaycees for 5 
in 1955 
the club rents the land from the jaycees and enforced the rule 
after the church group complained the jaycees ordered the pool 
closed until it was desegregated 
daniel said that when he and a friend tried to obtain a pool 
membership three years ago they were refused 
i was told it was for white men recalled daniel who is 
black nothing was done at the time although there were people 
here who knew it was wrong he said 
robert booth president of the pools sevenmember board of 
directors said he was pleased that the pool opened under the 
desegregation policy 
its going well he said i feel like blacks will start 
coming to the pool 
jamie willis 17 who is white said they probably wouldnt 
they think theyre not wanted there said miss willis who 
was watching and said she was not a club member 
she also said that the 80 seasonal membership fee might be too 
expensive for many people in the mostly rural town of about 3000 
people

treasury secretary nicholas brady said today 
that the mexican government has shown a much greater interest in 
fighting drug trafficking since the administration of president 
carlos salinas de gortari took office 
brady also praised the salinas administrations economic program 
and said a recently negotiated debtreduction agreement may have 
been so successful that a 2 billion us bridge loan may be 
less necessary 
i take my hat off to the salinas administration brady told 
a news conference in discussing the mexican governments economic 
policies 
brady was joining secretary of state james a baker iii and 
three other cabinet members in talks today with mexican officials 
like baker he expressed optimism that usmexican relations are 
on solid footing after a long period of crossborder friction 
before the meeting of the usmexico binational commission 
brady and other us officials gave high marks to salinas 
eightmonthold administration for its handling of economic policy 
and for cracking down on drug smugglers 
we have seen an enormous increase in the interest of the 
mexican government in fighting the drug problem said brady 
areas where the united states will be seeking cooperation 
include increased requirements for reporting transactions stronger 
forfeiture and seizure laws the criminilization of money 
laundering and the idea of making money laundering an extraditable 
offense 
discussing the twoweekold agreement to reduce mexicos 54 
billion debt to commercial banks brady said he thought the pact 
would succeed in its major goal of giving mexico 3 billion a year 
for capital investment 
he said the agreement would save mexico 10 billion over 
previous debt agreements which involved rescheduling payments and 
increased loans but did not provide for any actual debt reduction 
he said a reduction in domestic interest rates brought about by 
the debt agreement will by itself save the mexican government 
another 10 billion a year and noted that the agreement had 
already brought about a heavy influx of capital from abroad 
he said the united states was prepared to provide a 2 billion 
shortterm bridge loan to help mexico while the debt agreement is 
finalized but said the capital flow may make it less necessary 
he said discussions have been held on debt reduction with the 
philippines costa rica venezuela and morocco but that two of the 
largest debtors argentina and brazil have not put in the kind of 
economic program that would qualify them for an agreement 
they have to bite the bullet and make the tough choices 
said brady 
he praised the salinas administration for its continuing efforts 
to open up the mexican economy to competition both foreign and 
domestic noting that recent deregulation of the trucking industry 
had reduced rates by 20 percent 
he said the negotiations between mexico and commercial banks had 
almost broken down several times points in time where people 
said well this is just too hard 
but the compelling nature of the idea the drive to reality 
made it clear that this was an idea whose time had come brady 
said 
the drug and economic issues were among many that baker and the 
40 other members of the us delegation were taking up during their 
daylong discussions with mexican officials us officials said 
they could not recall a larger or higherranking delegation ever 
turning up for a meeting in a foreign capital 
other cabinet officials in the group are attorney general dick 
thornburgh commerce secretary robert mosbacher and us trade 
representative carla hills 
also on the agenda for the talks were immigration law 
enforcement the environment border cooperation and fisheries 
trade and investment and cultural relations 
the binational commission was established eight years ago and 
serves as a forum for regular meetings among officials from the two 
countries 
the bush administration views salinas team as generally more 
pragmatic and less ideological than the administration of former 
president miguel de la madrid who was succeeded by salinas in 
december

the state department on monday warned 
americans to avoid unnecessary travel in sri lanka because of 
political tension and the widespread potential for violence in that 
island nation 
the travel advisory which expands on an earlier warning came 
the day after the new york times published a story about a 
30yearold american tourist who disappeared traveling alone in sri 
lanka on march 28 
the parents of the woman sandra valentine of new york have 
tried to learn her whereabouts 
theres no area of the country that we would indicate people 
should go to without taking appropriate precautions said richard 
boucher the department spokesman 
the earlier advisory listed some areas as safer than others in 
the country where ethnic tamil rebels are waging civil war 
boucher said the case of ms valentine is a symptom of the 
kind of things that can occur in the unsettled conditions and the 
unsettled conditions are the reason that were putting out the 
travel advisory

the university of utahs cold fusion 
program cleared a major hurdle monday when a state panel voted to 
release 45 million for research into the phenomenon and its 
potential as a new energy source 
the 71 vote with one abstention reflected the objections of 
the only two scientists on the panel the vote allows the 
university to fund a national cold fusion institute for research 
into fusion and its practical application 
theres going to be lots of hard work to be done said chase 
peterson university president its like being pleased to be 
asked to plow 100 acres of sugar beets but im pleased 
james brophy vice president for research also announced that 
general electric had signed an agreement providing for 
substantial financial participation but he declined to 
elaborate 
university officials had hoped for months that the fusionenergy 
advisory council charged with confirming the feasibility of cold 
fusion and disbursing a 5 million legislative appropriation for 
research would unanimously approve release of the remaining 45 
million 
however the panel voted 71 for approval with wilford hansen 
a utah state university physicist abstaining the lone dissenter 
was university provost karen morse a chemist who said she would 
have preferred more of the money being spent on science instead of 
facilities and administration 
of cold fusion morse said we can only have verification when 
a full understanding of the science is in i have concerns about 
putting money into things other than research 
morse saying she did not object to the funding per se moved 
unsuccessfully for a lineitem review of the proposed budget by the 
full council the councils fourmember executive committee already 
had screened the budget and recommended passage to the full body 
hansen echoed morses concern about confirming the research of 
university of utah chemist b stanley pons and his british 
colleague martin fleischmann who claim to have produced a 
sustained nuclear fusion reaction in a laboratory beaker 
hansen recalled the scientific communitys general skepticism 
about the experiment and said it would have to be generally 
duplicated in order to erase the doubts 
as soon as we have the science it will send a shock wave 
around the world hansen said you dont need hyperbolic public 
promotion 
the two chemists announced in march that they had sustained a 
fusion reaction by running an electrical current between platinum 
and palladium electrodes immersed in heavy water they later said 
the tabletop room temperature experiments generated up to about 
100 times the current charging them 
fusion involves the combining of atoms and should be safer than 
fission atomsplitting used to produce nuclear power 
but at subsequent scientific gatherings pons and fleischmann 
were accused of shoddy research and criticized for not publishing 
enough information to enable others to duplicate their results 
council chairman raymond hixson acknowledged the criticism but 
said reports that several universities already had duplicated the 
work was impetus for releasing the money

an fbi report listing the albany metropolitan 
area as the nations most murderous came just two days before the 
mayor faces a reelection challenge 
mayor larry bays told voters in the southern georgia city that 
the fbi murder statistics issued sunday were misleading and that 
challenger tommy coleman hurt the citys image by capitalizing on 
the murder rate 
whoever wins tuesdays democratic primary will have a lock on 
the mayors office no republican is running in the nov 7 general 
election 
the latest fbi uniform crime report shows the albany area had 
241 murders per 100000 residents in 1988 the new york area was 
second with 227 the new york region reported 3577 murders to 29 
in the albany area but the relatively tiny albany metro population 
120560 in relation to new yorks 86 million gave it the 
higher rate 
assistant police chief bob boren said 70 percent of albanys 
murders could be attributed to the drug trade police say crack 
cocaine has become pervasive in the citys poor neighborhoods 
coleman a bank executive originally reacted to the report by 
saying people are living in fear they have deadbolt locks 
security bars on their windows and chain link fences around their 
front yards 
bays said there was no fair way to compare albany and new york 
and by monday he was trying to turn the issue in his favor 
in an interview with the albany herald he blasted coleman for 
this mishandling of the fbis release of its crime report and the 
irresponsible statements that he made about that 
coleman said he regretted that too much had been made of the 
murder statistics 
albany is no different than any other city in the nation he 
told the newspaper they all have problems with drugs crime and 
they all have certain depressed areas where people have been living 
there for a long time and are afraid 
boren noted his officers had solved all the citys murders in 
1987 and 1988 they might commit the crimes but theyre not 
walking around after they commit them he said 
in other major crimes the fbi said albany had 92 forcible 
rapes 433 robberies 429 aggravated assaults 4493 larcenies and 
354 motor vehicle thefts 
to combat crime the police formed a major crime squad to focus 
on violent offenses and the city and surrounding dougherty county 
organized a consolidated drug squad 
in addition officers have cracked down on loitering in 
highcrime areas and are enforcing an ordinance aimed at 
eliminating fortified buildings that could be used for drug dealing 
were certainly not satisfied bays said of the citys crime 
prevention efforts thats why we have the major crimes task 
force 
coleman said he favors hiring more police officers opening 
precinct stations and putting more cops on the street where they 
can develop a better rapport with neighborhood residents 
im committed to a safer albany he said weve got to do 
a better job with our people by providing more jobs weve got very 
high unemployment unemployment breeds despair and despair breeds 
violence 
albany suffered a serious economic setback a few years ago when 
two major manufacturing plants shut down eliminating 2000 jobs

president bush exhorted thousands of 
boy scouts on monday to steer their peers away from this scourge 
called drugs 
bush becoming the first president since lyndon b johnson to 
attend a boy scout jamboree told more than 30000 scouts and 
leaders encamped at fort ap hill that keeping drugs out of 
americas schools was perhaps the greatest challenge of our 
times 
as bushs marine one helicopter landed loudspeakers blared the 
theme music from indiana jones from a giant stage drawing cheers 
from the huge crowd clad in green and olive bush described it as 
an unbelievable gathering 
bush called drugs a form of pollution a poisoning of the 
mind a corruption of the very soul of young america 
bush said the boy scouts have helped out through times of 
disaster from fires to flash floods and during wartime 
now he said the organization has already taken on a new 
struggle to defeat what you call the five unacceptables 
illiteracy unemployment child abuse drug abuse and hunger 
the president cited recent statistics showing an overall drop of 
40 percent in the number of americans using drugs but added we 
cannot yet claim victory 
the number of people addicted to cocaine and crack has almost 
doubled we must work harder he said i am especially looking 
to you to encourage friends to refuse drugs any illegal drugs 
he cited a firstperson account last week in the wall street 
journal by reporter ronald shafer about how drugs and alcohol led 
to the death of his son ryan at age 16 
there are thousands of ryans across america thousands of 
young men and women who are in danger of losing their future their 
very lives to this scourge called drugs said bush 
ask yourself if you know someone like ryan shafer and if so 
have you done everything you can to help him or her he said 
bush an avid fisherman told the youths of the pleasure he has 
found in the outdoors 
whatever you love to do whether its hiking hunting or 
kayaking hang on to it bush advised the scouts if you 
stay true to the hobbies of your youth you will find a source of 
relaxation and replenishment that will never fail you 
bush brought three eagle scouts with him from his top staff 
transportation secretary samuel skinner and white house aides 
andrew card and robert gates and said it was no coincidence 
that half of all astronauts were once scouts 
he put in a pitch for his recently enuciated goals of 
reinvigorating the space program including seeking to establish 
an outpost on the moon and explore the mysteries of mars in the 
next century 
you are privileged to be the generation that will witness the 
first large movement of men and women into space he said 
the scouts from across the united states and abroad end their 
sevenday 12th national jamboree on tuesday

the last coast guard lighthouse 
keeper in maine lowered his flag monday and an old boat sounded its 
horn three times in salute as a lighthouse commissioned by george 
washington became automated 
i can think of nothing more noble said rear adm richard c 
rybacki commander of the 1st coast guard district in boston as 
the portland head light became the last coast guard lighthouse in 
maine to be automated the lighthouse symbolizes all that is good 
in mankind we are not here to celebrate an ending we are here to 
immortalize a tradition 
it was the bicentennial of the day that washington signed a bill 
letting the federal government start building lighthouses the 
portland head light a white stone tower was first lit in 1791 
guiding ships past the jagged rocks that flank the best channel 
into portland harbor 
on monday light keeper davis simpson lowered the flag for the 
last time and the machinery that will turn on the lights and sound 
the foghorns automatically were officially in control 
according to the lighthouse preservation society the nation has 
about 800 lighthouses but only about a halfdozen still have 
keepers 
the coast guard band played and several coast guard cutters 
gathered nearby in casco bay 
a restored light ship the nantucket sounded its horn three 
times and the lighthouse answered three times to honor those who 
have operated the tower which after several remodelings stands 101 
feet above sea level 
lighthouse lovers were saddened to see the portland head light 
go unmanned yet happy to see its grounds being turned over to the 
town of cape elizabeth which wants to make the place a museum 
rybacki said the automation was necessary to better protect 
ships and to cost taxpayers less money 
we dont row surfboats out to make rescues and we dont get 
our mail from the pony express rybacki told hundreds of people 
who gathered for the ceremony 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine two years 
ago wrote legislation that set up the bicentennial lighthouse fund 
which provides grants for preserving and restoring lighthouses 
standing at lands end through two centuries they have 
symbolized safety security heroism and faithfulness mitchell 
said 
lighthouse historian f ross holland jr said the beacons have 
evolved considerably from the days when they began as elevated 
bonfires to the 1980s when some lighthouses are operated by 
solarpowered batteries 
now he said the major issue that will face lighthouses in 
the future and probably not too far off is erosion 
global warming rising water and shifting shorelines may 
eventually take their toll on the towers that guided generations of 
sailors he said

the battleship iowa fired some of its powerful 
16inch guns last week for the first time since 47 sailors were 
killed in an april explosion aboard the ship the navy said monday 
guns from two of the ships three turrets were used in the 
exercise conducted friday in the mediterranean sea said navy 
spokesman lt greg smith 
the test was successful and without incident smith said he 
added that the no 2 turret the one involved in the april 
explosion was not used 
the no 2 is still down he said 
the iowa one of the navys most heavily armed warships has 
been steaming across the mediterranean as part of a calculated us 
show of military force in response to the current hostage crisis 
the battleship had not been allowed to use its 16inch guns 
pending the outcome of a navy inquiry into the april 19 explosion 
but that decision was modified in june to allow for livefire 
training to prepare for contingency operations as directed by 
fleet commanders smith said 
the april accident amounted to one of the worst naval disasters 
since the vietnam war 
smith refused to discuss the number of guns used in the exercise 
or the amount of explosives used to pack them 
there are three guns on each of the iowas gun turrets 
each gun can fire projectiles weighing up to 2700 pounds at a 
maximum range of 23 miles the battleship also has 12 5inch guns 
the battleship is also equipped with a variety of weapons 
including tomahawk and harpoon cruise missiles that could be used 
if president bush orders a military strike in the ongoing hostage 
crisis 
the iowa was in the mediterranean to make a port call in 
marseilles france but cut short its visit to head closer to 
lebanon pentagon sources said last week 
the commander for the 6th fleet in the mediterranean vice adm 
james d williams authorized the gun fire training smith said 
williams aboard the guided missile cruiser uss belknap 
canceled a fourday call at the soviet port of sevastapol last week 
in to oversee the us navy movements in the area 
the only us aircraft carrier in the 6th fleet the uss coral

a senior un envoy expressed optimism 
monday about chances of freeing western hostages in lebanon but 
predicted a long process of quiet and patient diplomacy 
algerias ambassador who has acted as an intermediary said 
getting the hostages released might take a year or more 
israel on monday rejected a new demand for release of a 
kidnapped lebanese shiite cleric and urged shiite radicals to use 
the red cross to arrange a hostageprisoner swap israeli officials 
said the government would only accept a deal if three israeli 
soldiers were included 
president bush was described by white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater as cautiously optimistic about the american 
hostages in lebanon however fitzwater said he knows that its 
probably going to be a longer period of time rather than shorter 
before the matter is resolved 
certain tendencies certain trends in the international 
climate suggest that circumstances may be more conducive to a 
settlement to the hostages problem now than they have been sometime 
in the past said marrack goulding un undersecretarygeneral 
for peacekeeping operations 
many governments and organizations will have to take part it 
will be a cooperative effort 
its a very difficult and very complicated problem in which 
there are a large number of elements and a large number of players 
involved goulding said in beirut after five days of meetings in 
lebanon and syria 
goulding met monday in west beirut with salim hoss premier of a 
moslem cabinet that vies for power with a christian government and 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual adviser of the 
fundamentalist shiite moslem group hezbollah or party of god 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for proiranian 
kidnappers holding most of the 16 western hostages in lebanon 
eight of whom are americans 
khaled hasnawi the algerian ambassador also met with hoss and 
later with sheik sobhi tofaili a senior hezbollah leader 
tofaili and hasnawi told reporters they focused on ways of 
getting israel to free sheik abdul karim obeid a cleric affiliated 
with hezbollah israeli commandos abducted obeid on july 28 from 
his home in south lebanon 
israel has offered to trade obeid and other lebanese shiites it 
holds for the western hostages and three israeli soldiers held in 
lebanon 
hasnawi sounded optimistic about a swap when he began his 
mediation last week on orders of chadli bendjedid president of 
algeria 
asked on monday about his views the ambassador said i 
havent set a deadline in any of my previous statements it might 
take one two or even three years 
goulding said he unable to determine whether lt col william r 
higgins was killed by his proiranian captors 
i have not been able to ascertain whether colonel higgins was 
still alive he said i hope that he is but i havent been able 
to confirm that he is equally i havent been able to confirm that 
he is dead the question remains an open one 
a group calling itself the organization of the oppressed on 
earth said it hanged the us marine officer july 31 in retaliation 
for israels abduction of obeid three days earlier 
higgins 44 commanded un truce observers when he was 
kidnapped feb 17 1988 in south lebanon his captors released a 
poorquality videotape july 31 purporting to show him dangling from 
a makeshift scaffold 
the fbi said in washington its forensic experts believed the 
videotape showed higgins but offered no conclusion on when or how 
the death occurred 
in fort myer va bush paid tribute to higgins on monday as 
the symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of every 
american in uniform 
goulding said he would fly back to new york fairly soon to 
report to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on what i 
have been told and what my conclusions are there we will consider 
what to do next 
his aides said he had scheduled meetings tuesday in jerusalem 
with yitzhak rabin israels defense minister and deputy foreign 
minister benjamin netanyahu 
on sunday kidnappers holding american hostage joseph cicippio 
58 offered to free him if israel released 450 arab prisoners and 
allowed the return of 55 palestinian deported from the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
israel said monday there would be no exchange without its three 
soldiers 
it is obvious we will not agree to a partial exchange said 
avi pazner chief spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
rabin interviewed by abc news said israel had received no 
real proposal for an exchange if the shiite groups want a 
solution he said they have to turn to the right proper 
channels of the international red cross and then well start 
negotiations 
hussein mousawi a senior hezbollah leader said sunday one of 
the soldiers might be killed unless israel released obeid 
alon liel foreign ministry spokesman said monday the israelis 
would hold syria and iran responsible for the safety of the 
soldiers 
cicippios lebanese wife elham ghandour a secretary at the 
us embassy in beirut said she felt encouraged by sundays offer 
from the revolutionary justice organization the name his captors 
use her husband was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
i believe everybody is on the right track which is 
encouraging im optimistic mrs cicippio told the associated 
press she would not elaborate 
the western hostage held longest is terry a anderson 41 the 
aps chief middle east correspondent kidnapped march 16 1985

columbia earthbound for 3 years 
and cannibalized for parts to keep other space shuttles flying was 
pronounced troublefree monday and ready for a tuesday morning 
launch to put a highpowered spy satellite in orbit 
everything is on schedule there are no constraints to 
launch said lisa malone a nasa spokeswoman at the kennedy space 
center 
the fiveman crew was told that the weather appeared to be no 
problem for launch their ship the oldest in the fleet has had 
258 modifications to bring it up to par with the others and in the 
process gained 2500 pounds 
everything about the mission except the names of the allmale 
allmilitary crew was secret including time of liftoff length 
of mission and the cargo in the shuttles 60footlong hold 
nasa said only that the liftoff would be between 730 am and 
1130 am edt the most likely time was a few minutes before 8 
military missions in the past have lasted only four days but this 
one is expected to remain aloft a day longer to test the shuttles 
control systems unused for 3 years 
nasa conducted its countdown in secret the clocks scattered 
around the kennedy space center were to be lit up just nine minutes 
before launch nasa will provide only minimal announcements during 
the flight including the time of landing at edwards air force base 
in california 
sources said the astronauts will launch a 20600pound 
satellite capable of gathering photographic and electronic images 
of the soviet union china the middle east and other areas of 
military interest 
the satellite traveling over much of the inhabited world is 
able to take highly detailed photographs of troop movements 
military installations and the like according to the sources 
the sources also said the shuttles cargo bay holds a package of 
scientific experiments for military research built by nasa at its 
goddard space flight center in maryland and the jet propulsion 
laboratory in california 
columbia is the grand old man of space shuttles it was the 
first of the flying orbiters and completed five missions in 1981 
and 1982 before the second ship challenger joined the fleet 
columbia flew once in 1983 and once in 1986 completing its 7th and 
last mission 10 days before the challenger explosion 
but columbia became outdated as the newer ships came along and 
when the fleet got its complete overhaul during the 2year 
postchallenger hiatus discovery and atlantis got preferred 
treatment columbia was used as a parts source until modernizing 
began last november 
we will have a certain sense of deja vu when columbia lifts 
off said dick young a nasa spokesman columbia is the first 
of a kind and were glad to see it back in flight a lot of us 
remember back in 1981 when columbia did its first mission 
columbia will return to space with two borrowed engines and one 
reclaimed from an earlier flight engine no 1 last was used on 
atlantis on two missions in 1985 and before that by columbia in 
1983 nos 2 and 3 were on discovery last september and again in 
march 
the crew commander is air force col brewster shaw a veteran of 
two earlier shuttle flights including a 1983 trip on columbia the 
other crew members are navy cmdr richard richards navy cmdr 
david leestma army lt col james adamson and air force maj mark 
brown 
the mission designated sts28 is the fourth dedicated to 
military purposes and operating under the pentagons strict secrecy 
rules 
two military flights preceded the 1986 challenger accident and 
one other has been completed under a postchallenger agreement that 
called for nine flights through 1993 
the pentagon had planned 13 more military launches from the 
shuttle in the rest of the 1990s but has decided instead to use 
expendable rockets to get the cargo into orbit

commerce secretary robert mosbacher told by a 
judge to protect endangered sea turtles told shrimp fishermen 
monday they must inspect their nets every 105 minutes for trapped 
turtles 
environmentalists said that interval was too long and promised 
to oppose mosbacher in court 
the commerce department said the trawling time limitations 
which take effect tuesday and will be in place at least through 
sept 7 will protect the kemps ridley turtle better than turtle 
excluder devices which shrimp fishermen loathe 
the department says the turtles can survive submerged for 90 
minutes environmentalists say the departments own studies show 
that one in four sea turtles will drown during a tow time of 105 
minutes 
the new regulation established a 105minute cycle for shrimpers 
7 minutes to get their nets in the water 90 minutes to trawl 
and 7 minutes to retreive the nets 
we dont think the secretarys proposed regulations comply 
with the law and were going to challenge it in court said 
national wildlife federation spokesman charlie miller 
the department predicted compliance with the trawling time 
limitations would be far better than with the excluder devices 
because there is so much opposition to the excluder 
regulations compliance has been very low in some areas the 
department said in a document filed in federal court here it is 
therefore likely that many turtles are dying in the nets of those 
trawlers who are refusing to use the devices 
us district court judge thomas hogan who last week ordered 
mosbacher to begin protecting sea turtles from drowning in 
shrimpers nets by monday after the secretary suspended 
enforcement of the excluder device law july 24 following massive 
shrimper protests had not ruled on the commerce plan by late in 
the day 
conservationists said the judge was not expected to rule before 
midweek 
officials will take public comment on the rules through aug 21 
to determine whether the trawling time restrictions should be 
continued or modified in light of conservation needs of sea 
turtle populations and the economics of the shrimp fishing 
industry 
tom miller a spokesman for the center for marine conservation 
said the restrictions are unenforceable and that the kemps ridley 
must surface frequently to ventilate its lungs 
we believe the towtime restrictions condemn the sea turtles 
to extinction miller said tow times are not the answer 
judge hogan issued his ruling in a suit filed by the national 
wildlife federation which wants the excluder regulations enforced 
mosbacher suspended the regulations after shrimpers protested 
their use by blockading texas gulf coast shipping channels

the fbi said monday it believes the videotape 
released last week in beirut shows the body of american hostage 
william higgins hanging from a rope but the agency offered no 
conclusion as to the cause or timing of death 
president bush who praised marine lt col higgins publicly 
during the day as a symbol of courage telephoned mrs higgins 
to offer private condolences and tell her the united states is 
still seeking full details on her husband 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said gen al gray the 
commandant of the marine corps had informed higgins wife of the 
results of the fbi analysis of the videotape purported to be of 
lt col higgins 
presidet bush called mrs higgins at about 2 pm to offer his 
support and encouragement the president said the us government 
will continue to do all it can to obtain a full accounting of what 
happened to her husband fitzwater said 
the fbi said its forensic experts have concluded within a 
reasonable degree of medical certainty that the person depicted in 
the videotape is dead 
although a positive identification could not be made numerous 
observable characteristics were noted indicating that the person 
depicted in the videotape is lt col higgins the fbi said 
a law enforcement source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said fbi experts were unable to determine the time of higgins 
death from their examination of the videotape 
the tape showed a man bound and gagged hanging by a rope from 
his neck 
higgins head of a 75member united nations peacekeeping team 
was kidnapped in south lebanon on feb 17 1988 
the president paid tribute to higgins at a ceremony at ft myer 
in nearby arlington va marking the 200th anniversary of the 
department of war forerunner to the pentagon 
bush used the occasion to press for his defense priorities 
including mobile nuclear missiles the b2 bomber and the strategic 
defense initiative all threatened with budget cuts on capitol hill 
with the defense departments top civilian and military brass 
seated behind him bush offered a salute to every brave american 
who ever served in peace and wartime 
then in a voice that broke he added 
we cannot leave here today without pausing to salute one who 
stands as the symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of 
every american in uniform one marine who has been very much in our 
thoughts lt col higgins william richard higgins 
higgins captors said they hanged him last monday in retaliation 
for the israeli kidnapping of a moslem cleric sheik abdul karim 
obeid the terrorists had made previous death threats against 
higgins calling him a spy 
israeli government officials said their sources indicated 
higgins had been killed some time ago 
fitzwater said now is a time of monitoring and watching at 
the white house as the bush administration pursues diplomatic 
efforts to free hostages in lebanon eight additional americans are 
being held and a halfdozen other westerners 
fitzwater said bush was cautiously optimistic but expects 
it will take a longer period of time rather than shorter 
there are a lot of ideas being floated a lot of exchanges 
being made we see ideas coming out from iran from syria 
algeria israel the united states everybody said fitzwater 
the proiranian revolutionary justice organization said sunday 
it would release another american hostage joseph cicippio if 
israel frees the moslem cleric and hundreds of other lebanese and 
palestinian prisoners 
fitzwater said of the white house refusal to comment on that 
offer we have to be very careful of what we say often you 
can cut off those kinds of channels and communications if you 
comment prematurely in public 
there is no change in the us policy of refusing to negotiate 
with terrorists said fitzwater 
we have always said our policy is to talk to anyone who has 
information about our hostages to discuss any possibility of 
release to pursue every avenue of knowledge and information that 
might lead to their release and thats what were doing he said 
richard boucher a state department spokesman said the us 
role remains one of active diplomacy he added were 
continuing to be in contact with various parties in the region and 
with international organizations

hardline factions within fatah the main 
unit of the palestine liberation organization on monday renewed a 
call for military action against israel outside the 
israelioccupied territories plo sources said 
it was part of a draft resolution to be submitted for a vote 
before about 1000 fatah members attending a fiveday congress in 
the tunisian capital 
the move conflicts with attempts by plo chairman yasser arafat 
to adopt a more moderate approach to solving the issue of 
palestinian sovereignty 
the palestine national congress the plos parliament declared 
palestinian independence last november arafat then declared that 
the plo would restrict armed actions to israelioccupied 
territories although the exact meaning of occupied territories 
was vague 
arafats stand led to talks with the united states and weakened 
israels refusal to deal with the plo on grounds the plo is a 
terrorist organization 
plo sources at the congress speaking on condition of anonymity 
said mondays call to arms was included in the draft resolution 
over the objections of more moderate fatah members 
they said the draft also rejects israels proposal for elections 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip but supports 
arafats acceptance of elections after israeli troops withdraw 
under united nations supervision 
the meeting the first fatah congress in nine years opened 
friday and was closed to journalists after opening remarks by 
arafat and tunisian president zine abidine ben ali 
in amman the capital of jordan a senior plo official said 
monday his organization will transfer a fund headquarters to amman 
from abu dhabi in the united arab emirates to help boost jordans 
troubled economy 
the official also speaking on condition of anonymity said 
arafat would visit jordan next week to inaugurate the palestine 
national funds new headquarters 
the official jordan news agency petra reported monday that 
jordan agreed to the plo decision 
the fund functions as fatahs treasury it was moved from amman 
in 1986 after relations between the plo and jordan soured 
relations improved after king husseins decision in july 1988 to 
renounce sovereignty over the west bank in favor of the plo israel 
captured the west bank from jordan in the 1967 war

about 150 of the hundreds of east germans 
who have fled their communist homeland through hungary to austria 
left monday for west germany and a new life 
the east germans most in their early 20s and carrying papers 
provided by the west german embassy in vienna boarded one of the 
trains that leave each night with refugees bound for west germany 
embassy spokesmen will not say how many east germans have passed 
through vienna since may when hungarys communist regime began 
dismantling barbed wire fences and fortifications along its border 
with austria 
officials in budapest hungary caused a stir last week in the 
soviet bloc by saying they might offer asylum to east germans who 
can prove political persecution a budapest official said monday 
border police had stopped putting special stamps on the passports 
of east germans caught trying to cross the border 
austrian authorities said they had registered at least 400 east 
german refugees before west germany asked them last friday to stop 
making the figures public they said the true figure could be at 
least six times that because many of the east germans do not report 
to police 
in bonn ottfried hennig parliamentary state secretary for the 
ministry of intergerman relations said west germany feared east 
germany might impose new travel restrictions to stop the refugees 
western news reports say say about 200 east germans are inside 
the west german embassy in budapest the official east german news 
agency adn said monday letting the refugees stay there was gross 
interference in east germanys internal affairs 
about 100000 east germans are expected to make their way west 
this year because of the lack of reform at home 
three groups of young east berliners who recently followed 
different routes across the border sat in viennas westbahnhof 
railroad station monday and told escape stories ranging from 
harrowing to casual 
all cited the lack of personal freedom as the main reason for 
leaving home they also said their parents knew of their decision 
and supported them 
you can have a pile of money but if you want to buy something 
decent you cant spend it said one young man who had worked in 
a restaurant you run around the shops looking for a tshirt 
just a tshirt and you run out with tears in your eyes we want to 
breathe 
like many other east germans who spoke with reporters he asked 
not to be identified fearing his comments might cause trouble for 
relatives and friends 
joerg 21 made it across from hungary on the second try with a 
friend but i wouldnt recommend our route to anyone he showed 
scars left on his arm by barbed wire and thorns 
hungary says it has dismantled fortifications along about half 
the 160mile frontier with austria on their escape thursday night 
joerg said he and his friend got caught in the part still standing 
we ran for about two hours then we must have hit a trip wire 
which set off two flares shooting into the air he said 
after that they thought they heard warning shots they bumped 
into barbed wire stayed low because of dogs vehicles and voices 
and then ran several miles joerg said 
some who made it to safety only on the second or third try 
praised the hungarians 
the first time we were standing in a wood and the border 
guard saw us joerg said he was so nice about my age i gave 
him a cigarette a tissue because he had a cold he was like my 
brother 
but the hungarian reported the incident and the two east germans 
were taken to a barracks where men in plainclothes threatened to 
stamp their passports and ordered them out of the border zone 
joerg said however that one of the soldiers virtually told 
me where to try again

rebels on condition that once the talks begin that they not look 
for excuses to break them 
the bush administration has been lobbying central american 
governments to keep the usbacked contras active until februarys 
scheduled elections in nicaragua 
the us government had four observers at the meeting but they 
were meeting delegates outside the talks not attending the 
sessions 
ortega signed an agreement friday with the domestic political 
opposition which calls for demobilizing the contras in honduran 
camps in exchange he has pledged democratic reforms 
the bilateral plan calls for resettling the 11000 contras and 
12000 dependents who are living in honduras along the nicaraguan 
border 
fighting has been reduced to sporadic clashes since last year 
when the united states cut off military aid and the two sides 
reached a temporary truce since then both sides have said they 
would not carry out offensive operations 
the contras have been fighting the leftist sandinistas since 
1981 alleging the government betrayed the goals of the 1979 
revolution that ousted dictator anastasio somoza in 1979

the usbacked contra rebels 
fighting nicaraguas sandinista government on monday reiterated 
their defiance of the opposition arrayed against them in central 
america 
we will not lay down our arms and our fight will continue in 
the mountains of nicaragua said boanerges mathus of the contra 
general staff 
as he spoke the five central american presidents were meeting 
in tela honduras about the rebels future with the goal of 
disbanding the contras 
adolfo calero a contra political leader said he would not ask 
the men to lay down their arms until after the nicaraguan elections 
in february the united statrs has said it wants the rebel force to 
remain intact until then 
were ready to exchange arms for democracy but not for 
promises calero said in a speech monday in madison ala 
the contras have been fighting the sandinistas since 1981 and 
about 50000 people have been killed they say the leftist 
sandinista government betrayed the 1979 revolution that ousted 
dictator anastasio somoza 
fighting has declined sharply since february 1988 when the 
united states cut off military aid to the contras limiting 
assistance to humanitarian aid 
at a february summit the presidents agreed the contras would be 
resettled in exchange for free elections in nicaragua president 
daniel ortegas government has scheduled the vote but the matter of 
disbanding the contras has not been settled 
although the sandinistas and the contras agreed march 21 to 
suspend offensive operations talks aimed at a permanent end to the 
7yearold war are at an impasse and the rebels continue to launch 
sporadic attacks 
us officials say the resistance has frayed somewhat around 
the edges since the ceasefire but that the contras have 
maintained high morale 
if the presidents of guatemala el salvador honduras 
nicaragua and costa rica agree to bury us we will abandon honduran 
territory and fight from the mountains of nicaragua said mathus 
we will seek economic and military support from other western 
nations if the united states suspends aid 
although the leadership is a cultured elite based in miami and 
includes former leaders of somozas hated national guard most 
contras are former sharecroppers or rural businessmen 
about 11000 contra fighters and 12000 dependents have moved 
from nicaragua into honduran border camps 
many fled nicaragua because the sandinista government was 
forcing them to sell crops at low prices and join rural 
cooperatives others fled the draft not wanting to fight for the 
sandinistas and ended up fighting against them 
many have begun to farm or to work on coffee plantations in 
honduras but the hondurans have made it difficult for most contras 
to get work permits

an obscure california legislative 
district has become a political battleground in which the us 
supreme courts recent decision on abortion is playing a crucial 
role 
voters go to the polls tuesday in a race both prochoice and 
antiabortion activists say marks the first legislative election in 
the nation since the high courts july 3 ruling gave states more 
authority to restrict abortions 
voters will choose a representative for the 76th assembly 
district from among eight candidates the winner will succeed gop 
assemblyman bill bradley who died june 1 
the special election would normally excite little outside 
interest but the abortion issue has made a difference 
its not the sole reason im going to choose someone but it 
will definitely be a consideration said escondido resident troy 
gagielo who said he was definitely looking for a prochoice 
candidate 
six republicans and two democrats are stumping the sweltering 
streets and rural ranches and the campaigning has been lively 
despite the difficulties of summer apathy the short time period 
and a huge district 
the mushroomshaped 76th assembly district has 65439 voters and 
is overwhelmingly republican 542 percent to 327 percent 
democrat 
only one of the six republicans the president of the state 
board of registered nursing is openly prochoice and supports 
state funding of abortions for poor women 
health care is the issue to me said tricia hunter 36 of 
bonita a registered nurse who is also director of surgical 
services at chula vista community hospital you cannot restrict 
health care because of individual beliefs 
hunter says the abortion issue is going to play a big part in 
the election it has definitely spurred interest in the race 
throughout the state she said 
both democrats are also prochoice three of the republicans are 
strongly opposed to abortion 
the two other republican candidates deputy mayor linda brannon 
42 of poway and dennis koolhaas 34 of escondido say only that 
they oppose state funding of abortion but abortion should not be a 
major issue in the race they insist 
this is not a campaign that should be a oneissue race said 
koolhaas 
all the candidates see crime education and 
growthtransportation as among the biggest issues in the district 
the special election process is an odd one all candidates will 
be on the ballot together regardless of party voters will get one 
ballot and can vote for whomever they choose if one candidate gets 
more than 50 percent of the vote unlikely in such a split field 
he or she is elected to the office if that does not happen the 
top republican and the top democrat will face each other in a 
runoff election on oct 3

alabama securities investigators leaving the 
home of church deacon steven streit after interviewing him about 
possible fraud found on his doorstep a 35000 check from a 
wouldbe investor 
these people were begging to invest with him said robert 
rash director of the alabama securities commission 
streit is now serving a 10year prison sentence for fraud for 
running a con game that bilked nearly 200 people out of an 
estimated 18 million 
streits investment scam was among several cited by state 
securities regulators monday at a news conference announcing a 
15state survey of religiousoriented investment schemes that have 
cost 15000 investors some 450 million since 1985 
us rep william dickinson rala was among the investors 
taken in by streit the former treasurer of one of the largest 
baptist churches in alabama 
he never invested any of the money said rash 
streit who kept a stock market ticker running in his office and 
maintained three satellite dishes at his 400000 house told 
investors he had a direct link to every major exchange in the 
world said rash 
although streit promised an exhorbitant return of 30 percent to 
35 percent per month his investors didnt question him one victim 
stated it was sort of comforting to see the bible verse printed 
at the end of the monthly statements 
streit traded on his role as a deacon of the church as well as a 
former accountant and bank trust officer to bilk virtually every 
prominent businessman in the huntsville area said rash 
everybody thought he had divine guidance he played his role 
real well rash said in an interview

a spokesman for the chihuahua state 
government said monday it is willing to discuss with prostitutes 
and bar owners the opening of a tolerance zone in which 
prostitution would be allowed 
but spokesman alfonso sanchez gallo said first they would 
have to find an appropriate place and then they would have to get 
the funds the bar owners themselves would have to pay for it 
sanchez said prostitutes were meeting with government officials 
to discuss the opening of a red light district 
last week authorities in chihuahua city the state capital 
closed about 31 downtown bars and restaurants they said had become 
fronts for prostitution 
they said the businesses will stay shut despite prostitutes 
threats to strip in protest in front of the capitol building 
about 1500 prostitutes threatened to march on the capitol 
monday and undress publicly to press for creation of a red light 
district in the city 
there was no march and nobody took off their clothes 
sanchez said in a telephone interview 
he quoted chihuahua gov fernando baeza as saying that any bar 
or restaurant catering to prostitution would have its license 
revoked 
the mexico city newspaper excelsior on sunday quoted magdalena 
aguirre a spokewoman for the prostitutes as saying she and the 
other prostitutes would exhibit themselves completely naked at 
the capitol if their demands were not met 
ms aguirre ridiculed baezas suggestion that prostitutes seek 
factory jobs according to the sunday edition of the mexico city 
daily la jornada 
she was quoted as saying that factories only pay 60000 pesos 
23 a week we make that much or more in two hours 
sanchez said baeza had warned the women that it would be illegal 
for them to disrobe in public 
the state government has to put the brakes on prostitution it 
isnt legal here the spokesman added 
sanchez then mentioned a possible tolerance zone 
although prostitution is illegal in mexico many city and state 
governments have allowed red light districts to operate

president bush promised to deal with the 
problems of poverty and racial intolerence in his presidency and 
his aides claim progress in six months in office but civil rights 
advocates gathered here say his record so far has been spotty 
bushs choice of william lucas to be the justice departments 
top civil rights enforcer his refusal to speak out on recent 
supreme court rulings limiting affirmative action programs and the 
dispute with congress over a new minimum wage are cited most 
frequently by his critics 
administration aides defend bushs civil rights commitment 
claiming it is a strong one that dates back to his support of open 
housing legislation as a firstterm house member in 1968 in a 
dramatic break with the rest of the texas delegation 
and fred mcclure the highestranking black member of the white 
house staff said most of the agenda of the civil rights movement 
is george bushs agenda 
the president on tuesday will address the 79th annual urban 
league conference whose theme this year is total parity by the 
year 2000 
urban league president john e jacob is challenging bush to use 
the speech to present bold new initiatives that help americas 
poor people and put us back on the path of racial progress 
white house aides said they do not expect the speech to break 
any new ground despite jacob appeal 
bush according to deputy press secretary stephen hart will use 
the speech to say that weve come a long way but weve got a long 
way to go on ending discrimination 
it focuses on education as the key to equality it talks about 
education and about drugs said hart 
however the president for some time reportedly has been 
considering making a trip to africa this fall according to white 
house officials tuesdays speech might present a good forum for 
bush to announce such a trip 
bush himself in a monday evening telephone address to a town 
meeting sponsored by the urban league and the naacp at the mt 
olive baptist church in fort lauderdale fla said he would offer 
a message of challenge and hope in his speech to the urban 
league 
in his phone talk he focused on the war against drugs citing 
statistics showing the number of americans who are frequent cocaine 
users was up sharply were talking addiction bush said 
this is an issue we should fight every day 
civil rights leaders appear willing to give bush some benefit of 
doubt on his agenda partly because he has reached out toward them 
from the early days of his presidency but they suggest his words 
dont live up to his deeds 
the civil rights community would give the president high marks 
for accessibility and symbolism and rhetoric but low marks on 
substantive civil rights policy said ralph neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
so far the bush administration has compiled a disappointing 
record on civil rights neas said in an interview 
civil rights advocates list these developments as the major 
irritants 
the senate debacle over lucas a black detroit lawyer bush 
nominated to head the civil rights division at justice lucas was 
widely criticized by black leaders for lacking experience in 
discrimination cases and was rejected by the senate judiciary 
committee on a 77 tie vote 
still the administration continues to stand by the nomination 
including a behindthescenes effort by bush last friday to get the 
full senate to ignore the committee vote and bring the nomination 
to the floor 
the administrations refusal to speak out against or support 
legislation to sidestep a series of supreme court rulings last 
spring that sharply restricted affirmative action and made it more 
difficult to prove discrimination in the workplace 
bushs veto of a new minimum wage bill 
the presidents support of a holdover nomination by former 
president reagan of vaughn walker a san francisco attorney to a 
federal judgeship in california walker came under fire for his 
membership in a club that excludes women 
the justice departments decision to undo existing school 
desegregation orders in georgia and its filing of a lawsuit 
challenging a prince georges county md desegration plan 
mcclure the bush white house liaison with members of congress 
defends bushs civil rights policy as a continued effort to break 
down barriers 
at the same time mcclure said you havent had issues like 
civil rights acts the voting rights act traditional types of 
civil rights measures thus far in bushs adminstration 
however mcclure said the bipartisan agreement reached last week 
with the white house on legislation to extend equal opportunity 
protection to americans with disabilities should be viewed as a key 
civilrights move on bushs part 
civil rights leaders agreed giving bush high marks for his role 
in crafting the legislation 
jacob the urban league president says that despite major 
differences with the administration on some civil rights issues he 
remains hopeful that remaining problems can be worked out with 
honesty and candor 
and labor secretary elizabeth dole appearing at the urban 
league conference monday touted administration planning grants to 
12 cities and rural areas for getting atrisk youths into the 
economic mainstream 
she said stamping discrimination out of our economy remains 
a high priority of the administration 
and bush addressing a ceremony honoring the 25th anniversary of 
the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 told a white house 
audience last month he would be satisfied with nothing less than 
equality of opportunity for all americans 
the hard lesson of the passing years is that it has not been 
enough to wage a war against the old forms of bigotry and 
inequality bush added 
but rep william gray dpa majority whip of the house 
scoffed on monday at bushs notion of a kinder and gentler 
nation 
he told the urban league forum it does none of us any good to 
talk about the benefits of economic growth and opportunity and yet 
not acknowledge that there has been stagnation and a worsening of 
conditions for some americans and especially africanamericans

grew to more than onehalf acre said sheela mclean an okanogan 
forest spokeswoman 
hundreds of army soldiers moved through the interagency fire 
center for training and eventual deployment to the firelines as 
land managers pressed for more manpower 
in past years weve used the military for mopup but thats 
not happening this time said boise national forest spokeswoman 
pat irwin in idaho theyre being used as mopup for a few days 
but thats just their training the incident commanders believe 
they can be as good as classone hotshot crews because theyre 
disciplined used to working together and theyre physically fit

the major fires like the 42000acre lowman complex of fires that

fresno was 95 percent surrounded officials said 
the vail fire in the cleveland national forest east of san 
diego which was ignited by a target shooters bullet nine days 
ago was 90 percent contained said us forest service spokeswoman 
jean magarrell the fire had torched a house and trailer and 
threatened the historic mount palomar observatory and the eagle 
crag nature sanctuary earlier in the week 
near coalville utah about 45 miles east of salt lake city 
firefighters were close to containing the 1700acre chalk creek 
blaze 
in northwestern nebraska a fire that blackened 3000 acres of 
brush and timber in canyon country near belmont was largely 
contained but control wasnt expected for two to three days

a young woman who was found 
abandoned at a church a month ago was identified monday as a mental 
patient missing from portland ore 
the woman who was known only as christina was identified 
monday as rochelle scholl and she has a severe mental disorder 
said ed hallett a spokesman for newfoundland premier clyde wells 
doctors had thought she was a severely handicapped 14yearold with 
a lifethreatening muscle disease 
hallet said ms scholl about 19 was identified by portland 
psychologist susan beattie who arrived in st johns on monday 
ms scholl has been hospitalized in st johns for treatment 
any information i have is privileged beattie saidof 
course im surprised she turned up in st johns thats awfully 
far away from portland oregon 
the brownhaired woman was found on the steps of an anglican 
cathedral in st johns on july 7 five days after she was last 
seen in portland 
she was covered by a blanket and apparently unable to speak 
an intense investigation followed involving canadian police 
social and medical workers customs officials scotland yard and 
interpol 
len power of the royal newfoundland constabulary said her true 
identity was learned when a police department in a us city he 
wouldnt identify suggested checking with portland authorities 
they contacted ms scholls father who reported her missing on 
july 16 he identified her pictures on saturday said power the 
father said ms scholl hadnt been seen since july 2 when she left 
home telling a neighbor she was heading for california or arizona 
with 1000 in her pocket 
but it wasnt the first time ms scholl made others believe she 
was unable to talk 
news reports from january 1988 said she turned up at an airport 
in des moines iowa clutching a baby bottle and a handwritten 
letter authorities originally believed was written by her mother 
power said 
three months earlier she was found in an airport bathroom in 
springfield mo with a baby bottle and a similar letter that 
quoted from the bible and blamed her apparent disabilities on 
falling short of the lords blessing 
although seemingingly mute and handicapped ms scholl was later 
found to be ablebodied and able to speak 
john efford newfoundlands social services minister said 
theres a lot of questions going to have to be answered hopefuly 
now that she has been identified all the rest of the information 
will piece together very quickly 
the discovery ends a monthlong search for information about the 
girl who social workers said used sign language to spin a tale 
about sailing to newfoundland from england on a white yacht 
accompanied by her mother three men and a nanny 
officials said she appeared to understand english german and 
slovene a yugoslavian dialect 
power said police are still trying to find out how ms scholl 
got to newfoundland and are checking with airlines and buses that 
travel to the province

news organizations in appealing the networks multimilliondollar 
libel loss to entertainer wayne newton 
a federal jury in las vegas awarded newton 193 million in 
damages over allegations that nbc libeled newton by linking him to 
mob figures 
a federal judge later reduced the award to 53 million 
nbc has appealed the verdict to the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals saying the award to newton was excessive and 
insupportable 
other networks national newspaper groups and journalism 
associations have joined nbc in the appeal filing friends of the 
court briefs last month 
among them were cbs capital citiesabc and fox broadcasting 
whose lawyers argued that viewers impressions should not open a 
media organization to liability 
also filing briefs were the gannett co the new york times 
company dow jones amp co copley press and chronicle publishing 
according to mondays editions of the las vegas reviewjournal 
newtons attorney morton galane said he consented to the other 
media supporting nbc so the appeals court could be presented with 
all possible arguments 
newton sued nbc after the network broadcast a series of stories 
entitled wayne newton and the law beginning in 1980 
galane argued in the trial that the nbc reports left the false 
impression that newtons purchase of the aladdin hotel was linked 
to the mob

a plane carrying rep mickey leland dtexas 
congressional aides and several other people failed to arrive as 
expected at a refugee camp near the ethiopiansudanese border 
monday the state department said 
we are concerned about the welfare of mr leland and his 
group department spokesman adam shub said in a statement leland 
aides suggested the group simply got behind schedule and was 
staying overnight in another camp 
in addis ababa the ethiopian capital john guerra a political 
and economics office at the us embassy said in a telephone 
interview with the associated press in nairobi we dont know 
anything for sure yet we are hoping they got into problems with 
the weather and diverted somewhere 
there were conflicting accounts of who was aboard the plane 
a leland spokeswoman said the congressman was accompanied by two 
aides and three officials from relief organizations a source on 
capitol hill speaking on condition of anonymity said the party 
included three congressional staffers a friend of lelands three 
officials from the us embassy one embassy spouse an ethiopian 
employee of the embassy and two ethiopian government officials two 
of the americans worked for the agency for international 
development he said 
that would make 12 people in the party guerra said the plane 
was carrying 14 people it was not clear whether that included the 
ethipoian pilot and copilot 
the plane is owned by ethiopias relief and rehabilitation 
commission the governments welfare agency 
shub said the plane left addis ababa at 1040 am local time 
headed for the refugee camp fugnido about 300 miles to the 
southwest the plane did not arrive at the camp and it did not 
return to addis ababa as expected at 5 pm local time 10 am edt 
monday in the united states he said 
greta morris a department spokeswoman said she did not expect 
that search planes would be dispatched from addis ababa until 
daybreak were working closely with the ethiopians she said 
leland is chairman of the house select committee on hunger he 
has taken a keen interest in africas refugees and visited the 
same area in march officials said 
the camp the group had been headed for is run by the united 
nations high commission for refugees it is home to about thousands 
of refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring sudan 
the planes takeoff monday morning was delayed about two hours 
because of bad weather officials said 
planes must fly over rugged terrain to reach the refugee camp 
but the aircraft would not pass over the area where rebels are 
battling ethiopias government ethiopias separatist movements are 
based in the northern part of the country in the horn of africa 
we think its very premature to be concerned at this point 
said timmie jensen a spokeswoman for the house select committee on 
hunger which leland heads 
this kind of thing comes up when youre in the bush she 
said 
alma newsom another leland spokeswoman said for all 
practical purposes theyre cut off theyre going to be overdue 
all night theyre going to be overnight in the camp 
my guess is once en route the camp that was the original 
destination was too far and they opted to go to a different camp 
ms newsom said even at that once they got on the ground and 
began their tour they simply ran out of time to end their tour and 
get back 
she said pilots were very strict about adhering to a 5 pm 
curfew to return to addis ababa

state spending on prisons and health care 
continued to climb and eat into education budgets in 1989 but most 
states are financially healthy according to a report released 
monday at a national meeting of legislators 
the report by the fiscal staff of national conference of state 
legislatures showed that education though considered the no 1 
issue across the country did not fare much better in spending than 
other areas in most states 
more than 5000 people mainly legislators and state officials 
and staff are expected to attend the weeklong convention 
the overall increase in spending in state budgets was 72 
percent up from 66 percent a year ago 
spending on corrections principally for prison capital needs 
and operations rose by 141 percent among the states as a whole 
while the increase in medicaid costs was 104 percent 
elementarysecondary education spending rose by 78 percent and 
funding for colleges and universities jumped 73 percent 
education makes up more than 50 percent of state budgets across 
the country 
west virginia which had to pour money into teacher retirement 
and health insurance had the largest increase in education funding 
with 257 percent 
next were illinois with a 177 percent increase nevada and new 
hampshire with 168 percent ohio with 152 percent and georgia 
with 147 percent 
the report however showed that states have an estimated 109 
billion in reserves or 44 percent of states general funds 
thats the highest amount of reserve fund balances in nine years 
steven gold director of fiscal affairs for the ncsl said most 
states are comfortable from a financial standpoint but gold 
said the margin that is protecting them from being uncomfortable 
is not so large 
louisiana senate president pro tempore samuel nunez jr ncsl 
president said experience has shown that financial conditions 
among states can change rapidly and often are tied to the national 
economy 
the greatest concentration of fiscal problems this year was in 
the new england states and in new york and new jersey places that 
just two years ago were faring better than most states 
nunez also pointed out that 1989 was an active year for state 
tax policy with tax increases totaling 35 billion in 30 states 
in 1980 states had reserve fund balances totaling 118 
million lee daniels ncsl presidentelect and minority leader of 
the illinois house noted that two years later many states were 
in severe difficulty as they felt the effects of a national 
recession 
the current fiscal health is certainly not a cause for 
complacency daniels said 
increased spending on prisons comes at a time of declining crime 
in many areas gold tied the cause to courtordered prison 
improvements and tougher sentencing guidelines 
nunez said the economic future of states is clouded by large 
trade and federal budget deficits and about what will happen to 
federal aid and federal mandates on various programs 
he said unfunded federal mandates have added billions of dollars 
in new responsibilities to the states in recent years 
federal initiatives in welfare reform catastrophic health care 
and nursing home legislation will raise state costs by more than 2 
billion per year nunez said

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
monday that mexico after years of stagnation has become an 
economic model for other debtor nations because of the bold 
farsighted policies of president carlos salinas de gortari 
he also said that mexicos record over the past six months in 
cracking down on drug trafficking has made clear the governments 
commitment that it wants to tear the roots of the opium poppy and 
marijuana plant from its soil 
baker spoke at the ceremonial opening of daylong talks that 
featured the presence of an unusually large array of senior bush 
administration officials with baker were 40 other officials 
including four cabinet members 
treasury secretary nicholas brady set the tone for the 
discussions telling a morning news conference that great 
progress has been made in economic and financial fields that are 
important to our two countries 
brady hailed the debt agreement mexico reached with commercial 
banks two weeks ago that provides for among other things a 
reduction in mexicos debt servicing obligations payments on the 
countrys 107 billion foreign debt have contributed to a sharp 
decline in living standards over the past seven years 
brady said that mexico has taken steps to make the business 
climate here more favorable for foreign investment and to lower 
barriers to trade tax reform and deregulation also will help 
stimulate economic growth he said 
later baker standing before the assembled delegations at a 
foreign ministry conference room for the opening ceremony said 
the united states has no more important relationship than with 
its neighbor and friend the republic of mexico these are not mere 
words they represent the solemn commitment of the united states 
expanding on bradys comments about mexicos economic policies 
baker said mexicos bold farsighted approach has convinced 
the private banks and international lending institutions that 
mexico is worthy of credit and trust 
we believe that mexico can once again set an example that 
other nations can follow baker said at his news conference 
brady expressed hope that similar debt reduction agreements can be 
reached with the philippines venezuela costa rica and morocco 
afterwards baker praised the talks as very productive and 
highly successful 
mexicos foreign affairs minister fernando solana was far more 
restrained in his remarks after the meeting he said the 
discussions were carried out in an atmosphere of mutual respect 
and were marked by intelligent analyses of the problems of the 
two nations 
at the opening ceremony he praised the high level of maturity 
and cordiality between the two countries but said mexico will 
never surrender its latin american identity despite its 
geographical proximity to the united states 
we want to be evermore good friends of the united states but 
never at the cost of affecting the values which determine our 
essence and which shape us as a nation he said 
he said that us foreign investment in mexico is far less than 
what it should be and that the improvement in eastwest relations 
should lead to an increase in the resources the united states makes 
available for development and wellbeing 
but based on the remarks of baker and brady us relations with 
mexico have come a long way since the period during the reagan 
administration of mutual recriminations over drug trafficking and 
central america policy 
mexicos perceived role as one of the staunchest supporters in 
the hemisphere of nicaraguas leftist government and the rebel 
movement in el salvador embittered officials of the reagan 
administration 
with the almost simultaneous advent of the bush and salinas 
admininistrations central america has faded as an issue and there 
is a sense in washington that mexico is far more serious now about 
confronting drug smugglers 
baker acknowledged that the united states bears part of the 
blame for the drug problem because of the senseless demand for 
drugs a statement that reflects a longheld mexican view 
mexico has been a principal source of heroin and marijuana and a 
transit point for usbound cocaine shipments mexican officials 
believe a reduction in us demand is the most effective means of 
combating the problem 
nonetheless baker said salinas has taken decisive action on the 
drug issue mexicos success over the past six months in 
capturing and prosecuting drug traffickers has seized the worlds 
attention 
the other cabinet members who joined baker and brady for the 
talks held under the auspices of the usmexico binational 
commission were attorney general dick thornburgh commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher and us trade representative carla 
hills 
also on the agenda were issues relating to the usmexican 
border the environment fisheries trade and investment and 
cultural ties

the national assembly on monday 
approved a ceasefire in surinames 3yearold guerrilla war that 
was signed by the government and rebels in late july 
the 51member assembly deliberated eight hours before voting 
442 for the ceasefire 
prime minister henk arron said disputes with the army over the 
terms of the accord had been overcome he said the truce will be 
implemented within the next weeks after the final wording is put 
together 
the surinamese military which ruled the country until 1987 had 
protested provisions of the agreement that allow the rebels to keep 
their weapons and eventually join the south american nations 
police force 
the government and rebels agreed in principle to the accord on 
july 22 at a meeting in french guiana 
it was to end the fighting in eastern suriname between 
government forces and the rebels led by ronnie brunswijk 27 a 
former bodyguard to lt col desi bouterse who ruled suriname from 
19801987 
bouterse was replaced by a civilian government in 1987 
elections but the army still has influence in surinamese politics 
under a state of emergency in large parts of the nation 
the truce also calls for an end to the state of emergency and 
for an aid program for eastern suriname where brunswijk has his 
power base 
the threeyear strife which is seen as a personal feud between 
brunswijk and bouterse has cost hundreds of lives 
suriname a nation of 400000 gained independence from holland

the government said monday it was 
ready to begin talks on extending us military bases beyond 1991 
and would speed up studies on alternative uses of the facilities if 
they are closed 
national security council adviser rafael ileto told reporters 
we are ready for talks now he said the united states should 
propose a date for the beginning of negotiations 
the council examined the security arrangements between the two 
countries particularly the us military bases agreement which 
expires in september 1991 ileto said 
it noted the need for the early resolution of the bases issue 
and decided to speed up the completion of plans for the alternative 
uses of the us military facilities 
the united states maintains six bases in the philippines 
including clark air base and the subic bay naval base they are 
among the largest us military garrisons outside the continental 
united states 
under the philippine constitution any extension of the bases 
must come under a bilateral treaty subject to approval by 
twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to the 
installations is strong 
president corazon aquino has refused to say whether she supports 
an extension in october the united states and the philippines 
reached an agreement allowing the bases to remain until 1991 in 
return for 962 million in us military and economic aid over two 
years 
the two countries are expected to begin preliminary talks on a 
new treaty later this year mrs aquino is expected to discuss the 
issue when she visits washington probably in november 
about 40000 american troops civilian workers and military 
dependents are stationed at the facilities 
opponents of the bases have suggested the facilities could be 
used for commercial ship repair export processing zones and 
industrial parks to soften the economic effects of any us troop 
withdrawal 
on friday singapores minister of state for foreign affairs 
george yeo told parliament that the island nation wanted the 
united states to maintain its military presence in the region and 
had offered to host some facilities 
yeos statement was seen as an attempt by singapore to make it 
easier for the manila government to extend the bases agreement the 
philippines has complained that other noncommunist southeast asian 
nations were unwilling to share the political burden of hosting the 
bases

us financial support direct or through 
proxies has kept the nicaraguan resistance movement the contras 
going since 1981 but at the price of almost endless controversy 
between administrations eager to block the consolidation of a 
second marxistleninist government in the region and congressional 
opponents of intervention 
currently the bush administration and its democratic opponents 
in congress are operating under an agreement to provide the contras 
with 498 million for food clothing and other supplies but no 
arms or ammunition through feb 28 1990 at the rate of 45 
million a month the money can be used for resettlement 
separately the contra leadership in miami has been receiving a 
reported 400000 a month but that was cut in half in the spring 
last month the contra leadership there said it was told to expect 
further cuts 
the agreement between congress and the administration provides 
that the money will stop as of nov 30 if democratic congressional 
leaders are not satisfied with the administrations efforts to 
support peace 
the bush administration had been hoping to keep the contras 
together as a force until after the nicaraguan elections next 
february congressional critics have said this effort could be a 
violation of their aid agreement with the president 
the entire irancontra affair revolved around attempts by 
elements of the reagan administration led by lt col oliver north 
of the national security council staff and cia director william 
casey to divert profits from the secret sale of arms to iran to 
the contras during a period when congress had forbidden the use of 
us funds 
as part of that effort other nations were solicited and some 
were ranted aid 
the house first voted to cut off aid to the contras in 1983 
after two annual secret appropriations of 19 million each a later 
compromise made 24 million in open aid available to the rebels 
that year 
another vote to cut off aid came in 1984 after reports that the 
cia had mined nicaraguan harbors 
late in 1984 congress set aside 14 million but did not release 
it and banned support for paramilitary operations in nicaragua 
without congressional approval 
an adverse house vote early in 1985 kept the 14 million from 
being released although the senate voted in favor 
during the summer of 1985 congress approved 27 million in 
humanitarian aid and barred the cia and the military from any 
role in distribution of the funds 
in the fall of 1986 congress approved 100 million a large 
part of it for military aid and lifted restrictions on the cia 
early in 1987 the house tried to hold up the final 40 million 
of the 100 million approved the previous year but the senate 
refused to go along 
when the 1988 fiscal year began on sept 30 1987 a series of 
temporary aid measures began that eventually provided 30 million 
early in 1988 congress killed president reagans request for 
36 million in aid and in march of that year the contras made a 
truce with the sandinista government congress that voted to 
provide 48 million but rejected a request for 47 million in the 
summer 
after he took office president bush decided he had no chance of 
winning military aid and negotiated his deal with his congressional 
critics a key bush aide white house counsel c boyden gray 
suggested in a bizarre episode that the agreement could amount to 
an unconstitutional abrogation of the presidents powers

thirty states raised taxes in the 
postelection year legislative sessions of 1989 including six 
states that enacted broad increases in personal income taxes a 
survey of the states shows 
net tax cuts were set for the coming year in another 11 states 
although in most cases the cuts were small 
passed despite intense political opposition to federal tax 
increases voiced by president bush and others the state actions 
are expected to produce a net increase in revenue amounting to 35 
billion in fiscal 1990 
that is only a fraction of the 280 billion in revenue of all 
the 50 states but compares to a small net tax decrease of the 
previous year according to the survey conducted by the national

use the new ending i think its right now said shaffer 
its better than the original 
shaffer said he would never implement a rewrite until there is a 
change of cast or as on broadway a fresh staging 
the creators of aspects had no such qualms no sooner had 
the longawaited musical opened april 17 at the prince of wales 
theater than revisions were being discussed on june 16 in they 
went 
you rehearse it in front of frank rich basically said 
actress kathleen rowe mcallen referring to the new york times 
critic who saw the show at the june 17 matinee 
its a matter of fine tuning and honing colyricist don 
black said there were certain things we wanted to do before the 
opening and there wasnt really time 
the changes in aspects focus on mcallens character 
giulietta an italian sculptress who has affairs with both an aging 
english aristocrat kevin colson and his younger wife a french 
actress ann crumb 
a new song in the second act theres more to love than making 
love replaces the initial with other men to make giulietta 
more than just a promiscuous italian said mcallen 
originally the show ended where it began at a train station 
in pau in southwest france as the romantic lead michael ball 
prepared to leave with giulietta possibly in tow 
now it ends in the aristocrats garden with the romantic leads 
in a clear romantic clinch of all the musicals permutations here 
at last is one that may endure and the new ending is meant to 
satisfy audiences who may have felt confused or let down by the 
original finale 
it finishes on a high said black who went on to quote his 
american colleague composerlyricist stephen sondheim stephen 
says musicals arent written theyre rewritten and this is 
very much the case 
its not like the old days on the road where you sling a song 
out or write a new scene you have to live with a score and let it 
settle to see if it sits properly with the audience 
in london too preview periods are much briefer than on 
broadway so that adjustments are more easily made after the 
opening 
black said aspects was now frozen for london but would no 
doubt change further when it opens on broadway next april the 
tinkering isnt done 
echoed critic mark steyn in the independent newspaper while 
the show has been sharpened aspects still has much to be 
fixed 
follies les miserables and chess are other recent 
shows that changed during their london engagements 
but the phenomenon is not limited to blockbuster musicals of the 
1980s 
oscar wildes 1895 masterpiece the importance of being 
earnest was originally in four acts the version now being 
performed has three 
tennessee williams wrote two separate third acts for his 1955 
cat on a hot tin roof more recently producer joseph papp shut 
down rehearsals of albert innauratos coming of age in soho 
offbroadway to allow the playwright to overhaul his play

as hong kongs muggy summer moves relentlessly 
on longsimmering tension over the skyrocketing population of 
vietnamese boat people in the british colony is coming to a boil 
hong kong residents are increasingly bitter about the 52000 
vietnamese now in camps after sailing in rickety wooden boats from 
their communist homeland in search of a better life 
and the boat people could become increasingly difficult to 
control if britain and vietnam agree on a program that would 
forcible send most of them back 
i think the hong kong people in general are fed up with the 
problem said allen lee the senior member of the legislative 
council which approves hong kongs laws the reason for this is 
the continuing influx 
more than 23000 boat people sailed into hong kong from may to 
july an 84 percent jump from the corresponding period a year 
earlier 
resettlement of the vietnamese asylumseekers in third countries 
has lagged far behind creating a crisis of accommodation for the 
new arrivals 
existing detention centers are overcrowded riots broke out in 
two camps late in july one after guards tried to prevent boat 
people from escaping through holes cut in the fence and another 
after a squabble between vietnamese women from rival groups 
when large numbers of people are kept cooped up in camps 
particularly in hot weather there is bound to be a great deal of 
discomfort and frustration secretary of security geoffrey barnes 
said after the first disturbance 
meanwhile government plans to build makeshift camps to house 
the flood of newcomers have met resistance from hong kong 
residents in the most recent example scores of villagers pitched 
tents on a construction site to stop work on a new detention center 
in rural sai kung 
reports of boat people escaping of severe staff shortages at 
the detention centers and alleged police brutality toward the 
vietnamese have added to the crisis atmosphere 
raymond chung an official who represents a hong kong district 
that has a detention center said his constituents now are more 
concerned about the boat people than the violent crackdown on 
dissent in beijing which has horrified this territory that returns 
to chinese sovereignty in eight years 
ironically the hardline stance against accepting the vietnamese 
comes as hong kong residents are demanding that britain offer them 
refuge because of the chinese communist crackdown on the mainland 
i think the situation is completely different chung said 
we are claiming our rights as british subjects 
in an effort to end the flood of boat people britain decided 
that all vietnamese arriving after june 1988 would have to prove 
they fled their homeland in fear of persecution or face 
repatriation 
negotiations with the vietnamese government to set up a system 
of forcible repatriation of vietnamese who fail to qualify as 
political refugees are under way a hong kong government screening 
system has determined that roughly four of every five arrivals will 
be sent back 
the united states is among those criticizing forcible 
repatriation and this has irritated some hong kong people they say 
the us position which they believe stems from a sense of moral 
responsibility for its role in the vietnam war should be backed by 
promises to resettle more boat people in the united states 
what affect the us opposition will have on the program is not 
clear but many hong kong people clearly hope repatriation begins 
soon despite concerns of increased tension in the detention centers 
boat people already have staged hunger strikes to protest plans 
for forcible repatriation and hundreds of makeshift weapons have 
been found during searches of the camps the us consulate in hong 
kong received a letter from one vietnamese who wrote in blood 
save my soul 
while the number of boat people who have volunteered to return 
to vietnam has increased in recent weeks they still account for 
only a tiny fraction of the total population 
chris bale the director of the relief agency oxfam hong kong 
sees a potentially explosive situation in the camps once 
mandatory repatriation begins 
but he believes efforts should continue on a repatriation 
program so long as safeguards are in place to ensure that political 
refugees do not have to return home and that people sent back will 
not face persecution

fred kona has been waiting 
20 years for an invitation to washington to present his shell money 
and war club to american veterans of the battle of guadalcanal 47 
years ago in world war ii 
japanese veterans of the battle took him to japan in 1985 and 
hes hoping the americans ask him to the united states he gave the 
japanese shell money highly prized by solomon islanders and 
usually used to buy brides 
but i got no money to go washington kona said 
the 50yearold solomon islander says he regards himself as a 
peace envoy 
he is well known to veterans of both sides who have returned to 
the site of one the pacific wars greatest battles 
among the coconut palms and jungle of his 214acre plantation 
he has assembled a collection of world war ii memorabilia 
look this japanese gun was designed by british this one by 
german he said in pidgin english this plane is grumman 
wildcat fly very high to dive on japanese ships 
his collection is virtually the only reminder of the great naval 
and land battle that began aug 7 1942 and ended the following 
february the americans lost 1600 men killed and 4200 wounded in 
taking the island japanese casualties were estimated at 15000 
killed or missing 
kona has the wreckage of a twintailed p38 lockheed lightning 
that was shot down by the japanese and salvaged from the sea 
he paid 400 for it 
when he first began collecting wrecked planes from the jungle in 
1969 he cut them into pieces so he could carry them 
i misunderstanding so i cut them he said adding he 
learned later it would have been better to have kept the planes 
intact 
there plenty of good planes all over until the 1960s but 
people sold them for scrap 
hauling fragments of wreckage from the jungles over the years 
he built up a collection of planes guns shells and helmets that 
many japanese and american veterans come to look at when they 
return to guadalcanal each year particularly in august many of 
them weep when they see them 
in recognition of his efforts the us government presented 
kona with an american flag that had flown over the white house in 
washington 
australian veterans to commerate the sinking of the flagship 
hmas canberra in a famous engagement alongside the uss houston 
against the japanese in the battle of savo island put up a plaque 
in his garden 
next to it is a marble stone memorial from the guadalcanal 
combined veterans usa 
and it stands next to another simple stone memorial with this 
inscription in english 
the repose of souls tens of thousands of young men who fell 
in battle sleep here may the tragic events that occurred on this 
island in world war ii 194243 be forever inscribed on our 
memories war brings all sides nothing but grief and distress it 
must never happen again to the souls of these departed youth our 
only words of tribute are the renunciation of war 
people of the world let us take this pledge and may the blue 
sea the great expanse of sky and this green island be a 
testimonial of eternal peace 
sleep peacefully fallen friends 
this monument was erected in memory of deceased friends by a 
former japanese soldier august 1983

this tranquil prosperous south atlantic 
port is an example of what angola could be like if peace takes hold 
and a 14yearold civil war comes to an end 
with its neat pink houses and joggers running along the 
oceanfront boulevard at dusk namibe looks like angolas past when 
portugal ran it and its future under independent black rule 
but even namibe sandwiched between the ocean and the namibian 
desert suffers from the devastating effects of the war and the 
rapid pullout of the portuguese after they granted independence in 
1975 
the city known as mocamedes during portuguese colonial years 
is now a focal point of a 500million reconstuction plan of the 
united nations development program to rebuild infrastructure and 
attract foreign investment in southern angola 
namibe has not suffered much from the war its enormously 
rich said otto essien the un programs representative in 
luanda angolas capital 
once peace takes hold he added angola will be among the most 
attractive countries in africa for foreign investors 
but peace is only the first step in rebuilding angolas 
unwieldy centralized socialist economy according to a report by 
the world bank and the un economic mismanagement and inadequate 
policies along with the war and mass exodus of skilled portuguese 
labor after independence are the main reasons for angolas poor 
economic performance 
angola is a vast fertile country twice the size of france 
whose wealth of oil and more than 30 types of minerals including 
uranium diamonds and iron ore could easily make its estimated 9 
million people among the richest in africa 
peace is edging slowly closer as the marxist governmen and 
usbacked rebels of the national union for the total independence 
of angola pursue sporadic talks in neighboring zaire 
over the last six months weve seen more interest in foreign 
investment and were happy about that said francois moulinier 
economic counsellor with the european economic communitys 
delegation in angola 
the diamond giant de beers the french bankers paribas the 
dutch brewer heineken and several us and european oil companies 
are likely to be joined by other foreign firms eager to do business 
in angola 
in namibe a fishing port on angolas 1000mile seaboard 
italian and spanish flags flutter on the sterns of rows of 
hardworked fishing boats 
portuguese construction companies are building on the sandy 
outskirts and the italians plan a joint venture to mine the areas 
marble quarries 
annual economic growth averaged less than 1 percent over the 
first 10 years after independence according to world bank and un 
data oil pumped by us and french firms kept the official war 
effort afloat but production of once major exports like diamonds 
coffee and sugar has slumped by as much as 90 percent from pre1975 
levels 
in addition the war consumes as much as 40 percent of the 
governments annual budget and has wrecked rail and road networks 
disrupting distribution of food and goods 
tens of thousands of angolans have been killed in the fighting 
and many more left crippled by land mines the international red 
cross estimates the war has made more than 600000 people homeless 
the marxistleninist government keen to attract more western 
capital acknowledged as early as december 1985 that it needed 
freemarket reforms 
in august 1987 president jose eduardo dos santos announced an 
ambitious economic and financial restructuring program it called 
for slashing state spending closing or selling unprofitable state 
enterprises and revitalizing the banking system 
a new foreign investment law permits the establishment of mixed 
stateprivate companies and guarantees foreigners rights to send 
profits and capital back home 
angola also is becoming a member of the international monetary 
fund which is expected to clear the way for a rescheduling of a 
4billion foreign debt 
the government has been quite open about economic reform the 
orientations good but the problem is implementation its a 
mammoth task said the eecs mouilinier 
imf membership also is likely to bring about the longawaited 
devaluation of the kwanza the national currency from 30 to 60 to 
the us dollar and then to 120 a new controlled issue of bank 
notes could mean drastic belttightening for many angolans 
on the parallel market kwanzas currently are exchanged at rates 
of 2500 to 3000 to the dollar 
even in the relatively welloff namibe much remains to be 
overcome outdoor restrauants do a snappy trade but diners look 
resigned when told theres no beer 
its wednesday sighs one stateowned trucks deliver beer 
to namibe only on thursdays and that supply is often gone after the 
weekend

the day after his wife died an 83yearold 
man sat in his dining room surrounded by relatives crying why 
did she have to leave me he moaned then he went into the 
bedroom and killed himself 
a former harddriving insurance executive in his 60s unable to 
adjust to the slower pace of retirement and depressed because of 
the loss of identity he derived from his work took a job pumping 
gas six months after settling in a retirement community three 
months later he committed suicide 
an 82yearold man with the debilitating and ultimately fatal 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lou gehrigs disease was becoming 
increasingly helpless not wishing to burden his wife he slashed 
his wrists and bled to death 
the cases are typical of what experts say is a growing 
phenomenon but one that can go unrecognized because some deaths 
arent obviously suicide 
ive known people who would just sit in their apartments and 
eat nothing but 2 or 3 pieces of toast a day eventually they die 
from malnutrition said dr marv miller a san diego 
gerontologist who wrote in 1979 that the elderly are deadly 
serious about killing themselves 
as the older population grows in a youthoriented society the 
problem is worsening miller said in some societies older people 
are venerated and respected but not in this one 
once people are out of the work force and no longer 
contributing to the productivity of society in an economic sense 
society no longer has any use for them this is a shame because 
after the depression this country was built back by the people who 
are now the elderly 
in 1986 the most recent figures available the nations suicide 
rate was 128 per 100000 people for those 65 and over the rate 
was 216 per 100000 within that group the breakdown was 197 for 
ages 6574 252 for those 7584 and 208 for those 85 and older 
ten years previously those rates were 178 208 and 179 
respectively 
the national center for health statistics which compiles data 
from death certificates reported 2146 suicides among people 19 
and younger in 1986 and 6275 in the 65andover group miller 
said the actual number could exceed 10000 because of the 
underreporting of elderly suicides 
the figures are appalling said dr robert n butler author 
of the 1976 pulitzer prizewinning book why survive being old in 
america 
cuts in social programs and changing attitudes may be partly to 
blame for the 25 percent rise in latelife suicide since 1981 said 
dr nancy j osgood a medical college of virginia gerontologist 
in the last five or six years there has been a growing feeling 
that suicide is an acceptable solution to deal with lifes 
problems especially if youre old 
the problem is worse among men particularly white men in 1986 
the suicide rate among men aged 6574 was 355 compared to 72 for 
women in the 7584 group the rates were 548 and 75 for 85 and 
older 616 and 47 
many men feel that when they are no longer working they have 
no value they have merged their work with their identity which 
precipitates an identity crisis upon retirement they are 
traumatized by so much free time said miller author of 
suicide after sixty the final alternative 
todays elderly women on the other hand were wife and 
mother and maintain their same roles throughout life he said 
they also can ask for help without it being interpreted as a sign 
of weakness 
men cant do that he said men cant even cry 
in addition to the loss of selfworth brought by retirement 
other major reasons for suicide among the elderly are loss of a 
loved one physical illness and to a lesser extent a motivation 
to defy or control death which miller said is becoming more common 
for people who are terminally ill 
while shooting is the primary method among all suicides the 
elderly sometimes use covert techniques like starvation refusal to 
take medicine and overdosing on prescribed drugs such covert 
suicide combined with the stigma of taking ones life leads to 
underreporting miller said 
someday someone very close to a president will commit 
suicide and then there will be a hue and cry raised across the 
country we need the president to enunciate a clear policy to lower 
the number of suicides by a certain time 
reporting would be improved if doctors were taught to recognize 
the signs of suicide and outreach programs should be set up to 
identify and treat potentially suicidal older people experts say 
the warning signs include behavior like stockpiling medicine 
changing wills and buying a gun other indications are extreme mood 
and behavior swings expressed feelings of hopelessness and 
worthlessness and major changes in weight eating and sleeping 
patterns 
only california delaware new hampshire pennsylvania and rhode 
island have stateoperated suicide prevention and intervention 
programs aimed at older people according to an october 1988 survey 
for the american association of retired persons virginia is 
planning a statewide education effort 
nevada has the nations highest rate of geriatric suicide at 
322 per 100000 people followed by arizona california colorado 
vermont new mexico idaho oregon virginia and florida said dr 
john l mcintosh a psychologist at indiana university who 
specializes in the elderly massachusetts with a rate of 99 per 
100000 people was the nations lowest 
no one knows for sure why rates are high in some states 
said mcintosh who wrote suicide and the elderly with ms 
osgood in 1986 the reason could lie in geographic isolation and 
easy availability of firearms in rural areas 
the suicide rate could be reduced by a national program that 
encouraged the elderly to remain productive said butler director 
of geriatrics at the mount sinai school of medicine in new york he 
suggested creating a national senior service corps to take 
advantage of the vast untapped talent pool 
there are any number of such programs for the young but none for 
older people he said once again as a society were missing the 
boat we should create opportunities for the elderly to contribute 
to society its a shame not to make use of such talent 
miller suggested putting day care centers in nursing homes 
where elderly people who have an affinity for children would 
care for them and even be paid for it corporate america also 
could play a significant role by providing preand postretirement 
counseling and letting workers put in fewer hours three or four 
years before they retire cushioning the shock of leaving 
anyone without sensitivity to the problem is really 
shortsighted he said were all going to be elderly one day

fewer thrift institutions lower deposit rates 
for savers and reduced property values in some regions will result 
from the landmark savings and loan legislation passed by congress 
analysts say 
the 1000page bill adopted early saturday is the most 
significant financial law adopted since the depression as the 
largest government bailout ever it will cost each taxpayer about 
1000 over 30 years to close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrift 
institutions hemorrhaging losses at the rate of 20 million a day 
the measure provides the most sweeping reorganization of the 
regulatory bureaucracy in 50 years beyond that in highly visible 
and more subtle ways it touches anyone who pays taxes deposits 
money with a bank or sampl or owns real estate

thirty states raised taxes in the 
postelection year legislative sessions of 1989 including six 
states that enacted broad increases in personal income taxes a 
survey of the states shows 
net tax cuts were set for the coming year in another 11 states 
although in most cases the cuts were small 
passed despite intense political opposition to federal tax 
increases voiced by president bush and others the state actions 
are expected to produce a net increase in revenue amounting to 35 
billion in fiscal 1990 
that is only a fraction of the 280 billion in revenue of all 
the 50 states but compares to a small net tax decrease of the 
previous year according to the survey conducted by the national 
conference of state legislatures 
the high level of activity this year is typical of a 
postelection year since states tend to avoid tax increases when 
an election is looming immediately ahead said steven gold 
director of fiscal studies for the conference 
the survey was part of a broader report being released today at 
the conference of state legislatures annual meeting in tulsa okla 
some states approved packages raising several taxes such as 
illinois where the total was projected at more than 1 billion and 
nearly 10 percent of state revenue last year and connecticut 
where the increase topped 800 million or 18 percent of state 
revenue 
in illinois when we think something is important were 
willing to pay for it republican gov jim thompson said 
the largest income tax increases came in illinois 
massachusetts connecticut north dakota vermont and montana the 
survey said in connecticut the tax applies only to dividends 
interest and capital gains not earned income 
the tax increase total would have been even larger but for new 
york although the new york legislature passed a number of 
increases in taxes on cigarettes alcohol and corporations new 
york was counted in the survey as a net tax decrease because of a 
12 billion income tax reduction passed in 1987 and scheduled to 
take effect in october gold said 
taxes were raised in all regions of the country in new england 
where an economic slowdown has hit states that only a few years ago 
were booming five of six states raised taxes and only maine cut 
them 
to a considerable extent the most serious state fiscal 
difficulties were in the northeast including new england states 
new york and new jersey gold said 
their budget problems follow a fouryear period when they were 
among the fiscally strongest states in the nation most of them 
increased their budgets substantially and reduced taxes during that 
period setting them up for problems this year 
hawaii where a budget surplus was projected passed permanent 
income tax reductions plus a onetime rebate of 125 per person 
kansas and maine also cut income taxes according to the survey 
hawaii was the only state where tax cuts totaled more than 5 
percent of revenue wisconsin cut taxes 3 percent 
gasoline and sin taxes were the most popular targets for 
increases the survey found 
sixteen states increased their motor fuels taxes by at least one 
cent per gallon 13 states raised cigarette taxes and seven raised 
taxes on alcoholic beverages corporate income taxes were increased 
in five states 
sales taxes were increased in georgia connecticut north dakota 
and kansas and west virginia extended it to cover food 
connecticut also broadened the tax to cover services such as 
architectural design consulting lobbying public relations 
repairs and some advertising 
many other miscellaneous taxes were raised including increases 
in real estate transfer taxes in six states states are 
increasingly turning to taxes on real estate sales as a source of 
revenue gold said 
states want to raise money without interfering with the 
economy he said when youre talking about hundreds of 
thousands of dollars for selling property and paying 6 percent or 
more to an agent the state taking 1 or 1 and a half percent more 
doesnt seem to make that much difference to people 
according to the survey the following states have passed net 
tax increases amounting to 5 percent or more of state revenue 
taking effect in the next fiscal year alaska connecticut 
georgia illinois massachusetts north dakota rhode island and 
west virginia 
raising taxes by 3 percent to 5 percent were nevada north 
carolina tennessee and vermont 
raising taxes 1 percent to 3 percent were arizona colorado 
missouri montana new hampshire nebraska ohio oregon and 
wyoming 
raising taxes less than 1 percent were arkansas florida 
kansas michigan mississippi new mexico oklahoma south 
carolina washington 
states listed as lowering taxes more than 1 percent were 
hawaii wisconsin louisiana new york virginia and texas taxes

as many as 30 commodity traders indicted in a 
federal probe of chicagos futures exchanges eventually will plead 
guilty according to a published report 
attorneys for some of the 46 traders indicted last week said 
guilty pleas could come as early as wednesday when 21 defendants 
who traded in the japanese yen pit at the chicago mercantile 
exchange are scheduled to be arraigned the chicago tribune 
reported in todays editions 
it was thought last week that 14 traders would plead guilty 
rather than face trial the tribune said it raised its estimate 
over the weekend after interviewing defense lawyers 
the charges range from prearranged trading to racketeering 
conspiracy and tax fraud most of the charges involve schemes in 
which traders allegedly pocketed part of the profit from trades 
they made for customers while passing on to customers their 
personal losses 
the defendants traded in the yen and swiss franc pits at the 
merc and the soybean and us treasury bond pits at the chicago 
board of trade 
attorneys said decisions to plead guilty by some traders were 
based on three considerations government evidence against the 
traders the potentially heavy prison sentences and fines for a 
conviction on racketeering charges and new federal sentencing 
guidelines that remove much judicial discretion

the deadline for sale of the galesburg 
registermail to thomson newspaper of toronto has passed so the 
illinois newspapers owners hope to void the sale agreement 
the registermails owners have filed a lawsuit in us district 
court asking that the 147 million contract with thomson be 
declared null and void 
the peoria journal star has made two tender offers for the 
registermail and two weekly newspapers the wrova reporter and the 
galva news those offers are to expire on thursday 
one offer for 15 million involves creation of an employee 
stock ownership plan which offers significant tax benefits the 
second offer is for 16 million for a direct purchase 
the lawsuit filed friday states that thomson repeatedly said it 
would call off the deal if its purchase of the registermail was 
not completed as scheduled on june 30 
thomson now claims that its contract with the signing 
shareholders is valid and enforceable and that it will neither 
permit a sale to the peoria journal star nor an unrestricted public 
auction the complaint stated 
about 91 percent of the registermails shares already had been 
tendered to thomson when judge michael mihm issued an injunction 
blocking the sale on june 30 
former registermail publisher john pritchard who also is a 
trustee of a trust that controls 54 percent of the newspapers 
stock asked for the injunction on the grounds that the other two 
trustees had breached their fiduciary responsibilities by not 
adequately considering other offers he also charged that the two 
his brother lester pritchard and their cousin sally day agreed 
to sell to thomson because of payments that would have bypassed the 
trust 
all three trustees joined together in fridays action to void 
the thomson deal 
thomson has appealed mihms injunction to the 7th circuit court 
of appeals in chicago but a hearing has not yet been scheduled 
along with the injunction mihm had voided the tendering of the 
trusts shares to thomson and ordered the appointment of an 
investment banker to evaluate all offers

their service but those needing operator assistance faced some 
delays and spokesmen for the companies said repairs and 
installations also will be stalled as managers try to fill in for 
strikers 
we have more than 20000 management people filling in but we 
have 60000 strikers said nynex spokesman bob obrien but 
obviously there are fewer resources certainly delays will 
occur 
the unions preparing for the possibility of lengthy strikes 
this week will ask the aflcio to adopt a support plan that 
includes a call on unions their members and others who live in the 
affected areas to withhold payment on their local phone bills 
the proposal will be presented to the 14millionmember labor 
federations executive council which is holding its summer meeting 
this week in chicago 
three more regional phone companies face saturday strike 
deadlines those companies ameritech us west and southwestern 
bell have 131000 union workers and provide service in 24 states 
of the strikes than began sunday the situation at nynex appeared 
the most contentious major disputes over wages and a company 
proposal to shift health insurance costs to workers have prevented 
formal talks since friday 
the company provides service in new york and the six new england 
states like pacific telesis and bell atlantic nynex has used 
management personnel to replace strikers 
nynex has 60000 union workers twothirds of whom are 
represented by cwa the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers represents the remaining 20000 and for the first time this 
year has bargained with its onetime rival union 
nynex was hit by a nineday strike in 1986 the last time it 
bargained with the unions 
in all three strike situations the unions and companies 
remained well apart on the issues of wages and health insurance 
and a number of local issues remained unresolved in each set of 
negotiations the debate over health insurance has been the major 
obstacle with the unions resisting companies efforts to shift 
some costs to workers 
some progress was reported sunday in talks between the two 
unions and pacific telesis but the two sides sparred over the 
scope of the companys offer on the table when the strike was 
called at midnight saturday 
pacific telesis serves parts of california and all of nevada and 
employs 44500 union workers all but 2500 of them cwa members 
the strike deadline at bell atlantic was extended as 
negotiations continued past midnight saturday but a walkout was 
called just before 7 am sunday because of a lack of progress 
bell atlantic serves delaware maryland new jersey 
pennsylvania virginia west virginia and the district of columbia 
cwa represents 41000 bell atlantic workers ibew 11500 
instead of posting pickets the 64000 union workers at 
bellsouth were preparing for a ratification vote on their new 
contract 
the bellsouth agreement provides an immediate 4 percent pay 
increase and cost of living adjustments in 1990 and 1991 bellsouth 
officials said the pact also provides employees up to 12 months of 
child care leave and six months of medical coverage while on leave

striking eastern airlines pilots generally remain 
opposed to returning to work following meetings in several of the 
carriers major cities a pilots union spokesman said today 
air line pilots association members in atlanta new york and 
miami met on sunday to discuss whether to continue the 
fivemonthold walkout said alpa spokesman ron cole 
all the feedback weve gotten says there is strong support for 
remaining on strike said cole 
alpa officials say formal votes are scheduled for today in 
atlanta and tuesday in miami 
alpa members in boston washington and tampa fla could listen 
to the miami meeting via an audio link but cole was not certain 
whether pilots in those cities cast votes 
during a closeddoor meeting in miami on sunday some pilots 
booed and stormed out after a returntowork option was presented 
by jack bavis the head of easterns pilots union according to 
published reports one pilot pushed a television cameraman who was 
outside the meeting room 
cole said only a few pilots at the meeting said they have 
contemplated returning to work 
some pilots circulated petitions suggesting that alpas national 
leadership was not giving full support to striking eastern pilots 
and advocated a nationwide pilot work stoppage on labor day 
karen ceremsak a spokeswoman for the miamibased carrier said 
a few pilots called sunday to indicate they wanted to return to 
work 
the 20member pilots master executive council voted in favor of 
continuing the strike on saturday following a fiveday meeting in 
washington 
your mec voted unanimously to continue the picket line the 
unions taped telephone message said adding that the union 
leadership repeated its commitment to longterm pilots security 
remember how important it is to hold the line while all these 
dynamic forces affecting our situation and the alternatives are 
played out the message said 
among the options to be proposed at the tuesday alpa meeting in 
miami are 
continuing the strike and support of the buyout effort by 
chicago options trader joseph ritchie 
negotiating a settlement with eastern management the air line 
pilots associations chief goals in negotiations have been job 
security for its 3600 eastern members ensuring easterns survival 
and unionizing pilots at continental airlines easterns sister 
carrier under texas air corp ownership 
returning to work unilaterally the pilots are on sympathy 
strike and their contract remains in effect 
the last scenario would raise legal questions about how many 
pilots eastern would have to take back at their existing salaries 
considerably higher than those of newly hired pilots 
eastern which admitted its machinists strike contingency plans 
were crippled by the pilots surprising solidarity has been moving 
along on a rebuilding plan without its unions 
the airline filed march 9 for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization five days after the machinists went on strike and 
were joined by the pilots and flight attendants eastern has filed 
a plan for its creditors that envisions an airline twothirds its 
prestrike size coming out of bankruptcy by years end 
eastern says it will need 1700 pilots by weeks end eastern 
said 380 alpa pilots had crossed the picket line more than 300 
newly hired pilots have completed training and 700 more are in 
training 
eastern has indicated that most of the striking pilots no longer 
have jobs to come back to the pilots union would likely challenge 
that 
from the outset eastern management has said it doesnt need the 
striking machinists whose 8500 members include mechanics baggage 
handlers and other ground services workers but the unions with 
some backing in congress have chaged that consumer safety could be 
compromised by easterns heavy reliance on newly hired pilots

investor marvin davis has made an unsolicited and 
conditional offer to acquire ual corp parent of united airlines 
company officials announced today 
the bid reportedly worth 200 a share or 432 billion sent 
ual stock soaring in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange 
by late morning ual was up 3650 to 201 a share 
the board of ual is to consider the proposal at a wednesday 
meeting the officials said 
while the board of directors has not decided whether a sale of 
the company is in the best interest of the companys shareholders 
and other constituencies in keeping with its fiduciary duty the 
board will give careful consideration to mr davis proposal 
stephen m wolf ual chairman and president said in a news release 
ual spokesman rob doughty refused to comment beyond wolfs 
statement and would not say what davis offered for chicagobased 
ual 
however the wall street journal reported in todays editions 
that davis a former oil wildcatter has offered 200 a share or a 
total of about 432 billion for the airline 
ual stock has risen sharply since los angeles investor alfred 
checchi made a successful 365 billion bid in june for nwa inc 
the parent of northwest airlines 
ual stock rose from 11750 in midjune to 190 in late july 
the movement was fueled by speculation that investors such as 
robert bass and davis had purchased stakes in ual 
however the price of the stock has settled in recent trading 
closing at 16450 on friday amid reports that the us 
transportation department would no longer look kindly on leveraged 
takeovers of major us airlines 
the offer from davis comes at a time when the airline is 
experiencing some troubles in july united had its second fatal 
accident in six months when a dc10 crashlanded in sioux city 
iowa killing 111 of the 296 passengers and crew aboard 
in february the cargo door of a boeing 747 blew out over the 
pacific ocean on a flight from honolulu to auckland new zealand 
killing nine 
united recently surpassed by american as the nations largest 
airline lrofit from a year earlier 
for the quarter ended june 30 the airline reported net income 
of 141 million or 652 per share on revenue of 25 billion the 
company had revenue of 898 billion in 1988

former us sen thomas eagleton on monday 
criticized reforms recently announced by the chicago mercantile 
exchange and asked the commodity futures trading commission to 
impose more stringent measures on the merc 
eagleton a public member of the exchanges board of governors 
and a member of a special committee whose work led to the reforms 
said the changes announced aug 3 are a positive step but do not go 
nearly far enough 
the reforms announced just one day after 46 traders were 
indicted call for tougher rules and penalties and increased 
surveillance of the trading floor one official said they are 
designed to put the fear of god into the membership 
he said the public outcry system of grunts groans and 
gestures permits only limited accountability and limited ability 
to trace transactions 
eagleton also called for more clout for floor inspectors and an 
even tighter audit trail 
the commodity futures trading commission has to awake from its 
long slumber and realize that the peoples multibilliondollar 
business in chicago has to be vigorously supervised by the peoples 
regulatory agency the missouri democrat said 
leo melamed chairman of the mercs executive committee said 
the reforms were first discussed in january by merc officials who 
appointed a blueribbon panel including eagleton to review 
procedures on the floor in response to public disclosure of a 
2year undercover federal investigation at the merc and the 
chicago board of trade 
the board of trade announced similar measures late wednesday 
within hours of the indictment 
the most significant rule change approved by the mercs board of 
governors however requires membership approval 
it would severely limit dual trading in which a trader is 
allowed to trade his own account as well as customers accounts a 
practice that appears to have made possible many of the frauds 
alleged in the indictment

congress faces a long hard bruising battle 
over the 1990 farm bill but could have the job done by next summer 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said monday 
yeutter also said the united states will continue to push for 
elimination of the barriers to fair agricultural trade around the 
world 
in a speech to the us feed grains council yeutter said he 
expects heavy debate on new federal farm legislation in 
february and march as congress tries to approve a farm bill before 
the 1990 elections 
yeutter said he disagrees with those who want the united states 
to limit farm production and sell less grain overseas he said 
there will be 62 billion people in the world by the year 2000 
somebody is going to feed those folks said yeutter i 
hope that somebody will include us feed grain producers 
he also said he opposes international agreements in which 
exporting countries try to divide up markets and regulate prices 
id rather compete than negotiate market shares he said 
yeutter said us officials attending the next round of 
international trade negotiations will work for reform of policies 
that limit imports subsidize exports and create high internal 
price supports for farmers 
such practices distort free trade he said 
the european community for example has reduced its imports of 
coarse grains from 20 million metric tons a year to 4 million tons 
a year in 10 years while its exports of grain have increased from 
5 million to 12 million tons said yeutter 
thats an enormous turnaround thanks to these export 
subsidies he said lets phase out all the distortions and 
let farmers compete 
one approach said yeutter would be to persuade nations to 
replace all import constraints quotas for example with 
tariffs then work to gradually reduce them 
until trade reform is accomplished however yeutter said the 
united states will need to provide export subsidies to compete with 
other producers like the european community 
yeutter also said us farmers will have to be more competitive 
so that they can take advantage of foreign sales opportunities when 
trade barriers are removed 
we better be ready to get them when the markets exist said 
yeutter 
during the meeting yeutter also announced that the united 
states and the soviet union will begin negotiations in december for 
a new longterm grain agreement 
the current agreement provides that the soviets will buy at 
least 4 million metric tons each of us wheat and corn annually 
and make additional purchases of at least 1 million tons of wheat 
corn soybeans or soybean meal 
it also allows the soviets to buy up to 3 million metric tons of 
additional wheat and corn without additional consultations 
the us feed grains council a private organization of farm and 
agribusiness groups was formed in 1960 to promote export markets 
for us corn barley and sorghum 
about 300 people are expected to attend the annual meeting 
which concludes wednesday

retailers distributors producers and tape manufacturers have come 
to the show to check out everything from who framed roger 
rabbit to balloonacy a howto video complete with 50 
balloons and tips to create more than 30 inflated animals 
although offbeat titles account for only a small percentage of 
video sales they do give the show its distinctive flavor

at the same time though the video industry is confronting a 
number of potentially damaging developments 
rushing into the 90s brings us to a critical crossroads 
said andy lasky the conventions chairman 
video executives are concerned that a number of pending bills 
aimed at containing violent programming will keep video retailers 
from renting movies that children might be able to see on 
television or in pg13 rated motion pictures in theaters 
there is also growing concern among video renters that tape 
quality has deteriorated conventioneers say whos to blame 
though is unclear it could be fieldinflicted damage caused 
by dirty vcrs and careless customers or it could be costcutting 
manufacturing and duplication techniques that make tapes fall apart 
after only several viewings 
shoplifting has become a concern too and conventiongoers 
investigated new security systems aimed at stopping theft and 
retailers are fighting to maintain rights to rent nintendo video 
games a practice which nintendo says hurts sales and should be 
stopped

the dallas times herald filed suit monday against 
the owner of its crosstown rival the dallas morning news as one 
of the nations fiercest newspaper wars returned to court after a 
yearlong absence 
in a lawsuit filed in houston the smaller times herald asked a 
texas judge to prevent morning news owner ah belo corp from 
acquiring exclusive dallasarea rights to 26 comics columns and 
other features it currently publishes 
the lawsuit claims belo and universal press syndicate will 
inexorably harm competition in the dallas market if the rights 
are granted 
the times herald chose houston seeking neutrality president 
ll ike massey said 
belo announced last week it had formed a joint venture with 
universal press syndicate to explore television programming 
possibilities for some of the syndicates features which include 
such comic strips as doonesbury and the far side advice column

as part of that agreement belo which also owns dallas top 
television station acquired the exclusive rights to the 
syndicates features in the market 
the belo company is attempting to unfairly increase its 
influence in the dallas market where it already operates the 
larger newspaper the leading television station and seven 
community newspapers massey said in a prepared statement now 
it wants to manipulate a newspaper syndicate against us 
besides blocking the transfer the times herald is seeking 
actual and punitive damages 
last week belo president james p sheehan said the exclusivity 
agreement really is secondary to the joint venture however he 
said it wouldnt be appropriate for us to develop one of the 
features to be running in a competitors newspaper in our market 
sheehan said monday we believe that their lawsuit is without 
merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
just last year the two newspapers settled a dispute over 
circulation figures as each dropped a lawsuit against the other in 
an argument begun by the times herald

a conservative critic of treasury secretary 
nicholas f bradys plan for cutting third world debt said on 
monday that mexico needs to privatize more of its industry and cut 
the number of bureaucrats so that mexicans will be encouraged to 
bring home the billions they have sent to the united states and 
other safe havens 
he said that mexico has more government employees than the 
united states which has three times mexicos population 
we havent heard anything about debtequity swaps cancelling 
foreign debt in return for shares in mexican industry said 
edward l hudgins director of the center for international 
economic growth the center is part of the heritage foundation a 
conservative private study group 
its not inflationary as mexican officials say some of those 
shares are owned by the government they can be turned over in 
return for debt 
earlier monday brady said that last months agreement between 
the mexican government and creditor banks to reduce 54 billion 
worth of mexicos foreign debt has brought the country so much 
investment from abroad that a 2 billion bridge loan he had 
promised may be less necessary brady spoke at a news conference in 
mexico city 
the mexican agreement has aroused criticism as well as praise in 
recent days 
sir kit mcmahon chairman of britains midland bank called it 
illconceived and destabilizing encouraging debtor countries to 
slow down repayments netherlands finance minister h onno ruding 
head of the international monetary funds powerful interim 
committee said he would not ask his taxpayers to finance payments 
to american banks 
william r cline a senior fellow at the institute for 
international economics reported that an estimated 25 billion 
had been brought back to mexico since the agreement some estimates 
put the total of capital flight from mexico as high as 80 
billion mexicos foreign debt is calculated by the world bank at 
more than 107 billion 
cline agreed with brady that the agreement had improved public 
confidence so much in mexico that domestic interest rates had come 
down enough to save the mexican government 10 billion a year 
cline estimated that it will save mexico another 1 billion to 15 
billion a year of the interest it has been paying on foreign debt 
the institute is a private research body with international 
funding 
though he saw the plan as a good start cline said that about 
34 billion pledged to support it by the fund the world bank and 
japan would not be enough that at least 50 billion will be 
needed 
third world debt is estimated at 13 trillion

american telephone amp telegraph co on monday 
accused its biggest competitor mci corp of offering large 
business customers illegally low prices to win their longdistance 
telephone business 
atampt officials said they hope the complaint will lead to a 
reversal of a federal communications commission policy that exempts 
atampt competitors from having to file tariffs with the fcc detailing 
rates and other terms they offer customers 
in its complaint to the fcc atampt alleged that mci has used 
unlawful discriminatory discounts the past two years to win 
contracts with the pentagon merrill lynch westin hilton and 
vista hotels united airlines the university of colorado and 
uniguard security insurance co 
the commissions regulatory reforms have not kept pace with 
the fierce growth of interexchange competition francine j 
perry atampts vice president for legal affairs said in a letter to 
the fcc accompanying the complaint 
to promote competition in longdistance and data transmission 
services with the thenimpending breakup of the bell system the 
fcc in 1983 granted forbearance to nondominant carriers on 
filing rate tariffs with the commission 
atampt said it viewed that decision as a transitional interim 
step that would lead to eliminating unnecessary regulatory 
restraints such as disclosing its rate offerings to business 
customers for all longdistance carriers including itself 
because atampt alone has to file tariffs with the fcc mci and 
other competitors have gained unwarranted advantages in the 
marketplace by selectively providing services on an offtariff 
basis berry said 
mci which filed a similar complaint against atampt last year 
after atampt won a contract for holiday inns longdistance and 
reservation system called mondays complaint a smokescreen 
atampt is merely trying to achieve its own deregulation through 
the complaint process said pam small an mci spokeswoman 
theyre essentially challenging the rules 
ms small said mci maintains that atampt should still be required 
to detail its rates through tariff filings with the fcc because as 
the dominant carrier it still holds 80 percent of the 
longdistance and interstate data transmission market 
herb linnen spokesman for atampt said fcc figures show the 
company holds about 68 percent of the market far less than the 
almosttotal control it once held 
generally in telecomunications or other regulated industries 
companies must adhere to tariffs filed with regulators

a delaware judge refused monday to stop dunkin 
donuts inc from taking antitakeover measures that put about 28 
percent of the companys stock in friendly hands 
vice chancellor william chandler of delaware chancery court 
denied a request by a canadian partnership for a preliminary 
injunction against the doughnut companys 35 million employee 
stock ownership plan and its 28 million sale of preferred stock to 
general electric capital corp 
the canadian partners unicorp canada corps kingsbridge 
capital group and cara operations limited launched a 305 million 
hostile tender for dunkin donuts in june 
the doughnut chain based in randolph has franchised more than 
1700 doughnut shops worldwide it reported a profit of 135 
million on sales of 1128 million last year 
kingsbridge and cara argued in the lawsuit that dunkin donuts 
enacted the esop and sold the preferred stock to ge capital to 
frustrate a takeover under delawares business combination statute 
which effectively requires a hostile bidder to obtain 85 percent of 
the target firms outstanding common stock 
the esop holds about 16 percent of dunkin donuts outstanding 
common shares and ge capitals preferred stock is convertible to 
700000 common shares or roughly an 11 percent stake in the 
company 
since top executives and directors also hold about 15 percent of 
the shares more than 40 percent of dunkin donuts is considered by 
securities analysts to be in friendly hands 
dunkin donuts attorney john d donovan jr said the judge 
accepted the doughnut makers contention that the esop and ge 
capital had caused no immediate and irreparable harm to the 
canadians 
we argued that if the esop and ge capital dont want to tender 
their shares its because the bid is at a bargain basement price 
not because they dont have a right to do so donovan said 
gil sparks attorney for the canadian partnership was on 
vacation monday and could not be reached according to a 
receptionist at his office in wilmington del there was no answer 
after business hours at kingsbridges toronto headquarters and 
kingsbridge spokesman eric w evans did not return messages left at 
his home

the federal aviation administration on monday 
canceled a 79 million contract with hazeltine corp to bring a new 
generation of landing systems to the nations airports 
the faa said in a statement that production delays have put the 
program three years behind schedule but the agency remains 
committed to using the new microwave landing systems at major us 
airports in 1998 and at all airports around the year 2000 
hazeltine has delivered two of the 178 landing systems called 
for in the contract since beginning work in 1984 one has been 
installed at the lebanon nh airport 
the agency said it would buy 26 systems from other sources test 
that equipment and a decision on how to move ahead will depend 
upon successful completion of the evaluation program the faa 
said it plans to award a new contract in 1991 
a spokesman for hazeltines parent company emerson electric 
corp said the company plans to file suit contesting the decision 
the spokesman said problems including payments and timing of 
deliveries were the result of changes the faa made in the contract 
after it was awarded 
the contract changes required by the faa over several years 
are so numerous and substantial that they have fundementally 
altered the nature and the cost of the contract said the 
spokesman who asked that his name not be used 
the system uses highfrequency microwaves to direct planes to 
landings allowing them to make curved and steeper approaches 
outside the strict paths necessary under the current instrument 
landing system virtually immune to weather the system can 
increase an airports flight capacity and helps planes avoid 
residential areas 
air carriers have been reluctant to support the microwave 
system saying it isnt much better than the current system 
the faa in june warned that hazeltines contract was in danger 
of being canceled because of production problems hazeltine had 
said the price of the contract was too low and entered an 
unauthorized work slowdown last august dick arnold head of the 
faas microwave landing system program said in june 
the company was given a delay in a decision on the contract in 
july to see if it could find another firm to it over but no such 
contractor was found according to the faa 
the agency had been planning on putting new microwave systems at 
the laconia and manchester airports in new hampshire but faa 
spokesman john leyden has said that because of the delays it may 
put early systems at highprofile highvolume airports such as 
john f kennedy international in new york 
the faa plans to buy 750 of the new systems if congress 
approves

two longtime newspaper rivals the las 
vegas reviewjournal and the las vegas sun announced plans monday 
to merge their business circulation and production operations in a 
joint operating agreement 
the venture must be approved by the us attorney generals 
office if accepted las vegas will become the 20th city in the 
country to have newspapers participating in a joa 
no change of ownership is involved and the agreement calls for 
both newspapers to maintain independent and separate newsrooms as 
well as separate weekday editions under the terms of the joa the 
reviewjournal would remain a morning paper and the sun would 
change from morning to afternoon publication 
combined morning editions labeled the las vegas 
reviewjournalsun would be published on saturdays sundays and 
holidays 
the sun would receive 10 percent of the operating profits of the 
two newspapers and the reviewjournal would receive 90 percent 
based on the rjs stronger financial position according to the 
joa agreement 
the agreement makes financial sense for the reviewjournal and 
is the last hope of the sun to continue providing las vegas with 
an outspoken frequently divergent editorial voice said the text 
of the agreement 
without this move we believe the sun is in probable danger of 
financial failure sun president brian greenspun said in a 
statement monday with this move there will be no displacement 
of sun newsroom personnel and there will be the continuation of an 
important newspaper 
the reviewjournal is the states largest newspaper and is the 
flagship for donrey media group which owns 59 us daily 
newspapers the sun is nevadas thirdlargest newspaper 
as of last year the reviewjournal had a circulation of 121321 
daily and 142923 on sunday the sun had a circulation of 50515 
daily and 54669 on sunday 
the plan would link the business and production functions of the 
two newspapers for an initial period of 50 years 
under the agreement the sun will give donrey media group 10 
percent of the outstanding stock in community cable tv and an 
option to purchase an additional 35 percent of the stock at a later 
date 
the value of 10 percent of community cable tv is estimated at 
about 20 million 
the agreement to enter into the joa was signed june 12 and is to 
be filed with the justice department tuesday approval of such 
agreements can take anywhere from a few months to several years 
the reviewjournalsun filing asked that the agreement be 
approved quickly and without a hearing because of the weak position 
of the sun in the marketplace 
the document said the sun is losing about 3 million a year on 
annual revenues of 21 million the newspaper last made a profit in 
1981 earning 183148 
the suns total debt now exceeds 107 million the application 
said 
the greenspun family has borrowed money from banks and 
familyaffiliated businesses to keep the newspaper going the 
document said hank greenspun founder of the sun died july 22
