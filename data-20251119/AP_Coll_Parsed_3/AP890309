in an unusual move to avoid another 
entertainment industry strike the two largest actors unions 
published their contract demands on wednesday two months before 
negotiations with producers are set to open 
the joint statement from the local board of the screen actors 
guild and the american federation of television and radio artists 
was conciliatory in tone asking for many of the same contract terms 
given to the writers guild of america following its sixmonth strike 
last year 
we are attempting to greatly accelerate the bargaining process 
in order to keep production going at full steam sag negotiator 
ken orsatti said in a statement after last years painful 
writers strike we dont believe the industry can withstand another 
major work stoppage 
the sagaftra release said the two guilds hoped to avert the 
long contentious bargaining process when their joint contract 
with producers expires june 30 
sagaftra negotiations with the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers are scheduled to begin on may 15 herb 
steinberg a spokesman for the producers group said that it would 
have no comment on the sagaftra proposals 
in their release the actors unions said they would accept new 
rules for overtime work and a new formula for rerun payments for 
onehour television programs the guilds also asked that producers 
raise minimum wages 4 percent each year in the threeyear contract 
improve pension and health plans and revise the payment structure 
for foreign television syndication

franz kafka is reappearing in print 
in his native prague after nearly 20 years but vaclav havel the 
czech dramatist wellknown in the west is in prison and his name is 
nowhere to be found on shop or library bookshelves 
like much else in a nation caught between the pressures of soviet 
reform today and the kremlinimposed orthodoxy of the past 
czechoslovak literature and the arts present a contradictory picture 
hesitant steps toward opening up the statecontrolled arts have 
returned a few previously unshown films including those by 
czechborn academy awardwinner milos forman to the movie 
theaters put a handful of more daring plays on the stage and 
legalized some underground rock groups 
this spring kafkas novels should go back on sale in prague 
they had been banned under the nazis in the stalinist 1950s and 
were out of print again after the prague spring reforms were 
crushed in 1968 
literary journals began publishing long articles on kafka and 
some of his notebooks last year the first time in two decades the 
author saw print apart from a collection of short stories published 
for the 1983 centenary of his birth 
but the new attitude to kafka does not extend to anything or 
anyone deemed a political challenge to the orthodox communists 
installed by moscow to rule after 1968 michal cernik head of the 
czech writers union has said that emigre writers can be published 
however both he and official poet karel sys editor of the 
relatively outspoken literary weekly kmen referred swiftly to top 
officials when asked in recent interviews if works by havel or the 
feted emigre writer milan kundera the unbearable lightness of 
being might appear soon in prague 
communist party leader milos jakes in a december interview with 
the french daily le monde spelled out why 
kundera is not a bad writer jakes said when asked whether 
works written since kundera went abroad in 1977 might be published 
in czechoslovakia but he simply takes his specific attitude to us 
and to socialism we have many more such talents but they 
do not speak openly against socialism 
as an active member of the charter 77 human rights group and a 
writer who refuses to leave his homeland havel draws far more 
official ire than any other cultural figure 
he was arrested jan 16 and went on trial in february on charges 
of sedition and obstructing a public official that could jail him 
for 2 years 
the growing respect for the 52yearold playwright among 
intellectuals and others outside the tiny circle of active 
dissidents inside czechoslovakia is one explanation for the tough 
move 
havel was feted when called to the stage at a folk music festival 
in lipnice last september an action that later sparked official 
reprisals against the festival host music critic jan rejzek 
he was the only dissident greeted by name with joyful chants of 
long live havel when the authorities surprisingly permitted an 
independent rally in prague last dec 10 
in contrast to the public silence in czechoslovakia after havel 
and five other activists were jailed for subversion in 1979 his 
january arrest prompted demonstrators in prague to shout demands for 
his release more than 1000 intellectuals who had never sided with 
havel in public before voiced the same demand in a letter urging the 
communist authorities to open up to the society they rule 
further signs of a stirring in the arts are found in the moravian 
capital of brno where theater is far more lively than in prague 
but political activity carries its price in brno too eva 
vidlarova an assistant director at a brno theater was detained in 
december after organizing a petition to free another jailed cultural 
activist independent publisher petr cibulka 
fear of such repression leaves many czech and slovak 
intellectuals wondering what to do to push for the greater freedom 
most seek like many people in the soviet bloc they often retreat 
into a private sphere of family friends and interests in that cozy 
world characterized by a leading economist as somewhere between 
nirvana and lethargy they can pursue cultural activities for 
small audiences or chase material comfort 
in society at large though they must often work at jobs that 
deaden initiative and cope with irritating consumer shortages once 
rare in czechoslovakia 
as dissatisfaction mounts official attempts at dialogue and 
counsels of patience ring hollow to many 
we know how bad the situation is said sys in an interview 
we can discuss it for hours and days but we live here and we have 
to get out of it somehow 
there are extremes on both sides in the clash between the 
communist authorities and independent groups sys said advocating 
dialogue as the solution 
but intellectuals who attended a meeting with prague communist 
party boss and politburo member miroslav stepan after the petition 
circulated on havel said the increasingly isolated leadership still 
seems unwilling to open up to the society it rules

in the bustling markets that line the 
narrow winding alleys and the muddy kabul river war always seems 
just around the corner 
tanks with their guns fixed and armored personnel carriers block 
intersections 
young soldiers clutching kalashnikov rifles in one hand and 
plastic prayer beads in the other patrol the streets and stand guard 
on rooftops 
helicopter gunships chug along the snowcovered mountains lined 
with radar installations 
the moslem guerrillas battling the forces of afghanistans 
sovietstyle government are hiding beyond the ridges that form a 
bowl around kabul the capital city of 225 million they 
periodically launch a few rockets into the capital 
theres little feeling of imminent danger in the marketplaces 
where merchants wrapped in tattered brown shawls and dingy white 
turbans sit crosslegged on the ground in front of huge piles of 
fruits and vegetables 
but rumor and speculation are as plentiful now as russian caviar 
and vodka were before the soviet army pulled out last month 
its the weather they the guerrillas are waiting for 
spring said one vendor zahir 
its the shura added another ibrahim referring to a 
guerrilla meeting in pakistan and suggesting the fighters are too 
preoccupied setting up a governmentinexile to launch major 
assaults 
moscow pulled out the last of its 115000 troops and ended its 
nineyear military involvement in afghanistan on feb 15 leaving 
the afghan forces alone to battle the usbacked guerrillas 
the departure of the last soviet soldier passed without much 
notice in afghanistan most people seemed more concerned about food 
shortages and the lack of fuel to heat their mud brick homes on the 
freezing winter nights 
there were no official ceremonies and only the barest 
acknowledgment by the kabul government of the kremlins involvement 
in a war that killed 13000 soviet soldiers 
the soviets have worked tenaciously to ensure that a friendly 
government remains in power in kabul and they have backed several 
ineffective measures aimed at drawing the rebels into a coalition 
government 
president najib outlined what he called a government of national 
reconciliation urging unity with the guerrillas who have battled 
the kabul regime since a few party members engineered an april 1978 
coup and began trying to radically alter the economic social 
political and religious life of afghanistan 
the guerrillas rejected najibs peace overtures and vowed to 
destroy his government 
the president has in turn tightened his grip on power 
he declared a state of emergency and suspended many individual 
rights he purged his cabinet of some members who were not from his 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan replacing them with his 
most trusted advisers and he placed the fate of the country in the 
hands of a 21member military council 
the government said the actions did not close the door to 
negotiations with the guerrillas 
we have to move more cautiously now than ever but we still 
want negotiations we want a rainbow coalition that represents all 
segments of afghan society said abdul fatah weidi the foreign 
ministrys information chief 
some diplomats and observers believe the guerrillas may be on the 
threshold of power 
but bitter divisions among the guerrilla factions are evident 
with some supporting establishment of a strict islamic republic and 
others supporting a more broadbased government 
many observers believe a power struggle similar to that which has 
plagued najibs party could break out among the guerrillas 
pressure has been increasing for policymakers from western 
countries to help mold the guerrillas into a more responsible 
coherent group but observers in kabul doubt it will happen 
outside interference in afghanistan has historically been a 
disaster both for the afghans and for the outside powers the 
russians ignored this reality said one un official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
afghanistan was one of the worlds poorest countries before civil 
war erupted 10 years ago relief officials say it will take years 
and billions of dollars just to restore it to its prewar state 
they estimate they will need 16 billion for the first 18 months 
the country has the worlds lowest average life expectancy 42 
years and the highest child mortality rate 30 percent of all 
children die before the age of 5 according to unicef 
late last year a un convoy carrying wheat seeds and fertilizer 
took off from kabul for the guerrillacontrolled panjsher valley 
where thousands of farmers hoped to begin planting for the first 
time in 10 years 
it was the first such international effort and was a major test 
of whether the country was stable enough to begin rehabilitation 
work 
several hours outside kabul the convoy was hijacked by a rival 
guerrilla group several un staff members were taken hostage 
afghan and soviet troops responded with tanks artillery and air 
bombardments 
no was was injured and the workers were released after four 
days but any illusions relief workers might have had about a quick 
and easy end to the suffering were shattered 
we were anxious to do some real rehabilitation work said 
ross mountain deputy director of the un development program 
but we learned the hard way that there are many many different 
groups out there it looks like things will have to shake down some 
more he said

it will be four years on march 11 since mikhail

after the kuibishev food warehouse tied pay raises 
to profits the staff worked so much harder that management no 
longer had to dragoon thousands of muscovites from their usual jobs 
to help sort vegetables at harvest time 
at the butovo building materials factory director mikhail 
bocharov turned a profit just months after being freed from the 
moscow ministry that controlled every kopeck bocharov shifted 
extraneous workers to producing plank furniture and plastic toys and 
plans to raise capital by selling stock to his staff 
but muscovites still line up on snowy streets for bruised 
halffrozen apples because the fruit rots on the trains creeping 
2000 miles to the capital from central asia at an average speed of 
15 mph and butovos bricks still crack before they leave the 
factory for lack of critical western technology 
president mikhail s gorbachev has changed so much in the soviet 
economy that bewildered citizens ask if he has given up on 
communism but the problems run so deep that his own economists say 
they will need years to raise the low standard of living of the 
average soviet 
to buy womens boots you need 250 to 300 rubles about 400 to 
483 complained war veteran a tabayakov in a letter to pravda 
my daughter who needs them is paid only 115 rubles 185 a 
month where is she supposed to get that kind of money 
four years after gorbachev took over as leader of the communist 
party meat and cheese are rationed in much of the country shelves 
in state stores are empty and citizens like tabayakovs daughter 
are forced to pay high prices to new cooperatives or the booming 
black market to get essentials perestroika or restructuring is 
getting the blame gorbachev admitted recently 
the shortages are so pervasive they are undermining attempts at 
reform 
wages and bonuses have no effect because the money received 
cannot buy anything said soviet economist nikolai schmelov 
some kremlin watchers doubt gorbachev can repair decades of 
damage fast enough to stave off collapse of the economy 
the failure is critical said columbia university soviet 
expert seweryn bialer it cannot go on indefinitely 
conrad miller a silver spring md computer salesman who spent 
seven months exhibiting his products in cities like minsk and 
tashkent said the people he met didnt share his optimism about 
perestroika 
theyd bite my head off and say you do not know nothing 
ever changes here he said 
gorbachev is trying he is in fact ripping the very fabric of 
his communist society he has rejected years of propaganda against 
profits and he is upsetting the cradletograve security guaranteed 
even the most worthless worker 
he promises to revive family farms through longterm leasing of 
state land currently uninspired collective farmers cant even 
choose their crops without approval from moscow bureaucrats 
but the problems gorbachev inherited are monumental construction 
firms take 11 years to complete a building less than 17 percent of 
soviet products meet world quality standards the labor force has no 
concept of such western notions as initiative hard work and 
efficiency 
secret budget deficits hide many of the failings of a centrally 
planned economy in which an army of apparatchiks has been trying 
vainly to allocate everything in the country right down to the 
number of turnips for tiksi prices are still set by bureaucrats 
with no regard for the cost of production or the demand for their 
goods 
gorbachev says he is attacking the budget deficit with a 14 
percent cut in defense spending to be achieved by recalling soviet 
troops from afghanistan and cutting 500000 men from the red army 
he has halted water projects including a plan to reverse the flow 
of siberias mightiest rivers 
half the bureaucrats in the government and communist party are 
slated to lose their positions which raises the spectre of 
unemployment despite gorbachevs insistence no one will be left 
jobless already at least 180000 bureaucrats have been moved 
according to the official news agency tass 
gorbachevs most dramatic success has been the legalization of 
private cooperatives to provide consumer services in critically 
short supply coops have mushroomed in two years to create 770000 
jobs typically at more than twice the average salary because 
staffers share the profits 
inspired by gorbachevs vision military officers dream of 
starting their own small businesses and bureaucrats searching for 
new niches in society attend classes in entrepreneurship and 
marketing 
however bialer said gorbachev also has made costly mistakes 
the campaign to cut alcoholism by slashing the supply of vodka 
cost 40 billion in taxes and revenues according to gorbachevs own 
estimate most of that sum simply moved from the treasury to the 
pockets of black marketeers and moonshiners encouraging the same 
sort of corruption spawned by prohibition in the united states 
if gorbachev had started his reforms with agriculture bialer 
said he might have solved the critical food shortage by now 
instead cooperative retail shops and services sprang up and 
they are using up scarce raw materials in the city of tallinn 
thousands of new coop taxis eased a chronic transportation 
shortage now theres no gasoline said estonian prime minister 
indrek toome 
gorbachev also has suffered costly bad luck cleanup and repairs 
from the chernobyl accident and the armenian earthquake are 
estimated at 292 billion 
the falling price of oil means the government must sell three 
times as much of its major export to buy the same danish ham as in 
1985 as a result imports of consumer goods have been slashed 
coffee for example is now a luxury obtainable only through back 
doors of restaurants from thieving employees 
soviet economists suggested eliminating central planning and 
letting the market set prices and supply but backed down for fear 
price increases would spark bloody riots like the ones in poland in 
1970 that toppled communist party leader wladyslaw gomulka 
gorbachev says he wants to ease the shortages first and then let 
prices float to avoid soaring inflation on items such as 
refrigerators and tv sets but western experts consider that 
impossible as long as prices are too low they say no one will 
produce anything and the shortages will remain 
in the meantime fear of the coming price reform has exacerbated 
the soviet hoarding habit and helped strip store shelves 
long before a marketdriven economy can offer even a taste of the 
overflowing markets of the west soviet citizens will feel its 
dislocations to reach such goals as hightechnology jobs full food 
stores and quality consumer products the soviet union must first 
confront the pressures of unemployment rising prices and economic 
disruption 
meanwhile gorbachev repeatedly tells his people give me 
time

when samuel knox skinner breezed into president 
bushs cabinet as one of its leastknown members sen trent lott 
rmiss advised the new transportation secretary dont let them 
shove you around 
im not going to take a back seat said skinner 
indeed he hasnt the man known back in chicago as sam the 
hammer has quickly made a name for himself on the white house 
varsity even as some of its more familiar players are still 
reviewing their game plans 
in short skinner soared from obscurity when eastern airlines got 
stuck on the ground a happenstance due in no small measure to his 
insistence that the carriers brutal labormanagement battle be 
allowed to take its natural course and soon 
to the dismay of easterns employees and all of big labor 
skinner and the president refused to intervene on the eve of the 
machinists union strike last saturday despite a mediation boards 
recommendation that a presidential emergency panel be named to 
attempt to settle the longstanding dispute under the law that 
would have precluded any work stoppage for an additional 60 days 
this dispute has been going on for 17 months skinner 
declared its time we get it resolved there was no guarantee 
that in 60 days were going to be any better off than we are now 
some analysts believe that virtually guarantees the imminent 
collapse of eastern and the loss of jobs and pension benefits for 
thousands of employees who had hoped for government help in their 
battle against the payrollcutting tactics of easterns owner frank 
lorenzo 
skinner further piqued labors anger when he served notice that 
the administration would battle secondary picketing and sympathy 
strikes elsewhere in the transportation sector despite a 1967 
supreme court decision which sanctioned such efforts and without 
taking formal action he has criticized the bytherules 
slowdown of pilots for other airlines 
actual work stoppages at noneastern sites skinner vows will be 
met with an attempt to persuade congress to enact a statutory 
prohibition thats on my desk ready to go up to the hill in five 
minutes if necessary 
meanwhile skinner has spurned congressional appeals to rethink 
the option of a presidential emergency board instead he has 
relayed veto threats over a house committees bill to force bush to 
appoint such a panel 
union officials say skinner is following precisely the 
toughonlabor pattern established by one of his predecessors drew 
lewis early in ronald reagans first term when the administration 
fired thousands of air traffic controllers who went on strike 
william winpisinger president of the international association 
of machinists accused skinner and bush of attempting to confine 
this dispute to a narrow arena where lorenzo can bring all his 
resources to bear against the striking employees 
his statements read like they were written by lorenzo said 
iam vice president john peterpaul if george bush wants a kinder 
gentler nation hes getting the wrong advice from sam skinner 
skinner insists hes not out to teach labor a lesson but neither 
will he tolerate allowing the machinists to shut down american 
industry and hold american industry hostage 
why should commuters in chicago and new york and auto workers 
in detroit be involved in this dispute he asked they should 
not 
neither has he minced words about lorenzo mr lorenzo has 
obviously not got the trust and confidence of his company a company 
doesnt work unless its a team he said wednesday congress 
cant get involved and the president cant get involved you dont 
create a working relationship between a company and its employees by 
congressional act 
skinners decision to force the eastern showdown and his blunt 
rhetoric on the issue come as no surprise to those who know him as a 
tough pragmatic chicago lawyer who spent much of his career in the 
shadow of his political mentor illinois gov james r thompson 
skinner was his top assistant when thompson was us attorney in 
chicago the governor recalls his deputy didnt quite fit into the 
velvet hammer school of prosecutors instead according to 
thompson he was just a hammer 
skinner 50 helped thompson prosecute one of the biggest federal 
corruption trials in illinois history the bribery case against

prime minister benazir bhuttos first 
months in office have brought a splash of color and a dose of 
culture to a pakistan that had grown grim and gray under her 
predecessor president mohammed zia ulhaq 
but this newfound sense of social freedom has created some deep 
conflicts in this moslem nation of 107 million people 
a group of islamic clergy have designated friday bhuttos 99th 
day in power as a day of protest against her allegedly secular 
policies they claim religious law bars a woman from governing an 
islamic country 
others disagree and have welcomed the swift social changes her 
young reign has wrought 
we had become a joyless society before she hit the scene 
said a senior pakistani diplomat who requested anonymity 
zia who died in a plane crash in august ruled 11 years under a 
combination of martial law and strict islamic practice 
but ms bhutto a 35yearold oxford and harvard graduate 
believes islam should be a religion and not a form of government 
her attitude seemed to catch on quickly after she emerged 
victorious from the november elections 
a young brotherandsister duo of singers and dancers known as 
nazia and zohaib were the first act of their kind to to hit the 
stateowned television soon after ms bhuttos inauguration on dec 
2 the onehour gala left millions of bored pakistanis humming the 
tunes for days 
several rightist groups were quick to dub the tv show unislamic 
and filed lawsuits to seek to have the producers and performers 
punished the courts dismissed the cases 
now a new wave of theatrical satire is rising in the cities of 
rawalpindi lahore and karachi the acts are full of barbs aimed at 
government bureaucrats 
one play called divorce me my wife takes a swipe at womens 
rule several females have begun appearing on the screen without 
covering their heads with the traditional dopatta or head 
scarf worn even by bhutto herself in deference to the still 
politically strong religious lobby 
while ms bhuttos cultural openness takes hold she remains 
careful not to unecessarily offend islamic sensitivity she has 
directed women in government to refrain from shaking hands with men 
pakistani or foreign 
meanwhile leftleaning pakistanis such as ms bhutto have 
stopped accusing staterun media of being monopolized by the clergy 
pakistani newspapers and magazines are enjoying their newfound 
liberty with ads and fashion photos featuring shapely female models 
at a dinner for newspaper editors shortly before his death zia 
waved copies of newspapers and magazines that displayed fashion 
pictures of women 
are these the publications of an islamic country zia 
demanded i leave the future decision to you most of the 
editors were blushing 
while pakistani women are enjoying newfound liberties men are 
not far behind 
one of the first masculine items to disappear from government 
offices under the new bhutto era was the traditional pajamalike 
baggy trousers and long shirts which pakistanis call shalwar 
kameez 
now most bureaucrats wear western business suits

members of congress are expressing doubt about 
the federal deposit insurance corps ability to supervise the 
nations sickest savings and loans and simultaneously regulate 
commercial banks 
as an interim step in president bushs plan for the savings and 
loan crisis the fdic a bank regulator is taking control of more 
than 200 insolvent sampls 
i am deeply concerned about the ability of the fdic to handle 
its current workload and to also take on the additional burden 
assigned by the bush plan rep frank annunzio dill chairman 
of the house banking subcommittee on financial institutions said 
wednesday 
we should not blindly transfer a whole burden of 
responsibilities to an agency that clearly has problems of its 
own he said citing reports that seven banks in texas had not 
been examined for the past four years 
however fdic chairman l william seidman said we believe we 
are up to the task 
seidman said the fdic is diverting about 500 bank examiners from 
its force of 2029 to work on sampls he conceded the agency would be 
strained for two to three months but said only 200 to 250 fdic 
examiners would be needed after the initial takeovers 
in the meantime the fdics list of problem banks has been 
declining he said and the agency will hire about another 150 
examiners by the end of the year it also is raising salaries to 
retain experienced employees he said 
white house budget director richard darman has agreed to testify 
before annunzios subcommittee later this month initially darman 
had refused saying he would testify only before the full banking 
committee 
however he reversed his position after annunzio sent a letter to 
president bush complaining that darmans ego problems threatened 
to delay congressional action on the sampl crisis 
at another hearing before the senate banking committee 
commercial bank groups endorsed the bush plan which would maintain 
separate deposit insurance funds for banks and sampls 
executives of the us league of savings institutions said 
earlier this week that the funds should be merged as a way of 
forcing banks to help pay for the sampl crisis 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee told reporters he opposes any plan to mingle the sampl and 
bank insurance funds 
i believe one drowning man is enough he said 
gonzalez said time pressures mean congress likely will pass the 
administrations offbudget borrowing plan for resolving the crisis 
even though he personally favors direct treasury spending 
he also said he favors giving sampls that concentrate on home 
mortgage lending a break in meeting stricter capital standards 
in related action sen david durenberger rminn introduced a 
bill wednesday to repeal tax breaks benefiting buyers of failed 
banks and sampls he said tax rules may be encouraging the new owners 
to operate the institutions less efficiently seidman has asked that 
the tax benefits continue beyond their scheduled expiration at the 
end of this year

senate sergeantatarms henry k giugni says he 
will reimburse the senate for any improper expenses he submitted 
during a dozen taxpayerfinanced trips in 198788 but insists he 
did nothing wrong 
giugni said wednesday he submitted his trip records to the senate 
rules committee and will make the repayments if panel chairman 
wendell h ford dky finds anything improper 
the senates secondranking staff official said in an interview 
that he conducted official business on all of the trips including 
the six to the former honolulu policemans native hawaii 
giugni said trips that included nonsenate business were only 
partially billed to taxpayers 
giugni said he traveled to inspect security at senators state 
offices to check on a computer network he ordered installed to 
provide security at last years two national political conventions 
and to meet senators state office staff members 
ive got to be a people person he said they get to know 
who the sergeantatarms is when they pick up the phone 
serving as the senates chief purchasing officer with a 115 
million budget giugni said i have telecommunications i have a 
computer system to discuss with senate offices i could have gone 
to more places hawaii is my own state im more tempted to go to my 
state than texas 
giugnis travels were reported in wednesdays washington post 
which said that he took eight trips to hawaii from december 1987 to 
august 1988 the official disputed that number saying there were 
six trips including one in 1987 for which he was unable to find his 
records 
another trip to hawaii in 1987 began in new orleans the official 
said 
giugni said the purpose of an 11day trip to hawaii on which he 
was accompanied by two aides was to familiarize the capitol police 
chief with security problems 
the chief of police had never been to honolulu and i wanted 
him to look at the security at the federal building giugni said 
they have major security problems 
giugni who has authority over the capitol police also set up 
meetings between congress police chief frank a kerrigan and 
hawaii police officials to discuss security 
on two trips where taxpayers financed only part of the cost 
giugni said he went to hawaii to be master of ceremonies at a boy 
scout fundraising function and to attend a meeting of a hospital 
rehabilitation board on which he serves 
the post cited figures indicating that giugnis dec 2730 1987 
trip to hawaii for which he couldnt locate records cost 2274 
giugni billed the senate 436 for a feb 48 trip to honolulu for 
the rehabilitation board meeting after which the official said he 
visited senate offices 
a sevenday trip over the july 4 weekend last year was taken at 
the invitation of american telephone amp telegraph co which paid for 
giugnis air fare giugni charged the senate for 52277 in personal 
expenses 
the capitol police board paid for the travel of giugni and 
kerrigan on their trip to hawaii but giugnis budget paid 1195 
for his per diem expenses the 5779 travel and per diem expenses 
of giugnis two aides were charged to the sergeantatarms budget 
giugnis other trips during the past two years included visits to 
miami atlanta new orleans las vegas and reno in nevada el paso 
texas and new mexico he said

you cant be sued for being rude an appeals court 
said 
the state court of appeals ruling which overturned a lower 
court decision resulted from a lawsuit filed by a woman who 
contended she had to quit her job and undergo therapy because of a 
coworkers alleged obnoxious behavior 
nita mundy former branch manager of the anchor savings bank in 
suburban hapeville had charged that a public relations officer had 
subjected her to a series of humiliating pranks 
alleged tasteless and rude social conduct is not 
actionable the appeals court said 
the court ruled that the jonesboro woman had no grounds to 
collect damages from her boss or the coworker 
mrs mundy said wednesday she has not worked since august 1985 
and still is being treated for the distress she claimed fellow 
employee h street kornegay had caused after leaving her job she 
said she could not even go into a bank for more than a year 
my job itself was not bad at all she said in a telephone 
interview i really enjoyed my job 
but during her last six months of work life became difficult 
mrs mundy said 
working with the added stress or distress created such an 
environment that eventually i could not function as a manager she 
said it was very distressing it took away from me personally and 
professionally 
among other things mrs mundys lawsuit said kornegay 
questioned whether whether her hair color was real in the presence 
of her colleagues interrupted her while she was talking to 
customers and swept objects off her desk while she was on the 
telephone with a customer 
these incidents whether considered individually or 
collectively do not as a matter of law rise to the requisite 
level of egregious or outrageous behavior which justifiably results 
in that severe fright humiliation embarrassment or outrage which 
no reasonable person is expected to endure the appeals court said 
in its feb 22 decision 
the decision overturned a lower court ruling that would have 
allowed the lawsuit to go to trial 
mrs mundys attorney james t perry said no appeal was planned 
kornegay now retired did not return telephone messages left 
wednesday by the associated press according to the court ruling he 
denied mrs mundys allegations wade k copeland who represented 
the bank was out of town and could not be contacted 
mrs mundy said she thought kornegay disliked her because she was 
a strong manager though he was not under her supervision 
it was more or less a premeditated plan to get me out of the 
branch from his personal belief that a woman could not manage a 
bank as well as a man she said i ran the branch and he didnt 
want me to be a strong manager

the republican partys attempts to attract more 
blacks will be hampered by the same resentment over the 1988 
presidential campaign that drove gop chairman lee atwater from the 
board of howard university black leaders and analysts say 
using willie horton the way he was used was deeply felt within 
the black community rep john lewis dga said wednesday 
referring to the black massachusetts murderer and rapist highlighted 
in president bushs campaign ads 
for now however more of that resentment is aimed at atwater 
who ran the bush campaign than at bush himself said linda williams 
of the joint center for political studies an independent group that 
focuses on issues of concern to blacks 
a lot of younger blacks and older blacks too are willing to 
give george bush a chance and yet atwater is in a kind of separate 
category right now she said 
the president was flying to new york late today to be the keynote 
speaker at a united negro college fund banquet 
michelle stent director of the funds washington legislative 
office said the college fund has a very close and good 
relationship with the president and his family 
atwater resigned from the board of overseers at howard a 
predominantly black school after protesting students occupied the 
administration building and demanded his removal 
the students cited the bush campaign ads that featured horton a 
convicted murderer who escaped while on furlough from a 
massachusetts prison and later raped a maryland woman the ads 
alleged that democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
supported allowing convicted murderers weekend furloughs from prison 
the ads prominently featured a picture of horton democrats 
including jesse jackson contended that they played on racial fears 
the signals that were sent in the willie horton ad were not so 
much about furloughs but about raceinciting fears in white people 
and creating very painful feelings among africanamericans 
jackson said wednesday 
unfortunately lee atwater symbolizes the worst of that 
situation 
atwater who was the presidents choice to take over as party 
leader after the election has said one of his goals is to attract 
more black voters to the gop 
he attended a commemorative service in atlanta for the late 
martin luther king jr an accomplished rhythm and blues guitar 
player atwater also has made highly publicized appearances with 
black musicians including bb king 
i think it was a good thing he attended the king service 
said lewis a former civil rights activist but he went on its 
going to take more than attending a service in honor of martin 
luther king jr its going to take much more than that 
coming to the defense of atwater was alan keyes a black who was 
the gops candidate for senate in maryland in 1988 
keyes disputed that the willie horton ads were racist 
when i look at willie horton i see a criminal i dont see a 
black person he said 
but ms williams said simply playing the guitar with black 
musicians wont be enough to change atwaters image with blacks 
people are waiting to see from atwater something more than 
symbolism she said hes talked about winning 20 percent or 
more of the black vote hes been on stage with bb king and so 
forth 
blacks are beginning to say theres no other group in america 
that people think liking their music affects their voter choice

the federal aviation administration wants to 
bar blind or deaf passengers or passengers whose handicaps make them 
unable to open an airliners emergency exit door from sitting in the 
exit row seats 
the proposed rule to be published monday on the eve of a senate 
hearing on discrimination against the blind in air travel has 
already brought criticism from the national federation of the blind 
and a handicapped veterans group 
this proposal is both silly and discriminatory and well 
resist it mark maurer president of the federation said 
wednesday 
i feel crummy about it said james gashel the federations 
government affairs director who was ejected from a united airlines 
plane by police last year in chicago after refusing to leave an exit 
door seat 
but faa spokesman john leyden called the matter a critical 
safety issue and said people in those seats have an added 
responsibility 
the faa says that seating people who wouldnt be able to operate 
the emergency exit door in other rows of the aircraft enhances 
their safety as well as that of other passengers 
the air transportation association which represents airlines 
said the rule is needed to provide uniform procedures for airlines 
rules on exit door seating vary among the airlines said spokeswoman 
leslie roland 
don mcguire spokesman for braniff airlines said handicapped 
people on braniff flights are asked not to sit in seats next to 
exits but are allowed to if they insist american airlines spokesman 
jim brown said the carrier already bars exit door seating to women 
close to giving birth handicapped people or children 
an faa rulemaking notice said handicapped people often believe 
the airlines have no right to refuse them seats by the exit a 1986 
law guarantees the handicapped full access to air travel but allows 
the faa to impose seating restrictions for safety 
the proposed rule would limit exit row seating in domestic 
airliners to people who can open the doors and take other actions 
that will expedite the evacuation of an aircraft in an accident or 
other emergency 
the proposal would affect the seat locations of persons with 
physical and mental disabilities parents with small children obese 
and frail persons children traveling alone and others who can 
impede evacuation when seated in exit rows the faa said leyden 
said this would also include those who are blind or deaf or for any 
other reason might have difficulty operating the door 
in a way the people in those seats become auxiliary flight 
attendants leyden said they have to assess the situation look 
out the window to see if its safe to open the door there might be 
fire on the wing and then open the door and lead people to safety 
choosing the safest path 
the blind federations maurer said that in some cases an alert 
blind person might be the best passenger to have next to an exit 
door especially if the plane filled with smoke because that person 
would be used to being unable to see 
david capozzi an official of the paralyzed veterans of america 
said the faa rules would go too far and might prevent people in 
wheelchairs from boarding some commuter flights where the exit row 
might be the only one with enough room for them 
under the proposed rule each carrier would have to submit its 
procedures for faa approval it would take effect after a 90day 
period for public comment unless the faa sees reason to change it

an environmental protection agency draft report 
detailing damage to the alaskan tundra from oil drilling was very 
preliminary and gives no reason to stop further oil exploration in 
the area says a senate backer of drilling 
the report leaked to the new york times has not had adequate 
review by epa managers and requires substantial work before it is 
finished sen frank murkowski ralaska said wednesday 
the epa was apparently doing some onsite work to establish 
information for guidelines they are going to issue in the future 
he said this is all very preliminary 
the draft was a summary of a trip report after a visit to the 
north slope said tom williams a member of the senate energy and 
natural resources committee staff 
according to a story sunday in the times the draft relates 
improper and careless management of chemical oil wastes by companies 
in the prudhoe bay oilfields 
legislation before the committee would allow oil exploration in 
the arctic national wildlife refuge just east of prudhoe bay 
the refuge is considered a promising area for a strike that could 
produce as much as 32 billion barrels of oil but it also is the 
breeding ground for north americas largest remaining herd of 
migratory caribou and the habitat for polar bears musk oxen 
wolves arctic foxes waterfowl and fish 
the epa draft report said acres of tundra have been blackened by 
chemical spills oil wastes seeping from drilling pads stacks of 
leaking chemical drums a mine flooded by a diverted river 
overflowing waste disposal pits and failure to comply with federal 
regulations governing the handling of hazardous materials 
murkowski said that since the drilling in prudhoe bay began 
there have been advancements in technology that minimize damage to 
the environment 
furthermore he said if no oil is found the area will revert 
completely to its natural state 
but sen timothy wirth dcolo who opposes the bill said the 
government should establish an overall energy policy before it 
starts looking for more oil 
our policies toward energy conservation are so bad we cant 
even get the architect of the capitol to agree to more efficient 
lighting he said we ought to be very aggressively looking at 
ways to lessen our dependence on fossil fuel 
in reference to the effects of arctic drilling wirth said 
anybody who would suggest that what has gone on up there has not 
been damaging to the environment is just blowing smoke 
sen dale bumpers dark characterized the governments energy 
policy as go out and find it dig it up and use it up as fast as 
possible 
i want to hold this bill hostage in exchange for a national 
energy policy he said we dont have an energy policy and we 
need one

if as they say on a hot steamy night in iowa 
you can hear the corn grow it probably is louder than the arrival 
of new political appointees at the agriculture department 
the pace quickened this week however with president bushs 
announcement late tuesday that he intended to appoint richard thomas 
crowder a pillsbury co executive as undersecretary for 
international affairs and commodity programs 
crowders selection was the third announced for usda since bush 
began putting his team together last fall the other two were 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter the only one yet confirmed 
and jack parnell of california named feb 28 as deputy secretary 
the no 2 job in the department 
other senior positions include one other undersecretary for small 
community and rural development and seven assistant secretaries 
having responsibilities for a wide range of usda services from 
foreign affairs to meat inspection and public information 
yeutters salary is 99500 a year the deputys 89500 the 
undersecretaries 82500 and the assistant secretaries 77500 
additionally there are dozens of deputies at all levels 
administrators of various usda agencies plus scores of state 
directors for certain of the agencies not to mention hundreds of 
nonsalaried appointments to departmental boards and advisory panels 
at federal and state levels 
the top job appointments are presidential and require senate 
approval as a general rule the lowerlevel jobs are named by the 
secretary of agriculture 
william j riley jr director of personnel for the department 
and its farflung work force of about 106000 fulltime employees 
said wednesday in an interview that usda has approximately 150 
political schedule c and around 40 noncareer senior executive 
service jobs that are considered political appointments 
but riley stressed that the numbers were approximate and that he 
had no estimate of how many would be filled by holdovers from the 
reagan administration 
the jobs he said include state directors for the farmers home 
administration and the state executive directors of the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service 
about the time bush took office on jan 20 deputy secretary 
peter myers who will be leaving informed political job holders 
that they may or may not be maintained here by the new 
administration and to prepare letters of resignation to be effective 
at the pleasure of the new secretary riley said 
as people are found to make replacements the existing schedule 
cs may either be retained in their jobs or their resignations 
accepted he said but there is nothing in large large 
numbers 
riley was asked about reports that other departments had issued 
pink slips to many political job holders and that april 1 was 
the deadline for departure 
no not at agriculture he said some of them have already 
left and some will be leaving prior to the first of april and im 
sure some of them will be here after that 
riley was also asked about rumors that up to 150 potential new 
job holders had been put on usdas payroll as a reserve squirreled 
away to fill openings as they become available 
there have been some people who have been brought on board 
obviously but 150 people squirreled away is about 600 percent 
higher than the actual figure he said weve brought on 
approximately 25 people in an administration change thats a 
small small number 
riley said he preferred to think of the shift from reagan to bush 
as evolutionary not revolutionary 
when you have an evolution its a lot slower and more 
professional and its a lot less bloody than a revolution he 
said

if catfish farming is a fastgrowing business 
in some parts of the united states can snail ranching be far 
behind perhaps not if enterprising producers take a hint from the 
agriculture department 
dont be fooled by their fancy french name escargots says 
the departments foreign agricultural service many of the snails 
the french eat arent french at all instead they hail from such 
countries as greece turkey indonesia and czechoslovakia 
its possible that us snails could corner a share of the 
market the agency said in agexporter magazine 
the french consume as much as 40000 metric tons of snails 
annually and domestic production cant keep up with demand the 
report said in 1987 for example 7681 tons were imported or 
nearly a fifth of yearly use 
more than threefourths of the imports are fresh frozen or 
refrigerated canned snails represent about 2 percent of the total 
with other processed snails making up the remainder 
there is no duty on fresh frozen or refrigerated snail imports 
but a 20 percent ad valorem duty is applied to all imports that are 
prepared or preserved the report said

a pilot at strikecrippled eastern airlines said 
thursday shouts of scab and static interfered with his 
communications to air traffic controllers as he took off from 
hartsfieldatlanta international airport 
the word scab was used on the radio said capt roger p 
pipkin who was flying flight 5679 to miami on monday with a crew of 
six and three passengers aboard the boeing 757 
i havent said that any danger was posed but if frequencies 
are going to be used for reasons other than air traffic control then 
we have a problem said pipkin who has flown for eastern for 27 
years i have no idea who the voices were i have no idea who 
caused the interference 
pipkin said the interference which lasted seven minutes was on 
four separate frequencies and occurred during taxi out take off 
and climb out 
voices were heard on three of the frequencies and static was on 
the fourth said pipkin who claimed the interference blocked a call 
clearing him to a new heading 
jack barker spokesman for the federal aviation administration in 
atlanta said the incident was reported to the fbi 
there was some interference on the frequencies from some 
unknown person on the air barker said the pilot was able to 
communicate there just was other spurious transmissions on the 
frequency 
we were of course involved barker added we had an 
inspector meet the plane in miami the fbi has it now 
air line pilots association members contacted in miami said it 
was the first they had heard of the incident and doubted that any 
of their members were responsible 
i find it highly unlikely that an alpa pilot would do it it 
could have been anybody said jack gordon an eastern pilot at the 
alpa communications center in miami 
pipkin 52 is one of the few eastern pilots who crossed picket 
lines nearly 3600 apla pilots at eastern have honored a strike by

the fbi says it cannot keep track of the 15000

retribution over the novel the satanic verses 
blaming the problem in part on state department visa policies 
the fbis oliver buck revell told a senate subcommittee on 
wednesday we cannot control our borders even for our own 
selfprotection 
the panel was looking into the impact of threats issued by irans 
ayatollah khomeini against british author salman rushdie and the 
publishers and sellers of his book 
revell executive assistant investigations director told the 
subcommittee that the fbi is keeping surveillance over 200 or more 
hard core iranian nationals in the united states 
but there are a large number of students here both legally 
and illegally who are zealous adherents to the khomeini rhetoric 
and pursuit of violence revell said 
underscoring the impact of khomeinis threats representatives of 
the books us publisher vikingpenguin and a major bookstore 
chain waldenbooks declined to appear at the hearing after earlier 
saying they would attend 
a committee source said the publisher had cited security concerns 
in refusing the invitation neither company would answer queries as 
to why it had skipped the hearing 
revell said roughly 30000 iranian citizens are in the united 
states on student visas and at least that many more are in the 
country illegally some 10000 to 15000 are activists with 
sympathies for khomeinis fundamentalist shiite regime he said and 
many receive government money to help them stay in the united states 
or are affiliated with the iranian revolutionary guard corps 
he said those iranians most of them students represent a 
greater threat because the fbi has neither the authority nor 
resources to track or evaluate them in the way it handles the far 
smaller number of iranians with known terrorist links 
revell told the senate foreign relations terrorism subcommittee 
that the students are more dangerous than any sort of 
infrastructure or organizational activity because they cannot be 
monitored and because the state departments standards for issuing 
visas are lax 
but a newspaper editor warned that the situation should not be 
made an excuse to crack down on foreigners who dissent from us 
values 
it would be a travesty if this crisis resulted in further 
effort to diminish access of dissident voices from outside our 
country said john seigenthaler publisher of the nashville 
tennessean and president of the american society of newspaper 
editors that it seems to me would be embracing the ayatollahs 
way 
khomeinis blanket threat with its promise of martyrdom should a 
follower die attempting retribution for the book and his 
governments offer of a reward of up to 52 million for the death 
of rushdie escalate the terrorist threat beyond that normally faced 
by the fbi revell said 
sen john kerry dmass chairman of the subcommittee agreed 
when the ayatollah threw out his death threat he threw a 
different kind of bomb he said but it was and is a terrorist 
bomb nevertheless and threatens american freedoms as well as lives 
revell said the fbi so far knows of 178 threats to booksellers by 
telephone and by letter received in cities from new york to san 
francisco to houston while the bureau has no authority to offer 
protection it has immediately responded to each threat and 
investigated he said 
the waldenbooks official who declined to appear at the hearing 
instead submitted a statement complaining that the government was 
slow to come to the defense of booksellers 
it would have probably been helpful had the government and 
specifically the department of justice offered a much higher 
profile from the beginning said harry hoffman the chains chief 
executive officer i dont believe the severity of this current 
situation was understood by anyone except those who were receiving 
the threats 
on feb 28 a waldenbooks and another bookstore in berkeley 
calif and a printing plant in new york city were firebombed but 
revell said the bureau has not been able to determine whether those 
incidents stemmed from khomeinis decree

only nine states began paying medicare premiums 
for the elderly poor under a law that took effect jan 1 and less 
than half have begun taking steps to inform wouldbe beneficiaries 
they are eligible a new survey says 
as a result many of the elderly still have 3190 a month 
deducted from their social security checks although the 
statefederal medicaid program is supposed to pay the medicare 
premium for those who live significantly below the poverty line 
the 3190 covers the optional portion of medicare that pays 
doctor bills 
this is completely unacceptable rep henry waxman dcalif 
said wednesday the purpose of this medicare buyin requirement 
was to protect the poorest of the elderly and disabled from what at 
their income levels is an extreme financial burden 
waxmans remarks and the villers foundation survey dealt with a 
requirement in legislation to expand the medicare program including 
coverage of catastrophic illness starting jan 1 
the requirement says states must use their medicaid programs to 
pay medicare premiums and other costs for beneficiaries with incomes 
below 85 percent of the poverty line 
waxman a main force behind the new legislation said widespread 
failure of states to comply may well be an ominous sign for other 
mandates coming down the line 
he referred to such things as expanded medicaid coverage for 
pregnant women and newborn infants that also have been switched from 
optional to mandatory but have not taken effect yet 
under the medicare expansion all but five states are required to 
pay medicare premiums for recipients with incomes below 85 percent 
of the official poverty line 5980 for an individual or 8020 
for a couple 
moreover medicaid is supposed to pay any hospital deductibles or 
other copayments that otherwise would be required of medicare 
beneficiaries 
the five with exceptions hawaii illinois north carolina ohio 
and utah are supposed to cover medicare recipients up to 80 
percent of the poverty line in the first year 
within five years all states and the district of columbia are 
supposed to be paying the premiums for medicare recipients up to 100 
percent of the poverty line 
medicaid is the statefederal health program for the poor and 
medicare the federal health program for the elderly and disabled 
there are an estimated 35 million elderly americans living below 
the poverty line but roughly 1 million are so poor they already 
have their medicare costs picked up by medicaid 
the congressional budget office estimates that of the remaining 
25 million or so who would be eligible 590000 will actually sign 
up for the 3190 benefit program 
ronald f pollack executive director of the villers foundation 
said only nine states started providing coverage jan 1 as required 
florida iowa maine nevada new jersey north dakota ohio 
pennsylvania and south dakota 
waxman said he did not know whether the fault for the others 
failure was at the local level or failure of federal officials to 
get guidelines out in time 
at any rate he said where the fault lies is really not 
the issue we need to assure as quickly as possible that 
lowincome medicare beneficiaries in all states are protected from 
catastrophic medicare costsharing 
pollack said the most disturbing finding of the survey conducted 
for villers by sarah shuptrine amp associates of columbia sc was 
that only 24 states and the district of columbia have taken concrete 
steps toward notifying poor medicare beneficaries in their 
jurisdictions that they may be eligible to have medicaid pay their 
medicare premiums 
villers is a private foundation that concentrates on issues 
affecting the poor particularly the elderly poor

the plight of a homeless paraplegic whose 
wheelchair was stolen as he slept in a parking lot unleashed an 
outpouring of public sympathy but the man disappeared before he 
could accept any offers of help 
details about george donovans life and his misfortune were not 
all that clear but people who tried to help him said the theft was 
typical a snapshot of misery on skid row 
george is a victim of the victims said ray mccann 
communications director at the union rescue mission where donovan 
found shelter briefly 
police agreed donovan who claimed to be a veteran was the 
victim of skid row thieves and although people who have heard about 
the theft wanted to help there was no one to refer them to said 
lt fred nixon a police spokesman 
the incident began tuesday evening when donovan 47 awakened in 
a parking lot and found his wheelchair was gone said officer joe 
mariani another police spokesman 
police said they found donovan propped up against a wall in an 
alley near the downtown greyhound bus station 
before taking him to the union rescue mission police tried to 
find him shelter for three hours calling the veterans 
administration the county social services department and even a 
detoxification center although he hadnt been drinking mccann 
said they wouldnt take donovan because he wasnt sick or injured 
wasnt ambulatory or because they didnt have room 
its just dreadful said blanche carey 61 of lomita after 
she heard a radio account of donovans plight she offered to donate 
electric and manual wheelchairs she can no longer use 
we dont have a lot of money but here is one man who has 
become crippled for his country and apparently there is no one who 
cares who is doing anything she said 
weve got a real outpouring of people who want to help said 
carl fielstra ministry director at the union rescue mission 
following the news reports about donovan the 98yearold downtown 
mission received calls all day offering help and donations he said 
but donovans whereabouts were unknown he was in a friends care 
when he left a hospital early wednesday and was not considered 
missing said police cmdr george morrison 
hes not a police problem except to the extent that we were 
trying to help him morrison said 
although there were some reports that donovan had been roughed up 
by the thieves the police report stated only that the chair was 
stolen as he slept fielstra said donovan told him he had been 
attacked 
regardless the bonafides of the story hes crippled on the 
street fielstra said well take him 
at the mission donovan had complained of pain in the stomach and 
groin and was taken by ambulance to countyusc medical center late 
tuesday mccann said 
at the hospital he complained of pain in his left leg and side 
but after about four hours donovan left with a friend and said they 
were going to the va said hospital spokeswoman adelaida delacerda 
donovan never showed up at a va hospital however said larry 
caird spokesman for the agencys western region 
police spokesman mariani said donovan had a veterans 
identification card 
donovan would appear to be eligible for veterans benefits and 
would have received care if he had come to a va hospital caird 
said he said he had no information about donovans service record 
mccann said donovan receives veterans benefits and has some 
trouble with a bad hip socket however mccann said he did not 
know anything about donovans military service or how he became a 
paraplegic 
he has been in and out of our facility mccann said he is 
a street person we do know him by sight

sen lloyd bentsen declared himself for fellow 
texan john tower as defense secretary but he waited until after 
democratic leaders said they didnt need the vote 
bentsen didnt expend on tower the party clout he gained in his 
vice presidential campaign keeping a low profile in the battle that 
has torn the senate 
in his speech wednesday on the senate floor bentsen put his 
endorsement into terms of personal sympathy rather than political 
allegiance reflecting the 14 years he served with tower in the 
senate and his own experience as a scrutinized candidate 
this event so painful to john tower has been difficult to me 
we have seen every imperfection in an essentially good man 
dragged into the pitiless glare of television lights while his 
aughters sat listening he said 
last fall i learned firsthand what its like to have reporters 
looking up every friend youve had in the last 60 years or asking 
what you ate for breakfast he said 
tower supporters temporarily were cheered by bentsens decision 
i think that the timing would have been better if it came 
earlier in the debate but at this stage ill take him any time i 
can get him said tower friend paul eggers 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine had already 
told reporters he didnt need bentsens vote and after bentsen 
spoke four democrats considered as possible swing votes announced 
they were against the nominee 
bentsens decision was consistent with his position in january 
when he presented tower to the senate armed services committee 
praising him as a good choice not only for hawks but for liberals 
critical of pentagon overspending 
john tower is too much of a conservative to give a blank check 
from the us treasury to the pentagon bentsen said then 
but as the showdown over the nomination grew in intensity 
bentsen declined to say how hed vote 
a change in his position or strong lobbying for tower could 
have had great impact given the visibility he has held since he was 
michael dukakis running mate on the democratic ticket last fall 
bush telephoned bentsen repeatedly tower supporters in texas 
organized telephone calls and letters to his office 
but bentsen just elected to a new sixyear senate at the same 
time he lost his vice presidential bid told reporters he felt 
little political pressure 
texans have a long tradition of closing ranks said joseph 
oneill a washington lobbyist who has been bentsens top senate 
aide and was chief of staff for his vice presidential campaign 
but a vote against tower would not have been particularly 
damaging either said george shipley an austin political consultant 
there is no wellspring of support here for tower shipley 
said the silence is thundering 
shipley noted that tower himself had voted against several 
presidential nominations including that of a fellow texan ray 
marshall who was president carters nominee for labor secretary in 
1977 
but lance tarrance a houston republican pollster said bentsens 
move was shrewd in his home state where conservatives who supported 
him the past were aggravated by his partnership with dukakis and 
opposition to the supreme court nomination of robert bork 
by deciding to vote for tower bentsen has taken care of two 
nagging political problems tarrance said 
claibourne darden an atlanta pollster and consultant to senate 
armed services chairman sam nunn said he saw broader political 
implications in bentsens stance 
theres something in that woodpile that aint all wood he 
said for the democratic vice presidential nominee to bolt the 
party it sounds to me like he wants to run for president he said

call it the crawfish war 
when texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower said louisiana 
crawfish are smaller smellier dirtier dumber and less tasty than 
those in the lone star state his counterpart in louisiana was quick 
to respond 
jim hightower will have to back out and crawl commissioner 
bob odom said wednesday referring to the way a startled crawfish 
runs from danger 
the one market weve gone head to head with texas crawfish has 
been in the swedish market odom said 
louisiana beat the hell out of them 
but hightower crowed about his states crawfish saying the texas 
variety were cleaner because packers put them through a brief fast 
to clean out intestinal impurities 
at long last we have a pure texas crawfish that is going to 
save us texans from the shame and humiliation that we have 
experienced over the last many many generations of having to eat 
those smelly mudcoated ittybitty slowwitted crawfish from 
louisiana hightower said 
the crawfish skirmish is of no little consequence hightower 
estimated that the crawfish industry could mean 120 million in 
direct sales for texas farmers and about 1000 jobs

jennifer brown isnt looking for a 
little michelangelo but she did teach her middle school art 
students something about the difficulties of painting the ceiling of 
the sistine chapel 
ms browns students at the childers middle school were required 
recently to draw on paper taped to the bottom of their desks 
there were a lot of moans and groans she said some 
thought it was cruel some thought it was cool but once they got 
started i think most of the students enjoyed it 
the youngsters spent parts of three days on their backs drawing 
a likeness of their hands 
michelangelo painted figures on the ceiling of the sistine 
chapel so we painted hands instead which is a part of the body at 
least she said 
the teacher said some students who had trouble with other 
assignments excelled on this project i joked with some of them 
that they would have to draw on their backs all the time ms

a new generation of student activists 
marched peacefully throughout poland to pay tribute to their 
predecessors and mark the 20th anniversary of a violent crackdown on 
campus unrest 
thousands of students turned out for rallies and marches in at 
least six cities wednesday some disturbances were reported but the 
rallies still were in sharp contrast to the march 1968 events they 
commemorated 
contributing to the calm mood was the announcement tuesday that 
solidarity chairman lech walesa had won government agreement to 
legalize the independent students association or nzs after a 
sevenyear ban 
in warsaw police on wednesday helped direct traffic around two 
separate demonstrations held with the permission of municipal 
officials 
more than 5000 young people led by a woman pushing twins in a 
baby carriage marched through the capitals downtown streets the 
marchers chanted no success without nzs 
an evening march later drew about 2000 people 
at jagiellonian university in krakow in southern poland 3000 
students listened to an address by opposition activist adam michnik 
a veteran of the 1968 protest its a moving day for me because 
what happened 21 years ago changed my generation and my life he 
told the students 
the students heeded an appeal from the university rector and 
stayed on the campus avoiding a confrontation with police 
about 1000 people gathered at the polytechnic institute in 
wroclaw in southwestern poland said local opposition activist 
jozef pinior 
he said that later a few hundred youths began marching and 
carrying banners of the radical splinter group fighting solidarity 
pinior said police allowed them to walk a mile or so before stopping 
the demonstration 
sixteen people were briefly detained he said 
when the evening march ended in warsaw 50 to 100 youths from 
fighting solidarity and the rsa an anarchist movement held their 
own march for several blocks before riot police blocked their path 
someone in the crowd threw a smokebomb at police and a few 
others threw stones before the crowd melted away 
the official pap news agency reported peaceful rallies in poznan 
lublin and olsztyn 
on march 8 1968 police and communist party workeractivists 
invaded warsaw universitys campus and attacked students protesting 
the expulsion of michnik and another student who had spoken out 
against closure of a performance of adam mickiewiczs patriotic play 
forefathers eve 
the episode and subsequent clashes between students and police 
radicalized many young people who later became leading figures in 
the solidarity free trade union movement it also provided a pretext 
for an antisemitic antiintellectual purge that caused thousands 
of people to lose jobs in an internal party power struggle 
the march 1968 events make us aware of a certain great 
truth how pitifully ineffective are the efforts of all those who 
stand against the natural and inborn wish for freedom warsaw 
university rector grzegorz bialkowski told the students before they 
marched to a monument to mickiewicz

government troops today arrested a 
renegade military officer sought in a series of coup plots allegedly 
financed by ousted president ferdinand marcos military officials 
said 
president corazon aquino congratulated the armed forces and said 
the capture of former lt col reynaldo cabauatan after a twoyear 
manhunt will lead to greater stability in this country 
brig gen pantaleon dumlao said cabauatan who was wearing 
civilian clothes and disguised with eyeglasses and a goatee was 
arrested by soldiers as he left a suburban manila restaurant after 
midnight 
dumlao said soldiers tipped off earlier that cabauatan would be 
at the restaurant initially did not recognize the renegade officer 
when they arrived at the restaurant 
but dumlao said one soldier saluted a bearded man who resembled 
cabauatan and cabauatan instinctively returned it leading to his 
arrest 
cabauatan was taken to the philippine constabularys camp crame 
where authorities presented him briefly at a news conference no 
interviews were allowed cabauatan shook his head no when reporters 
asked him to make a statement 
cabauatan 42 was the most prominent antiaquino military figure 
captured since the december 1987 arrest of former lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan leader of the aug 28 1987 coup attempt in 
which 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded 
honasan escaped in april and remains at large 
cabauatan was sought after a january 1987 coup attempt when 
renegade soldiers stormed military and news media facilities in the 
capital the government called it an attempt to restore marcos to 
power 
he also took part in an abortive coup at the manila hotel in july 
1986 and was linked to an attack on the stockade at manilas fort 
bonifacio the following april 
maj gen ramon montano head of the philippines constabulary 
said the military had very strong indications that the money being 
used by this group came from expresident marcos who fled to 
exile in hawaii after being ousted in a february 1986 
militarycivilian uprising 
cabauatan went underground after the january 1987 coup attempt 
he gave frequent clandestine news conferences to announce the 
organization of the nationalist army of the philippines to continue 
his struggle against mrs aquino 
military officials said they were preparing several rebellion 
charges against him in addition to the two existing mutiny cases

injections of a powerful solvent and two other new 
treatments should make gallbladder surgery unnecessary for many of 
the 500000 americans who undergo the operation each year 
researchers reported today 
mayo clinic doctors described in the new england journal of 
medicine their use of methyl tertbutyl ether a substance that 
until now has been used largely as a gasoline octane booster and as 
an industrial solvent 
injecting it directly into the gallbladder doctors found that it 
quickly dissolved large stones freeing patients from their painful 
condition 
we have learned that we can use the technology successfully in 
a broad range of anatomical circumstances said dr johnson l 
thistle who pioneered the procedure we have become quite 
comfortable with the feeling that we can do it safely and 
effectively 
however the experimental technique has competition from two 
other therapies that also promise to replace gallbladder removal 
which until now has been the standard treatment for gallstones and 
trails only caesarean sections as the most common form of abdominal 
surgery 
a stonecrushing machine called a lithotriptor already widely 
used for kidney stones is being tested against gallstones and a 
stonedissolving drug was recently approved for routine use 
all three of them need to be considered said dr gerald 
salen of the veterans administration medical center in east orange 
nj they offer an alternative to an operation most patients can 
have their stones treated with one of these techniques 
salen said the three treatments may be useful for many of the 
350000 or so people who undergo elective gallbladder surgery 
annually in 1987 526000 americans had their gallbladders taken 
out surgery will still be necessary for 150000 people who need 
emergency treatment 
thistles technique works only on gallstones made of cholesterol 
which are the majority of all stones he estimates the therapy might 
be useful for at least half of all people who now need gallbladder 
surgery 
in the technique doctors push a long needle into the patients 
abdomen through the liver and into the gallbladder they then 
replace it with a skinny tube and infuse ether usually after a day 
of treatment the stones are gone even when the gallbladder 
contains many stones or ones that are especially large 
patients can go home within a day or two and quickly return to 
work by contrast gallbladder surgery requires a week in the 
hospital and six weeks of recuperation 
thistle first described his initial testing of the procedure four 
years ago in the latest report he outlined the results of 
treatment of 75 gallstone victims in 72 the stones almost 
completely went away 
a drawback of the approach is the difficulty of accurately 
putting a tube into the gallbladder it requires a radiologist who 
is skilled at placing little tubes in little places thistle 
said 
doctors at several medical centers also are experimenting with 
lithotriptors which use shock waves to crush gallstones still 
inside the body 
unlike the ether treatment lithotriptors dont put anything 
inside the body and require relatively little technical skill to 
operate while they quickly disintegrate moderatesize stones they 
do not appear to work as well as ether in people with large or 
multiple stones 
the other alternative is ursodiol a stonedissolving pill that 
in october was approved for routine use it is most effective for 
people with a few small stones which may take two years to 
disappear completely

large employers would be required to provide up 
to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for parents to care for newborn or 
seriously ill children under a bill approved by a house committee 
the bill passed wednesday a major part of congressional 
democrats domestic agenda also would require companies with 50 or 
more employees to grant similar leave to workers who need extended 
time off to take care of ailing parents 
and it would require them to give up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave 
for the workers own serious illness 
in each instance the only direct cost to the employer would be 
to continue whatever companypaid health benefits that were in force 
at the time the worker requested leave 
however many private and public employers including the 
national league of cities oppose the measure on grounds it would be 
overly disruptive to their operations to hold jobs open for workers 
requesting such extended leaves even though the direct financial 
cost might be minimal

leftist rebels say time has run 
out on their offer to hold peace talks with the government and they 
are now calling for a boycott of the march 19 presidential elections 
but the guerrillas in a communique said they may resume 
discussions with political leaders after the vote and that they 
favor participation in the election by the leftist political front 
with which they maintain links 
the rebel announcement wednesday put at least a temporary end to 
the peace process they initiated jan 24 by offering to take part in 
the vote and respect its outcome if it were postponed to september 
and their security and antifraud concerns addressed 
the christian democratic government of president jose napoleon 
duarte had failed to arrange talks with the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front to consider the plan 
the opposition rightist nationalist republican alliance which 
controls the legislature and is favored to win the presidency 
vigorously objected to any election delay 
noting that the government took more than a month to respond to 
the proposal the rebel communique said that time had run out 
in these conditions of so much delay and deceit the 
farabundo marti national liberation front declares that it maintains 
its offer of peace and will continue to struggle for it but it 
considers that holding a meeting now with the government would 
be to lend ourselves to further deceit of our people and of world 
opinion the communique said 
only after the election which will be fraudulent could there 
be another attempt to negotiate peace among the rebels the 
government the legislative assembly and the political parties 
said the communique which was called in to a local radio station 
the front calls on the masses to combatively repudiate this 
fraudulent election it said the guerrillas have repudiated the 
five previous national elections held this decade 
the rebel communique approved participation in the election by 
the democratic convergence the political front that maintains links 
with the guerrillas it said guerrilla combatants consider that 
the convergences participation in the elections at a disadvantage 
and against fraud is intended to help clear the path toward peace 
an estimated 70000 people most of them civilians have died in 
the 9yearold civil war between the marxistled guerrillas and the 
ussupported government

police will now accompany tax collectors on their 
rounds to prevent more attacks of the sort that have since 1985 
claimed the lives of 13 of the civil servants and injured 6800 
official reports say 
the masses are attacking surrounding beating officials from 
the state administration of taxation who are trying to collect 
taxes the peoples daily said wednesday 
the paper told the story of pig farmers in jiangxi province who 
stuffed four tax collectors into a pig pen after the officials 
demanded payment 
man and pig mixed together as they drove the collectors from 
town to town the story said one of the criminals stood on the 
crate and urinated on the officials police later arrested them 
and in february they were sentenced to several years in prison 
tax evasion runs rampant throughout china especially among 
artists actors and businessmen who make more than 108 a month 
the minimum taxable amount the average urban chinese makes about 
25 a month the average rural chinese makes about 12 a month 
why should i pay taxes said a wellknown actress who makes 
about 13500 a year 44 times the average all those forms to 
fill out id rather spend my money on fun things like eating and 
clothes 
in every corner of china theres tax evasion according to 
the peoples daily businessmen lie when they fill in forms 
famous artists donate their paintings for a hefty sum actors 
dont use their real names and ask for payment in cash 
but individuals arent the only ones guilty of malfeasance 
staterun companies and collective enterprises also cheat in recent 
years the percent of tax income in the countrys national income 
has fallen from 35 percent to about 26 percent 
still most reports concentrate on entrepreneurs possibly 
because they have less power than larger firms to suppress criticism 
about them in the staterun press 
the reports of widespread tax evasion and violent opposition to 
tax collectors are an indication of growing corruption and 
restiveness in china 
economic reforms designed to introduce elements of a market 
economy in chinas staterun system have created vast differentials 
of wealth and opportunities for cheating the reforms have also 
triggered inflation of more than 26 percent the highest price rises 
since the 1949 revolution this in turn has sparked an angry 
response 
increased tax revenue is supposed to play a critical role in 
funding the reforms the governments inability to collect 
sufficient funds is hurting the program reports have said 
china began to tax individual incomes in 1980 in 1987 it 
instituted a progressive income tax for all citizens and private 
businesses 
individuals pay taxes on a sliding scale beginning at 20 percent 
for every 108 earned a month and ending at 60 percent for incomes 
of more than 216 
large staterun companies pay 55 percent of their profits while 
smaller companies and collective pay on a sliding scale that tops 
out at 55 percent individual businesses are taxed like individuals 
with the addition of production and business taxes 
one of the problems is that the state has been slow to punish tax 
evaders 
every since 1987 we have yet to hear of a tax evader being 
sent to court the peoples daily said 
it also said many beatings of tax collectors have gone unpunished 
some of the crimes have been settled by fines others are being 
called simply civil disputes it said this has allowed many 
criminals to go scot free and hurt efforts to stop antitax 
violence 
it said that since 1985 7807 cases of beatings and attacks had 
been reported in addition to the 13 dead 27 officials have been 
crippled and 786 collectors were seriously injured 
yu lei deputy chief of the ministry of public security said the 
situation had to stop 
we will not tolerate a continuation of this situation he 
said speaking on national television tuesday night we will begin 
dealing very harshly with these criminals

the un human rights commission has denounced 
rights abuses by iran but failed to take similar action against 
iraq which stands accused of using chemical weapons executing 
people without trial and torturing children 
a resolution proposed by 13 western nations on wednesday 
condemned reliable reports of mass extrajudicial executions in 
iraq and reports that unarmed ethnic kurds had been ordered killed 
but iraq proposed a motion that no action be taken on the 
resolution that motion was approved by 17 third world nations and 
opposed by 11 western nations plus togo and peru 
nine third world countries and the soviet bloc abstained 
human rights groups have accused iraqi authorities of using 
chemical weapons against iraqs kurdish minority and ordering mass 
executions 
last week the londonbased human rights group amnesty 
international accused iraq of torturing the children of enemies of 
the government to punish and extract confessions 
amnesty international said in a statement that it was deeply 
disturbed by the outcome of the iraq vote which it said seemed 
irreconcilable with a genuine commitment to bring a a halt to human 
rights violations in iraq 
the commission did criticize iran voting 206 to adopt a 
resolution citing continued reports of grave and persistent 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
the resolution sponsored by 13 western nations listed reports 
of a wave of summary executions in the second half of 1988 and 
numerous reports of illtreatment and torture of detainees 
voting in favor were all western members of the 43nation panel 
as well as iraq colombia mexico peru the philippines rwanda and 
venezuela 
sri lanka somalia ethiopia cuba bangladesh and pakistan cast 
opposing votes twelve third world countries abstained and all four 
soviet bloc members did not participate in the vote 
the commission also approved a resolution expressing dismay at 
continued acts of extreme violence from all sources in chile and 
concern at the persistence of serious violations of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms 
but it also noted that the government has respected the outcome 
of the oct 5 referendum in which an overwhelming majority of 
citizens voted against continued rule by gen augusto pinochet

for rent furn rms util heat inc meals limited vu 
call your local jailer 
prison officials around the nation who desperately need to reduce 
their overcrowded inmate populations are increasingly looking to 
send prisoners to local jails with rooms to rent 
in some cases lockups with the space to spare have paid for more 
than half their budgets with the renting scheme but in at least one 
jail the arrangement backfired when inmates angry about a move 
across the country vandalized the cells 
still the complaint from many jailers isnt the new inmates but 
the number of telephone calls from prospective renters 
i turn people down almost every day said lt james ross who 
runs the allegan county jail in southwest michigan about half of 
the jails 174 beds are often rented to outofcounty convicts 
about 27000 prisoners or 10 percent of the inmates in the 
nations largest jails are being held for other agencies said 
lawrence greenfeld director of corrections statistics for the us 
department of justice most of the displaced inmates come from state 
prison systems which pay a per diem to the county jail greenfeld 
said 
jails with space often have contracts with the state and federal 
governments to hold inmates from overcrowded lockups 
one of the pressures to alleviate overcrowding comes from federal 
or local court capacity restrictions in michigan for instance a 
state law requires early release for inmates if a county jail is 
above capacity for 21 consecutive days 
sheriffs throughout the state have recognized there is money to 
be made and are becoming conscious that they can make a profit by 
renting out said dale davis executive director of the michigan 
sheriffs association 
in clare county mich other jurisdictions are charged 40 per 
day to house an inmate at the jail said sheriff howard haskin he 
said about 25 or 30 of that is profit 
the lights and heat are on anyway so all were really paying 
for is three meals a day he said 
allegan county expects to take in about 135 million in 1989 by 
leasing jail space to other counties that will pay for about 70 
percent of the jails anticipated budget expenditures for the year 
in illinois about a third of the peoria county jails 220 
inmates are from other illinois counties and federal agencies 
charging 50 per day per inmate the jail took in 718000 last 
year in rent or about half of the sheriffs departments annual 
revenue said budget coordinator carol van winkle 
until recently the practice of transferring inmates from one 
county to another had been common in california 
that stopped when everyone became overcrowded said richard 
rainey vice president of the california sheriffs association 
rainey said the severity of overcrowding has led to jail 
expansion and has forced counties to look closely at alternatives 
such as community service parole and home monitoring programs 
but there are drawbacks to boarding inmates hundreds of miles 
from their homes and families 
if you place a pretrial person in a jail 200 or 300 miles away 
from home and from his attorney hes buried in terms of his legal 
defense said ed koren a staff attorney with the american civil 
liberties union national prisons project 
the loss of contact with family and friends also makes adjustment 
more difficult when the inmate is released koren said 
and occasionally a sheriffs dream about raising revenue in an 
jail with empty cells can turn into a nightmare 
in december the 509bed spokane county jail in washington signed 
a 11 million contract with the district of columbias department 
of corrections to accept 50 of the citys inmates 
since then the inmates have set mattresses on fire and stuffed 
up toilets to protest their 2600mile transfer 
its not going too well capt donald manning said

the bush administration may announce a new 
approach to the third world debt problem by the end of the week 
officials say 
the treasury department has completed its review of the debt 
topic officials said although the president has not yet approved 
the recommended changes 
officials said wednesday if that approval is gained treasury 
secretary nicholas brady could outline the new administrations 
approach to the debt issue when he addresses a conference on third 
world debt at the state department on friday 
officials would not comment on a published report that the bush 
administration planned several initiatives to encourage banks to 
voluntarily forgive a portion of the debt 
such an approach would mark a major change from the baker plan 
which has guided us policy on debt issues since it was first 
unveiled by thentreasury secretary james a baker iii in 1985 
bakers approach emphasized new lending rather than broadbased 
efforts to reduce the debt burden 
the wall street journal reported in wednesdays editions that the 
bush administration has been considering proposals that would 
involve reduction in interest rates and principal on a portion of 
the 13 trillion in debt held by developing countries 
the newspaper reported that the administration plan rules out any 
new direct us government spending to support the debt reduction 
efforts instead the administration proposal would call for 
diverting a portion of existing resources at the world bank and the 
international monetary fund to debt reduction and away from making 
new loans 
the new administration is receiving pressure from major us 
allies to go beyond the baker plan and support some sort of 
debtrelief program 
that pressure intensified last week after riots in venezuela 
which were touched off after the newly elected government of carlos 
andres perez announced austerity measures as part of an agreement 
with the imf to get more loans for venezuela one of latin americas 
biggest debtors

former gov john sununu made a second career 
of poohpoohing michael dukakis claims about the massachusetts 
economy during the presidential race now democrats say the white 
house chief of staff is sporting his own black eye 
just five days after sununu announced a state surplus as he left 
to serve president bush his successor judd gregg said new 
hampshire was saddled with a deficit today the governor and 
legislators are still struggling to keep the states books in 
balance 
where did governor sununus 10 million surplus go or was it 
never there democratic state sen james st jean asked recently 
in calling on sununu and gregg both republicans to explain 
house democratic leader mary chambers proposed that if she were 
gregg id punch john sununu in the nose 
some critics suggest sununu did to gregg what he accused his 
democratic predecessor of doing in 1982 telling the big lie by 
intentionally masking a deficit 
sununu did indeed project a 10 million surplus in the current 
571 million generalspending budget when he bade farewell to 
legislators jan 4 and gregg less than a week later warned of a 
potential 13 million deficit when he cut most state spending by 3 
percent for the remainder of the fiscal year 
what galls critics is that sununu in projecting a surplus 
didnt deduct anything for bills he knew were coming due gregg did 
in predicting a deficit 
gregg however a former congressman who soundly defeated a 
democratic lawyer in an election to succeed sununu defended the 
former governor 
you always want to put the best spin on things gregg said 
recently he did what most politicians in his position would have 
done 
critics say that in not mentioning the bills sununu painted too 
rosy a picture sununu said they werent listening closely to what 
hes been saying for two years 
for folks to say i didnt say revenues were tight is just not 
true he said i was the one who said it was going to be a 
tough tough biennium 
sununu was well aware of the bills for programs including lawyers 
for poor defendants and courtordered placements of troubled 
juveniles but he said the amount had not been established 
sununu and gregg also differed on two other critical elements in 
the surplusdeficit calculation how much revenue the state will 
take in during the year ending june 30 and how much money will be 
left over appropriated but not spent in various state accounts 
together those differences alone made sununu about 13 million 
more optimistic than gregg 
some democrats suggest sununu padded figures to make himself look 
good even as he was criticizing dukakis last years democratic 
presidential candidate for boasting about the economy in 
neighboring massachusetts 
but gregg himself agrees that the deteriorating fiscal picture 
wasnt predictable he does not challenge sununus assertion that 
when he left the forecast was for a small surplus even after the 
bills were paid 
you could still have been optimistic into december gregg 
said and if i were a departing governor i suspect i would have 
been 
sununu added i felt we still would have been able to manage 
it 
even now gregg and legislators dont agree on how much money the 
state will take in this year projecting revenues gregg said 
remains very much a crystalball game 
gregg said the main reason is the unpredictability of the states 
business profits tax its top moneymaker 
gregg warned against exaggerating the states difficulties 
spending cuts not tapping the states rainy day fund or raising 
taxes will take care of the projected deficit he said 
my sense is we are still in a very manageable problem he 
said

in a break with 15 years of state support 
for the seabrook nuclear power plant gov judd gregg announced he 
will ask a federal bankruptcy judge to block lowpower testing of 
the reactor 
gregg who two months ago succeeded staunch seabrook supporter 
john sununu said wednesday the testing shouldnt start until 
commercial operation is assured 
if seabrook never goes online commercially then lowpower 
testing will have been a wasted exercise the resultant 
contamination will have been avoidable and the expense will have 
been unnecessary the republican governor said in a statement 
seabrook officials hope to start the tests within weeks and begin 
commercial operation within a year 
spokesman nicholas ashooh said public service co of new 
hampshire officials have concerns that this may lead to additional 
unnecessary delays and cost increases for seabrook and may further 
delay our getting seabrooks power which we need 
but seabrook spokesman rob williams sought to play down the 
development and said gregg must be misinformed about the effects 
of lowpower testing on the plant 
seabrook opponents greeted greggs announcement as a major 
setback for the longdelayed project 
the one thing the owners could always say was that they had the 
state on their side were delighted to have company in this 
fight said mary breslauer spokeswoman for massachusetts attorney 
general james shannon who has fought seabrook licensing on the 
grounds that massachusetts residents near the plant could not be 
safely evacuated if there were an accident 
antiseabrook lawyer robert backus called greggs announcement 
monumentally good news 
the 59 billion project was completed in july 1986 but remains 
idle because of evacuationplanning and financial obstacles 
seabrooks main owner public service sought bankruptcy 
protection in january 1988 other seabrook owners have been 
faltering 
gregg said the state will argue to bankruptcy judge james yacos 
that letting seabrook conduct atomic tests is not sound business 
judgment unless it has first obtained the clearances necessary to 
begin fullpower operation including final evacuation plans 
public service one of five members of the seabrook owners 
executive committee has maintained it does not need yacos approval 
to start the tests the judge has not ruled on the issue 
in december the us nuclear regulatory commission said 
seabrooks troubled finances do not pose a safety concern for 
lowpower tests as long as the owners prove they can come up with 
721 million to decommission the reactor if the tests are conducted 
but the plant never operates commercially 
seabrook owners initially hoped to give that assurance in 
january but they have yet to do so 
public service owns 36 percent of seabrook and gregg said the 
state opposes letting the company take on what he estimated as 25 
million more liability for lowpower decommissioning 
gregg said that contaminating seabrook with atomic testing will 
needlessly render the facility useless for alternate applications 
williams the seabrook spokesman countered theres nothing to 
suggest that the plant would be rendered useless any contamination 
would be negligible 
public service began the project in 1972 initially planning two 
1150megawatt reactors at a cost of less than 1 billion the first 
to operate commercially in 1979 and the second in 1981 seabrooks 
owners abandoned the second reactor in 1986 
the project suffered years of delays over environmental issues 
and in the late 1970s became the site of mass protests resulting in 
more than 2000 arrests 
sununu who in 1984 helped public service sell bonds that paid 
for the plants completion now is president bushs chief of staff

a sociologist is studying whether the 
rise in weekend residents like herself are to blame for traffic 
jams high housing costs and the disappearance of dairy farms as 
locals in this quaint town claim 
when social change happens people create explanations of why 
its happening said roberta satow wool associate professor of 
sociology at brooklyn college in new york 
id like to look at their explanations of why its happened 
versus the objective reasons why its happening 
wool her husband and their two children have spent their 
weekends in a modest white clapboard house overlooking the states 
northwest hills since 1980 she estimates as many as 20 percent of 
this towns 3960 residents are weekenders mostly from new york 
city about 85 miles to the southwest 
spurred by complaints voiced by longtime residents wool has 
spent two years examining how weekenders have affected housing 
costs taxes jobs consumer buying patterns and the quality of life 
in the last decade she is finishing her work by surveying local 
attitudes toward parttime residents 
i started off on a guilt trip she said i started out 
feeling gee we have intruded in this place and weve had a very 
negative impact 
she hopes to finish this summer and publish her findings in a 
book about american communities being compiled by the new school for 
social research in new york city she says her work will have 
implications for other towns where wealthy urbanites have bought 
weekend homes in increasing numbers a trend called rural 
gentrification 
according to studies by the us department of commerce and 
researchers at city university of new york the number of second 
homes in the united states has surged since 1950 when there were an 
average of 40000 built each year wool said 
the number jumped to 130000 a year in the 1970s and there were 
more than 3 million second homes in 1977 the last year for which 
national figures were available she said 
locals say washington has been transformed from an agrarian 
community into what william bader the towns unofficial historian 
calls a cosmopolis an affluent parlour town populated on 
weekends by doctors lawyers and wall street executives 
groceries butcher shops and hardware stores have given way to 
upscale shops including a fancy jewelry store and a book store that 
caters to affluent new yorkers he others said 
im not saying its good and im not saying its bad bader 
said as with any kind of an economic change there is always 
somebody that benefits and somebody that gets hurt the young locals 
just cant afford to live here 
there are some very distinguished people who have bought homes 
here and in their own way they have contributed a lot to the 
community said thomas p whitney owner of the hickory stick 
bookshop 
bruce bailey sr a lifelong resident who owned a garbage 
collection business until he retired says he must drive further to 
shop for basic necessities its tough to get a quart of milk 
said bailey 63 
parking is so short on saturday mornings in washington depot the 
shopping district that some residents are calling for traffic 
restrictions he said 
the number of people buying second homes in washington jumped 
from five in 1982 to 52 in 1986 wool said the median price of a 
home increased from 75000 in 1980 to 240000 in 1987 according 
to figures compiled by the us census bureau and the state office 
of policy and management

an eastern airlines pilot who crossed picket lines 
said today that static and cries of scab interfered with his 
radio communication with air traffic controllers 
the incident was reported to the federal aviation administration 
and the fbi which has recordings of the interference faa spokesman 
jack barker in atlanta said 
the word scab was used on the radio said capt roger p 
pipkin who was flying flight 5679 from hartsfield atlanta 
international airport to miami on monday with a crew of six and 
three passengers aboard 
i havent said that any danger was posed said pipkin who 
has flown for eastern for 27 years but if frequencies are going 
to be used for reasons other than air traffic control then we have a 
problem 
pipkin said he has no idea who caused the interference which 
lasted seven minutes and occurred during taxi out take off and 
climb out 
pipkin said he heard voices on three frequencies and static on a 
fourth blocking a call for clearance to a new heading 
most aircraft including private planes have radios that can 
transmit on aviation frequencies used by commerical jetliners 
signals also could have been sent from a portable transmitter 
available in specialty stores for several hundred dollars officials 
said 
barker said the pilot was able to communicate despite the 
interference 
the frequencies were not jammed there was some interference on 
the frequencies from some unknown person on the air barker said 
the fbi has it now 
representatives of the air line pilots association whose members 
have refused to cross the machinsts picket lines said they were 
unaware of the incident 
i find it highly unlikely that an alpa pilot would do it it 
could have been anybody said jack gordon an eastern pilot at the 
alpa communications center in miami 
its just contrary to everything youre taught the safety 
factor alone is enough to stop you you dont jam channels gordon 
said being a pilot thats the last thing id do my fellow 
airmen wouldnt do it either 
pipkin 52 is one of only a few of easterns 3600 pilots to 
cross picket lines during the strike by the miamibased carriers 
8500 machinists who walked off the job saturday 
eastern has dropped all service expect its northeast shuttle and 
several flights from miami to buenos aires and santiago chile

a marine biologist has begun a fiveday 
sojourn in a sealed environment that generates its own air and rain 
part of an experiment that creators say may work as well on distant 
planets as in the arizona desert 
abigale alling entered the unnamed module wednesday through an 
airlock abandoning earths atmosphere for one created to test the 
systems of biosphere ii a futuristic closed ecosystem which wont 
be completed for about 15 months 
i will live move and breathe in another life system ms 
alling said before she entered the airlock she later told reporters 
over a videotape hookup that she felt like a pioneer 
it is another world and a world apart from where you are it 
is a remarkable feat she said 
researchers from the soviet union have experimented with 
nonfoodproducing closed systems and the university of hawaii has 
kept a closed experiment going for 20 years but no one has 
integrated natural processes into a longterm habitat capable of 
sustaining human life project director margaret augustine said 
that is the mission of biosphere ii which will provide a world 
within a world for eight biospherians from september 1990 until 
september 1992 she said 
biosphere ii will feature desert ocean farmed land marsh 
savanna and jungle biomes or life zones with 250 animal 
species ranging from goats to insects and 3800 plant species the 
human habitat listed as another biome will include laboratories 
and an amphitheater in a sixstory building resembling a mosque 
ms augustine and other officers of space biospheres ventures a 
private company largely funded by texas oilman edward p bass 
expect the 30 million project to pay for itself in sales of 
biospheres to governments and researchers for space colonization 
preservation of endangered species or other projects 
ms alling said her experiment will be the longest test so far a 
humaninhabited module cut off from earths atmosphere and food 
chains 
there have been 2 years of unmanned studies in the test module 
and a threeday manned study 
the yale universitytrained biologist wore a red jumpsuit as she 
entered the enclosure a greenhouse about the size of a singlecar 
garage at the base but topped with a glassandsteel canopy that 
makes it 20 feet high and traps 15000 cubic feet of air 
the module stocked with flora and fauna as well as a private 
quarters for ms alling is a fraction of the size of biosphere ii 
which will put 5 million cubic feet under glass over a 2acre site 
but planners expect this weeks experiment to prove the worth of 
their calculations that plants organisms and solarpowered 
equipment can purify the air and water and replenish the oxygen 
supply of the biospherians 
the import of this thing is monumental because of information 
to be gathered said linda leigh a design coordinator 
the small enclosure kept ms allings world devoid of chickens 
goats and other vertebrates expected to populate biosphere ii 
however ms alling said she would have no trouble dining on 
2500 calories a day from 29 types of fruit and vegetables as well 
as two aquarium fish which she will kill and eat as part of the test 
air circulation works on a system similar to biosphere iis hot 
air will rise over the desert section of the module pick up 
moisture over a 1 milliongallon ocean and release it as rain over a 
rain forest solar fans and a turbine will send air back over the 
desert to begin the cycle again 
ms alling a 29yearold marinemammal scientist will monitor 
systems inside while project managers outside do the same as well 
as record ms allings heart and respiration rate and other vital 
signs 
she has already learned to enjoy the enclosed environment which 
she said has the wonderful smell of a rich tropical rain forest

the government has agreed to drop its claims 
against the secondranking teamsters official in return for his 
efforts to increase democracy and fight corruption in the union 
lawyers said 
the settlement with weldon mathis the unions 
secretarytreasurer was announced in us district court wednesday 
just days before the governments case against the international 
brotherhood of teamsters was scheduled to go to trial 
it remained unclear whether mathis would go through with the pact 
should the union oppose it and demand his resignation 
in january after three other officers settled the teamsters 
board passed a resolution requiring any member of the leadership who 
settles with the government to resign from the board mathis and his 
allies want to remain on the board 
the government has been negotiating with the union and some of 
its leaders in recent weeks but talks with leaders loyal to union 
president william j mccarthy have ended said james t grady the 
unions general counsel 
mathis challenged mccarthy for leadership of the 17 
millionmember union after the death of jackie presser in july 
the governments civil suit seeks to use federal racketeering 
laws to oust the unions senior leadership and impose reforms 
originally named as defendants were the union 18 members of its 
executive board and 26 alleged leaders of organized crime the trial 
is scheduled to begin monday 
also wednesday judge david n edelstein separated from the case 
all of the governments claims against five reputed organized crime 
figures saying those claims would be tried separately

people it identified as mafia leaders after some were ordered and 
others agreed to refrain from involvement with the union

the soviet union says it will accept world 
court rulings in cases involving human rights treaties a gesture 
that signals an end to soviet resistance to being judged by other 
nations 
state department officials hailed the move as a major step 
and said they hoped the soviets would now join the united states in 
accepting the courts rulings in all but the most sensitive national 
security cases 
the united nations legal office on wednesday released a letter 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze wrote to 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar withdrawing soviet 
reservations on six human rights treaties 
his letter suggested however that the soviet union would agree 
to the courts arbitration in all human rights cases the 15judge 
officially neutral court deals with cases brought by states and has 
no authority to deal with complaints filed by private individuals or 
organizations 
shevardnadze noted that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
proposed in his december address to the general assembly that all 
countries recognize world court jurisdiction with respect to the 
interpretation and application of human rights agreements 
in geneva soviet deputy foreign minister anatoly l adamyshin 
said the changes gorbachev is pursuing are aimed at the 
development of a state based on the rule of law 
we want to build it by drawing on the general democratic 
achievements of human civilization he said 
a senior state department official called the announcement a 
major step the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
noted that the soviets previously contended the court was 
dominated by western influences 
the netherlandsbased tribunal formally known as the 
international court of justice at the hague was established in 1945 
and is the main judicial arm of the united nations while it has no 
powers of enforcement its rulings weigh heavily on world opinion 
three years ago the united states rejected the courts authority 
when nicaragua brought a case charging washington with trying to 
subvert the leftist sandinista government 
washington and moscow have been holding talks however in an 
effort to get an agreement with britain france and china to 
recognize the courts authority in most treaties 
a world court official in the hague today called the soviet move 
a declaration of moscows intention to give the court a more 
prominent role in international affairs 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that only 
once had the court handled a case involving one of the six treaties 
in which shevardnadze said the soviets would recognize the courts 
binding jurisdiction 
they are 
the 1984 convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment 
the 1979 convention on the elimination all forms of 
discrimination against women 
the 1965 international convention on the elimination of all 
forms of racial discrimination 
the 1952 convention on the political rights of women 
the 1949 convention for the suppression of the traffic in 
persons and of the exploitation of the prostitutions of others 
the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the 
crime of genocide 
moscow had signed the treaties but said it did not accept world 
court authority in disputes 
us and soviet legal experts have held two rounds of talks since 
july aimed at strengthening the courts authority in all but the 
most sensitive political cases 
washington also suggests that the united states soviet union 
china britain and france declare certain cases inappropriate for 
the courts jurisdiction such as national security issues or the 
use of force 
that would avoid cases such as the 1986 nicaraguanus dispute 
in which nicaragua charged the united states was illegally mining 
its harbors after the world court ruled it had jurisdiction in the 
case the united states refused to appear before the tribunal or 
honor its verdict which favored the sandinistas 
in 1946 the united states had accepted the compulsory 
jurisdiction of the world court in all cases except those within the 
jurisdiction of us courts

china today answered us criticism of its use of 
force to quell dissent in tibet saying it has the right to maintain 
order within its boundaries and will not tolerate foreign meddling 
tibet is an inalienable part of china foreign ministry 
spokesman li zhaoxing said tibetan affairs are chinas internal 
affairs which brook no interference by a foreign government 
organization or individual 
li characterized the violence in tibet as a serious riot 
deliberately engineered by a handful of separatists in an attempt to 
split china this is what the chinese government and people can 
never tolerate 
us state department spokesman charles e redman on wednesday 
criticized the chinese governments use of force against 
demonstrators 
while we recognize the right of a government to maintain order 
we object to the unwarranted use of lethal force he said 
china says 12 people were killed in three days of violent clashes 
between police and proindependence tibetans tibetans have put the 
death toll far higher and claim most of the victims were shot by 
security forces 
on tuesday china put the tibetan capital of lhasa under martial 
law and reportedly has arrested large numbers of protesters 
redman said the us government had expressed its concerns to the 
chinese government we stressed a concern in the united states 
over human rights in tibet 
li speaking at a weekly briefing also criticized a recent us 
decision that chinese employees at the united nations may not travel 
farther than 25 miles from midtown manhattan on personal business 
the restriction has previously applied to other socialist nations 
the discriminatory travel restrictions imposed on chinese un 
employees by the united states run counter to the norms of 
international law and the legal obligation undertaken by the united 
states in accordance with the un charter li said 
china flatly rejects these unreasonable restrictions li said 
china has called on the united nations to urge the united states 
to abolish this discriminatory measure immediately

if you dont believe that it pays to be 
persistent just ask michael ray tanner but be sure you ask the 
right michael ray tanner 
the michael ray tanner who knows that persistence pays is the 
same man who finally convinced a harris county prosecutor that the 
wrong man had been arrested on a felony theft charge 
but it wasnt easy tanner said even the woman who was with him 
when he was arrested wont talk to him 
a harris county deputy arrested tanner on feb 12 on a 1986 
warrant accusing him of stealing 6000 worth of computer discs 
tanner a 31yearold electronics technician from suburban katy 
took an unusual step to prove he was the wrong man 
he began calling prosecutor ruben perez 
perez said i told him i shouldnt be talking to him and that 
anything he said could be used against him but he just kept telling 
me we had the wrong man finally i started to sense a ring of 
credibility he literally convinced me on the phone 
the matter was resolved wednesday during a confrontation between 
tanner and joseph h wofford jr whose tapes had been stolen three 
years ago 
wofford took one look at the technician in the courtroom and told 
perez that tanner was not the michael ray tanner who had stolen the 
tapes 
the judge then signed a dismissal order that exonerated the 
innocent tanner 
the other tanner 35 who is accused of taking 20 discs from 
woffords business and attempting to ransom them back for 1500 is 
still at large authorities say 
the younger tanner said his problems began when his jeep got 
stuck in the mud a deputy who came out to help ran a check on the 
mans drivers license and arrested him on the old warrant 
i was on a date with a girl id just met and now she wont 
even talk to me tanner lamented the deputy wouldnt even let 
me go back to the jeep to tell her he said ill take care of 
it 
tanner spent most of a day in jail before paying a bondsman 300 
to post a 2000 bond 
tanner said he never hired a lawyer choosing instead to take his 
case directly to perez 
if id been guilty i sure wouldnt have called him but i had 
nothing to lose tanner said i had to do something

weightlifter and stunt man tom owen who 
once let a tractortrailer rig roll across his stomach finally met 
his match 
the operator of a home for abused children suffered two broken 
ribs wednesday after a pickup truck loaded with 20 children rolled 
across his stomach 
ive never been hurt like this before owen said by telephone 
from his bed at ami brookwood medical center the pain was so bad 
i thought i might die 
owen founder and director of the kings ranch in chelsea was 
admitted to the hospital with abdominal injuries and was being kept 
overnight for observation a spokeswoman said 
owen 38 had performed the stunt hundreds of times when he 
agreed to do it wednesday for a photographer from the national 
enquirer 
the problem owen said was he didnt have a ramp to catch the 
wheel of the truck once it had rolled across his stomach owen 
usually uses two ramps one of each side of his stomach but he 
decided to use only one ramp wednesday because he thought it would 
make a better picture 
a dozen spectators and the truckload of children watched quietly 
as owen writhed on the ground in pain for several minutes owen 
appeared dazed before he finally looked around and said is it 
over i must have blacked out 
owen who has won dozens of trophies in weightlifting contests 
started performing his daredevil feats about 10 years ago to raise 
money for the ranch 
until wednesday his only serious injury was a broken hand the 
result of a truck tire landing on his hand he said he also has 
broken several teeth during stunts in which he pulls trucks and 
lifts heavy objects with his mouth

looked like it dropped said newman i never did see the other 
plane

president bush should stand by his nomination 
of john tower for secretary of defense former presidents jimmy 
carter and gerald ford said during a joint appearance 
at no time did i see john tower in a position which impaired 
his integrity or capabilities ford said wednesday night during a 
news conference before he and carter appeared in a forum at tulane 
university 
my opinion is that he is well qualified to serve and he will be 
secretary of defense said the republican former president 
democrats in the senate have called on bush to withdraw towers 
nomination which has been jeopardized by allegations of excessive 
drinking and womanizing 
carter said bushs choice for the post should be honored 
i dont think it would harm relations to allow tower to 
serve the democrat said 
ford and carter met in a debate on the american presidency 
the forum was part of tulanes direction 89 speaker series 
the two crossed political party affiliations and agreed on most 
of the topics 
both said bush should stay out of the current eastern airlines 
strike 
if i were president i would not intercede in negotiations 
involving eastern airlines carter said 
ford said it would be unfortunate if bush were to get 
involved between labor and management in the walkout by eastern 
machinists 
it is certainly tragic that one of our great american airlines 
will probably never fly again he said but the controversy 
will have no significant impact on the labor movement unless 
secondary boycotts occur

a comatose woman who received an abortion 
last month after a bitter legal battle has made enough progress to 
transfer to a rehabilitation center relatives say 
nancy klein who remains in a coma at north shore university 
hospital in manhasset just east of new york city was to be moved 
today to a rehabilitation center in edison nj 
nancy is moving onto a whole new world her mother anne 
zusselman of delray beach fla said wednesday in an interview with 
the associated press from the klein home in upper brookville 
we think she is ready and were going for it 
mrs klein 32 suffered severe brain damage in a dec 13 car 
accident 
her husband martin 34 went to court to be appointed her legal 
guardian so he could authorize an abortion that doctors said could 
improve her chances of survival 
antiabortionists fought a threeweek court battle to block the 
abortion appealing all the way to the us supreme court before the 
case was thrown out 
the abortion was performed feb 11 when mrs klein was 18 weeks 
pregnant 
although hospital physicians believe mrs klein only has a slim 
chance of recovery family members say they have seen an improvement 
since the abortion 
she can move her head to both sides open her mouth and lift her 
left arm on command she can even give us the thumbs up sign 
mrs zusselman said 
but carol hauptman a spokeswoman for north shore said mrs 
kleins condition remained unchanged 
the kleins 3yearold daughter has visited her mother twice in 
the hospital 
we dont know how much nancy knows but she seems to be happy 
when the baby visits said mrs zusselman 
the family believes mrs klein now requires intensive daily 
therapy that the hospital isnt equipped to provide 
the robert wood johnson rehabilitation institute of john f 
kennedy hospital has a renowned brain trauma unit it provides eye 
and speech therapy and equipment that includes a chair that will 
help mrs klein hold her head up 
they will give her an intensive workout as much as she can 
take mrs zusselman said

state farm insurance has agreed to pay 
refunds to thousands of new policyholders charged higher auto 
insurance rates after california voters approved a proposition to 
slash rates last year 
but the states largest automobile insurer will go ahead with a 
96 percent rate increase charged to all of its auto insurance 
customers more than a month ago the state department of insurance 
has scheduled a hearing on the legality of the increase 
the refunds were announced wednesday as a settlement of charges 
by the department that state farm had discriminated illegally 
against new customers 
the company which insures 28 million drivers in california 
started assigning new customers to a higherpriced subsidiary state 
farm fire and casualty co after nov 8 when voters approved the 
rateslashing proposition 103 initiative 
state farm fire and casualty charges 20 to 60 percent more than 
state farm mutual auto insurance co the preferredrisk 
subsidiary 
it was the first increase by a major california insurer since the 
passage of proposition 103 which calls for a oneyear rollback of 
auto and property insurance rates to 20 percent cut below november 
1987 levels the state supreme court has blocked the rollback while 
it considers insurance company lawsuits claiming the initiative is 
unconstitutional 
the department contended state farms actions violated a 
preproposition 103 law forbidding arbitrary discrimination among 
insurance customers state farm said it had suffered large 
underwriting losses in california and was entitled to refuse new 
customers in any subsidiary as long as all customers were treated 
alike 
the department said as many as 10000 new customers were placed 
with the higherpriced company the details of the refund plan were 
due in two weeks 
were pleased with the results of our negotiations said 
insurance commissioner roxani gillespie now the policyholders 
will get immediate action instead of seeing the issue drag through 
courts for years 
james mattesich a lawyer for state farm said part of the 
settlement was an agreement by the department that the companys 
actions had been reasonable and consistent with prior regulatory 
practice

authorities have agreed to 
release or file formal charges against 35 black inmates who have 
been hospitalized because of their hunger strikes their lawyers 
said today 
lawyer mahmood cajee said law and order minister adriaan vlok 
agreed on tuesday to make a decision on the status of each of the 35 
prisoners who are among hundreds of black inmates being held 
without charge 
the 35 prisoners some of whom have been on hunger strikes for 19 
days are inmates at a prison in the southeastern city of 
pietermaritzburg 
cajee said the detainees resumed eating wednesday evening the 
detainees are ecstatic he said 
the attorney declined to say how many of the 35 would be freed 
and how many would be charged but said he expected the law and 
order ministry to announce its decisions within a matter of days 
lawyer rishi thakurdin who also represents some of the inmates 
said some of those released would be placed under restrictions 
limiting their movements and prohibiting involvement in political 
activities 
a law and order ministry spokesman brig leon mellet said vlok 
was examining the status of each and every detainee nationwide 
but we dont want to comment on individual cases 
detainees in johannesburg began fasting jan 23 demanding to be 
freed or put on trial the hunger strikes quickly spread to other 
cities and vlok said feb 16 he would release a substantial 
number of detainees 
the government says it since has freed 279 detainees and more 
than 500 people remain held without charge antiapartheid groups 
say 202 people have been released while about 700 remain in 
detention 
the groups say vlok has reneged on his promise that he had given 
the impression that more than half the detainees would be released 
by the beginning of march there have been widespread calls for an 
end to all detentions without trial 
about 20 detainees in durban and a smaller number at modderbee 
prison east of johannesburg reportedly remain on hunger strikes 
vlok said wednesday that 23 detainees hospitalized due to their 
hunger strikes have been returned to prison 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge for 
varying lengths of time under the nearly 3yearold state of 
emergency 
emergency regulations give security forces wide powers and ban or 
restrict many forms of peaceful protest 
in a separate development today two black men convicted of 
murder were hanged in pretoria raising the number of executions 
this year to four 
human rights organizations recently praised the government for 
the sharp decline in the rate of executions a total of 117 people 
were executed last year and 164 were hanged in 1987

participating in the action said michael lewis a spokesman for the 
coalition for concerned students 
the officials also agreed to work on improvements to financial 
aid and curriculum at the predominantly black university lewis said 
you stood up and said we have an insult level and howard has 
established a watershed movement civil rights leader jesse 
jackson told the students as the takeover ended 
jackson mayor marion barry jr and walter fauntroy the district 
of columbias delegate to congress met into the earlymorning hours 
with the students 
jackson called the outcome a great victory 
he said the students had two major interests on one hand they 
were concerned about being a part of the political process on the 
campus which university president james cheek agreed to in a 
very amicable way and also they were concerned about the politics 
of the bush administration they want an end to raceconscious 
politics 
lewis said some students remained in the building today to repair 
any damage that was caused during the occupation which began monday 
as students protested atwaters appointment to the board of trustees 
atwater resigned tuesday saying he was worried the occupation 
might lead to injuries of students 
after learning they had succeeded in driving atwater from the 
board of trustees the students focused their attention on other 
demands involving curriculum financial aid and improved security 
the demonstration disrupted classes and the students on wednesday 
blocked the entrance of a site they thought was being used for 
temporary administrative offices 
atwater was appointed to the board in december students started 
the protest on friday when they disrupted a convocation ceremony for 
the schools charter day that was to have included a speech by 
comedian and philanthropist bill cosby 
the students recommended that cosby be named to replace atwater 
atwater complained wednesday that he was the victim of an 
unfair portrayal of his civil rights positions by howard 
students 
all i was trying to do was help howard university atwater 
said the president of the school knew that the board of 
trustees knew and i think some of the students knew 
students contended that atwater encouraged racism while managing 
president bushs 1988 campaign by focusing on convict willie horton 
jr who is black horton raped a maryland woman while on furlough 
from a massachusetts prison 
jackson thanked cheek for the way he handled the demonstration 
these struggles to make life better dont always end on this note 
many students have been expelled to make their point and that didnt 
happen at howard he said

the dalai lama today praised the tibetan 
nationalist struggle and condemned chinese repression in the 
disputed region the scene of bloody riots this week 
tibetan demonstrations for independence have left at least 16 
people dead and forced the imposition of martial law in lhasa the 
tibetan capital 
no amount of repression however brutal and violent can 
silence the voice of freedom and justice the tibetan spiritual 
leader said in a statement marking the 30th anniversary of the 
tibetan uprising against china 
unfortunately the chinese leadership still fails to understand 
the extent of dissatisfaction among the tibetan people said 
the statement issued by the office of the dali lamas 
representative in new delhi 
the dalai lama spiritual leaders of tibetans fled to india 
after the failed march 10 1959 uprising against the chinese in 
lhasa 
china claims tibet has been an integral part of chinese territory 
for seven centuries but most tibetans maintain it was an 
independent nation before the communists moved into tibet in 1949 
we honor more than 1 million tibetans who have died as the 
result of four decades of chinese occupation the dali lama said 
his governmentinexile headquartered in the town of dharmsala 
260 miles north of new delhi offered on wednesday to hold talks on 
the future of tibet with the chinese government 
despite the current tragic events we are still ready to hold 
talks with the chinese so that a peaceful solution can be found 
said tashi wangdi the tibetan leaders chief representative 
china offered in september to hold talks with the dalai lama on 
the future of tibet if he dropped demands for tibetan independence 
the dalai lamas adminstration accepted the offer but said the 
only reasonable basis for resolving the issue was a selfgovering 
democratic entity in tibet in association with the peoples 
republic of china 
the talks were to start in january but snags developed in 
december when the chinese said they preferred to meet in beijing 
not geneva 
the tibetans rejected beijing saying a meeting in the chinese 
capital would portray the tibetan issue as an internal chinese 
problem

all foreigners were removed from lhasa 
today and chinese troops began rounding up tibetans said a tibetan 
woman 
soldiers are all over the place and theyre grabbing 
everyone she said the woman who runs a small hotel in lhasa 
was interviewed by telephone from beijing foreign reporters were 
barred from the city 
china on tuesday declared martial law in the city of 70000 
following three days of rioting by tibetans demanding independence 
from china and the return of their spiritual leader the dalai lama 
china today added four people to the number killed during 
protests in lhasa on sunday bringing the official toll to 16 dead 
and about 100 wounded 
western travelers say many more have died and most tibetans 
reportedly put the toll at between 20 and 30 
the government also denied that it had abused tibetans human 
rights 
the tibetan woman said most of the citys foreigners estimated 
at 140 left in buses about 40 flew into to chengdu the capital of 
neighboring sichuan province 
the woman said soldiers then began detaining large numbers of 
tibetans she said she could not estimate how many people were being 
taking away many people it is many more than when the foreigners 
were here she said 
upon arriving in chengdu tourists said tibetans had become 
increasingly scared after the imposition of martial law 
people begged us repeatedly over the last few days tell the 
world help us please said one american from new orleans who 
spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of chinese reprisals 
they grab your hand and say help us and they cry said a 
west german woman 
a group of tourists that flew to chengdu issued a statement they 
said would be sent to the united nations and to the dalai lama who 
lives in exile in india 
it is our urgent and heartfelt wish that the world community 
should carefully and critically examine the causes of this conflict 
and the methods and motives of the authorities said the statement 
while the tibetan demonstrators became violent and destructive 
in expressing their anger and frustration we feel the magnitude and 
bloodiness of the crisis has been caused by the incompetence of the 
authorities 
shootings by the authorities have been excessive 
unpredictable indiscriminate and there have on occasion been 
atrocities it said 
staterun radio reported the four additional deaths and said the 
people died in the hospital during emergency lifesaving 
procedures the report did not say whether the dead were tibetans 
foreigners say some tibetans claim as many as 100 people were 
killed by police although those claims could not be confirmed 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing in a weekly briefing 
denied chinese authorities were violating the human rights of 
tibetans 
recently a handful of separatists committed beating smashing 
looting and burning in a deliberate attempt to start a riot li 
said these violent incidents aimed at splitting the motherland 
were a serious breach of law it is not a question of human rights 
religion or nationality 
li also blamed the disturbances on the clique of the dalai 
lama 
during the riots thousands of tibetans rampaged through the 
streets and ransacked chineseowned shops on wednesday travelers 
reported seeing police dragging tibetans out of their homes and 
hauling them away in trucks 
the official chinese media has given no figures on arrests but 
the communist partys official peoples daily reported from lhasa 
how police raided one home and dragged a screaming man outside they 
then went next door and found a man hiding under a blanket 
the mans wife was quoted as saying hurry up and dress and go 
with them i told you not to take part in the riots but you just 
had to do it 
chinas official xinhua news agency meanwhile accused tibetan 
separatists living abroad of smuggling weapons into tibet and 
instigating the riots 
foreign travelers said they saw no signs of tibetans firing on 
police 
xinhua said the tibetan separatist clique based abroad has 
recently sent its men into tibet under the guise of tourists to 
incite riots and they have also smuggled weapons into the region 
it was an apparent reference to the followers of the dalai lama 
who fled tibet following a failed uprising against chinas army in 
march 1959 
friday is the 30th anniversary of that rebellion and martial law 
was imposed in part to prevent further antichinese demonstrations 
on that day 
the dalai lama in a statement marking the anniversary praised 
the tibetan struggle and condemned chinese oppression 
no amount of repression however brutal and violent can 
silence the voice of freedom and justice he said

a 78yearold snake researcher bitten by a 
deadly viper last week was released from the hospital and has 
returned to his laboratory 
william haast whose illness touched off an international effort 
to find antivenin to save him was released wednedsay 
he said the pakistani pit viper was only defending itself 
blaming the bite on his own carelessness it was the 148th time he 
had been bitten during his career as a researcher and the 19th time 
he was hospitalized 
they have a reputation for striking out he said wednesday 
they can reach out from the ground over two feet 
haast was bitten feb 28 because he did not expect the reaction 
to be as serious as it was he did not enter the university of utah 
health sciences center until the following day 
he was treated with antivenin flown in from california when it 
was discovered he was allergic to the serum on hand 
through the efforts of a white house aide more serums were 
obtained from england from the soviet union and even from private 
sources in iran but in the end the serums from overseas were not 
used because doctors feared possible side effects and because haast 
appeared to be recovering 
haast said the people who sent in the antivenins were the real 
heroes of this story 
he is director of the miami serpentarium laboratories at the 
university of utah he keeps an estimated 1000 poisonous snakes at 
the lab where venom is extracted for research and the manufacture 
of antivenins 
hospital spokesman john dwan said haast would still have to have 
blood tests every other day for the next week or so

sources as saying an iranian commando team was recently in that 
country trying to obtain weapons apparently to kill british author 
salman rushdie

against rushdie has damaged islam more than the controversial novel 
which some say blasphemes islam 
kuwait today joined other moslem nations in condemning the book 
and it banned all works by the author who was born into a moslem 
family 
the satanic verses led iran to break relations with britain

close to the regime there are about 25000 iranians in britain 
including 2400 students 
i can confirm to you that the names of nine iranian individuals 
have been sent over to the fco foreign and commonwealth office 
a spokesman for the home office the department responsible for 
immigration said today 
this would be to initiate the proceedings to secure their 
removal he said speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
custom when asked if they were former embassy employees who no 
longer have diplomatic status he said i can confirm that 
home secretary douglas hurd said his officials were checking all 
people stationed in britain by iran to decide which of them we can 
no longer safely receive here 
i think we are dealing here with a regime which is different 
from the others a regime which in recent weeks has gone back to 
preaching violence hurd told british broadcasting corp radio

police guard since feb 14 when khomeini ordered moslems to kill 
him iranian clerics have offered 52 million for rushdies death

but failed to obtain weapons in spain to kill rushdie no charges 
were filed because of lack of evidence it quoted the sources as 
saying 
the iraqi president was quoted today as telling the saudi 
newspaper alsharq alawsat that rushdie is bad and illdisposed 
but he was also quoted as saying this death threat does more 
damage to islam than salman rushdies book it was the first 
public statement from the iraqi president on the rushdie affair 
kuwaits government urged moslems across the world to boycott all 
books published by the penguin group which published the satanic 
verses 
in a separate decision the information ministry banned all books

the new orleans symphony took the stage for 
the first time since it ran out of money 14 months ago and feted a 
rare sellout crowd with balloons jazz bands and cajun buffet 
this is a great victory for the city mayor sidney barthelemy 
told the crowd wednesday this is a great victory for the people 
we cant go anywhere but up 
the long absence generated a crush for tickets in addition to 
the opening night sellout officials said all seats for saturday 
night were sold and only 200 remained for the next thursdays 
performance in the 1750seat orpheum theater 
symphony officials said they could remember only one previous 
sellout in the orpheum a benefit with violinist itzhak perlman 
ron jones president of the board said 70 percent of season 
tickets have been sold and officials expect to sell 90 percent of 
seats in advance 
organizers turned the opening into a celebration there were 
flowers for women in the audience a welcome line of local 
television anchors and a high school jazz band playing in the lobby 
during the closing bows balloons rained from the ceiling as in a 
political convention afterward the whole crowd was invited to a 
hotel across the street where some of the citys finest restaurants 
catered a buffet that included jambalaya red beans and rice shrimp 
pasta and oyster soup 
the crowd loved it 
i can remember the night they closed said eean mcnaughton 
an architect who has been attending the symphony here for 30 years 
it really makes this an exuberant night 
a massive fundraising and the sale of the orpheum erased a 4 
million debt the theaters buyers whose names havent been 
disclosed are letting the symphony play rentfree for five years 
in addition the board of directors and staff were restructured 
the symphony has scheduled a short 12week spring season full 
34week seasons are being prepared for the next two years 
the opening program with music director maxim shostakovich 
conducting included fanfare for a new beginning composed by 
orchestra flutist richard harrison 
alexander slobodyanik was guest pianist for chopins concerto no 
1 in e minor 
the orchestra sounds better than it has for a long time 
because the people are in a better mood said greg miller a 
trombonist who is the musicians personnel manager it is hard to 
concentrate on beethoven when you are worrying about paying the 
rent 
the shutdown took its toll on the musicians however thirteen of 
the 89 orchestra members were listed in the program as on leave 
many have new jobs including concert master joseph kim who is now 
concert master of the seoul symphony in south korea 
kim flew back to new orleans for the opening and will be featured

the bush administrations top official in the 
fight against aids says the federal government will help communities 
that want to give clean needles to drug addicts to slow the spread 
of the deadly disease 
louis sullivan health and human services secretary says 
programs that provide clean needles to drug addicts deserve 
consideration by local communities but controversy over the idea 
will limit federal involvement until there is evidence that such 
programs work 
while i dont subscribe to the view that it condones drug 
abuse there are other people in society who do so the issue here 
is to try to work through this problem sullivan said wednesday in 
an interview 
sullivan said he would need to look very carefully at whether 
the federal government should pay for needleexchange programs but 
that in the meantime it could provide such support as trained health 
workers to advise on how to set up programs 
he also stressed that while he would encourage communities to 
experiment with needle exchanges the federal government should not 
require communities to have such programs 
these are activities that really mandate local decisions from 
the local communities around the country but we would be very 
supportive of such efforts if the communities make those 
decisions he said 
new york city where more than half of the citys 200000 heroin 
addicts are believed to be infected with the aids virus and tacoma 
wash are the only us cities with a governmentsponsored 
needleexchange program private efforts are under way or being 
planned in several other cities following the lead of several 
european cities which say their programs have succeeded in slowing 
the spread of aids without increasing drug abuse 
but the new york program has run into strong opposition from 
black and hispanic leaders who say giving needles to addicts 
continues their dependence on drugs those opponents say efforts 
should be focused on treatment of drug abuse 
officials say the infection rate for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome has been slowing in the gay community because of increased 
awareness and use of safe sex practices but they say the virus is 
spreading rapidly among drug addicts through sharing of contaminated 
needles 
infected addicts then spread the lethal disease to their sexual 
partners and to their babies 
sullivan said the department needs to target educational 
campaigns better to reach drug addicts and inform them about how the 
virus is spread 
we may very well not be tailoring the message to the specific 
segments of the community in the way that they can be most 
effective he said 
on other aids topics he said 
he would support a federally funded study into the sexual 
practices of americans as a way to get a better handle on the aids 
epidemic and where its headed 
from a public health standpoint this is information we 
desperately need if were going to have a reasonable chance of 
stemming this epidemic he said 
a new york group that announced this week it will help import 
prescription drugs not available in the united states for use by 
people with aids does not appear to be breaking any laws but he 
said the government will try to learn more about the effort 
as long as laws are not broken we would certainly not stand in 
the way but we would want to be sure that the public understands 
that this is not an activity that is endorsed by this department 
he said but we recognize the desperateness of the situation

men and women arent just different they 
also have different attitudes about what makes a good mate says a 
researcher who quizzed both sexes in dozens of cultures worldwide 
while both sexes value kindness and intelligence the fiveyear 
study suggests sexual differences in mate selection are virtually 
universal and probably rooted in mans evolution 
fifty scientists studied more than 10000 people of both sexes 
from 37 cultures in 33 countries to rate the desirability of 31 
characteristics in a mate said david m buss a university of 
michigan psychology professor who directed the international mate 
selection project 
the study is to be published in the march issue of behavioral and 
brain sciences 
the two basic differences emerged in nearly every culture from 
australians with western lifestyles to the zulus of rural south 
africa buss said 
men worldwide place greater value on mates who are young and 
physically attractive buss said wednesday 
women prefer mates who are somewhat older have good financial 
prospects and are ambitious and industrious he said 
but the research also showed both sexes value kindness and 
intelligence more than income or physical appearance buss said 
when i first found these sex differences in samples within the 
united states people were skeptical that they would be found across 
cultures he said i was skeptical as well but after the data 
from 37 cultures were analyzed statistically i was surprised at how 
pervasive the sex differences were 
earlier animal studies have confirmed the theory that females 
prefer mates who bear greater gifts hold better territories or 
display higher rank buss said 
crosscultural similarities in choosing a mate may result from 
patterns set by our ancestors including a womans traditional 
dependence on a man for food shelter and protection he said 
western european and north american men included in the study 
preferred mates who were at least one year younger buss said by 
contrast men surveyed from greece iran colombia and bulgaria 
opted for mates who were three to four years younger while nigerian 
and zambian men preferred women six or seven years younger 
women from indonesia nigeria and zambia most emphasized the 
earning potential of their prospective grooms he said dutch 
british and zulu women placed the lowest values on a mans 
moneymaking abilities american women considered finances important 
but not crucial 
the value placed on chastity varied widely from culture to 
culture buss said men from 23 of the 37 cultures considered 
marrying a virgin more important than did women 
both sexes in china india indonesia iran taiwan and israel 
stressed the value of chastity the study found but most western 
europeans said prior sexual experience was irrelevant in a potential 
mate buss said

eastern airlines decision to seek chapter 11 federal bankruptcy 
protection from creditors today means the strikecrippled carrier 
could continue to operate although it may have difficulty imposing 
wage cuts on union employees 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act companies are 
shielded from creditors while they continue to operate and 
reorganize their finances any reorganization plan is subject to 
approval by the bankruptcy court and creditors 
eastern could continue flying as other carriers have after 
seeking bankruptcy court protection 
but frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp 
would have a tougher time imposing lower wages on striking employees 
than he did when he reorganized continental airlines under federal 
bankruptcy law in 1983 
congress amended federal laws in 1984 to require bankrupt 
companies to negotiate with unions and prove economic necessity 
before abrogating their contracts 
the eastern strike began saturday with a walkout by 8500 members 
of easterns machinists union in a dispute over lorenzos proposed 
125 million in wage cuts 
the miamibased airline reduced its operations to about 4 percent 
of its scheduled flights and sent thousands of employees home after 
eastern pilots and flight attendants joined the machinists walkout

all foreigners were removed from lhasa 
today and chinese troops began rounding up tibetans said a tibetan 
woman 
soldiers are all over the place and theyre grabbing 
everyone she said the woman who runs a small hotel in lhasa 
was interviewed by telephone from beijing foreign reporters were 
barred from the city 
china on tuesday declared martial law in the city of 70000 
following three days of rioting by tibetans demanding independence 
from china and the return of their spiritual leader the dalai lama 
china today added four people to the number killed during 
protests in lhasa on sunday bringing the official toll to 16 dead 
and about 100 wounded 
western travelers say many more have died and most tibetans 
reportedly put the toll at between 20 and 30 
the government also denied that it had abused tibetans human 
rights 
the tibetan woman said most of the citys foreigners estimated 
at 140 left in buses about 40 flew into to chengdu the capital of 
neighboring sichuan province 
the woman said soldiers then began detaining large numbers of 
tibetans she said she could not estimate how many people were being 
taking away many people it is many more than when the foreigners 
were here she said 
upon arriving in chengdu tourists said tibetans had become 
increasingly scared after the imposition of martial law 
people begged us repeatedly over the last few days tell the 
world help us please said one american from new orleans who 
spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of chinese reprisals 
they grab your hand and say help us and they cry said a 
west german woman 
a group of tourists that flew to chengdu issued a statement they 
said would be sent to the united nations and to the dalai lama who 
lives in exile in india 
it is our urgent and heartfelt wish that the world community 
should carefully and critically examine the causes of this conflict 
and the methods and motives of the authorities said the statement 
while the tibetan demonstrators became violent and destructive 
in expressing their anger and frustration we feel the magnitude and 
bloodiness of the crisis has been caused by the incompetence of the 
authorities 
shootings by the authorities have been excessive 
unpredictable indiscriminate and there have on occasion been 
atrocities it said 
staterun radio reported the four additional deaths and said the 
people died in the hospital during emergency lifesaving 
procedures the report did not say whether the dead were tibetans 
foreigners say some tibetans claim as many as 100 people were 
killed by police although those claims could not be confirmed 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing in a weekly briefing 
denied chinese authorities were violating the human rights of 
tibetans 
recently a handful of separatists committed beating smashing 
looting and burning in a deliberate attempt to start a riot li 
said these violent incidents aimed at splitting the motherland 
were a serious breach of law it is not a question of human rights 
religion or nationality 
li also blamed the disturbances on the clique of the dalai 
lama 
during the riots thousands of tibetans rampaged through the 
streets and ransacked chineseowned shops on wednesday travelers 
reported seeing police dragging tibetans out of their homes and 
hauling them away in trucks 
the official chinese media has given no figures on arrests but 
the communist partys official peoples daily reported from lhasa 
how police raided one home and dragged a screaming man outside they 
then went next door and found a man hiding under a blanket 
the mans wife was quoted as saying hurry up and dress and go 
with them i told you not to take part in the riots but you just 
had to do it 
chinas official xinhua news agency meanwhile accused tibetan 
separatists living abroad of smuggling weapons into tibet and 
instigating the riots 
foreign travelers said they saw no signs of tibetans firing on 
police 
xinhua said the tibetan separatist clique based abroad has 
recently sent its men into tibet under the guise of tourists to 
incite riots and they have also smuggled weapons into the region 
it was an apparent reference to the followers of the dalai lama 
who fled tibet following a failed uprising against chinas army in 
march 1959 
friday is the 30th anniversary of that rebellion and martial law 
was imposed in part to prevent further antichinese demonstrations 
on that day 
the dalai lama in a statement marking the anniversary praised 
the tibetan struggle and condemned chinese oppression 
no amount of repression however brutal and violent can 
silence the voice of freedom and justice he said

the warsaw pact today proposed sweeping 
reductions in troops and conventional weapons but gave a stern 
warning to nato that its plans to modernize nuclear weapons could 
disrupt arms control efforts 
a warsaw pact position paper given to reporters sets a goal of 
making both military alliances strictly defensive by the year 
2000 after gradual reductions in troops and weapons 
oleg a grinevski the soviet ambassador to the new talks on 
reducing conventional weapons outlined the warsaw pact proposals at 
the start of the negotiations involving the 23 nato and warsaw pact 
nations 
separate talks on closer eastwest relations also began today in 
vienna those talks involve the 35 nations including the soviet 
union and united states that signed the 1975 helsinki accords on 
human rights 
grinevski stressed the warsaw pacts opposition to a western 
proposal to upgrade 700 lance nuclear missiles to double their range 
to about 150 miles the missiles are mostly in west germany 
reading a prepared statement grinevski declared it should be 
clearly understood that good will has its limits we have made quite 
a few major unilateral steps 
he referred to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
announcement to pull out about 50000 men and their weaponry from 
east germany czechoslovakia and hungary during the next two years 
and pledges by other soviet bloc countries to scale down their 
armies and defense budgets 
let no one cherish the hope that our profound internal changes 
will be making us more malleable and agreeable to unreasonable 
demands or inflated bids grinevski said 
judging by the warsaw pact presentation and prior nato proposals 
the two alliances differ substantially on how and what reduce and 
to what extent 
the 16member north atlantic treaty organization proposes deep 
cuts in battle tanks artillery pieces and armored personnel 
carriers it says the sevenmember warsaw pact has a 2to1 edge in 
such equipment 
the warsaw pact paper proposes three stages of reducing personnel 
and arms up to the year 2000 
from 1991 to 1994 participants would eliminate imbalances and 
asymmetries between the alliances and would take steps to 
eliminate the capability to launch a surprise attack or initiate a 
largescale offensive action the amount of arms the alliances are 
allowed to maintain would be reduced by about 15 percent according 
to the warsaw pact 
from 1994 to 1997 the bloc proposed reductions of armed forces 
by 25 percent or 500000 men 
in the last stage the armed forces of the nato and warsaw pact 
nations should be given a strictly defensive character 
according to the paper 
it included combat aircraft among the weapons to be cut but nato 
is unwilling to discuss the inclusion of combat aircraft at this 
point 
nato has proposed overall limits of 40000 tanks on both sides 
33000 artillery peices overall and 56000 troop carriers it also 
proposed a limit of 12000 tanks 10000 artillery pieces and 16800 
armored troop carriers for any one nation 
weaponry stationed outside ones home country would be limited to 
32000 tanks 1700 artillery pieces and 6000 armored troop 
carriers in each bloc according to nato proposals 
britains foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said this would 
cut soviet tanks and artillery in europe by twothirds and armored 
troop carriers by more than 50 percent 
the united states and most other nato countries have ruled out 
negotiations on nuclear or even dualcapable weapons system stating 
that they are not included in the mandate for the new arms talks 
but grinevski said the more agreement we shall have on the 
conventional side the more are necessary steps measures or 
negotiations concerning other types of security tactical nuclear 
weapons and their modernization and the naval situation 
nuclear weapons are not on the agenda but they exist around 
us its impossible to close our eyes to that im just warning 
about that nothing more he said 
the arms control negotiations replace and expand the mutual and 
balanced force reduction talks which ended without agreement after 
15 years 
the new talks called the negotiations on conventional armed 
forces in europe come during a time of improved relations between 
the superpowers and are expected to produce results

more than 1000 musicians actors and other artists 
gathered to lobby the legislature to restore 19 million in arts 
funding to the state budget saying culture returns more than that 
to the state 
they argued that jobs ticket sales tourism and enrichment of 
schools and communities justify full state funding for the 
massachusetts council on the arts and humanities 
in a rally outside the statehouse on wednesday they brandished 
signs that said dont stop the music and keep the arts alive 
the state house of representatives is debating a 123 billion 
budget proposal for next year that eliminates 19 million proposed 
by gov michael s dukakis for the council which makes grants to 
dozens of cultural institutions and individual artists 
the legislature is considering a nofrills budget because the 
current fiscal year is expected to end up at least 600 million in 
the red since anticipated corporate tax revenue has not materialized 
democratic house leaders retreating from the zero funding 
recommended by the house ways and means committee two weeks ago 
have decided to support a plan that would tap the state lottery 
commissions prize money to restore 95 million to the council 
but arts advocates want restoration of full funding arguing that 
the money spent on the arts more than pays for itself last year 
arts funding yielded 23 million in state taxes they said 
culture is good business and the economic impact is 
substantial said nancy finkelstein executive director of the 
massachusetts cultural alliance 
holly sidford executive director of the new england foundation 
for the arts said her group has compiled statistics that show 
nonprofit arts groups contributed 12 billion to the states 
economy she said arts organizations employed 20000 people and 
served 20 million ticket buyers five times the number who attended

a top vatican cardinal addressing american 
catholic leaders accused bishops of allowing their authority to be 
usurped by academic experts officials said today 
cardinal joseph ratzinger head of the powerful congregation for 
the doctrine of the faith appealed to the americans attending a 
special vatican meeting to assert their authority and be martyrs 
for church teaching 
some us bishops countered that compromising on some church 
issues should not be seen as weakness as long as matters of 
faith are not sacrificed 
the issue of the us bishops role was at the center of an 
extraordinary meeting involving 35 american catholic leaders 
summoned by pope john paul ii to discuss the independentminded 
american flock 
the vatican has criticized american catholics dissent from rome 
on matters such as artificial birth control and divorce 
at the meetings opening session ratzinger charged that in many 
places theological experts have expressed their own ideas through 
the mass media he said they have taken the place of bishops as 
teachers causing a growing insecurity and disorientation among 
the faithful 
bishops he said were pressured to be administrators rather than 
strong champions of church doctrine 
bishops have fully adapted themselves to this regulative model 
little defending their magisterial authority over that of 
theological experts the west german cardinal said according to a 
summary of his speech 
those who announce the gospel must also be martyrs in the most 
profound sense of the word he said 
ratzingers speech wednesday evening was to set the vaticans 
tone for this weeks fourday meeting according to church 
officials vatican spokesman joaquin navarro and the rev john 
lynch secretary of the us national conference of bishops briefed 
reporters today on the closed session 
in opening remarks at the meeting archbishop john l may 
president of the us bishops conference said americans would not 
put up with an authoritarian approach from the church 
other bishops led by archbishop john roach of minneapolisst 
paul responded to ratzingers speech by saying that giveandtake 
in the american church did not endanger catholicism 
several bishops said that in the united states compromise as 
long as youre not giving away the store is not in and of itself 
a bad word or a bad process said lynch 
the bishops he said declared that to keep the dialogue open 
which can sometimes be read as weakness but which in our american 
experience often leads to a good end should not be seen as 
weakness 
while it can be risky it does sometimes lead to the successful 
conclusion of problems between bishops and theological experts or 
between the church hierarchy and the faithful the bishops said 
according to lynch 
the vatican has billed this weeks encounter as a series of open 
discussions of issues raised during the popes 1987 us visit and 
periodic bishops trips to rome 
on wednesday evening cardinal john oconnor of new york said 
there were no expressed disagreements to the speech by ratzinger 
or one he gave on the bishops role 
however several of the bishops statements drove home the 
contention of some americans that vatican criticism stems in part 
from a lack of understanding of the us church 
speaking of us society at wednesdays meeting may said 
authoritarianism is suspect in any area of learning or culture 
individual freedom is prized supremely religious doctrine and moral 
teaching are widely judged by these criteria 
therefore to assert that there is a church teaching with 
authority binding and loosing for eternity is truly a sign of 
contradiction to many americans who consider the divine right of 
bishops as outmoded as the divine right of kings said may of st 
louis 
in his speech oconnor said us bishops had been fulfilling 
their teaching role 
i explained my personal conviction that for 200 years the 
bishops of the united states have demonstrated their commitment as 
teachers too often they are dismissed simply as fundraisers or 
schoolbuilders he said in an interview wednesday night he said 
however that it was not the vatican but us critics who made those 
charges 
a conflict appeared to develop between the vatican and the us 
bishops over releasing texts of speeches from the closed sessions 
the vatican released mays opening remarks but not the speeches by 
oconnor or ratzinger 
vatican officials prevailed today issuing summaries of the 
speeches

an artists haunting surrealist paintings 
went on view today as a tribute from his friends who wont let his 
art die despite his tragic life and death 
colleagues liken john wicklunds work to early efforts by 
salvador dali and compare his tragic life and premature death to 
vincent van goghs 
they arranged for the monthlong exhibit of wicklunds works at a 
gallery here about 40 miles north of chicago 
his art showed very lonely always abandoned houses his best 
friend francis smolinski said wednesday to him they were 
buildings that had a lot of love at one time now they were empty 
ready to be torn down 
wicklunds art imitated his life up to the day he died sometime 
between dec 20 and dec 30 smolinski said 
although he had just been released from an alcohol detoxification 
center wicklund was depressed and dejected when he stopped by 
smolinskis house in gurnee on dec 20 the friend said he suffered 
from a lack of inspiration and grieved over his sister in 
california who was comatose and near death smolinski said 
after wicklund left smolinski became alarmed and spent 10 days 
searching for his friend smolinski finally found wicklunds frozen 
body beneath a tree in a nearby stand of woods with vodka bottles 
scattered around 
lynn schornick director of the jack benny center for the arts 
called the exhibit of wicklunds watercolors and drawings haunting 
and disturbing 
i think theres no denying he had a real genius schornick 
said almost none of the works have any people in them and the 
windows you cant see in them at all theres simply no one 
home 
wicklund won a number of art contests and was an active member of 
the lake county art league 
he had this facade of humor and his work was just the 
antithesis of that solemn serious said ed kanwischer an art 
professor who said wicklund often sat in on his classes at the 
college of lake county 
i knew he was doomed to die you know like van gogh 
kanwischer said 
he said he and other league members organized the exhibit and 
plan to auction off some works to raise money for a grave marker 
we just felt his death shouldnt be the end he said

propane gas accidentally injected into a 
city water line caused three toilets to explode in separate 
buildings injuring three people authorities said 
ive never seen the like or heard of anything like this 
fire chief roy wayne moseley said wednesday things come and 
things go but when a man sees water burning maybe its time to 
go 
he said an accidental hookup allowed the propane to enter the 
water system from a pressurized railroad tank car at a company that 
uses water to clean railroad cars flushing released bubbles of the 
highly flammable gas 
he said each explosion was set off by either a space heater or 
a hotwater tank or some source of open flame near the toilet there 
was an ignition source nearby in each case 
peronie weathers said he was sleeping tuesday afternoon when he 
heard his 15yearold daughter retha scream 
when she flushed it boom i heard her calling daddy come 
here daddy come here the house is on fire weathers said 
retha was treated at dallas county hospital and released 
weathers said he lost everything in the fire when there is no 
time to get your britches and shoes thats bad he said 
wendell rex wells 48 said he heard a strange bubbling sound 
coming from a toilet at the benton casket manufacturing co where 
he works and touched the tank lid 
whomp the commode burst into flames he said the blast 
slammed the bathroom door and set fire to the room and his clothing 
he was hospitalized in little rock 
another young woman was in fair condition in a little rock 
hospital after an explosion at her home 
moseley said the improper hookup was made at transitank corp 
which cleans and refurbishes railroad cars and routinely works on 
cars carrying propane 
when they have propane in a car they have to bleed that off and 
pull it through a tower and burn it off he said then they 
inject steam water and air into the car to clean it we have 
determined through investigation that there was a crossover hookup 
we believe by accident that actually brought propane from a 
pressurized car into the water system

author who attended the meeting told the associated press israel

the state court of appeals has upheld a law 
denying a golf course property tax break to the prestigious burning 
tree club unless it accepts women as members 
the private club at bethesda in marylands washington suburbs has 
historically numbered congressmen cabinet officials and us 
supreme court justices among its members 
the tax break which applies to both state and county taxes 
allows clubs to pay a special rate by agreeing to maintain a golf 
course as open space and not use it for commercial or residential 
development 
the 1986 law on accepting women was declared unconstitutional 
july 22 1987 by anne arundel circuit judge martin a wolff 
because of a provision allowing clubs to exclude certain sexes on 
specific days or at specific times he said the entire law was 
invalid because that one section violated the states equal rights 
amendment 
the states highest court on wednesday agreed that the exemption 
allowing discrimination on certain days or certain times was 
unconstitutional but said that didnt invalidate the entire law 
as a result clubs accepting the preferential tax treatment will 
have to admit women and cant set aside times or days exclusively 
for men or women 
burning tree is the only maryland club maintaining a menonly 
membership policy that takes advantage of the property tax break 
court records showed that for the 198687 tax year burning tree 
saved about 300000 in state and local taxes under the open space 
tax exemption 
robert zarnoch an assistant state attorney general said other 
clubs in maryland claim the preferred tax rate while setting aside 
tee times for men or women 
james dunbar a lawyer who represented burning tree before the 
appeals court said he had not had time to read and digest the 52 
majority opinion and dissent and couldnt comment on whether there 
will be a further appeal

the commander of the 5th brigade 
has been relieved of his post as a result of an investigation into 
the massacre of 10 peasants military and government sources said 
today 
the sources who declined to be identified pending announcement 
of the probes conclusions said the removal is not final but they 
said it was unlikely col jose chavez caceres would be reinstated as 
commander of the 5th brigade based in san vicente 40 miles east of 
san salvador 
chavez is not suspected of direct involvement in the slayings 
the sources said his whereabouts were unknown 
his responsibility appears to be limited to believing his 
subordinates when they tried to cover up the armys role said one 
source 
according to relatives neighbors and witnesses the massacre 
took place on sept 21 when soldiers from the 5th brigades jiboa 
battalion marched into san francisco a hamlet of about 15 families 
in san vicente province 
the soldiers detained most of the residents in a oneroom school 
and accused them of collaborating with leftist guerrillas 
working from a list the troopers separated seven men and three 
women and took them to a nearby ravine they tied them up with 
strips of green fabric and killed them with explosives either 
grenades or captured guerrilla mines and rifle fire according to 
the witnesses 
the army at first said the 10 corpses discovered in the ravine 
were guerrillas killed in an army ambush then it said they were 
detainees who while being marched away from san francisco were 
killed in a guerrilla ambush 
three officers who were in san francisco the day of the killings 
have been detained and at least one will be indicted on murder 
charges this month by san sebastian judge alcides guandique 
according to sources close to the case 
if such an indictment takes place it would be the first time an 
army officer has ever been indicted for politically motivated 
killing of noncombatants in el salvadors 9yearold civil war

former education secretary william bennetts 
nomination to head the war against drugs sailed through the senate 
judiciary committee today and lawmakers planned to take it right to 
the floor for confirmation 
i have no doubt hell grab the job and run with it and really 
do a very good job sen orrin hatch rutah said as the panel 
voted 131 for bennett 
sen paul simon dill an ally of teacher groups was the lone 
dissenter saying bennett had sought a cut in the drug education 
budget in his previous post and that his record as an administrator 
at the department was not strong 
my fear is that were going to have a lot of visibility and not 
much action i hope im wrong simon said 
lawmakers were shooting for a lateafternoon senate floor vote on 
bennett although they said scheduling problems could sidetrack it 
even before his confirmation bennetts responsibilities were 
increasing with president bush handing him the politically volatile 
issue of whether to ban the sale of semiautomatic weapons 
bennett met wednesday with national rifle association 
representatives to seek input and advice said bennett spokesman 
don hamilton im rather confident he has not made up his mind 
bennett whose designated job often has been referred to as 
drug czar can now add the title gun czar joked hamilton 
hes not too upset about it really he said 
but although he hasnt made up his mind whether assault weapons 
should be banned bennetts eventual stance is certain to prompt 
some disagreement in the white house bush a member of the national 
rifle association has said he opposes a ban while first lady 
barbara bush supports one 
a host of drugrelated shootings and the killing of five 
california schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on the 
assaultstyle weapons 
bennett is concerned with the problem and hed like to seek a 
solution thats consonant with the constitution and individuals 
rights concerning firearms but he doesnt want to see that 
firepower in the hands of drug traffickers and other bad guys 
hamilton said 
the issue came up at bennetts confirmation hearings last week 
when sen edward m kennedy asked him about a memo he wrote last 
year when he was education secretary 
in the march 14 1988 memo to thenattorney general edwin meese 
iii bennett asked meese to consider supporting legislation to 
better manage the production importation and sale of automatic 
weapons and other firearms as sought by the major law enforcement 
organizations 
bennett hesitated when asked during the hearings whether he now 
supports legislation limiting access to weapons such as modified 
ak47s and uzis the tightly regulated military versions can be 
switched easily back and forth from semiautomatic to automatic 
he told the committee his decision on that issue would be part of 
the national drug control strategy due 180 days after he takes 
office 
i will admit a personal reservation about private ownership of 
ak47s bennett told the committee im not a gun owner the 
president knows i have my concerns 
asked by committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel whether 
he believes theres a correlation between easy access to weapons and 
the violence of drug dealing bennett said i dont think theres 
any doubt about it 
however he added you still have to take the peoples right to 
bear arms seriously 
he left open the possibility that he may ultimately disagree with 
bushs opposition to a ban 
the fact that its been spoken about by the president does not 
mean its off the table bennett said at the hearings 
bush said at a news conference tuesday that he discussed the 
testimony with bennett afterward 
i told bill i said look i dont worry about what you said 
up there bush said i said i can identify with what was 
behind your thinking on that very very easily id like to find 
some accommodation 
bush said that if bennett comes up with a sensible proposal 
ill take a hard look at it

the client got off with a suspended 
sentence but the fellow who said he was the attorney was booked and 
jailed 
fancy legal talk may have contributed to clifford johns arrest 
wednesday in jefferson county court after he claimed to be a lawyer 
although not all attorneys are terribly articulate this one 
was worse than the average said judge robert morris he used 
big words that had no meaning within the sentences they were used 
even our worst attorneys dont do that 
authorities say they still arent sure just what legal 
credentials john has but they said they do know hes not a licensed 
attorney in colorado 
john 37 appeared in court with his client feb 24 but asked for 
a continuance morris then checked state records and found that 
johns attorney number actually belonged to a woman who is an 
assistant colorado attorney general 
when john came to the sentencing he started talking and he 
still didnt sound very much like an attorney morris said 
johns client who faced a drunken driving charge was ordered to 
pay 320 in court costs and was given a suspended 500 fine and a 
suspended 180day jail sentence 
the 20yearold defendant monte castaneda received the minimum 
sentence which morris said was not affected by john castaneda did 
not pay attorneys fees said mark pautler chief deputy district 
attorney 
john formerly a salesman for the denver department stores 
apparently had an office in denver it does appear from looking at 
his appointment books that he has additional clients pautler said 
john booked in jefferson county jail on 5000 bond was 
scheduled to make his next court appearance today facing possible 
charges of criminal impersonation and forgery

two british soldiers were killed 
and six wounded near londonderry when their jeeps were blown apart 
by a land mine that shattered windows half a mile away police said 
today 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack 
shortly before midnight wednesday but suspicion fell on the irish 
republican army which is fighting british rule in northern ireland 
police said today they had arrested two men but did not identify 
them 
home secretary douglas hurd the british cabinet member 
responsible for law and order said wednesday an ira unit was at 
large on the british mainland 
his announcement followed the discovery of an arms and explosives 
cache near scarborough in northeast england where prime minister 
margaret thatcher will address a conference of the national council 
of her governing conservative party next week the discovery of the 
weapons prompted news media speculation that the ira might be 
planning a second bid to kill her 
sgt john brown a spokesman at police headquarters in belfast 
said the attack on the soldiers occurred just outside londonderry 
northern irelands second largest city two miles from the border 
with the republic of ireland 
he said an army patrol in two armored jeeps was traveling north 
on a main road leading from londonderry when the land mine buried in 
an embankment beside the road was detonated the second of the two 
jeeps caught the full blast 
police estimated 400 pounds of explosive were used 
the blast blew in windows up to half a mile away and was 
reportedly heard up to 30 miles away 
the army identified the dead soldiers thursday as miles daniel 
amos 18 and stephen geoffrey cummins 24 
the command wire was found leading to a nearby industrial estate 
from where the bomber would have had a clear view of the road brown 
said 
mrs thatcher survived an ira bomb attack on oct 12 1984 in 
which five people died during the conservatives annual convention 
at the south coast resort of brighton the blast partly demolished 
the hotel where she many of her cabinet and many other prominent 
conservatives were staying 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the 95 percent catholic republic of ireland 
under socialist rule

a water main break cut off water to millions 
of people in northern new jersey this morning forcing officials to 
close schools and seek help from the national guard 
the break in the 52inch main occurred at 5 am between the two 
main plants of the hackensack water co according to company 
spokeswoman martha green water began flowing again to most of the 
companys customers about 930 am but it was at very low pressure 
and residents were being urged to boil drinking water 
ken madden of the bergen county emergency management office 
said national guard tankers were brought to the armory in teaneck 
where water would be distributed to those who need it 
the company supplies water to 750000 customers or several 
million people in most of bergen county and in the northern part of 
hudson county officials said 
the flow of water from the huge main which washed out part of 
new milford avenue here was shut off by about 725 am officials 
said most of the water flowed back into the nearby hackensack river 
and did not threaten homes 
bob weiner a water company spokesman said work crews isolated 
the damaged pipe by about 9 am closing valves near it and routing 
water through other pipes about a halfhour later the water began 
flowing but it would take several hours to build enough pressure to 
return service to normal he said 
in the meantime he recommended that residents boil tap water for 
at least a few minutes before using it since some contaminants may 
have gotten into the pipelines during the break 
while most customers were beginning to get lowpressure water 
weiner said an unknown number still had service cut off entirely 
gov thomas kean toured the site of the break this morning 
bergen county superintendent of schools ray kelly canceled 
classes at all county public schools except for three districts not 
served by hackensack water co

the supreme court today refused to decide the issue 
of whether a fetus has constitutional rights saying it will not 
deal with the question while the country has no abortion law 
the court in a 70 ruling said deciding the issue is not in 
the public interest due to the potential uncertainty that could 
result in the absence of abortion legislation 
canada has been without an abortion law since january 1988 when 
the supreme court struck down as unconstitutional canadas 
restrictions on abortion the lack of a new law has brought 
abortionondemand to many cities and led to angry protests by 
antiabortion groups 
todays ruling was the result of a case brought last year by 
antiabortion activist joe borowski 
borowski in winnipeg with a bottle of chilled champagne ready to 
celebrate said instead hed dump it down the toilet or spike it and 
send it to the judges im shocked and disgusted and dismayed 
he said 
in its eightpage ruling the court said the government should 
have moved last year to quash the case 
failure to do so has resulted in needless expense for 
borowski it said and it ordered the government to pay his costs 
karen murawsky a lobbyist for the antiabortionist campaign life 
coalition agreed the court hasnt protected the fetus but she said 
it hasnt ruled the fetus doesnt deserve protection either she 
hopes for a new law 
the federal government doesnt need the guidance of the supreme 
court to bring in a good law ms murawsky said 
norma scaraborough of the canadian abortion rights action league 
told reporters shes pleased with the decision and hopes the 
government will see we can carry on the way we are and we can 
leave the situation the way it is

young people from the united states canada and 
west germany will help soviets serve big macs and french fries to 
muscovites when the golden arches go up a few blocks from red square 
next year pravda said thursday 
the communist party daily newspaper which usually fills its 
columns with the latest official political announcements printed a 
quarterpage article headlined will the big mac debut soon 
alongside was a drawing of the trademark golden arches above the 
words moskva mcdonalds 
we very much want to open the first restaurant at years end or 
at the latest in the first quarter of next year said vladimir i 
malishkov chief of the food service administration of the moscow 
city council 
first the company must finish building its own factory in moscow 
to make ingredients said george a cohon president of mcdonalds 
restaurants of canada ltd 
foreigners will be flipping burgers and serving shakes alongside 
soviet workers when the 650seat restaurant opens on gorky street 
near red square cohon told pravda twenty restaurants are planned 
in the country 
the article made it clear that muscovites deserve a break from 
substandard food service but indicated a mcdonalds fast food 
restaurant is still a dream 
soviets often must settle for tasteless food in dingy cafeterias 
or from outdoor vendors in lessthansanitary conditions 
the article temptingly described the ease yet unknown to 
soviets of being able to give an order and within moments walk 
away from the counter with appetizing food packaged in pretty 
plastic containers 
the hamburgers are not only tasty they melt in your mouth 
pravda said 
the inside of the restaurant is a kingdom of cleanliness and 
coziness and they do it all for you pravda said mimicking one 
of mcdonalds advertising slogans 
but pravda reminded soviets they have been promised better food 
service many times 
alas the miracle hasnt happened will it happen this time 
pravda asked 
in april cohon and malishkov signed the joint venture agreement 
to open mcdonalds restaurants in the soviet union the agreement 
gave mcdonalds of canada a 49 percent share in the 
sovietcontrolled firm 
at the time officials said soviets would be able to buy a big 
mac for about 3

extravagant sporty cars with powerful engines and 
fancy technical frills are headline items at the 1989 geneva motor 
show reflecting the auto industrys buoyant confidence 
organizers of the annual show which opened thursday and runs 
until march 19 cite the worldwide comeback of the toppriced sports 
car and renewed competition in the compact model range as this 
years major themes 
billed as the european show most representative of the global 
industry geneva is considered a prime testing ground for automakers 
because of switzerlands liberal import policy and lack of a 
domestic industry which make it a highly competitive market 
opel volkswagen and toyota were the topselling makes in 
switzerland last year followed by ford europe fiat and frances 
peugeot 
the industrys optimism is evident after low oil prices and a 
continuing economic boom in western countries spurred world car 
production to its fourth straight record high last year 
the show appears aimed at western europe where environmental 
worries had an impact on the car industry through the mid1980s 
but that concern seems to be waning the european community has 
launched a drive to cut harmful exhaust emissions and use of 
pollutionreducing catalytic converters though hardly universal is 
rising 
at geneva mercedes unveiled its revived sl roadster series 
aimed at recapturing affluent buyers from its west german rival bmw 
whose 7series is considered the leader in the upscale market 
bmws display featured the m5 a model introduced last fall with 
a 315horsepower sixcylinder engine 
not to be outdone general motors corp offered an updated 
corvette sports model with a 32valve v8 the corvette zr1 is 
expected to cost about 50000 gm officials have not said when the 
zr1 will go on sale in the united states or europe 
porsche the west german maker of prestige sports cars 
highlighted a new automatic tire pressure monitoring system in its 
topoftheline 928s4 model which lists for 74900 
volvo of sweden offered a heated steering wheel for its 
higherpriced cars 
recognizing the continuing vast market potential for affordable 
compact cars especially in europe ford motor cos west german 
division premiered a complete revamp of its successful fiesta 
hatchback of which more than 45 million have been built since 1976 
main innovations include fourdoor models more passenger space 
and an updated body prices have remained stable ranging from about 
8200 for the basic models to 12500 for a sporty threedoor 
swiss president jeanpascal delamuraz said in opening the 59th 
show that the event was a convincing denial of a clash between

a major underground nuclear weapons test 
rocked the nevada desert at dawn today unleashing a shock felt atop 
some las vegas hotelcasinos 85 miles away authorities said 
the test carried a force of 20 to 150 kilotons the highest 
allowed under test limitation treaties and created a shock that 
registered 51 on the richter scale of ground motion all us tests 
are listed as either less than 20 kilotons or as 20 to 150 kilotons 
thirteen protesters demonstrated at the main entrance to the 
desert site and 11 were arrested for trespassing 
the test conducted at 605 am was 55 minutes earlier than 
originally scheduled to take advantage of more favorable wind 
conditions according to energy department spokesman jim boyer 
the test codenamed ingot was the third conducted at the nevada 
test site this year the nuclear device was buried in a shaft 1600 
feet beneath the surface of yucca flat 
boyer speaking from a control point 15 miles from ground zero 
reported considerable ground motion at the time of detonation 
the seismograph needle is swinging wildly from side to side 
boyer said video cameras on the ground are getting quite a jolt 
the situation appears normal boyer said watching monitors 
at the control building it doesnt look like there were any 
problems whatsoever 
boyer said test controllers reported a subsidence at ground zero 
44 minutes after the blast a subsidence or ground collapse is a 
favorable sign because it indicates the test cavity has been sealed 
preventing any leak of radioactive gases 
motion from the blast was recorded by monitors atop some 
highrise hotelcasinos in las vegas but telephone operators at the 
resorts reported receiving no calls from guests inquiring about the 
blast 
waverly person a spokesman at the national earthquake 
information center in golden colo said the 51 richter scale 
reading was not as high as some previous tests the richter scale is 
a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake a quake magnitude 
of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated area 
the test was the 690th announced shot since testing began in 
nevada in january 1951 twelve tests were conducted in 1988 it was 
conducted under the sponsorship of lawrencelivermore laboratories

two men pleaded guilty today to trying to 
bribe former navy officials in one case buying an officials 
condominium in idaho for an inflated price in an attempt to 
influence decisions on lucrative pentagon contracts 
us attorney henry hudson said the pleas from charles f 
gardner a former vice president of unisys corp and james g neal 
a private consultant for unisys will move this investigation 
forward at a tremendous pace 
he called the pleas as well as one from kenneth f brooke a 
significant development in the 2yearold investigation into 
fraud in the defense departments purchasing procedures the case 
has focused on allegations that companies tried to manipulate the 
system by using consultants to pay bribes for inside information 
about contracts 
gardner 58 who worked until march 1988 for a unisys division in 
great neck ny appeared before us district judge claude hylton 
in a packed courtroom 
guilty guilty guilty he said in a strong voice when asked 
how he pleaded to charges of bribery conspiracy to file false 
statements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false tax 
return 
gardner is a key figure whose cooperation could be significant in 
helping prosecutors make major cases in the longrunning 
investigation todays charges link him directly to melvyn paisley 
the former assistant secretary of the navy for research engineering 
and systems and to date the highestranking official publicly 
identified in the case 
gardner also has ties to a group of firms and individuals on long 
island whose offices have been searched by the fbi the government 
has said it is looking into possible extortion of campaign 
contributions to congressmen in the long island segment of the 
investigation 
documents provided by prosecutors said gardner sought to bribe 
paisley by arranging for the purchase of paisleys condominiium at 
the sun valley idaho ski resort in august 1986 
gardner instructed james g neal that the condominium was to be 
purchased for 149000 and that no negotiation or attempts to lower 
the price were to be undertaken even though the unit was 
overprice hudson said in a statement the condominium was 
subsequently sold for 100000 
hudson said the condominium purchase at an inflated price was 
designed to influence paisleys actions on two pentagon contracts 
sought by unisys the prosecutor refused to say what paisley did on 
unisys behalf paisley has not been charged with any crime 
in another case gardner caused the campaign committees of rep 
roy dyson dmd and former rep bill chappell dfla to receive 
illegal campaign contributions of 1000 each hudson said 
in addition gardner caused unisys to make and present a false 
claim to the departments of navy and air force for services not 
performed he said

in the ongoing investigation faces up to 23 years in prison and 
fines of up to 750000

and conspiring to defraud the government by concealing his true 
taxable income he faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of

the debate over preserving the ozone layer 
dramatizes the gap between the industrialized west which pledges to 
clean up pollutants it no longer needs and developing nations that 
are just beginning to use them 
prodded by increasing scientific evidence that 
chlorofluorocarbons known as cfcs are destroying the ozone shield 
the west has promised to ban or significantly reduce their use by 
the end of the century 
third world countries do not dispute the facts and figures but 
are just embarking on largescale expansion of refrigeration air 
conditioning plastics and electronics industries most of which 
depend on cfcs 
this raises a major moral problem in the west australias 
science minister acknowledged at an international conference in 
london this week on the ozone layer which filters out 
cancercausing ultraviolet rays from the sun 
can we ask the developed world to adopt lower standards of 
convenience and amenity than we do asked the minister barry 
jones 
the dispute recalls the 1960s debate over the insecticide ddt 
the west discovered it was harmful to both plants and animals and 
imposed bans or restrictions in 197071 against the wishes of 
developing nations which feared a resurgence of diseasecarrying 
insects 
another environmental issue dividing the west from the third 
world is the dumping of toxic waste 
president daniel arap moi of kenya told the london conference 
that recent dumpings in africa of toxic chemicals from industrial 
countries were unfriendly actions equivalent to declaring war 
on the earths ecosystem 
on the ozone issue developing countries demand western help in 
financing any switch from cfcs to safe substitutes 
the chemicals developed in the united states more than 50 years 
ago as the working fluid for refrigerators also are used in 
aerosols fastfood packaging and computer solvents about 12 
million tons are produced annually more than 76 percent in the 
united states and european economic community 
when cfcs reach the stratosphere 1525 miles up as much as 100 
years after emission they break apart and their chlorine atoms 
deplete the fragile ozone layer cfcs also trap heat increasing 
earths temperature in a process known as the greenhouse effect 
the adverse effects are going to be more serious for developing 
countries due to their geographical situation and limited ability to 
fund defensive strategies said physicist mohammed ilyas of the 
university of science of malaysia 
in 1977 the united states announced it was phasing out the use 
of cfcs in aerosols canada norway and sweden followed suit 
washington now says it will ban all cfcs by 1999 if safe 
substitutes become available the 12nation eec has agreed to a 
similar timetable but its environment commissioner carlo ripa di 
meana wants an earlier target 
australia plans a phaseout by 1998 and japan says it will agree 
to a ban if other countries do the soviet union says it needs more 
scientific evidence of the damage 
thirtyone countries have ratified the 1987 montreal protocol 
requiring the amount of cfcs to be cut in half by 1999 their 
representatives will meet in helsinki finland in may for the first 
full review of the treaty 
another 20 countries have agreed to sign up but china india and 
brazil with rapidly growing populations are not among them they 
have urged western nations to create a fund to help them acquire 
technology to replace cfcs but insist the money not be deducted 
from existing aid 
any reduction in these resources for whatever reasons would 
mean that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer for 
the promised freedom from hunger and poverty said zr ansari 
indias environment minister the poor are no more prepared to 
wait and there will be social upheaval if they are asked to wait any 
longer 
chinas environment commissioner liu ming pu told the 
conference his nation of 11 billion people uses less than 2 percent 
of the worlds cfcs 
western nations say the potential for cfc use in the developing 
world is enormous and could wipe out any cuts made by industrial 
countries 
even if all cfcs were banned immediately scientists estimate two 
centuries would be needed to repair the damage 
the west wants developing countries to bypass cfcs and move 
directly to safe substitutes which still being developed and may be 
more expensive 
considerable sympathy was evident at the conference for the third 
world argument which britains prince charles called a powerful 
one 
jones the australian minister said if his country was entitled 
to a refrigerator in each of its 4 million households then it 
ought to be appropriate for 250 to 300 million chinese households

the government today denied reports that a japanese 
manufacturer in line to make a new version of the f16 fighter jet 
was involved in construction of what washington says is a libyan 
chemical weapons plant 
i have said in this forum again and again that we have made a 
thorough study on this problem we found that there was no 
evidence that japanese companies have been involved in this 
project said foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe 
i can now confirm that mitsubishi heavy industries has never 
been engaged in the export of equipment or dispatch of engineers as 
reported in the detroit news watanabe added 
the detroit news on wednesday quoted unidentified us 
congressional and defense department sources as saying they had been 
told of mitsubishis alleged participation in the libyan project by 
intelligence sources in washington kyodo news service carried a 
similar report today 
mitsubishi in a news conference today also denied the reports 
in washington marlin fitzwater a spokesman for president bush 
said we continue to investigate this matter 
at the same time he said the japanese government has given us 
assurances that there is no intention of any japanese involvement 
with the libyan project and has denied emphatically any involvement 
by mitsubishi heavy industries technicians or engineers in the 
libyan chemical project 
the reports said intelligence sources had told a closeddoor 
session of the senate foreign relations committee that 50 japanese 
technicians and engineers were at a chemical complex in the desert 
south of the libyan capital of tripoli to install metalmachining 
equipment used to make bomb canisters for poison gas 
libya denies the plant is for making chemical weapons saying 
that it is a pharmaceuticals factory 
on wednesday state department spokesman charles redman said the 
department had no evidence mitsubishi had helped to install 
equipment at the plant 
watanabe said japan had conveyed its findings to washington 
through regular communications channels 
from the statement made by mr redman i take it they have 
accepted our information he said 
he then read a statement that said 
through the exchange of information between the us government 
and japan the following views are fully shared by the two 
governments 
according to the investigation of the government of japan so 
far there is no information indicating that japanese firms were 
involved in libyas production of chemical weapons agents and its 
facilities 
the kyodo report said the allegations against mitsubishi were 
expected to spur congressional moves to persuade the us 
government to scrap a plan for general dynamics to provide 
mitsubishi with high technology to build japans new fighter 
jet called the fsx a version of the us f16 
mitsubishi is involved in a proposed joint venture with the 
united states to build the plane the venture was negotiated during 
the reagan administration and is now under review by the bush 
administration 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater on wednesday 
declined to comment directly on the reports about mitsubishi and 
said president bush had not yet made a final decision on the fsx 
project

a woman whose son was given detention for 
missing high school believed it wasnt his fault so she served the 
punishment for him 
vickey esquivel said she turned off her three boys alarm clocks 
after she heard from a friend that school had been canceled because 
of a winter storm jan 30 
it wasnt 
the esquivels realized that school was in session after the 
snowstorm stopped and one of the boys ran into two of his teachers 
at a store in this farming community 60 miles from kansas city the 
teachers were getting lunch 
that story was good enough to get the youngest and middle son off 
the hook but the pomona high school principal wanted sam 16 to 
serve a detention 
instead ms esquivel spent an hour and 45 minutes vacuuming and 
cleaning at school march 3 and again tuesday 
the idea of having ms esquivel serve the sentence came from 
superintendent james cain who said he made the comment more in 
jest than in meaning 
after taking him up on the idea ms esquivel said she is 
satisfied so is sam though he wonders why his mother stopped at 
serving detention 
she could have done my homework he said

people in chicago and cincinnati were asked recently what they 
thought about the wander indiana television and print ads 
they didnt know what it meant denise l miller the states 
new tourism director said wednesday it was aimless not really 
exciting it made us sound hick 
a similar survey of indianapolis residents reinforced the 
findings they were even nastier about wander indiana said 
miller 
miller said the states tourism contract with an advertising 
agency is up for review in june the stakes are high the state 
estimates tourism pumps 62 billion into indianas economy each 
year 
to attract even more revenue miller has asked the legislature to 
boost tourism appropriations to 4 million by 1991 from the present 
21 million

oliver norths lawyer today attacked the 
credibility of a fundraiser for the contras saying he gave 
inconsistent accounts of a conversation in which north allegedly 
said he didnt care whether he went to jail or lied to congress 
north lawyer brendan sullivan said carl spitz channell never 
even mentioned norths alleged comments in interviews with 
government investigators on jan 9 1987 and march 12 1987 
channell first mentioned the alleged north remarks to texas 
billionaire nelson bunker hunt on april 25 1987 three days before 
channell entered a plea agreement with the government under which he 
is cooperating with the prosecution in exchange for admitting to a 
single felony charge 
you told prosecutors that north was willing to lie if his 
activities became public but there was no mention of congress 
sullivan told channell in relating his april 25 1987 interview 
with prosecutors 
but in the prosecutions redirect examination lawyer michael 
bromwich brought out that channell never had been asked about the 
jail and lying conversations in those interviews bromwich 
also showed through questioning that some of the earlier statements 
presented to channell were summaries not stenographic transcripts 
were you ever told in words or substance give us ollie 
north the prosecutor asked 
no said channell 
were you ever told your sentence depended on whether north 
would be convicted or acquitted bromwich asked 
no ive been told just the opposite said channell 
channell said also that he never had control over the millions he 
raised but that north and rich miller did in congressional 
testimony it was brought out that millers firm helped funnel money 
raised by channell to secret swiss bank accounts controlled by north 
and others 
channell testified four times in june 1987 but said that it was 
hunt who asked north two questions and north simply answered yes to 
each 
on wednesday channell testified that on sept 11 1985 after 
dinner at the petroleum club in dallas hunt asked north if he was 
worried about getting in trouble for his activities on behalf of 
the contras 
i dont care if i have to go to jail for this i dont care if 
i have to lie to congress about this north said to which hunt 
just chortled channell related 
us district judge gerhard a gesell interrupted sullivans 
crossexamination to observe that channell on the witness stand had 
given three versions already of the huntnorth conversation 
sullivan went on to say that in september 1987 testimony 
channell said absolutely nothing about norths supposed remarks 
on jail and lying to congress 
you didnt put them in hunts mouth and you didnt put them in 
norths mouth sullivan told channell the judge then told the 
jurors that each and every inconsistent statement you may consider 
in your appraisal of the credibility of this witness 
on wednesday channell testified that president reagan made a 
dramatic appearance at a white house meeting to thank 25 wealthy 
contributors who gave money to support the contras 
channell pleaded guilty in 1987 to conspiring to defraud the 
treasury by using a taxexempt foundation for a nonexempt purpose 
raising money for contra military activities one of the counts 
against north who helped direct the reagan administrations secret 
contra assistance efforts is that he participated in the tax 
conspiracy 
north also is accused of lying to congress and the attorney 
general about the activities which occurred during a period in 
which congress had banned us aid to the rebels 
more than 10 million was raised for the contras from private 
donors through channells taxexempt national endowment for the 
preservation of liberty 
channell said that during the white house meeting with reagan 
one donor c thomas clagett pointed to pictures of former 
presidents theodore and franklin roosevelt and said mr 
president why dont you act like those people and do something 
tom reagan replied i am doing the best i can its very 
tough channell recalled 
one contributor from a prominent austin texas family ellen 
garwood gave around 25 million or maybe a little more said 
channell 
ms garwood made the contributions after col north began to 
talk to her and other donors about the terminal crisis of the 
contras said channell 
the white house aide told ms garwood that the contras were 
about finished and unless money was raised we were going to lose the 
whole fiveyear effort of supporting democracy in central america 
channell said 
nepl originally had been set up to educate the public about 
american political and social institutions 
i was aware we had varied from our mandate in 1985 and 1986 
by raising private contra aid said channell but i felt that was 
something we could resolve channell said he had no evidence that 
the money being raised was going for lethal aid 
robert mcfarlane norths former boss as national security 
adviser is tentatively scheduled to testify friday in the north 
trial he pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding 
information from congress and was given a 20000 fine and two 
years probation

a veterans group said thursday it had filed a 
federal lawsuit challenging a law to compensate japaneseamericans 
who were interned during world war ii 
under the law the us government is to provide 20000 in 
compensation to each of some 60000 surviving japaneseamericans who 
were interned by the government a total of about 120000 
japaneseamericans were put in camps after pearl harbor 
john p coale a washington attorney handling the lawsuit filed 
in us district court for the district of columbia said the court 
action was based on the fact that the legislation does not provide 
compensation for 2000 to 3000 german and italianamericans who 
were also interned during the war 
the japaneseamericans are singled out to be compensated 
coale told a news conference 
regarding their internment coale said were not saying it was 
a fair action but there were many many unfair actions during world 
war ii 
the suit was filed on behalf of the american war veterans relief 
association a 30000member group based in anaheim calif the 
organization provides emergency financial assistance and shelter to 
needy veterans 
john kirby the groups administrator said millions of 
veterans over the age of 60 who served faithfully in world war ii 
live in fear that congress will cut their social security and 
medicaid benefits 
this suit is being filed for those veterans who are outraged 
that the same congress which has pledged to handle the federal 
deficit problem has passed a law handing out 125 billion in 
compensation he said

the weekly animal market is one of the most 
popular places in baghdad a cacophony of trilling songbirds 
barking dogs and bleating goats where the mundane mixes with the 
exotic 
the souk ilhayawanat as its known unfolds every friday 
morning outside the mosque of the caliphs across the street from 
the main bazaar 
six months after the ceasefire in its eightyear war with iran 
iraq doesnt have the hard currency needed to pay for the imported 
video cassette recorders and tape decks that are found elsewhere in 
the arab world those that are available generally are out of the 
reach of most people and many stores are empty 
but the 300yard stretch of sidewalk where the animal bazaar is 
held throngs with iraqis looking for a bargain in pets a watchdog 
or a goat to provide milk 
like other bazaars this one is divided by speciality with 
carrier pigeons taking up the most space buyers squeeze the neck 
splay the feet unfurl the wings and look in the eyes for any signs 
of sickness 
one customer najib 35 says its all in the nose 
i must have one with a big nose he said that means its 
a strong bird if you see a big nose thats the best bird 
he was looking for a carrier pigeon to cover the 255 miles 
between baghdad and the southern port of basra a good one can cost 
about 90 
but there also are nightingales parakeets turkeys geese 
roosters chicks parrots exotic marsh birds falcons ducks 
finches and goldfish 
one section is taken up with dozens of vendors selling little 
aquarium fish swimming around glass jars stacked on benches 
in the middle of the animals theres all the paraphernalia 
needed to care for them massive bird cages mounds of seeds and 
fish tanks 
the crowd attracts other hawkers selling sesame cakes hearts of 
palm and even lucky stones 
the people inevitably spill into the traffic swirling past just 
feet away some cars slow while their occupants gawk at the animals 
a policeman adds his bullhorn to the din as he prods traffic and 
pedestrians to keep moving and keep apart 
occasionally someone waving through the cars with a sevenfoot 
birdcage on his shoulders will bring traffic to a screeching halt 
some customers come to buy white fantailed pigeons to decorate 
the garden at about 250 but even these are not the most expensive 
birds on sale 
a pair of white parrots with yellow crests from the soviet union 
drew a huge crowd with their ability to say papa kaka and 
yacouv apparently the names of their owners the asking price was 
a hefty 750 
as the crowd reached its thickest around noon the inevitable 
accidents occurred birds were trampled underfoot or someone holding 
one was jostled and the bird flew free 
one parakeet escaped and lodged on the gates of the mosque 
orange peels lobbed at it failed to budge it even the amplified 
noon prayer booming from loudspeakers in the ancient minaret barely 
ruffled a feather 
forget it said someone in the crowd its gone to pray

the deputy editorinchief of novostis north american 
department yevgeny a posdnyakov says the slick publications are 
not just recycled cold wartype propaganda he claims they are part 
of the campaign for greater frankness and wider debate launched by 
gorbachev 
there is a need to write about everything so people will make 
up their own mind and understand things posdnyakov said in an 
interview the demand that some zones be free from inquiry by 
journalists would be an attack on glasnost 
the view from washington is far different at least one of the 
novosti books once again about the cia is full of untruths and 
innuendo designed to smear the reputation of the united states us 
officials charge 
we have discussed this book with the soviets as a particularly 
egregious example of what we call disinformation said us 
embassy spokesman richard gilbert it contains outright 
falsehoods and weve told them we dont think the continued 
distribution of this book is in keeping with the increasing positive 
tone of our relationship 
nevertheless once again about the cia whose cover shows 
bloody corpses imposed on the central intelligence agencys seal is 
being distributed in special waiting rooms of moscow airports 
reserved for foreigners according to posdnyakov 10000 copies were 
printed in english 
novosti publications also are available in intourist hotels 
whose clientele is largely foreign from aeroflot the soviet 
airline and from soviet embassies and other institutions abroad 
paradoxically the publication of the books largely intended for 
foreign markets comes as official media whose audience is mostly 
soviet are finding much about the united states to praise ogonyok 
magazine recently asked whether a usstyle jury system could be 
instituted and on thursday the communist party daily pravda lauded 
the taste of mcdonalds hamburgers 
the novosti books strike a far different note among recent 
releases 
silent terror billed as the book us censors dont want 
americans to read written by former us cancer researcher arnold 
lockshin and his wife lauren who obtained political asylum in the 
soviet union in 1986 the book recounts the silent campaign of 
harassment and terror which the fbi the us political police 
organized to force them to conform politically or be sorry 
the former houston couple members of the communist party usa 
who came to moscow with their three children accuse the fbi of 
waging an intimidation campaign that included the bugging of their 
home false entries on their telephone bills harassment of their 
daughter jennifer by her high school russian teacher and the 
killing of mice that lockshin was using in experiments at houstons 
stehlin foundation for cancer research 
the lockshins also say it was an inescapable conclusion 
that the fbi murdered king the late civil rights leader 
their book was printed in 10000 copies in english posdnyakov 
said when lockshin proposed having the book published it was a 
scoop the agency couldnt pass up he said 
american cultural invasion in europe by yuri kagramanov 
with a 12000copy press run in english has a cover showing a satyr 
wearing a cowboy hat seemingly about to rape a naked woman 
symbolizing europe its author quotes writers ranging from norwegian 
novelist knut hamsun to jazz pioneer dave brubeck to buttress his 
thesis that us bourgeois ideology and culture are overrunning 
the old world 
once again about the cia in 117 pages accuses the us 
intelligence service of committing the monstrous crime of 
killing the rev jim jones and over 900 of his followers at 
jonestown guyana in 1978 and of assassinating foreign leaders like 
panamas omar torrijos and the congos patrice lumumba 
the booklet all but openly charges the cia with the unsuccessful 
attempt on the popes life in 1981 which an italian state 
prosecutor linked instead to the secret service of bulgaria a 
soviet ally 
there is some evidence indicating the cia had a finger in the 
attempted assaasination of pope john paul ii the book says 
john paul ii made enemies in the west by his statements in defense 
of peace and against the capitalist exploitation of the working 
people 
posdnyakov said he had no knowledge of the official us protests 
over once again about the cia but said that thanks to glasnost 
the agency could now take up its case with novosti 
the chief editor has said that hell publish the cia 
disclaimers if we put out a second edition and provided of course 
that the cia can prove that its version of events is true 
posdnyakov said

after lengthy negotiations failed to produce a 
settlement with striking machinists a moneylosing texas air 
corpowned airline shuts down and files for protection under 
federal bankruptcy law 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo is vilified by union members 
pilots and flight attendants walk off their jobs stranded travelers 
are irate 
the scenario is not unlike the one that climaxed thursday with 
the reorganization filing by strikebound eastern airlines in 
bankruptcy court in new york 
but in an earlier series of tumultuous events the bankruptcy 
court was in houston the year was 1983 and the airline taken to 
court was continental 
continental then the nations eighthlargest carrier filed for 
protection sept 24 1983 closed for three days and then reopened 
as a nonunion discount carrier generating public acceptance by 
offering 49 fares anywhere it flew in the united states fares the 
public found too good to pass up 
continental employees would bear the brunt of the changes some 
salaries were cut in half the workforce of 12000 was cut by 
twothirds and it would be two years before continental unveiled a 
plan to fully repay nearly 1 billion to creditors 
continentals labor strife could be tracked to 1981 when the 
airline asked that its agreement with the machinists be amended to 
change pay rates and work rules and conditions by 1983 a federal 
mediator in the talks threw up his hands 
a month later on aug 13 550 machinists were laid off their 
jobs abolished the next day the union struck 
the bankruptcy court filing came six weeks after that 
on sept 29 1983 two days after continental returned to the 
skies the airline told pilots they could not strike under the 
federal railway labor act 
pilots and flight attendants called the airlines bluff walking 
off their jobs oct 1 continental sued the pilots union for 50 
million the air line pilots association countersued upping the 
ante to 100 million 
continental kept flying 
the pilots union threatened slowdowns at other carriers 
continental kept flying 
seven weeks after the filing airline capacity reached 50 
percent by april 1984 continental was up to 85 percent of the 
capacity it had before the bankruptcy action 
first to show cracks in solidarity were pilots only one month 
after they walked off their jobs 500 of them more than onethird 
of the original pilot workforce were back in continental cockpits 
it would be two years before alpa totally gave in picket lines 
long gone the union in september 1985 authorized members to return 
to work 
six months earlier the machinists and the association of flight 
attendants had ended their walkouts by then 50 percent of the 
2000 machinists and 60 percent of the 2600 flight attendants 
already had returned to work 
the costs of filing for bankruptcy accounted for 25 million of 
the airlines 772 million thirdquarter 1983 loss 
but continental which lost 260 million in 1982 and 1983 showed 
a 503 million profit in 1984 and in early 1986 parent company 
texas air bought eastern

when dockworkers refused to service a 
nuclearpowered ship and residents demanded it stay away they were 
putting glasnost to work to express the kind of grassroots concern 
over the environment that president mikhail s gorbachev has 
welcomed 
just a few years ago such open defiance of moscow would have 
been unthinkable and authorities would have moved in immediately to 
arrest any protesters who surfaced 
but now on certain issues like the environment glasnost or 
greater openness is welcomed authorities are taking a more 
tolerant attitude toward protests and in some cases are even going 
along with the publics demands 
in the soviet far east at least three ports have refused to 
allow the nuclearpowered barge carrier sevmorput to dock because of 
concern for possible radioactive contamination 
soviet press reports have said tens of thousands of residents 
protested to a pacific radio station and city officials and 
dockworkers declared the ship unwelcome out of fear over nuclear 
power that grew after the chernobyl disaster the public also 
apparently was upset that although it was newly built the sevmorput 
had already developed cracks 
the weekly newspaper moscow news said this week that moscow 
ministries are to blame for trying to maintain a ship that is 
uneconomical and failing to tell the public that experts had 
certified it is safe 
the daily izvestia on thursday told of yet another protest 
against a ship it said residents in the ukraine on the western 
shore of the black sea are protesting plans to transfer onto barges 
what they believe is hazardous cargo from the west german ship 
petersberg dockworkers are also refusing to carry out the 
operation the newspaper said 
the april 1986 chernobyl nuclear power plant accident which 
killed at least 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation worldwide 
turned much of soviet public opinion against nuclear power and 
brought the issue to the top of the countrys environmental agenda 
in december government officials announced that six nuclear 
power projects have been scrapped because of earthquake danger or 
tougher standards imposed after chernobyl added to the list after 
the devastating earthquake in armenia on dec 7 was the nuclear 
power plant near the republics capital yerevan armenian activists 
had been demanding closure of the plant for years but it was only 
after the eartquake that authorities agreed 
lithuanians particularly have been vocal about their opposition 
to a nuclear power plant in their republic in september thousands 
of people formed a human chain at the ignalina atomic electric 
station to protest its threat to the environment authorities had 
already responded to earlier protests by ordering an end to 
construction of a third reactor at the plant 
in his travels gorbachev himself has been confronted with 
complaints from soviets about the safety of nuclear power plants in 
their backyards 
last month in the ukrainian capital of kiev not far from 
chernobyl residents confronted the kremlin chief with concern 
about the safety of a nuclear power plant under construction on the 
crimean peninsula gorbachev was sympathetic saying foreign experts 
have been called in to review the plants design and that it would 
not be finished if the specialists determine it to be unsafe 
in a feb 23 speech in kiev gorbachev said his democratization 
of society has spawned a grassroots environmental movement that the 
kremlin must in all ways welcome he noted millions of tons of 
harmful chemicals are spewed into the air yearly destroying arable 
land vegetation and animals and promised to completely overcome 
the underestimation of the importance of ecology 
scientists must review every project to determine their expected 
impact on the environment gorbachev said and a popular referendum 
must be held on each proposal 
the government is even welcoming help from the outside sometimes 
from unexpected sources the international environmental group 
greenpeace which has organized protests against soviet whaling 
announced monday it is negotiating the opening of a branch office in 
moscow

here is the statement of eastern airlines 
president phil bakes at a news conference thursday announcing that 
the strikebound airline had filed for chapter 11 protection under 
the us bankruptcy code 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we have petitioned the federal court in new york for protection 
under the bankruptcy laws 
turning to what we have always viewed as the last resort of 
bankruptcy has been brought about by the airline pilots union 
grounding or virtual grounding of our airline it has not only 
paralyzed our operation and severely inconvenienced customers but 
has precipitated a potential cash crisis at the company that can 
only be averted and stabilized by seeking protection under the 
bankruptcy laws 
i want to emphasize and reemphasize what frank said we intend 
to operate our airline and make no mistake about that we intend to 
continue our immediate emphasis on the shuttle and south america 
and then prudently but unmistakeably put back into the sky more 
airplanes and go back into service in many of the markets that we 
have served up until last week and well do that as pilots become 
available and the bankruptcy process itself will substantially 
assist our ability to build back the airline 
the steps weve been forced to take because of the virtual 
shutdown of the company will also require that we entertain 
transactions that like the proposed sale of the eastern airlines 
shuttle to donald trump will provide liquidity and cash resources 
the lifeblood if you will to allow us to resuscitate a smaller 
but certainly a revitalized and certainly viable eastern airlines 
we fully intend to meet and we intend to and we have 
confidence in saying that all of our obligations to our creditors 
and we are confident there will be substantial value for our 
shareholders 
despite the fact that the reorganization should be a successful 
one i have to echo franks comment that the last five days have 
been the saddest five days of my life this is the last course of 
the last resort that we ever thought wed have to pursue to see the 
tens of thousands of men and women who have been inconvenienced is 
tough to go from last week 30000 employees of eastern airlines to 
1500 employees today is something that will be with me for the rest 
of my life but were going to go on and were going to build 
although the immediate precipitating crisis has been the pilot 
union decision to shut down most of our airplanes the larger story 
of eastern airlines is a story that goes back many years most of 
the problems at eastern have preceded the acquisiton by texas air 
in the post decade of deregulation in the 1980s eastern has lost 
15 billion on airline operations during that same period of time 
the competition had earned 2 billion and much of that 2 billion 
was reinvested in airplanes that ended up in our market in the last 
five years we have seen approximately 1600 new daily competitive 
flights by our competitors in the market areas that we serve east of 
the mississippi 
the causes of easterns losses go back many many years they 
start acutally in the late 1950s and early 1960s eastern was slow 
to convert and stayed with props a little too long 
the problems date to the 1970s when easterns labor costs were 
among the highest if not the highest in the entire airline 
industry and they continue through the 1980s when easterns unions 
most particularly the international association of machinists 
resisted agreeing to productive and affordable labor settlements 
that could have provided the company the strength to not only meet 
the competition but to grow substantially as many other airlines did 
and labor strife not just high labor costs at eastern airlines 
over the last 10 years has taken its toll its diverted the 
attention of all of us management and nonmanagement alike and 
yes its diverted a lot of customers from eastern airlines 
eastern today as a result of that has a weakened revenue 
structure much too dependent on discretionary lowerpriced 
nonbusiness travelers 
the losses and high labor costs had to be paid from somewhere 
and they were over the years in the 70s and early 1980s and up 
until very recently eastern borrowed very heavily to meet the 
high labor cost bill to make up for the depressed revenue 
structure to cover operating losses 
and more recently when debt was not really available to us 
nobody really wanted to loan money to eastern airlines we had to 
sell some assets to raise cash to meet payroll and to continue in 
operation 
in fact if we had not sold the assets we have sold over the last 
couple of years this news conference would have been held about a 
year and a half ago and we wouldnt be talking about rehabilitating 
the company the company would never fly again if we had not done 
that

activists were told thursday that they must 
oppose a trend of regulated industries forcing bigger price 
increases on individual consumers than on business customers 
the trend can only be reversed by pressure on state and federal 
regulators said mark cooper research director of the consumer 
federation of america at his groups annual convention 
charges for electricity natural gas and telephone service 
increased more rapidly in the 1980s for residential customers than 
others and checking account charges rose most rapidly for 
lowbalance accounts cooper said 
i think theres a lot at stake here although these kinds 
of issues dont grab the lapels of consumer advocates this is 
esoteric stuff that can put most regulators to sleep he said 
the rates are important because the increases reduce the buying 
power of the incomes of the poor he said 
he said that electricity gas telephones and checking accounts 
take up 6 percent of the average households spending but in the 
poorest fifth of households these items eat up 26 percent of the 
budget 
though industrial and residential rates for electricity and gas 
rose together in the 1970s in the 1980s rates for industrial 
users became uncoupled he said 
for example he said 
from 1981 through 1988 average residential electric rates rose 
20 percent but industrial rates did not change 
in those years residential gas rates rose 5 percent while 
industrial gas rates fell 25 percent 
in that period local residential telephone rates rose 75 
percent private lines rose 55 percent and wats lines rose only 5 
percent 
though longdistance rates declined unfortunately the average 
consumer does not make enough longdistance calls to break even on 
the deal cooper said 
the annual cost of a checking account almost doubled from 1977 
to 1985 for people earning 10000 or less per year while those 
earning more than 50000 kept balances large enough to stop paying 
fees and earn interest 
in the three utility areas industrial users assaulted the 
regulatory commissions cooper said 
they extracted the freedom to shop around when residential 
consumers cant they threatened to leave town when residential 
consumers cant they threatened to build their own systems when 
residential consumers cant he said none of these threats 
almost none of them were ever backed up 
in banking he said the regulators essentially left the 
field 
the solution is obvious to beat the regulators about the head 
until they get the pricing schemes fixed you have to do it 
politically 
edward byers vice president of cambridge reports inc a polling 
firm told the convention generally theres a lot of confusion 
about natural gas and electricity issues we get very high rates 
of no opinion dont know or contradictory results 
where there are clear currents of opinion people are concerned 
that any deregulatory effort is going to raise their prices they 
are not concerned about impacts on service reliability or quality

umm elfahm israel ap election victories last week gave 
moslem fundamentalists control of this arab town and some villages 
inspiring fear among israeli jews that an islamic revolution is 
growing in their midst 
politicians of the new islamic movement in this northern town of 
27000 people say they won because of government neglect not 
revolution 
government officials scholars and editorial writers have warned 
of a fundamentalist trend and some even suggest ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini the iranian patriarch has become a revolutionary model 
for israeli moslems 
israel has 810000 arab citizens 18 percent of the population 
and 80 percent of them are moslems 
sheik raed salah mahajneh a moslem preacher and new mayor of umm 
elfahm said his party won because the town is in disrepair and has 
a debt of 39 million he blamed that on skimpy government funding 
and a poor job by the previous local administration which the 
communists supported 
we are short of drainage roads and schoolrooms said the 
30yearold mayor a policemans son anywhere you put your 
finger there is something to be done we are not in iran we are 
here we have been here since before the iranian revolution 
alex bligh a government adviser on arab affairs said complaints 
of discrimination against israeli arabs were not totally 
baseless despite improvements he said the ratio of government 
funds devoted to jewish and arab towns is 41 
mahajneh has the full beard of a moslem fundamentalist but he 
greeted reporters this week in a stylish sweater slacks and loafers 
the islamic movements use of mosque donations to build roads and 
kindergartens in arab areas is cited by many observers as a major 
reason for its election success 
a combination mosque clinic and social center now being built in 
umm elfahm was financed with local donations and 45000 from cat 
stevens the american folk singer who changed his name to yusef 
islam after becoming a moslem mahajneh said 
the fivestory complex sits on a hill overlooking the town 35 
miles northeast of tel aviv 
such efforts by the party have not arrested decades of neglect 
however open sewage drains and rutted dirt roads are common in 
arab towns and villages 
the islamic movement which is challenging communist domination 
among israeli arabs won leadership in umm elfahm and two large 
villages and could win three more villages in runoff elections 
six of the 19 council posts in the biblical city of nazareth went to 
islamic candidates 
bligh who spoke at a government forum on the elections called 
the victories a very disturbing development that could have 
national implications if the islamic movement runs for parliament 
where arabs occupy a halfdozen of the 120 seats 
rafi israel an expert on islamic affairs at hebrew university 
tied growing fundamentalism among israels moslems to the islamic 
fervor of khomeini and libyan leader moammar gadhafi i can see 
very alarming signs that things might get out of hand he said 
he noted that the concept of islam as a system of government and 
society as well as a religion were incompatible with the idea of a 
jewish state and declared it nonsense to believe arabs were 
loyal citizens of israel 
leaders of the islamic movement and newly elected moslem 
officials insist such fears are unfounded 
we will not do anything outside the law mahajneh said the 
law will be here as it is in tel aviv 
sheik abdullah nimer darwish spriritual leader of the islamic 
movement said jews had no reason to fear islam but made clear his 
mission was larger than local government 
darwish 41 was jailed for antiisraeli activities in the early 
1980s and advocates a palestinian state alongside israel rejecting 
the call of some fundamentalists for destruction of the jewish state 
lets agree on the two states and a ceasefire for 10 15 
years he said if they cannot coexist let them restore the 
situation to what it was

us education secretary lauro cavazos visited a 
roman catholic elementary school in one of the nations most 
depressed urban communities thursday praising its unusual blend of 
art and academics 
i think that any school that is well run that is orderly that 
is free of drugs all schools should be like that cavazos said 
st augustine school of the arts for kindergartners through 
eighth graders nearly all of whom are black was profiled in 
december on cbs 60 minutes as an educational oasis in 
slumridden section of the south bronx 
despite his praise for the school cavazos indicated to reporters 
he was not interested in renewing the debate over whether parents of 
catholic and other private school students should get tuition tax 
credits or vouchers 
im not really pushing for tuition tax credits or vouchers 
cavazos said 
yet principal thomas pilecki said he remained optimistic 
im hopeful his cavazos visit here will help him see the 
strength of catholic schools he said we dont have any money 
at all we dont have a cent 
from the 1970s through 1984 the schools enrollment dropped from 
about 500 to less than 200 and the new york archdiocese was 
threatening to close it but st augustine began an unusual 
curriculum built around a fine arts program in the 1984 and 
enrollment now stands at 320 tuition is 1100 a year 
the curriculum combines the usual academic subjects with 
instruction in art dance and especially music taught by 
professionals piano is mandatory through fourth grade each student 
must also learn at least one other instrument 
st augustine is the only parochial school in the archdiocese 
specializing in fine arts unlike most fine arts schools it admits 
all comers regardless of talent 
youngsters showed cavazos their musical prowess with a more than 
respectable rendition of the national anthem during an assembly in 
his honor 
it takes a lot of practice said 10yearold sharene 
lindquist who has studied piano and clarinet you dont have to 
be an expert if youve got problems you can always go to the 
teacher 
the arts program is supported by about 350000 a year in 
foundation and corporate grants 
but finances are sometimes so tight that at times teachers have 
been asked not to cash their paychecks said the rev robert 
jeffers pastor of st augustine 
the arts program has paid off said jeffers because it gives 
children a constant sense of accomplishment 
during a tour of the school cavazos stopped in on yvonne 
rhemtittles eighthgrade science class and quizzed youngsters 
about their assignments 
they in turn presented him with a maroon and white tshirt with 
the school emblem

a harvard professor has disputed the contention 
of two leading surgeons that replacing intestines and other organs 
is a justifiable lastditch remedy for dying children even though 
it has never saved a child 
there must be some likelihood of success before the desperate 
remedy becomes more than a desperate search for an opportunity to 
try a new procedure awaiting trial dr francis d moore of 
harvard university wrote in an editorial in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
the heads of two surgical teams that have performed the nations 
only four and fiveorgan abdominal transplants defended their 
efforts in separate articles saying they found no evidence of organ 
rejection in their first four child patients even though they all 
died 
dr thomas e starzl of the university of pittsburgh and dr 
james w williams of rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center in 
chicago said they also found no indication of a potentially fatal 
reaction in which immune cells transplanted from the organ donor 
attack the recipients cells 
while lauding the leadership of starzl and williams moore 
questioned their assertion that severely ill children tolerate the 
operative procedure very well 
he noted that two of the four children died soon after the 
operation and said the other two had many complications 
if this is tolerating the operative procedure very well one 
wonders what it would look like if the procedures were not well 
tolerated moore said he called for further study with animals 
before more transplants are tried on children 
starzls first patient a 6yearold girl died a few hours after 
her 1983 transplant at childrens hospital of pittsburgh most of 
her small intestine had been sucked out by a swimming pool pump and 
she later developed liver failure she received those organs along 
with a new spleen and pancreas 
his second patient survived longer than any of the three others 
tabatha foster 3 of madisonville ky died of cancer of the lymph 
system in may six months after receiving a new liver pancreas 
stomach small intestine and part of a large intestine 
the most important conclusion from our longest surviving 
patient was that she came tantalizingly close to truly longterm 
survival with a functioning gastrointestinal tract starzl said 
it seems inevitable that further cautious trials of 
multiorgan transplants will be made he said 
like tabatha both of williams patients were born with short gut 
syndrome a deformity that leads to liver failure 
williams first patient a 17monthold boy lived three days 
after surgery in 1986 he died of sudden internal bleeding his 
other patient a 10monthold boy died of cancer 3 months after 
receiving a new liver pancreas small bowel and part of the stomach 
in 1988 
doctors believe the cancer that killed tabatha and the other 
child last year resulted from too much antirejection medication 
which suppresses the bodys immune system 
williams said he performed his two multiorgan transplants 
because of the hopelessness of the childrens condition 
the forbidding problem of short bowel syndrome and associated 
liver failure is potentially manageable with multiorgan 
transplants he said 
williams has not performed any more multiorgan transplants 
although suitable patients would be accepted for consideration 
according to dr howard sankary a member of williams surgical team 
since the articles were written a fifth child died after 
multiple transplant surgery and starzl has suspended such 
operations until better antirejection medication is available 
the child fiveorgan recipient rolandrea dodge 3 of fruitland 
nm survived six weeks she died in january doctors believe she 
too died of cancer 
starzls team has had better luck with multiple organ abdominal 
transplants on adult patients with terminal cancer eleven of the 
first 13 have survived and are believed to be free of malignancy 
unlike the young multiorgan recipients the adults kept most of 
their own small intestines which the pittsburgh researchers said 
might explain the older patients success

the man elected to succeed bernie sanders 
the citys socialist mayor ran on the same leftwing platform and 
says his job is to tilt the scales toward those not rich enough 
to protect their interests 
but peter clavelle shies away from the socialist label 
very few people understand socialism i dont have a great 
understanding of it myself said sanders community development 
director who was elected mayor tuesday i was not schooled in the 
leninmarxist analysis 
the 39yearold clavelle who has taken a magazines description 
of him bald paunchy colorless as a badge of honor was 
chosen by the citys thirdparty progressive coalition to run after 
sanders decided against a fifth twoyear term 
he drew 5626 votes or 53 percent to 4400 or 42 percent for 
nancy chioffi a democrat a tax revolt candidate and one from the 
environmentalist greens party split the rest of the vote 
burlington vermonts largest city with a population of 38000 
drew widespread attention eight years ago when sanders a rumpled 
tieless radical educated at the university of chicago was elected 
by 10 votes 
clavelle and sanders joined forces shortly afterward when 
clavelle went to work first as personnel director and then as chief 
of development 
clavelle has won high marks for his efforts to preserve lowcost 
housing to get more women into jobs and help stem domestic abuse 
and to create amenities such as a boathouse and bike path on lake 
champlain 
he and others describe his approach as lowkey not as 
confrontational as sanders 
garrison nelson a university of vermont political scientist 
said clavelle has been a key behindthescenes player in the citys 
many tussles with developers over whether they will build or 
renovate affordable housing in exchange for permission to build 
higherpriced properties 
when bernie sanders makes his outburst against the rapacious 
developers and stomps out of the room peters the guy who will then 
shut the door and say ok lets sign the contract nelson said 
hes sort of been the good cop to bernie sanders bad cop 
of his style of governance clavelle said the mayor ought to 
be open to perspectives from the entire community but those who 
have the money those who have the power do a pretty good job 
representing themselves so the mayors role is to attempt to tilt 
the scales just a little bit 
clavelle grew up in the bluecollar suburb of winooski and 
remembers being called a river rat by affluent high school 
classmates 
he became the first in his family to graduate from college and 
pursued a career in city management because it seemed like 
something where you could make a difference 
he was hired at 23 as town manager in the town of castleton then 
moved to the same job in winooski four years later 
when a proposed budget there was voted down clavelle drained the 
municipal swimming pool during a heat wave saying the city couldnt 
afford it he resigned in disgust at what he called a lack of 
support for city services

the new leader of the governing 
national party conferred thursday with ailing president pw botha 
but failed to resolve a potential power struggle 
botha reportedly defying the wishes of his own party announced 
he would return to work next week after a twomonth convalesence 
from a stroke 
the party leader education minister fw de klerk indicated an 
impasse remained saying his talks with botha would continue at an 
unspecified later date staterun television said the meeting was 
apparently a very tough session which ended with no clear 
agreement on working relations between botha and de klerk the 
heir apparent for the presidency 
botha said he would resume his duties at a cabinet meeting on 
wednesday when the government presents its annual budget last 
week botha had said he would not return to office until april and 
indicated he was irked at suggestions that he retire 
the independent south african press association reported that the 
caucus of national party members of parliament was dissatisified 
with bothas stance and wanted a firm pledge from him to retire as 
soon as feasible to make way for de klerk 
bothas statement gave no indication how long he planned to 
continue in office and made no mention of his meeting with de klerk 
before the meeting there were unconfirmed press reports that a 
compromise would be proposed with botha remaining as president 
temporarily but agreeing to let de klerk succeed him in a general 
election held within the next few months 
the star of johannesburg the countrys largest daily newspaper 
quoted national party sources as saying botha might reject the 
compromise and thus provoke a confrontation 
de klerk described his talks with botha as comprehensive and 
penetrating but no further details were disclosed about the 
meeting held at bothas official residence in cape town 
botha 73 suffered a stroke jan 18 and resigned as national 
party leader on feb 2 he was replaced by de klerk marking the 
first time that the party leader was not also the head of government 
among south africas 5 million whites there has been a largely 
favorable reaction to the prospect of a de klerk presidency even 
staunchly progovernment newspapers have suggested the time has come 
for botha to step aside after holding power since 1978 
when botha said in an interview last week that he intended to 
return to office in april there were widespread predictions of a 
bitter power struggle between him and de klerk whose party post 
gives him no formal role in government policymaking botha said he 
had a duty to continue in office despite derision and attacks 
aimed at him 
while botha flew thursday from his holiday coastal home to cape 
town de klerk and other national party members of parliament met in 
private to discuss the situation 
after the meeting the caucus released a statement saying its 
members had reached unanimous agreement on the issue of political 
power it did not elaborate 
de klerk who also holds the post of national party leader for 
transvaal province then went to bothas office accompanied by 
leaders of the party branches in the other three provinces the cape 
province leader constitutional development minister chris heunis 
is serving as acting president during bothas convalesence 
business day a johannesburg financial newspaper said only botha 
himself could arrange a dignified departure from office 
if he engages in further power struggles and manipulations 
he will leave office a pathetic figure an editorial said the 
fact is that de klerk has a chance of making a political 
breakthrough president botha has none 
de klerk has not repudiated any of bothas major policies but he 
is depicted as more pragmatic and flexible however he has 
reaffirmed the governments commitment to segregated neighborhoods 
and schools for whites who want them and he has given no indication 
he would consider full voting rights for the countrys 28 million 
blacks

the vaticans chief theologian urged american 
bishops to be martyrs in defending roman catholic teaching and 
to impose their authority on dissenters officials said thursday 
several of the 35 us bishops attending a special conference 
responded that compromise and dialogue are necessary in the american 
church in areas other than major matters of faith 
cardinal joseph ratzinger said some bishops had let dissident 
theologians usurp their authority leading to a growing insecurity 
and disorientation among the faithful 
on some issues its necessary to risk being unpopular because 
of the truth said ratzinger the head of the congregation for the 
doctrine of the faith in remarks released thursday those who 
announce the gospel must also be martyrs in the most profound sense 
of the word 
his address wednesday night was seen as the keynote of the 
fourday closed meeting between the vatican and the bishops pope 
john paul ii summoned to discuss the state of american church which 
has 52 million members 
john paul who is attending the conference has criticized the 
tendency of many us catholics to disregard church teaching on 
birth control divorce and some other matters 
ratzinger spoke of theological experts who through the mass 
media bring into the public arena their often dissonant 
contributions to the point where their voices drown out those of 
the bishops 
in recent years he said many bishops have felt pressure to be 
managers rather than preachers 
the bishops have fully adapted themselves to this regulative 
model little defending their magisterial authority over that of 
theologians he said 
he criticized those who think the spirit of free inquiry not 
church teaching should prevail on theological issues 
archbishop john roach of minneapolisst paul and other american 
prelates responded with a defense of compromise and debate on church 
teaching 
archbishop roach made it very clear that us bishops will not 
compromise on major matters of the faith the rev john lynch 
secretary of the us national conference of bishops said at a 
briefing for journalists thursday 
in other matters he added sometimes the discussion and 
the dialogue take more time than perhaps other people would like it 
to take 
lynch said the bishops told vatican officials continuing the 
dialogue with dissenters which can sometimes be read as weakness 
but which in our american experience often leads to a good end 
should not be seen as weakness 
not all the us bishops disagreed with ratzinger 
addressing problems faced by the american hierarchy cardinal 
john oconnor of new york mentioned leadership in certain colleges 
and universities and said some bishops in the last 20 years have 
seemed to lose faith first in themselves as people afterward in 
their magisterial authority 
oconnor considered a doctrinal conservative said other 
problems stemmed from the effect of mass media on family and sexual 
attitudes the abortion mentality racism radical feminism 
loss in numbers of the teaching religious dissident theologies and 
ecclesiologies materialism etcetera 
the cardinal chided the vatican for failing to prepare its clergy 
and faithful for modern reforms however and said it had been too 
slow in clarifying its policy on artificial birth control 
a summary of his speech also was released thursday 
other american bishops asked the vatican for greater 
theological precision possibly in the form of periodic letters 
on moral issues 
ratzinger had some praise for the bishops commending them for 
pastoral letters that shed the light of faith on social issues 
the american prelates have produced controversial letters on the 
us economy and nuclear weapons 
he also said however that bishops must resist a society in 
which individual liberties were considered paramount and moral 
values consigned to the private sphere 
those ideas were echoed in meetings thursday between the vatican 
and the americans on the role of priests and on the churchs 
pastoral mission 
cardinal bernard law of boston said american priests were 
extraordinarily faithful but faced special challenges in us 
society he mentioned individualism moral relativism the 
isolation of sexual pleasure as an end in itself and failure to 
recognize differences between the sexes

an international conference on 
indochinese refugees ruled out repatriating asylumseekers who are 
deemed not to be fleeing political persecution officials said 
thursday 
delegates from 30 nations ended their threeday meeting endorsing 
a draft action plan for consideration at the international 
conference on indochinese refugees in geneva in june 
chairman majid mohamed told a news conference the plan would help 
provide durable solutions to the indochinese refugee problem 
the draft plan suggests vietnam launch a campaign stressing the 
risks and hardships of fleeing by boat and work to end illegal 
departures by boat people it also calls on vietnam to make 
legal departures easier 
malaysia indonesia thailand the philippines and other 
countries in the region have agreed to provide only temporary asylum 
for refugees western nations were urged to take in refugees left in 
camps in southeast asia 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the conference 
voted not to recommend a deadline by which asylumseekers would be 
screened to decide whether they qualified for resettlement in the 
west 
officials said some southeast asian countries had asked the 
conference to recommend forcible repatriation of boat people and 
others fleeing their countries for reasons other than political 
persecution 
the rules are very clear whenever refugees are repatriated 
it has to be on a voluntary basis said jean pierre hocke the 
united nations high commissioner for refugees 
the officials said the vietnamese delegation led by deputy 
foreign minister vu khoan had agreed at the conference to take back 
anyone who wanted to return voluntarily 
western delegations present said they might take in additional 
refugees and step up financial aid to help implement the plan 
so far 150000 people have emigrated legally from vietnam under 
the orderly departure program 
there are about 300000 indochinese refugees in southeast asia

years ago more than 800000 of them in the united states officials 
said

members of a house subcommittee gave a scathing 
appraisal thursday of a proposed presidential order that would 
tighten the governments security clearance process but do away with 
employee protections against arbitrary penalties 
rep gerry sikorski dminn shot a series of questions at mary 
lawton a justice department official who led an interagency group 
that developed the proposal over the last five years but lawton 
offered no justification for eliminating employees due process 
rights in the order 
i dont understand why were hurting these people said 
sikorsky chairman of the house civil service subcommittee whats 
wrong with these minimal due process rights why did you obliterate 
them 
lawton explained that her task force which included 
representatives from the fbi the central intelligence agency and 
the departments of state defense energy and treasury was charged 
by thenpresident reagan to bring governmentwide consistency to 
background investigations of workers whose jobs require secret 
security clearances 
the federal office of personnel management estimated in 1986 that 
5 million military civilian and federal contractor employees held 
various levels of security clearances numerous government studies 
have found that number too high to be manageable that overabundance 
makes periodic rereviews of security status impossible to keep 
current and increases the likelihood that secret information will be 
compromised 
when the task force completed its draft presidential order 
however it dropped from the regulations a series of due process 
guarantees that had been in place since president eisenhower 
instituted them three decades ago 
the proposed rule would do away with a workers right to be 
notified that he or she was being denied a security clearance to be 
told the reasons for the denial in writing to be granted a chance 
to reply and to be represented by a lawyer 
whats wrong with the current process of giving a reason in 
writing sikorski asked lawton 
nothings wrong lawton answered adding there is no 
liberty or property interest in security clearance 
denial of security clearance does not always mean a persons job 
will be endangered she said access to classified information 
is not a right its a privilege 
i think its indefensible sikorski replied adding later 
what youre saying is we want to flex our muscles we dont 
want any more court cases on access denial 
rep thomas ridge rpa asked lawton what public interest is 
preserved by not explaining the reasons for denial 
ninetynine times out of 100 none said lawton in the 
remaining case she said the government must protect the secrecy of 
the source of information on which the denial is based but she 
conceded that such information is protected even under the current 
system 
following the hearing lawton told a reporter she was unable to 
fully discuss or defend the draft order because it is still an 
internal executive branch document and is being reviewed by the 
office of management and budget with no decision yet made on its 
final form

the federal government on thursday announced a 
75 million grant program to expand drug treatment services to help 
get addicts off the streets faster and reduce the spread of aids 
the funds are designed to help drug treatment centers reduce and 
eliminate waiting lists which in some cities are six months and 
longer said frederick k goodwin head of the alcohol drug abuse 
and mental health administration

cases are contracted through use of contaminated intravenous 
needles it is especially critical that the nations ability to 
provide treatment to drug abusers be expanded he said 
the money will go to public and private nonprofit organizations 
that are providing outpatient or residential drug treatment 
services where applicants have been waiting more than a month to be 
admitted to the program 
states as well as federally recognized indian tribes can also 
apply for several local drug treatment service providers frederick 
said 
the grants are intended to expand treatment services for abuse of 
all types of drugs including those injected intravenously 
in addition to the new grant program fredericks agency part of 
the department of health and human services is providing 518 
million this fiscal year in block grants to states for substance

many cruise ships fail to report serious outbreaks 
of illness at sea an assistant us surgeon general says 
one ship in particular is consistently misstating its 
incidence of illness said dr vernon n houk director of the 
center for environmental health and injury control a part of the 
centers for disease control in atlanta 
the information has been turned over to a federal attorney for 
action he added 
a check of records found that ship officers have been reporting 
no illnesses to federal sanitation inspectors when in fact they have 
had as many as 240 people aboard suffering from diarrhea houk said 
wednesday 
this has public health significance we dont intend to 
tolerate it he said houk would not reveal the names of the ships 
except to say they regularly sail from south florida 
ships are supposed to report diarrheal illnesses among passengers 
and crew by radio at least 24 hours before arriving in a us port 
in order to help inspectors trace the source of a disease before 
passengers fan out across the country 
the vast majority of the nations cruise ships adhere to cdc 
standards houk said 
houk whose charges were made at a public meeting held by the cdc 
to discuss health aboard cruise ships said the problem was 
uncovered when inspectors checked the logs of some ships against 
their radio reports 
another speaker john reurs of the international committee of 
passenger lines representing 19 cruise cd would cooperate with any 
enforcement 
several other cruise officials at the meeting said they did not 
know what ships had been falsifying health reports we cooperate 
fully with the cdc on all public health questions said tim 
gallagher of carnival cruise lines 
in the past federal officials have publicized the names of ships 
that have not cooperated with cdc requirements under the assumption 
that bad publicity was more effective and cheaper than a drawnout 
court case

americans took out 44 billion more in credit 
than they paid off in january as consumer debt grew at an annual 
rate of 79 percent the government reported thursday 
the federal reserve board said the january increase followed a 
revised increase of 43 billion in december and a gain of 47 
billion in november 
januarys rise in the seasonally adjusted rate of credit growth 
was up slightly from a 78 percent pace in december but below the 
85 percent rate in november 
the increase was held back by slower growth in auto loans and the 
category of debt that includes credit cards while loans for mobile 
homes increased after falling sharply in december 
consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic 
health since it accounts for twothirds of overall economic activity 
in january auto loans rose by 22 billion a 92 percent annual 
rate following a slightly larger 24 billion increase during 
december 
growth in the category of debt that includes credit cards also 
was weaker in january rising by 823 million or at a 53 percent 
annual rate that followed a december increase of 13 billion that 
represented an 84 percent rate of growth 
mobile home debts which had declined by 278 million in 
december rose by 82 million in january a 38 percent pace of 
growth 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by

the government on thursday restored 
some civil liberties suspended last week during riots over price 
increases but said the military would continue patrolling major 
cities to prevent new violence 
the move gives back freedom of the press the right to gather and 
protest in public and the right to travel inside and out of the 
country it also ends the right of the military to enter homes and 
detain suspects without warrants 
the rights were suspended feb 28 one day after rioting broke 
out over sharp increases in public transportation fares the riots 
evolved into nationwide demonstrations against a government 
austerity program 
a dusttodawn curfew was imposed feb 28 but was lifted monday 
the government said 256 people died in the violence the worst in 
venezuelas 30 years of democracy unofficial reports put the toll 
much higher and human rights committees in caracas say at least 30 
people are missing 
the director of the central information office pastor heydra 
said military personnel will continue to control major streets in 
caracas and other cities until the situation is totally 
normalized 
president carlos andres perez vowed to go ahead with his economic 
program to meet loan conditions set by international financial 
institutions the country has a 33 billion foreign debt and needs 
to obtain loans 
price controls were lifted in venezuela this week but most shops 
were hesitant in implementing new prices 
maybe next week well set new prices said ernesto rangel 
owner of a pizza shop we dont want to shock people all at once 
roman catholic church leaders urged the government to ensure the 
poor alone dont shoulder the terrible burden of sacrifices of 
the foreign debt 
in a document published thursday in newspapers caracas 
archbishop jose ali lebrun and 20 other priests criticized the 
widening gap between poor and rich in venezuela and said the 
luxury of the few has become an insult against the misery of the 
masses 
we remind economic and political leaders that they have a duty 
to give examples of austerity and honesty so that the terrible 
burden of sacrifices the country must make because of its foreign 
debt will not be borne by weak and poor sectors alone they said 
the daily newspaper el nacional reported that planning minister 
miguel rodriguez said the country plans to buy back a portion of its 
foreign debt on secondary markets meaning from creditor banks at 
a discount of up to 75 percent 
venezuelas debt the fourthlargest in latin america is being 
offered at 25 percent of its value by the banks said el nacional 
rodriguez did not specify the amount of debt venezuela planned to 
buy back but said the acquisition would be made with reserves of the 
venezuelan central bank according to el nacional 
the effect of the purchase would be to reduce the amount of money 
venezuela would owe but the amount it could purchase would depend 
on how much is available in the central banks operative reserves 
the government said the operative reserves were 15 billion in 
late february but independent estimates have put the figure at 400 
million

the number of older women getting mammograms 
increased noticeably after nancy reagans breast cancer diagnosis 
researchers said thursday 
a survey taken in 33 states by the centers for disease control 
found that 38 percent of women age 50 and up questioned in november 
and december 1987 said they had received a screening mammogram for 
breast cancer within the previous year 
that was up nearly half again from the 26 percent the survey 
found in the first two months of that year 
mrs reagans diagnosis for breast cancer occurred in october 
1987 when she was first lady it was one of two events that directed 
public attention to the disease that year in march april and may 
the american cancer society conducted a media campaign to promote 
screening for breast cancer 
the percentage of women who reported being screened increased 
coincident with the acs campaign and again after the diagnosis 
of mrs reagans breast cancer the cdc said 
data from the cdc survey suggest that the media events and 
educational activities were accompanied by increases in screening 
mammograms the agency said it acknowledged there was no 
statistical proof of cause and effect 
the survey did not include women who had mammograms because of a 
specific health problem or history or those who hadnt seen a 
doctor for a routine examination at all 
medical centers in the united states reported after mrs reagans 
diagnosis that the demand for mammograms had gone up she later was 
honored with an american cancer society courage award for 
encouraging women to check for breast cancer 
the acs recommends that all women 50 or older have a mammogram 
each year but studies have found that most women in that group have 
never had a mammogram 
cancer specialists at the cdc and elsewhere say increased use of 
mammograms would increase early detection of breast cancer raising 
survival rates for patients 
the cancer society recommends that women between 35 and 40 have 
one initial mammogram and that women 4049 have one each year or 
two 
breast cancer second to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths 
among women kills about 40000 us women each year

also accorded him headofstate treatment he is to leave for 
bangladesh on friday 
india was one of the first nonarab nations to recognize the

where nearly 400 palestinians and 17 israelis have been killed in a 
15month uprising against israeli rule 
the plo has sought peace negotiations with israel but the jewish

time he was given headofstate treatment such as a 21gun salute

for their cars gandhi denied recent indian newspaper reports that 
india was preparing to upgrade its relations with israel 
we havent done anything yet theres nothing in the 
pipeline gandhi said 
india which has long expressed solidarity with the palestinian 
cause does not have diplomatic relations with israel the israelis 
however maintain a consulate in bombay

hungary on thursday backed a western effort to 
launch a united nations inquiry into alleged human rights violations 
in warsaw pact ally romania 
the un human rights commission voted 217 to adopt a 
swedishled resolution backed by hungary and six western nations 
the measure expresses concern at allegations of serious 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in romania and 
calls for the appointment of a special un investigator 
six third world nations and communist cuba voted against the 
resolution ten other third world countries abstained while the 
soviet union and the three other soviet bloc countries in the 
43nation panel did not participate in the vote 
hungary and romania have only observer status in the human rights 
commission and thus have no voting rights 
it was the first time a soviet bloc country joined western 
nations in seeking such a move against a warsaw pact ally 
romanias chief delegate gheorghe dolgu called the resolution a 
brutal interference in his countrys internal affairs and said 
romania regarded the measure as null and void 
we will never accept that models be imposed on us from 
outside dolgu said 
the resolution specifically refers to growing restrictions on 
romanias ethnic minorities which include about 17 million 
hungarians 
about 15000 romanians most of them ethnic hungarians have fled 
to hungary in the past 12 months the outflow increased after 
authorities disclosed plans for rural consolidation that would 
mean razing thousands of villages 
dolgu said hungary masterminded the resolution and charged its 
warsaw pact ally with pursuing revisionist intentions aimed at 
changing frontiers established by peace treaties 
romanians he said are familiar with such intentions it was a 
reference to a wartime deal between nazi germany and hungary under 
which transylvania the romanian region that includes most of the 
hungarian minority became part of hungary romania also an ally of 
the nazis until 1944 recovered transylvania after the war 
it is under the pretext of the alleged right to protect certain 
minorities that we had to go through direct aggression and 
dismemberment dolgu said the resolution aims once again at 
arousing nationalistic and chauvinist expressions and to destabilize 
romania

former defense secretary frank c carlucci and 
the state department joined thursday in asserting there was no 
evidence that japanese firms were directly involved in a chemical 
weapons plant in libya 
not that i know carlucci told reporters when i was in the 
government we had no indication whatsoever of any such diversion 
a state department official said meanwhile we have no 
information indicating japanese firms were directly involved in the 
libyan chemical weapons plant itself 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said japanese 
firms were involved in a nearby metal fabrications facility and 
that japan steel works was the prime contractor 
however the official said the japanese government has 
informed us that as of last summer japanese firms ceased all 
involvement with that facility 
denials were also issued in tokyo by the japanese government and 
by mitsubishi heavy industries which according to a published 
report had a team of 50 technicians and engineers at the plant 
complex in the desert south of libya 
the company is involved in a proposed joint venture with the 
united states to build a jet fighter the fsx the deal was 
negotiated during the reagan administration in which carlucci was 
defense secretary and is now under review by the bush 
administration 
carlucci said the memorandum of understanding that would 
govern the program would be signed with the japanese government 
we have absolutely no instance of any compromise of technology 
by the japanese government he said and the japanese government 
will be accountable 
still the report on alleged involvement by mitsubishi in libya 
raised new concerns in congress about the proposed joint airplane 
venture a report by the defense and commerce departments to 
president bush was due on friday 
the state department official said an investigation by the 
japanese government disclosed several japanese firms had supplied 
equipment to japan steel works as subcontractors and that japanese 
firms exported equipment to the metal fabrication facility through 
third countries 
but the official said the japanese government said all such 
involvement with the facility ended last summer 
our consultation with the japanese government concerning the 
libyan chemical weapons program has been positive and 
constructive the official said 
libya meanwhile has denied it was trying to develop chemical 
weapons and said the plant was engaged in the manufacture of 
pharmaceuticals 
on capitol hill there were calls for congress to ban from 
american markets products made by foreign firms found to have helped 
build the suspected chemical weapons plant and for bush to abandon 
the proposed joint airplane venture 
in japan foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said thursday 
that i can now confirm that mitsubishi heavy industries has never 
been engaged in the export of equipment or dispatch of engineers as 
reported in the detroit news mitsubishi also denied the reports 
the detroit newspaper on wednesday had quoted unidentified 
congressional and defense department sources as saying they were 
told of mitsubishis alleged participation in the libyan project by 
intelligence sources in washington 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that we continue to 
investigate this matter he added that the japanese government 
has given us assurances that there is no intention of any japanese 
involvement with the libyan project and has denied emphatically any 
involvement by mitsubishi heavy industries technicians or engineers 
in the libyan chemical project 
rep john bryant dtexas among those seeking action by congress 
and the president said that the nation must awaken to the fact 
that we are naive to expect the japanese to do anything other than 
what is in their economic interests 
rep duncan hunter rcalif said companies involved in the 
libyan plant have deliberately sold out the interests of the west 
in helping libyan leader moammar gadhafi and they deserve a 
corporate life sentence 
my bill would require the cia to supply the names of the 
companies that have participated in the construction of the libyan 
gas and bomb facilities they should not have access to our 
markets if they work to make chemical weapons that may one day be 
used by terrorists to gas american or israeli citizens hunter

in early 1986 easterns former ceo frank borman said the company 
had to be fixed sold or tanked with the iam at that time in 
1986 refusing to join all other employees in the effort to fix the 
company by agreeing like all other employees did to 20 percent pay 
cuts at that time eastern only narrowly avoided extinction by texas 
airs purchase of it 
later that year i joined eastern and we put forward a sixpoint 
plan to fix eastern if you will to turn it around and only one 
of those points involved changes in labor costs 
the other points involved making eastern an ontime airline for 
the first time in its history for expanding its consumer 
reservations reach into travel agencies and we were clearly 
successful in both of those objectives 
but the labor problem obviously took front stage and one of the 
reasons for that is a federal agency called the national mediation 
board that literally threw all pretense of neutrality to the wind 
kept eastern locked up in a fruitless destructive mediation process 
for 17 months while our losses grew alarmingly 
meanwhile some of our critics some of the union leaders engaged 
in what can only be described as a vicious vicious attack on the 
company and its management an organized litigation and 
disinformation campaign to smear the reputation of texas air of 
eastern and its management particularly frank lorenzo and to 
thwart our very efforts to provide working capital for the company 
through some liquidity programs 
you know if you step back the last several weeks have really 
seen the real issues at eastern airlines in my view unfortunately 
pushed to the background of the public debate instead some have 
framed the issues in large global terms almost defying rational 
boundaries 
they have tried to paint frank lorenzo who happens to be by 
the way the longest sitting ceo in the airline business today with 
16 continuous years in that role as some kind of corporate 
villain ignoring the fact that his efforts over the last 26 years 
in this business have created more aviation jobs than any other 
individual 
texas international in the early 1970s had 2500 employees and 
up until last week 60000 employees were under the texas air 
umbrella for those many years of building not destroying 
there has not been an honest debate of the issues that face 
eastern airlines for example the companys offer to the iam to 
guarantee all jobs for five years all jobs for five years to pay 
unskilled workers in a retraining program full pay while they get 
retrained to learn how to be technicians and mechanics so they could 
earn twice what theyre earning under the training program that 
hasnt been debated 
while trying to make this appear to be some kind of a national 
labor struggle between good and evil no one is even seriously 
debating the fact that the pilots union leadership decision to 
cripple the company defies rationality 
consider that their members average nearly 100000 a year in 
wages and benefits and the company proposed no reductions in base 
pay we proposed job guarantees for five years guarantees that 
there would be no sale of additional aircraft at eastern airlines 
that there would be protection on their pay in the event the company 
was not successful and had to seek reorganization under the 
bankruptcy laws 
this proposal from a company that in the last 10 years has lost 
one billion five hundred million dollars and that last year lost 
460 million 
the pilot union decision to ground easterns planes has been 
described i think accurately as professional suicide it almost 
defies explanation even in the context of a hard fought labor 
battle 
alpas leaders and financial adviser however have said publicly 
for some time that they are prepared for bankruptcy and in fact 
welcome actually welcome a bankruptcy process so that they could 
achieve their stated goal of seeking control of the airline 
the pilots union action has forced the bankruptcy filing they 
say they are prepared for but however prepared the financial 
adviser and the coterie of lawyers may be and the pilot union 
leaders whose salaries will continue how ever prepared they are for 
bankruptcy i wonder i wonder how prepared the eastern pilots and 
their families are for that process how prepared can those whose 
livelihood and standards of living and family security depend on 
flying easterns 200 plus airplanes most of which sit idle today 
how prepared can they be 
when the giddiness and emotional solidarity wears off and the 
picket line is no longer the selfdeluded battle between good and 
evil how will the real issues be resolved 
as a management not only with a personal stake in the outcome 
and im not ashamed to say a strong emotional attachment to this 
company but also with clear fiduciary obligations to the 
constituencies of the corporation including our investors including 
our creditors we tried mightily to keep eastern from bankruptcy 
but we also feel very strongly that we will be able to protect those 
interests of the creditors and those interests of investors and 
shareholders in the process that we have been driven to 
we expect and intend that all creditors will be fully safe that 
investors will realize a value and a fair return and that a 
restructured and revitalized although somewhat smaller eastern 
airlines will be flying and will be serving the traveling public for 
many years to come and most importantly to me at least is 
providing many more jobs to the eastern professional men and women 
who have had the cloud of failure hanging over their heads for many 
years and who have brought the airline in recent months to the 
number one position in ontime performance and i think theyll be 
able to do it again

federal prosecutors urged the jury in the fawaz 
younis sky piracy trial to find the defendant guilty and to reject 
his claim that he led the hijacking of a plane from beirut in 1985 
on orders from the lebanese militia to which he belonged 
hijacking said prosecutor karen morrissette is a violation of 
international law 
the defendant cannot hijack an airplane then come into a 
courtroom in this country and say well someone told me to do it 
and its alright she said 
the hijackers were trying to deliver a political message the 
prosecutor told the jury 
you can send a message to that hijacker she said 
younis 30 has pleaded innocent in the case considered a test 
of a 1984 statute asserting longarm jurisdiction for the united 
states over the taking of american hostages abroad 
the prosecution suffered a blow earlier in the day as us 
district judge aubrey e robinson jr blocked testimony from a 
government lawyer seeking to rebut the defendants claim he was just 
following military orders in hijacking a plane from beirut in 1985 
with the jury out of the room w hays parks chief of the 
international affairs division for the us armys advocate general 
argued that younis defense did not meet the standards of 
international or military law 
unable to introduce parks testimony as evidence federal 
prosecutors gave the robinson proposed instructions for the jury 
and morrissette indicated in her closing argument that the judge had 
accepted the major points that parks sought to present 
seeking to appear for the government as an expert witness parks 
said that lebanons amal militia to which younis belonged was not 
a legitimate military organization because its combatants did not 
wear uniforms and attacked civilians 
parks who heard younis testify earlier this week said that the 
defendant ought to have known that hijacking a plane with civilians 
aboard was a violation of international law 
if a soldier receives an illegal order he has not only a right 
but a duty to disobey that order said parks who is a colonel in 
the marine corps reserves 
after listening to parks robinson said i respect the expertise 
of colonel parks but he will not testify before the jury 
robinson said that he not parks would instruct the jury on the 
law in the case and anticipated an appeal from government lawyers 
if younis is acquitted on the defense of following a superiors 
order 
i may well be wrong he said i have been wrong before 
if it gets to the supreme court it will get there said 
robinson 
government attorneys said that the ruling was not unexpected and 
gave robinson a proposed written jury instruction containing parks 
arguments 
the path taken by the defense arguing that younis was just 
following orders appeared to cause consternation among officials 
from the justice and defense departments and intelligence agencies 
who have been attending the trial 
defense counsel francis d carter put his client on the stand for 
two days 
younis testified wednesday that the lebanese amal militia was in 
a state of war when its military commander aqil hamiyya 
ordered him to hijack the plane 
hijacking a plane is a wartime operation said younis 
younis said he was not proud of his actions but i was 
carrying out an order given to me by my military commander i was 
trying to serve my country in the best way i knew how he said 
i believe in actions that serve my people and my country 
prosecutors have produced five witnesses who identified younis as 
the man who led four other heavily armed men aboard royal jordanian 
airlines flight 402 in beirut on june 11 1985 
younis was arrested on sept 13 1987 by fbi agents who lured 
him aboard a yacht in international waters in the mediterranean sea 
the defense counsel has argued that fbi agents coerced a 
confession out of younis during four days aboard a navy munitions 
ship while he was suffering from seasickness and two broken wrists 
the hairline fractures were discovered after younis was flown to the 
united states and arraigned and an appeals court has ruled that the 
confession was valid

the chairman of the senate budget committee 
predicted thursday that in new budget talks the bush administration 
would agree to only a minimalist approach to deficit reduction 
this year but would later open the door for tax increases 
sen james sasser at a press breakfast hours before the start of 
talks on the fiscal 1990 budget reasserted his position that tax 
increases were needed to reduce the deficit 
and he said that president bushs budget director richard 
darman privately agreed an assertion that darman said was untrue 
privately darman believes were going to have to have revenues 
to run this government said sasser dtenn 
darman is a very bright guy he knows the score that if 
youre going to have any meaningful reduction in the deficit in the 
short term youre going to need some additional revenues sasser 
said 
darman had told him privately he said at some juncture he 
wouldnt be averse to taking new revenues to the president but not 
this year 
in the meantime sasser predicted the administration would insist 
on a minimalist approach to the fiscal 1990 budget which under 
the grammrudman law is supposed to reduce the deficit to 100 
billion or less 
theyre going to try to meet these targets at the front end 
with overly optimistic economic assumptions and pray that the 
markets will swallow it he said 
meeting the more stringent future targets of the law which calls 
for a balanced budget by fiscal 1993 would be left for next year 
he said and congress would in the end go along with putting things 
off he predicted 
what else can we do if we pass new revenues the president 
will veto them and give us a lot of political heat 
at a session with reporters later in the day darman disagreed 
with how sasser characterized his position 
i cant imagine he would have said that darman said asked 
whether he was more favorable to a tax increase than his public 
statements have indicated darman said maybe thats what he would 
like to believe 
he said the white house and congressional leaders have already 
discussed sharing the blame if stringent and unpopular actions 
become necessary in the deficitreduction package 
darman said that he and bush continued to oppose any new taxes 
although he conceded that when talks got down to fine detail 
probably not in the twoweek round of discussions beginning thursday 
there might be some small flexibility 
as an example of what the administration might accept he said a 
customs service fee was scheduled to decline and congress might 
want to keep it instead of losing 200 million in revenue 
but in terms of accepting a major tax boost he said i do not 
foresee the circumstance where we will be in that position 
darman also said he found good news in a congressional budget 
office report released thursday which projected the deficit next 
year at 131 billion or 40 billion higher than white house 
estimates 
most of the difference was because of a 22 billion disagreement 
over how to account in the budget for bushs plan to bail out the 
savings and loan system if that dispute were put aside the deficit 
would still be below the threshold at which the grammrudman law 
would require automatic spending cuts

the bush administration spurred by the bloody 
riots in venezuela is putting together a new approach to the heavy 
debt burden being carried by third world countries a problem that 
treasury secretary nicholas brady has called perhaps the most 
difficult facing the new administration 
the new plan or at least some details of what it will contain 
could be revealed as early as friday when brady is scheduled to 
address a private conference on third world debt at the state 
department 
after winning the election president bush said he favored taking 
a whole new look at us policy on third world debt and he 
ordered brady to launch a review at the treasury department 
bushs comments have raised hopes that the new administration 
will respond favorably to pleas from debtor countries that they face 
economic and political chaos without major debt relief 
those pleas gained new urgency last week when more than 300 
people died in riots in venezuela sparked by government imposition 
of tough austerity measures to please creditors 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that a 
white house review of proposals being generated by the treasury 
department had been underway for several days and was continuing 
other officials indicated that brady would likely begin outlining 
the new approach at fridays conference and would follow the speech 
with a more detailed report to congress in the coming weeks 
according to sources who have been involved in discussions with 
treasury department officials the administration plan will 
encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the 
third world debt they hold 
to encourage this debt reduction the administration is 
considering a variety of enticements including some type of loan 
guarantees on the reduced level of debt that would still be held by 
the banks 
also under consideration are a proposal to increase the size of 
tax deductions banks could take for losses on latin loans and a 
proposal to lower the amount of money banks are forced to hold in 
reserve to cover loan losses 
but it is the loan guarantees that are attracting the most 
attention these guarantees might take the form of assurances that 
the 151nation world bank or its sister institution the 
international monetary fund would make debt or interest payments if 
a debtor country defaulted 
a bush administration strategy emphasizing debt forgiveness even 
on a limited and voluntary basis would mark a major change from the 
reagan administrations approach which became known as the baker 
plan after thentreasury secretary james a baker iii 
bakers strategy emphasized new lending on the part of banks the 
imf and the world bank to countries that agreed to adopt economic 
reforms the idea was that the new money would spur the debtor 
countries economies making them more creditworthy 
in reality under the baker plan commercial banks lent relatively 
little in new funds and the debtor countries wound up paying out far 
more in interest and principal than they were receiving in new 
financing 
the morgan guaranty trust co estimates that the foreign debt of 
the 15 principal borrowers including 10 latin american countries 
rose to 505 billion last year with interest the countries had to 
pay totalling 42 billion 
baker who is now secretary of state did lend support to some 
limited debtreduction measures but he rejected a variety of more 
ambitious plans offered by such people as sen bill bradley dnj 
and james robinson iii the chairman of the american express co 
the proposals under review by the bush administration were 
praised thursday by economists as a more realistic approach to the 
debt problem 
the reality of the situation is that something different has to 
be done the idea of throwing good money after bad just hasnt 
worked said cynthia latta a financial economist with data 
resources inc it has just left them deeper in debt and is leading 
to great political instability in the debtor countries 
brady referring to the administration review last week said 
that the urgency of the problem had not been lost on the new 
administration 
perhaps the most difficult of the major issues facing us at the 
outset of the bush administration is the problem of third world 
debt brady said in a speech to the american bankers association 
unlike the federal budget deficit or even the savings and loan 
industry crisis this is not a problem that we in the us have the 
power or the resources to solve by ourselves 
the debt owed by all third world countries totaled 132 trillion 
at the end of 1988 up from 800 billion in 1982 the year the debt 
crisis first erupted with the announcement by mexico that it could 
not meet its obligations 
the largest debtor country is brazil with 110 billion owed 
followed by mexico with 107 billion owed other big debtors are 
argentina 50 billion and venezuela 33 billion

television evangelist pat robertson who once

a new record the federal election commission said 
the commission gave robertson 243296 this week boosting him 
over the 101 million record set in 1984 by thenpresident reagans 
reelection campaign said scott moxley a spokesman for the

reagans 1984 allotment later was reduced to about 975 million 
moxley said 
candidates who meet certain fundraising and votegathering 
thresholds are eligible to get matching money from the federal 
treasury to help pay for their campaigns in the presidential 
primaries 
the major parties presidential nominees then have their entire 
campaigns paid for by the taxpayers with the candidates receiving 
equal funding last year republican george bush and democrat michael 
dukakis received 461 million each for their general election 
campaigns that money is separate from the money provided during the 
primaries 
dukakis received 9 million in matching funds for his campaign in 
the primaries and bush received nearly 84 million 
among the other 1988 candidates democrat jesse jackson got 
almost 8 million republican bob dole received 76 million and 
republican jack kemp received almost 6 million 
in all the federal government paid nearly 667 million in 
matching funds to 15 candidates in last years primary campaigns 
early in the campaign robertson had said that he was 
philosophically opposed to government funding for presidential 
campaigns and that he would not accept it 
however after a string of losses robertsons campaign got into 
a financial pinch and he took the government money 
in yearend papers filed with the federal election commission 
robertsons campaign reported that it was nearly half a million 
dollars in debt 
in another presidential funding matter the commission on 
thursday ordered the campaign of former delaware gov pierre s du 
pont iv a republican to repay 23254 to the treasury the 
commission ruled that costs of a central telephone bank caused the 
du pont campaign to exceed the spending limits set for the campaigns 
during the iowa caucuses

three army officers have been 
arrested in the massacre of 10 peasants and at least one will be 
indicted judiciary and government sources said thursday 
an indictment would mark an unprecedented effort to apply 
civilian rule to the military said the sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
another officer a colonel and commander of an army brigade 
has been removed from his command because of his alleged link to the 
killings they said 
the arrests followed strong pressure from the united states to 
investigate civilian killings including the peasant massacre sept 
21 in the hamlet of san francisco four miles south of san sebastian 
what we all want to avoid is punishing only the scapegoats 
judge alcides guandique said in an interview guandique will 
announce this month who will be tried by a jury in the case 
sources said at least one of the three officers arrested will be 
among those indicted 
the united nations local and international human rights groups 
and churches have blamed government security forces for the torture 
and murder of thousands of leftists during the 9yearold war 
guerrillas have waged against the government 
eight soldiers have been convicted six for killing us 
citizens no officer has ever been tried and the army has denied 
any involvement in death squad killings 
according to witnesses and relatives the peasant massacre 
occurred when soldiers from the jiboa battalion marched into san 
francisco home to about 15 families they detained most of the 
residents in a oneroom school and accused them of collaborating 
with guerrillas witnesses and relatives said 
working from a list the troops selected seven men and three 
women took them to a nearby ravine and killed them with explosives 
and rifle fire according to documents and witness accounts 
the army at first said the dead were guerrillas killed in an army 
ambush it later said the victims were detainees killed in a 
guerrilla ambush while being marched away 
vice president dan quayle visited el salvador last month and told 
the high command that el salvadors tradition of military immunity 
for human rights abuses must end and that the san francisco killers 
must be punished 
the united states provides el salvador a country of about 5 
million with about 15 million a day in economic and military aid 
what do we have to say no convicted officer no more aid 
thats too blunt but quayle was unambiguously talking about 
continued aid said a high us official on condition of anonymity 
the army version of the peasant killings is about to change 
according to government and judiciary officials with access to 
preliminary conclusions of an army tribunal investigating the 
slayings simultaneously with guandiques inquiry 
remove from your head any doubt that they might have been 
killed by anyone but the soldiers said a government official 
four jiboa soldiers a corporal and three privates were 
charged with murder by guandiques predecessor but guandique said 
there is no indication the four did the killing 
they are kind of scapegoats unlucky enough to have been 
recognized the judge said he said he has taken sworn testimony 
from about 20 soldiers present the day of the killings 
the three arrested officers were in san francisco on sept 21 
according to military sources and carlos castellon a lawyer for one 
of the officers lt arnoldo vasquez 
castellon and the sources identified the other officers as 
intelligence maj mauricio beltran and lt manuel galvez 
col jose chavez caceres commander of the 5th army brigade and 
the jiboa battalion has been removed from his post but is not 
directly implicated in the massacre military sources said 
his responsibility appears to be limited to believing his 
subordinates said one source 
1988 was the first year in five that number of civilian killings 
rose from the previous year the roman catholic churchs legal aid 
office says 261 people were killed last year 67 percent more than 
in 1987 
the church blamed security forces for 92 of the killings and 
death squads for 60 guerrillas fighting the government were blamed 
for 44 summary executions

a twostar army general who commanded the 
walter reed army medical center in washington died earlier this week 
after sustaining injuries in a parachute accident in honduras the 
pentagon said thursday 
maj gen james h rumbaugh 49 was being evacuated by airplane 
from the soto cano air base outside comayugua honduras on 
wednesday night when he suffered an apparent heart attack the 
pentagon said in a prepared statement 
a day earlier on tuesday rambaugh suffered apparent abdominal 
injuries while making a parachute jump from a helicopter officials 
said the general was in honduras participating in the annual ahuas 
tara 89 exercise with a forward surgical deployment team the 
pentagon added 
maj gen rumbaugh an experienced parachutist had 
participated in a parachute jump with members of the 44th medical 
brigade at about 730 am on march 7 the pentagon said in a 
prepared statement 
he went about his normal duties immediately after the jump 
several hours later he sought medical attention for abdominal 
pains 
according to defense sources who insisted on anonymity 
physicians in honduras discovered bleeding around rumbaughs 
abdominal wall and recommended he be flown to the brooke army 
medical center 
preliminary information indicates that the general suffered 
cardiac arrest on the airplane and physicians were unable to 
resuscitate him the pentagon said in its statement 
an autopsy will be performed at walter reed to determine the 
cause of death 
one source said the plane carrying rumbaugh was diverted to 
cancun mexico when the twostar general failed to respond to 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation the plane landed in cancun around 8 
pm wednesday but rumbaugh was pronounced dead a few minutes 
later the official said 
his body was then flown on to kelly air force base in san antonio 
wednesday night 
gen rumbaugh was a 24year army veteran whose assignments 
included one as surgeon for the xviii airborne corps at fort bragg 
nc the home of the 82nd airborne division the pentagon said 
the general was jumping in honduras as part of his regional 
oversight responsibilities as commander of walter reed 
the pentagon declined to elaborate but several pentagon 
officials said it was unusual for a twostar general to participate 
in parachute jumps and that rumbaugh would have been under no 
requirement to perform such jumps 
rumbaugh took command of the armys most prestigious hospital 
center last august a native of washington pa rumbaugh earned a 
degree in history from thiel college and then earned his medical 
degree from the thomas jefferson university school of medicine in

of psychiatry posts including a tour in vietnam with the 1st 
cavalry division he later worked as an alcohol and drug control 
officer before taking command of the medical organization serving 
the xviii airborne corps at fort bragg 
rumbaugh served from june 1985 to july 1986 as the deputy 
commander at walter reed then two years as the director of 
professional services for the army surgeon general before assuming

the democraticcontrolled senate today rejected 
the nomination of former texas sen john tower as defense secretary 
delivering a major rebuke to president bush just 49 days into his 
term 
the senates 5347 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate 
focused on towers drinking habits behavior toward women and his 
business dealings with defense contractors 
it was only the ninth time in 200 years that the senate has voted 
to reject a presidents cabinet choice and the only time it has done 
so early in a new administration 
vice president dan quayle presided over the senate during the 
roll call underscoring bushs commitment to the nominee the senate 
galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats 
as the roll was called 
the nomination of john tower to be secretary of defense is not 
confirmed quayle intoned after the vote 
kansas gop sen nancy kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of 
the final hours of debate when she became the sole republican to 
declare her opposition she said her most serious concerns were 
over towers activities as a defense consultant after serving as an 
arms control negotiator she also expressed doubts that he would pay 
enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military 
towers republican defenders began to speak of him in the past 
tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat even before 
the roll was called 
just moments ago i took a call from john tower said sen 
john warner of virginia the senior gop member of the senate armed 
services committee 
his head is high his voice is strong warner said he 
asked me to convey thanks in his words to the troops who rallied 
to his support 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine moved to repair 
damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the senate 
and president bush 
i know whats in my heart and in my mind he told reporters 
i want to directly clearly and unambiguously say that this 
doesnt represent an effort to be harmful to the president 
dole agreed to a lateafternoon vote on the nomination after 
acknowledging the collapse of a lastminute bid to give tower an 
extraordinary sixmonth trial period as defense secretary to prove 
he could abstain from drinking 
there was no doubt about the outcome as the senate went through 
the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours 
before the roll call 
the last few undecided senators declared their positions sen 
john b breaux dla said he would vote against tower sen james 
m jeffords rvt said he would support the nomination 
senators from both parties credited towers defeat to the 
decision to oppose him made by sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
armed services committee 
when he made his decision all the other democrats wheeled in 
behind him said sen john chafee rri 
with the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said if necessary well come up 
with a new candidate very rapidly 
names most frequently mentioned in white house speculation as a 
replacement for tower if his nomination failed are sen warner a 
former secretary of the navy former defense secretary donald 
rumsfeld former rep jack edwards rala and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft 
scowcroft replied no when asked this morning if he was in 
line for the pentagon job 
it must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and 
the national security adviser any number of congressmen and 
senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on 
the tip of their tongue fitzwater said 
but the time has not come he added the time will come as 
soon as the vote is completed we will wait until then 
the most recent associated press survey showed 52 democrats and 
one republican committed to vote against tower or leaning strongly 
in that direction it showed 41 republicans and three democrats 
declared for tower or leaning his way 
nevertheless the white house said it wanted to see the 
nomination go all the way to a vote 
tower meanwhile reported for work at the pentagon where he and 
his three daughters had coffee together he then continued a review 
of various administration proposals 
i hope and believe we can work together on important matters 
mitchell said the tension of this issue will have no longlasting 
effect on the relationship i want to say from the bottom of my 
heart that i hope this will be the case 
the already slim chance tower would be confirmed was dealt a 
crushing blow on wednesday as a parade of previously undecided 
democratic senators announced they would vote no 
only democrat lloyd bentsen of texas said he would vote yes 
joining just two other democrats who have made that decision 
sens charles robb dva joseph lieberman dconn j bennett 
johnston dla dale bumpers dark and claiborne pell dri 
all said they would vote against tower 
johnston said his reading of the fbi report on tower leaves him 
with the clear impression that towers personality changes when he 
drinks heavily leading to a recklessness in the social sense 
entirely different from his behavior when sober

zenith electronics corp on thursday welcomed 
the governments decision to monitor television imports from mexico 
and malaysia saying the action could help curb the dumping of 
imported tvs at less than fairmarket value 
acting at zeniths request the commerce department last week 
agreed to monitor imports of complete and incomplete color 
televisions from the two countries 
zenith president and chairman jerry k pearlman said the 
monitoring program should help reduce schemes in which manufacturers 
in the far east who have been found guilty of dumping then evade 
antidumping penalties by establishing assembly operations in other 
countries such as mexico and malaysia 
the monitoring program which will last up to a year will 
determine whether there has been evidence of dumping from the two 
countries sufficient to warrant a fullscale antidumping 
investigation 
pearlman said color tv imports from mexico and malaysia are 
almost as large as those from japan korea and taiwan combined 
mexico has become the principal source of color tvs in the us 
and imports from malaysia have now surpassed those from japan he 
said 
zenith in december had asked the government to monitor imports 
from malaysia mexico singapore hong kong china thailand and the 
philippines 
the department said it decided to monitor imports from mexico and 
malaysia because it has reason to believe or suspect that an 
extraordinary pattern of persistent injurious dumping exists and is 
causing a serious commercial problem for the domestic tv industry 
the agency said the request to monitor imports from the other 
countries did not meet the statutory threshold for establishing a 
monitoring program 
antidumping orders now in place cover tvs from japan korea and 
taiwan and color picture tubes from japan korea canada and 
singapore zenith said

problem long before encountering the stresses of her husbands 
public life and she added i dont blame the presidential 
campaign for my being an alcoholic 
mrs dukakis 52 spoke at a news conference two days after 
completing a monthlong rehabilitation program at edgehill newport 
in rhode island 
she said her drinking became a serious problem in the three 
terribly painful and lonely months after her husbands defeat 
any crisis could have led to the drinking she said the 
campaign was a very positive experience the only problem is that we 
lost

accompanying mrs dukakis were her husband and her father harry

she said were all going to be part of the program 
mrs dukakis said she was ready to resume her speaking career and 
noted she would continue working on a book

occasional glass of wine

provides an opportunity for growth and learning she wrote the

a housesenate committee exploring rest home 
abuses viewed color slides of neglected residents thursday and 
heard gripping testimony from a survivor of a california home in 
which seven bodies were found buried in the yard 
rep claude pepper dfla released a report attributing 
problems at the homes in part to neglect by states and the decision 
about 25 years ago to move away from putting mentally ill persons 
into institutions 
pepper and the joint panel of the house and senate aging 
committees focused their attention on socalled board and care 
homes 
in different states the homes are called everything from rest 
homes group or personal care homes to domiciliaries they provide 
rooms meals and help with daily routines but not regular medical 
care such as provided by nursing homes 
john sharp 64 testified that he was a survivor of the 
unlicensed sacramento calif home run by dorothy puente seven 
bodies were found buried in puentes yard and she was charged last 
november with murder 
i often wonder why i was spared a terrible fate at the puente 
home sharp said 
he recalled seeing her going through residents mail and 
wondering why residents seemed to be disappearing from the home 
he said a pivotal moment came when he refused to allow her to 
begin receiving and cashing his government checks 
i told her that those checks were my lifeline and i couldnt 
trust them to anyone but myself i didnt turn over my social 
security checks to her and looking back thats probably what saved 
my life he said 
the report released by pepper was prepared by the house select 
committee on agings health subcommittee of which he is chairman 
many of the reports conclusions echoed those of a similar study 
released wednesday night by the general accounting office 
peppers report termed board and care homes a national 
tragedy 
we found that most of the one million elderly disabled and 
mentally ill persons who reside in board and care homes are being 
warehoused in understaffed underegulated shoddy and unsafe 
facilities pepper said 
the report identified many board and care residents as former 
state mental hospital inhabitants who were released in the 1960s as 
part of a push to place such patients in community settings 
the panel also heard a scratchy secretlyrecorded tape of an 
alabama board and care operator slapping a resident and describing 
how she had shot a woman for pulling her wig off 
the unidentified operator was described by jefferson county 
ala ombudsman julie oetting at the hearing as a convicted 
murderer 
earlier pepper 88 narrated slides of residents bound to 
wheelchairs and lying on floors and homes without proper fire 
safety equipment in maryland he said an owner continued to house 
11 residents in a burntout home without adequate fire safety 
equipment 
board and care homes typically serve many residents who rely on 
supplemental security income to pay the bills 
new jersey attorney david lazarus and rep james florio dnj 
used the analogy of a dog in a kennel to describe the lack of public 
commitment to rest home residents 
on average it costs 11 per day to board a 70pound dog in new 
jersey astonishingly new jersey board and care residents dependent 
upon ssi receive a low of 1130 to a high of just under 16 for 
their lodging meals and care in a board and care home florio 
said 
and in states that do not supplement the federal ssi amount 
the daily rates are even lower he said 
barbara jameson of the national association of residential care 
facilities said in an interview that she hoped the hearing would not 
convey the impression that the mistreatment was widespread 
i really dont believe there is widespread abuse she said 
i think there is far more abuse in biological families 
unfortunately than in licensed care homes

president bush on thursday vowed to waste no 
time starting a massive cleanup of tons of radioactive waste and 
widespread soil contamination from the energy departments 12state 
nuclear weapons complex 
at a swearingin ceremony for energy secretary james d watkins 
the president said the departments top priority is modernizing the 
weapons plants which have badly deteriorated and in some cases 
been forced to shut down 
this task is critical bush told an audience of several 
hundred energy department employees he added that the environmental 
cleanup also was important 
these problems developed over time and theyll be fully solved 
only over time but well waste no time getting started on fixing 
these problems bush said 
the weapons complex including nuclear reactors processing 
manufacturing and assembly plants and laboratories build and test 
the pentagons nuclear arsenal which is a vital element in the 
nations defense strategy 
the department in the waning days of the reagan administration 
issued a broadbrush plan for spending 81 billion over the next 21 
years to modernize and begin cleaning up the weapons complex bush 
has not explicitly endorsed the plan 
watkins said his main goal was to instill a new more responsible 
attitude in energy department workers that would lead to sounder 
practices in the nuclear field 
nuclear power demands no less than the best from all who 
control it he said this then is exactly what i ask of my 
department a commitment to excellence 
so i ask you to help me forge in the workplace a culture that 
rejects the mediocre and substandard 
watkins was confirmed by the senate last week and has moved 
quickly to begin developing a comprehensive strategy for dealing 
with the nuclear weapons problem his department however is still 
lacking bush appointees to key positions 
the white house announced thursday that bush intends to nominate 
john c tuck to be under secretary of energy the no 3 job 
replacing donna r fitzpatrick tuck served in several posts in the 
reagan administration including director of the chief of staffs 
office during the administrations final six months 
bush last month said he planned to nominate former rep henson 
moore of louisiana as deputy energy secretary the no 2 position 
but no confirmation hearing has been set because the nomination has 
not been forwarded to the senate energy and natural resources 
committee committee staffer nancy blush said thursday 
watkins has circulated a memo to department employees around the 
country spelling out some of his priorities including developing 
fiveyear objectives for waste cleanup at each of the nuclear 
weapons sites department spokeswoman christina sankey said 
other priorities mentioned in the memo include legislation to 
remove the remaining price controls on natural gas moving ahead 
with the 59 billion superconducting super collider project to 
study the nature of matter and energy pushing legislation to allow 
oil exploration on the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife 
refuge in alaska and developing an integrated national energy 
policy 
watkins also stressed a need to restart the reactors at savannah 
river near aiken sc that produce a perishable gas needed to 
manufacture nuclear warheads the three reactors there have been 
shut down since last spring for safety 
watkins said in the memo that he intended to have a more 
allinclusive set of objectives within three months

the bush administration said thursday it 
opposes the continuation of preferential tax breaks that federal 
regulators have been using to attract buyers for insolvent savings 
and loan associations 
unequivably we do not favor the continuation of favorable tax 
treatment white house budget director richard darman told the 
senate finance committee 
darman said the administration assumes that the scheduled january 
elimination will proceed of a tax break allowing purchasers of 
insolvent sampls to exclude from taxable income 50 percent of whatever 
aid they get from federal insurors for paying off depositors in the 
acquired institutions 
meanwhile the federal deposit insurance corp on thursday took 
control of an additional 45 failed savings and loans with 136 
billion in assets in eight states 
that brings to 118 in 24 states the total number of institutions 
the agency has taken control of since bush announced his sampl rescue 
package in early february 
until this year purchasers of insolvent sampls could avoid paying 
taxes on 100 percent of whatever they received from the fslic the 
agency that insured sampl depositors against losses up to 100000 in 
each account much as the fdic insures commercial bank depositors 
against losses 
before the 100 percent fslic aid exclusion was cut in half jan 
1 1989 sampl regulators used it in december it as a lure in 
attracting buyers for 75 insolvent thrift institutions 
the federal home loan bank board which until february also ran 
the insurance fund as well as regulating sampls estimated the tax 
revenue losses to the treasury from the december action at 4 
billion 
but rep dan rostenkowski dill and chairman of the house ways 
and means committee said thursday that the tax benefits in the 
december resolutions could be more than 7 billion 
another tax incentive for sampls scheduled to expire at the end of 
1989 allows net operating losses of an insolvent sampl to be 
transferred to its new owner who can use them to reduce taxes that 
would otherwise be owed 
both the general accounting office and the congressional budget 
office have recommended against continuing the tax breaks 
fdic chairman william seidman in his new role in the sampl crisis 
has called for continuing the tax breaks beyond this year 
he told congress last month that the tax breaks would reduce the 
impact of the sampl bailout to the federal budget and promised to use 
them to minimize the governments total cost 
sen david durenberger rminn and rep pete stark dcalif 
introduced bills wednesday to repeal the tax breaks immediately upon 
passage of bushs sampl bailout proposal instead of waiting until 
january 
in other developments 
congressional budget office director robert d reischauer told 
the senate appropriations committee that bushs fiscal 1990 deficit 
will total 131 billion rather than the administrations projected 
911 billion about 22 billion of the 40 billion difference is 
attributable to different accounting treatment of the sampl rescue he 
said 
rep thomas r carper ddel said he and other members of the 
house banking committee are looking into whether the stock of the 
regional federal home loan banks should be opened up to public 
ownership the stock is currently owned only by sampls which could 
benefit if the price of the stock rose after public trading was 
allowed

school districts would have a freer hand with 
federal dollars and the president would lead an offensive to improve 
math and science performance under a restructuring plan proposed 
thursday by an influential education group 
the blueprint from the national center on education and the 
economy also proposes extensive day care and early childhood 
education and recommends second chances for adult workers who are 
functionally illiterate or lack adequate job skills 
to secure our future the federal role in education comes 
three years after the group then known as the carnegie forum on 
education and the economy released a nation prepared teachers 
for the 21st century a wellreceived plan to upgrade the teaching 
profession 
apple computer president john sculley chairs the center board and 
new york gov mario cuomo is the honorary chairman other board 
members include former north carolina gov jim hunt former labor 
secretary ray marshall and pollster lou harris 
sculley speaking to a news conference by telephone hookup said 
the report has been presented to president bush white house chief 
of staff john sununu and education secretary lauro cavazos 
he said he did not know whether any of the proposals would be 
included in an education bill now being drafted at the white house 
but said bush was extremely interested in what we had to say and 
we do believe we have the presidents ear in terms of how 
important it is for him to come out early in his term for massive 
education reform 
center president marc tucker said at a news conference that the 
latest report envisions a whole new intergovernmental 
partnership that doesnt necessarily involve more money 
first go for quality the report says second reward 
success in producing quality third let the people on the firing 
line figure out how to get the job done and get rid of as much of 
the bureaucracy as possible 
the reports major proposal is patterned on the process that 
produced the nations new welfare law that law reflects many of the 
solutions developed by states during several years of 
experimentation when they were allowed to transfer federal money 
from existing programs to their own innovative projects 
unencumbered by many rules regulations and red tape 
the center recommends a very large experiment that would 
provide the information needed for a general redrafting of the basic 
federal programs later 
school districts could design initiatives to improve student 
performance ease the transition from school to work for potential 
dropouts or coordinate social services for disadvantaged students 
the report says the money would come from existing programs in the 
labor education justice and health and human services departments 
local communities if their proposals were approved by state and 
federal governments would be free to combine the available state 
and federal funds as they wish they would continue to be free

the performance targets they had set 
in other areas the center said 
bush should push the nation toward lofty math and science 
performance goals in an allout effort reminiscent of president 
kennedys space exploration program tucker said bush should 
identify the best performance anywhere in the world and resolve as 
a nation to meet it or beat it the report suggests several 
strategies including a revamped curriculum and a national center to 
teach teachers technology 
state federal and local agencies need to combine resources for 
highquality fulltime day care preschool child development centers 
and before and after school care programs so kids dont enter 
kindergarten as damaged goods already marked for failure 
the country must stop treating adult illiteracy as a personal 
misfortune rather than the threat to the nations standard of 
living that it really is the problem cant be solved by 
volunteers nor can employers be expected to foot the whole bill

with john towers defeat in the senate on 
thursday his name joins the likes of roger b taney caleb cushing 
and lewis l strauss on historys short list of failed cabinet 
nominees 
eight times before in its 200 years the senate voted to deny 
confirmation to a presidents choice for members of his cabinet 
tower president bushs nominee for secretary of defense became 
the ninth rejected by a vote of 5347 
towers defeat carries other distinctions too the first nominee 
to be voted down in nearly 30 years the first nominee of a 
justelected president to be defeated as the chief executive was 
shaping his first cabinet and the first former senator to be beaten 
in a senate floor vote 
still more presidential nominees have run afoul of the senate and 
failed to win confirmation according to a library of congress 
study in four cases the nominations were withdrawn rather than 
pressed to a vote as some had suggested tower might have done in 
two other cases nominations died in senate committees and thus 
werent put to a vote on the floor 
before tower the last rejection had been on june 19 1959 when 
strauss president dwight eisenhowers choice for secretary of 
commerce was beaten by 4946 
strauss had been on the job since the previous november having 
been appointed during a congressional recess but his earlier 
performance as chairman of the atomic energy commission he had made 
too many senate enemies 
the first senate reject was taney who was president andrew 
jacksons nominee for secretary of the treasury 
the senate voted 2818 to reject his nomination on june 24 1834 
although taney had been serving since the previous september 
jackson later appointed him chief justice and he won a senate 
confirmation vote 
president john tyler facing opposition in congress from his own 
whig party because of legislation he vetoed saw four cabinet 
nominees rejected 
he nominated cushing to be secretary of the treasury and on 
march 3 1843 the senate voted three times to reject tyler tried 
and failed again with a treasury nominee james s green was 
rejected on june 15 1844 although the vote was not recorded 
in january 1844 tylers nomination of david henshaw to be 
secretary of the navy and james madison porter to be secretary of 
war were both rejected porter got just three votes in his favor 
president andrew johnsons nomination of henry stanbery to be 
attorney general was rejected in 1868 he had held the job 
previously and stepped down to help johnsons fight against 
impeachment 
president calvin coolidges nomination of charles b warren as 
attorney general was rejected twice in one week in 1925 
sen robert byrd dwva speaking against towers nomination on 
wednesday recalled much of that history and said the constitutions 
requirement that nominations be made with the advice and consent 
of the senate does not specify that it vote 
the constitution does not say that we senators even have to 
vote on a nomination byrd said there have been nominations 
that have never been voted on and therefore never been confirmed 
there have been some that have been withdrawn

a burglar who ransacked a medical office 
stole a pistolshaped laser gun capable of blinding or burning a 
person up to 30 feet away with an invisible beam when plugged in 
authorities said 
investigators say the thief came across the gun during a breakin 
at a doctors office wednesday and took the sophisticated 20000 
piece of medical hardware apparently without knowing what it was 
they could just point it at somebody and blind them said 
palm beach county sheriffs sgt ken deischer we could have some 
serious problems with this 
dr martin shank the podiatrist from whose office the laser gun 
was stolen agreed the instrument is not a toy 
it can be disastrous in the wrong hands he said he said the 
guns light is invisible and will burn a hole in the eye the 
device has no warnings printed on it officials said 
the laser used to remove skin cancer ingrown toenails and fungi 
from feet can burn a hole through a hand at its most powerful 
setting 
it can also blind a person up to 30 feet away and ignite most 
nonmetallic materials flammable liquids and some explosive gases 
authorities said 
the laser gun was made by pfizer laser systems of irvine calif 
it weighs 10 ounces and looks like a small pistol with a long handle 
its power charger which was also taken is about the size of a 
business telephone the device takes only three seconds to warm up 
shank said the fact the laser gun must be plugged is encouraging 
the only consolation is knowing that these burglars arent 
going to be roaming the streets hurting people with it he said 
lawrence rutledge pfizer laser systems florida sales 
representative said from his orlando office that the laser is not 
like a flame thrower or anything 
but the manufacturer recommends several precautions such as 
wearing protective eyewear because the beam is easily reflected off 
shiny metal

to hear presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater tell it one would almost have thought the white house had 
won a great victory in the senate defeat of john towers nomination 
as defense secretary 
faced with putting a positive face on the first major defeat of 
the bush presidency and one with few historical precedants 
fitzwater decided on the old strength from adversity tact 
or as its known in political circles spin control 
meeting with reporters shortly before the nomination was 
rejected fitzwater said the battle had brought the republican party 
together toughened the bush team and showcased presidential traits 
of loyalty and decisiveness 
the struggle coming early in the administration brought 
everybody together and we all feel the better off for it and 
its been helpful in putting together a strong tough team thats 
ready to move on the spokesman claimed 
he was clearly anticipating the looming loss 
there is a certain strength that comes out of adversity he 
said weve fought a long fight hard and well out of this 
struggle has come good unity with the republican party 
we brought the administration team together and we feel that 
its been a tempering affair that should serve us well as we move 
forward 
what about all the bad feelings that developed between senate 
democrats and the white house enhanced by administration cries of 
partisanship 
fitzwater concluded that we have fought a very hard battle and 
weve done it on the high road and we think we have worked this 
nomination diligently but at the same time we have tried to do it 
in a way that didnt make enemies so that the white house can 
still work with capitol hill 
furthermore the press secretary contended everyone now knows 
that when bush makes an appointment that hell stick with it that 
hes willing to use the resources at his command that he stands for 
principle and what he believes in and we think those are all 
valuable traits to demonstrate early in a presidency 
finally fitzwater said that the fight enabled bush to solidify a 
working relationship with the republican leadership in the senate to 
help in future battles that he said is healthy and beneficial 
with losses like this one could almost ask who needs victories

government and opposition negotiators 
agreed thursday on free elections to a newly created senate in what 
could be the first democratic national elections in the communist 
bloc 
in addition the sides agreed to twostage elections to the 
existing sejm or parliament in which opposition candidates would 
be free to run for at least 35 percent of the seats 
politburo member janusz reykowski leader of the 
governmentcommunist party side at the talks said anyone could run 
for the senate who is nominated by an existing political or social 
group or who gathered 5000 signatures 
reykowski said that those elected and the resulting balance of 
power in the chamber will depend entirely on the voters 
there are no plans of any kind to arrange the composition 
before the elections are held he said 
opposition negotiator jacek kuron said later on state television 
we must admit that it is a step toward democracy such as has 
never been made anywhere else in this system 
it creates conditions in which citizens will be able to elect 
their real representatives to the top state authorities but there 
is a very important question whether it will be only the first 
step 
kuron is on the negotiations working group on political reform 
the talks have brought together polands powerful independent 
forces including the solidarity independent union movement and 
communist leaders to reshape the nations economic and political 
future 
the new senate and the sejm would form a new twochamber 
parliament called the national assembly negotiators said 
in addition the two sides agreed in principle to establish the 
post of president who would be elected by a majority of both 
chambers of parliament 
the powers of the president must still be discussed but in 
general the idea is to combine in one person all those powers now 
held by the council of state including appointing the head of the 
army and ambassadors in addition he would be given the right to 
dissolve parliament and call new elections 
there has been wide speculation that if a presidency is 
established the post would be filled by communist party first 
secretary gen wojciech jaruzelski 
opposition negotiators said obtaining agreement on completely 
free elections to the senate was part of a tradeoff for conceding 
that poland would have a strong presidency which likely would 
remain in communist party control 
elections to the senate and elections to the sejm would be held 
at the same time said solidarity spokesman janusz onszkiewicz the 
primary election date is tentatively set for june 4 and candidates 
who failed to win a 50 percent majority would compete in a runoff 
election june 18 he said 
rejkowski said the proposed new election law would be submitted 
to the sejm for approval as early as next week the communist party 
now has an absolute majority in the sejm and any laws proposed by 
the party are assured passage 
the senate would likely handle economic and social issues and 
civil rights said reykowski but the powers must still be 
negotiated by a panel of experts appointed by each side 
other negotiators have described the senate as a chamber that 
could exercise a right of veto over decisions of the sejm in such a 
system laws not approved by the senate would have to go back to the 
sejm and win a twothirds majority to be enacted 
there may be considerable disagreement and differences over the 
powers of the second chamber by the two sides reykowski said 
bronislaw geremek leader of the opposition team on political 
issues said entering into free elections poses risks for both sides 
he said the communist authorities for the first time will face 
a test of the basis of the ruling coalition but the opposition 
is at risk because it is completely unprepared for competition 
at the polls 
after 45 years in a political desert we suddenly find ourselves 
in an absolutely new situation he told a news conference 
solidarity under the leadership of lech walesa had refused to 
come to the negotiating table until the communist party agreed in 
principle to restore its legal status stripped away after the 
december 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
after meeting with top government officials tuesday walesa said 
the two sides hope to complete work and sign a new national accord 
on april 3

former education secretary william j bennett 
won senate confirmation thursday as head of the war on drugs with 
lawmakers urging him to waste no time in fashioning a strategy for 
fighting the invasion of illegal narcotics 
mr bennett is in for the fight of his life but more important 
he is in for the fight of our childrens lives sen alfonse 
damato rny said before the senate voted 972 for confirmation 
the opposition votes were cast by sens jeff bingaman dnm 
and paul simon dill sen john warner rva didnt vote 
the full senate acted hours after the judiciary committee voted 
131 to send bennetts nomination to the floor with a favorable 
recommendation 
following the tumultuous floor fight over president bushs 
nomination of former sen john tower as secretary of defense 
approval of bennett came easily despite controversy that swirled 
around his brash style and outspoken views as education secretary 
sen alan simpson rwyo told the senate that congressional 
oversight of the socalled drug czar must be streamlined or bennett 
will be forced to squander his time on sevencamera hearings on 
capitol hill instead of battling the tide of narcotics 
sen paul simon dill a longtime ally of teacher groups 
expressed concern on the senate floor that bennett would produce a 
blizzard of press releases but not much action 
he had told the judiciary committee earlier that bennett had 
sought a cut in the education departments drug education budget 
and as an administrator was not strong 
as head of the new office of national drug control policy 
bennett will be in charge of drawing up plans to attack the nations 
drug problems 
the drug czar is required to study the spending plans of 
cabinet officers and prod them to increase what they have designated 
for the war on drugs if he deems that is necessary disputes 
ultimately would be settled by the president 
ive been struck these last few weeks as ive met with people 
inside government and out by the pessimism many have about our 
mission in the war on drugs bennett told lawmakers last week 
sen patrick leahy dvt told the judiciary committee on 
thursday that bennett has a difficult job but it shouldnt be 
considered mission impossible 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel told lawmakers that the 
real issue was not about whether dr bennett is going to put 
together a strategy 
this is about whether president bush has a strategy whether he 
is going to enunciate that strategy and whether he is going to put 
that strategy into effect biden said 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina the top republican on the 
committee replied there was no question that bush was focusing hard 
on the drug problem 
i have been in the white house several times recently and i 
assure you that he is vitally interested thurmond said 
biden said he had no doubt that bush was interested but it 
remained to be seen if the interest would be matched by 
overwhelming commitment of resources and action

four senior scottish police officers have arrived 
in the united states and plan to visit families of the 259 victims 
of the pan am flight 103 bombing to clear up complaints about the 
crash investigation 
the officers said they will visit several cities to talk to 
relatives who complained that police have been too slow in releasing 
personal possessions of those who died in the terrorist bombing over 
scotland in december 
i lost a 16yearold daughter and she had four suitcases with 
her almost everything she owned said paul hudson a lawyer in 
albany ny who formed the 300member relatives support group 
victims of pan am 103 in february she had her christmas presents 
with her many of our memories of her were with her on that plane 
so far only five or six relatives of the victims have received 
any returned possessions hudson said 
its the last thing they have to remember their sons and 
daughters said north adams mayor jim barrett who represented 
several massachusetts families after the crash rings bracelets 
it would mean so much to them to get them back 
the british officers arrived in boston on wednesday night and 
flew to washington on thursday to meet with state department 
officials 
there has been some misinformation there has been some rumor 
about the release of possessions assistant chief constable paul 
newell told british television before he left for the united states 
we feel that to try to ease the frustrations of the relatives 
here we should come personally and explain to various groups of 
relatives exactly what the position is 
a letter from the families to prime minister margaret thatcher 
last month may have resulted in the visit said hudson 
its a very emotional time said joe horgan of west point 
pa whose brotherinlaw was on flight 103 the additional trauma 
of not having things returned means that the healing process cannot 
hit full stride 
horgan said the families understand that scottish law differs 
from american and authorities there do not want to release what they 
consider evidence in a criminal investigation 
but he said the families became upset after receiving a letter 
from a state department official last month that hinted that some 
victims luggage and clothing might be destrztat but it was found 
later to be false he said the families are not angry at scottish 
authorities who have been very sensitive to our needs 
state department officials did not return telephone calls 
thursday 
scottish police recovered more than 11000 items of property 
scattered over 845 square miles 
as ownership was established and the items were eliminated from 
the criminal inquiry the property started to be returned via the 
us consulate in midfebruary a police spokesman said 
the scottish police are scheduled to meet with families in new 
york on saturday and in boston on sunday travel to canton ohio on 
monday and see families in detroit on tuesday

federal mediators on thursday denied an 
accusation by eastern airlines management that they had not been 
neutral in dealing with the company and its machinists union 
eastern president phil bates in a new york news conference after 
the company filed for protection from its creditors under bankruptcy 
laws accused the national mediation board of throwing all 
pretense of neutrality to the wind in trying to mediate the 
17month dispute 
after more than a year of talks with the airline and its 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers local 
the twomember board said it couldnt resolve the dispute and asked 
president bush to create an emergency panel that would have delayed 
a strike by up to 60 days bush refused and the machinists went on 
strike saturday 
bates accused the board of keeping the company locked up in a 
fruitless destructive mediation process while the airlines 
losses grew 
it is regrettable that easterns management made adverse 
comments about the board said charles r barnes the executive 
director of the board which mediates transportation industry labor 
disputes but im sure in hindsight that the parties will conclude 
that the board acted professionally impartially and in full 
accordance with the legal responsibilities 
in a statement the board said the dispute in which eastern 
originally asked for 200 million in salary cuts while the union 
sought 50 million in raises was one of the most complex the board 
has had to mediate since the airline industry was deregulated in 
1978 
easterns bankruptcy filing is unfortunate for the carrier its 
employees the traveling public and the nations transportation 
system the board said 
board spokesman david bushnell said mediators continued to talk 
with both the union and the company but had not managed to bring the 
two sides together since the walkout

a witness testified thursday that oliver north 
was irritated about having to answer asinine questions from 
congress the first direct testimony that north drafted a letter 
denying he helped the nicaraguan contras 
the letter dated oct 7 1985 is at the heart of one of the 
criminal charges against north he is accused of having said falsely 
that he did not use his influence to get supplies to the nicaraguan 
resistance 
also during a day when three witnesses testified against north 
the former national security council aides lawyer tried to show 
that fundraiser carl channell had changed his story on a damaging 
conversation in which channell quotes north as not caring about 
lying to congress or going to jail 
later in the day daniel l conrad testified that thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane had received a letter from 
congress with 20 to 30 questions about fundraising activities 
colonel north said i just got this and im supposed to develop 
the answers conrad testified his boss had to testify and he 
north was supposed to draft the answers 
he angrily went through the questions he was irritated he had 
to take the time to develop answers to these asinine questions 
conrad who was a gobetween for channell and north said that in 
the same conversation north said he didnt want conrad to visit him 
so often in the white house complex because visitors logs were kept 
conrad who specialized in giving talks on fundraising 
testified that briefings about nicaragua by the state department 
failed to motivate people to help the contras he then heard north 
and there were light years of difference he was far superior 
exciting and motivated 
he said north told him that money raised by channell was turned 
over to a public relations firm international business 
communications from there it was sent to an account in the grand 
cayman islands then to a bank in switzerland and finally went to 
pay for supplies for the contras 
richard miller who ran ibc followed conrad to the witness 
stand he called north the point man for central american policy 
in the white house and said north once had him arrange to have 
contra leader alphonso robelo flown from costa rica to washington to 
be present at a fundraising meeting 
as channell was winding up his testimony north attorney brendan 
sullivan said yesterday you were putting the words in ollies 
mouth on other occasions he said channell either had left out 
the quotes on north not caring about lying to congress or going to 
jail or else attributed the words to nelson bunker hunt the other 
person in the conversation 
even us district judge gerhard gesell signaled his skepticism 
saying at one point that channell had offered three versions 
already that colonel north said what he did relating to these two 
questions 
on wednesday channell had testified at norths trial that on 
sept 11 1985 hunt a wealthy texan asked north if he were 
worried about getting in trouble for his activities on behalf of 
the rebels 
norths reply which channell said stuck in my mind was i 
dont care if i have to go to jail for this i dont care if i have 
to lie to congress about this 
the judge asked how do you explain to the jury it stuck in 
your mind and that you had no doubt about it 
sullivan who had led channell through gentle questioning for 
more than an hour said its hard to remember what was said 
sometimes when you have such an urge to cooperate there is a 
tendency to want to put words in peoples mouths 
he said channell never mentioned the north comments in interviews 
with government investigators in january and march 1987 and he 
suggested channell mentioned the conversation first a month later as 
a bargaining chip when he himself was plea bargaining with 
irancontra prosecutors 
but in later questioning prosecution lawyer michael bromwich 
brought out that records of those interviews were not stenographic 
transcrips but summaries and that channell had never been asked 
about either the go to jail or lie to congress statements 
were you ever told in words or substance give us ollie 
north the prosecutor asked 
no said channell 
were you ever told your sentence depended whether north would 
be convicted or acquitted 
no ive been told just the opposite 
the day after the hunt meeting the government charges in one of 
12 counts north drafted the letter signed by his boss mcfarlane 
in which he denied to a congressional committee that the national 
security council had a hand in fundraising for military aid to the 
nicaraguan contras official aid was at that time forbidden by law

after watching the senate vote to reject his 
nomination john tower walked to the private pentagon dining room 
reserved for the secretary of defense and said goodbye 
the former texas senator who by all accounts had longed to make 
that room his own had reported for work earlier in the day in a 
transition office upstairs 
now speaking in his clear deep baritone tower said he might be 
judged harshly by history but was returning to his home state at 
peace with myself knowing that i have given a full measure of 
devotion to my country 
the debate over towers bid to become the nations 17th defense 
secretary was dominated by allegations of excessive drinking and 
womanizing and concerns over towers lucrative defense consulting 
work after leaving the senate 
no public figure in my memory has been subjected to such a 
farreaching and thorough investigation nor had his human foibles 
bared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny tower said 
and yet there is no finding that i have ever breached 
established legal and ethical standards nor been derelict in my 
duty 
after undergoing weeks of personal scrutiny tower clearly had no 
intention thursday of subjecting himself to more 
he watched the senate vote on television and then appeared only 
briefly in the secretarys dining room before a tv camera and two 
reporters he stayed just long enough to read his statement 
looking dapper in his trademark threepiece pinstripe suit he 
declined to take any questions 
i will be recorded as the first cabinet nominee in the history 
of the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidency 
and perhaps be harshly judged tower said 
i am deeply grateful to our great president for his continuing 
confidence in me and his unflagging support in the most difficult of 
circumstances he also thanked his old colleagues in the senate 
who rallied to me with fervor zeal and eloquence in the face of 
staggering political odds 
referring to the rancorous sixday debate over his fate tower 
said it was time for the bitterness rancor and anger to fade and 
for those elements of government who have been involved in the 
confirmation process to unite and to be about the peoples 
business 
tower said he would return to private life in my beloved 
texas 
he then ignored a reporters question said thank you and 
walked from the room to the private elevator that would take him to 
his car

the commodity futures trading commission has 
enough power to protect options and futures market integrity 
despite questions raised by a chicago trading scandal its chairman 
told a senate panel thursday 
commission chairman wendy l gramm testified before the senate 
agriculture committee which said an fbi investigation involving two 
exchanges in chicago raises fundamental questions about the 
futures regulatory system 
congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the commission 
through 1994 extending its authorty to enforce federal futures and 
options trading laws 
a future is a contract to buy or sell a commodity at a specified 
price on a given date an option is the right to buy or sell a 
commodity for a specified price at some time in the future 
the house and senate agriculture committees have jurisdiction 
over the cftc the committee chairmen say reauthorization was 
expected to be a brief process but reports of an fbi investigation 
into alleged fraud and illegal trading on chicago futures markets 
made a congressional inquiry necessary 
the bureaus probe reportedly involves allegations that brokers 
and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars in deals on 
the chicago mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade 
sen patrick leahy dvt who heads the senate committee said 
the panel wants to know how well the cftc enforces the laws 
regulating us futures and options exchanges and how it can be sure 
the 14 exchanges do an adequate job of selfpolicing 
the results of the notyetcomplete chicago investigation may 
provide new information as to the effectiveness of existing programs 
upon which changes can be based mrs gramm told the committee 
however she said no program can detect every instance of 
wrongdoing particularly when it occurs off the trading floor 
the commission believes that its existing regulatory authority 
should be sufficient to discharge its responsibilities to protect 
the integrity of us futures and options markets mrs gramm said 
to the extent that any improprieties or abuses found in the 
course of the ongoing investigation warrant changes in the existing 
programs systems or rules the commission has publicly stated that 
it stands ready to take such actions as may be appropriate to 
address those circumstances she added 
leahy ordered the cftc within 30 days to submit an analysis of 
12 proposals made to tighten oversight of exchange floors 
the committee has not yet judged the wisdom of any one of these 
approaches nor do we prejudge the outcome of the chicago probe 
he said our goal rather is to begin the focus of public debate 
on tangible reforms aimed at maintaining confidence in the 
marketplace 
among the proposals were requiring exchanges to devote more 
resources to floor surveillance and increasing penalties for 
trading abuses

howard university president james e cheek 
expressed regret thursday over the student protests which led to the 
resignation of republican national committee chairman lee atwater 
from the board of trustees of the predominantly black school 
we simply are hurt cheek said we feel that the whole 
episode has been a very sad episode 
a student demonstration ended thursday when the university 
granted the students demands which included atwaters resignation 
from the howard board 
speaking after a capitol hill hearing on howards budget cheek 
said he wished atwater hadnt resigned 
were very disappointed that he found it necessary to do 
that he said we understand of course the conclusion that he 
finally reached 
he added that atwater who was unanimously elected by the board 
of trustees which included two student representatives had 
expressed his willingness to still work on behalf of the university 
politics werent the issue in the protest cheek said the 
efforts to make this a political issue were simply exploiting 
it he said 
howard university officials who reached a settlement with 
student protestors early thursday appeared before a house education 
subcommittee requesting 1849 million for fiscal 1990 a 33 
percent increase over last year 
the students left the administration building around 4 am 
following several hours of negotiations involving jesse jackson 
district of columbia mayor marion barry and walter fauntroy the 
districts nonvoting delegate in congress 
you stood up and said we have an insult level and howard has 
established a watershed movement jackson told the students at the 
predominatly black campus he called it a great victory 
student leader april silver declared we have done it we have 
made not a national statement but an international statement to the 
world 
university spokesman alan hermesch said the students left the 
building thursday morning and repairs to the doors and windows were 
underway 
the demonstration ended after university officials delivered a 
letter promising that students will not be punished for 
participating in the action 
atwater resigned tuesday saying he was worried the occupation 
might lead to injuries 
after learning they had succeeded in driving atwater from the 
board of trustees the students turned to demands involving 
curriculum financial aid and improved security 
the demonstration disrupted classes and the students wednesday 
blocked the entrance of a site they thought was being used for 
temporary administrative offices 
atwater was appointed to the board in december the protest began 
friday when the students disrupted a convocation ceremony for the 
schools charter day that was to have included a speech by comedian 
bill cosby 
the students recommended thursday that cosby be named to replace 
atwater 
atwater complained he was the victim of an unfair portrayal 
of his civil rights positions by howard students 
students contended that atwater encouraged racism while managing 
president bushs 1988 campaign by using ads that focused on convict 
willie horton jr who is black horton raped a maryland woman while 
on furlough from a massachusetts prison

a hospital is seeking a new breed of blood donors 
dogs and cats to help set up a blood bank for pets 
special liquids will replace the usual orange juice chasers and 
not all of the donors are expected to sit quietly as they give the 
gift of life but in many respects the blood drive beginning april 2 
will resemble its human counterpart dr alicia faggella a 
veterinarian with the angell memorial animal hospital said thursday 
the blood drive overseen by the massachusetts society for the 
prevention of cruelty to animals will enable the creation of a 
blood bank at the hospital which gave more than 300 lifesaving 
transfusions to dogs and cats last year 
i have not heard of any drives that have been conducted in any 
part of the country so theyre plowing some new ground said dr 
john albers executive director of the american animal hospital 
association in denver its a neat idea 
currently veterinarians keep a few animals in their clinics as 
mascots and blood donors or rely on a network of former patients 
that can be called in he said 
the angell hospital currently has workers bring in their pets for 
regular donations faggella said hospital officials hope to expand 
that to a more formal bloodstorage system that would operate like a 
human blood bank 
plasma would be separated from the blood and frozen making it 
last longer and more types of blood would be on hand faggella 
said like humans animals have different blood types and cat blood 
is different from dog blood 
accidents are the most common reason pets need blood but it also 
is used in treating such diseases as feline leukemia she said 
people really dont realize that our expertise is very similar 
in many instances to human medicine she said we treat pets 
with cancer we do total hip replacements we have animals who have 
diabetes we do cardiovascular heart surgery to repair different 
defects in the heart theres a specialist in every area 
dogs usually are willing to cooperate in donating a pint said 
faggella cats a extra persuasion to donate the usual amount of 
about 3 tablespoons we do tranquilize them so they dont get 
stressed out she said 
so far a few pet owners have registered for the drive 
i think they will be interested in it she said i know we 
have several clients who in the past when blood was very scarce 
theyve been very thankful that their animals have been saved by 
it

nancy landon kassebaum the determined 
gentlelady from kansas was the lone republcian to vote against john 
tower for secretary of defense thursday 
it wasnt the first time the junior senator from kansas had gone 
against her party and her partys leader bob dole the senior 
senator from kansas and the leader of the losing fight to save the 
nomination 
dole frequently charged that the fight was strictly partisan 
minority republicans against majority democrats kassebaum saw 
things differently 
this has not been an easy decision for me or for any of us 
kassebaum said in a statement entered into the congressional record 
but not spoken on the senate floor members i highly respect on 
both sides of the aisle are diametrically and vehemently in 
opposition 
if there was any irony in kassebaum spliting with dole on such a 
key vote there was also the matter of kassebaums concern about 
towers attitudes toward women 
kassebaum one of only two women in the senate noted that a 
pentagon study recently highlighted the seriousness of the 
problems of harassment and promotion i am not confident that 
senator tower would give these issues the priority they demand or 
would demonstrate the necessary sensitivity to their seriousness 
but her prime concern was not women nor was it towers past 
drinking habits which several sentors noted but she mentioned not 
at all 
most importantly kassebaum said the next secretary of 
defense is going to have to counter the debilitating impact that the 
defense procurement scandal has had on public confidence in our 
defense establishment 
in meeting these challenges the next secretary of defense must 
have the confidence trust and respect of the american people and 
the congress i do not believe he can provide the leadership 
that is necessary to forge a consensus on the critical national 
security issues confronting us today 
my most serious concerns about the nomination of john tower are 
from the public record kassebaum said although senator tower 
did not break any laws his consulting activities over the past 
couple of years in my opinion raise very serious concerns about 
the nominees judgment and his sensitivity to those major issues of 
conflict of interest 
later kassebaum told reporters she would have voted for tower if 
hers were the deciding vote 
i had told the president i would have voted for him even though 
i had serious misgivings she said because at that point i 
wouldnt have wanted to be the vote to defeat 
her vote wasnt needed and kassabaum became the only senator on 
the republican side of the aisle to stand and say no when the 
roll was called 
kassebaum 56 went against dole her party and thensen dan 
quayle in the summer of 1986 when she opposed the nomination of 
daniel manion as a federal judge in indiana kassebaum voted no but 
was persuaded by quayle to pair her vote with an absent senator 
who reportedly would have voted yes pairing in effect cancels out 
each vote manion was confirmed 
kassebaum also bolted from the party fold later that year siding 
with democrats to override president reagans veto of limited 
economic sanctions against south africa 
she was first elected to the senate in 1978 with her only 
previous public office that of a local school board she is 
however the daughter of the late alf landon the republican 
presidential nominee who lost to franklin d roosevelt in 1936

the vatican on thursday announced closer 
scrutiny over its scandaltainted bank with sweeping reforms to 
abolish the post of president held by us archbishop paul c 
marcinkus and to hire more professionals 
the changes were announced in a statement summing up three days 
of meetings by a special commission of cardinals studying the 
vaticans financial problems it forecast a record budget deficit of 
more than 78 million this year 
the statement said marcinkus a native of cicero ill will 
assist the vatican bank during a transition phase 
the changes at the bank call for a new post of secretary to be 
held by a nonbishop cleric a special council of five financial 
experts from various countries and a director and a deputy director 
named by that council 
the vatican also will set up a watchdog commission of five 
cardinals named by the pope for the bank which is formally called 
the institute for religious works 
pope john paul ii outlined the changes last june when he 
overhauled the curia the churchs central administration but 
thursdays statement gave the first details 
marcinkus 67 who has headed the bank since 1969 said he didnt 
know exactly when he would leave 
i will probably move on when its all set up marcinkus said 
in a telephone interview with the associated press 
he noted he holds another post the equivalent of deputy governor 
of the vatican citystate adding they havent taken that away 
yet 
warrants for the arrest of marcinkus and two lay vatican bank 
officials were issued in 1987 after italian prosecutors charged them 
with being accessories to the fraudulent bankruptcy of banco 
ambrosiano a milanbased bank that collapsed in 1982 it was 
italys biggest postwar banking scandal 
but the arrests were never made italys constitutional court 
ruled that a vaticanitalian treaty precluded any interference by 
italian authorities into the affairs of vatican an independent 
citystate 
the vatican bank which was the largest shareholder in banco 
ambrosiano denied any wrongdoing in the banks collapse but agreed 
in 1984 to pay 250 million to its creditors 
the bank went under after the default of 13 billion in vatican 
bankassured loans made to 10 dummy corporations set up in latin 
america the body of roberto calvi banco ambrosianos former 
chairman was found hanging from a london bridge in june 1982 an 
italian civil court ruled in january that calvi was murdered 
announcing its financial position the vatican said it expected 
revenues of 56145384 in 1989 and expenses of 134326153 
leaving a deficit of 781 million 
the vatican was in the red by about 66 million in 1988 a press 
statement said the big jump in expenses was more apparent than 
real because of a change in accounting practices that now put 
costs of running the holy sees diplomatic missions in 118 countries 
directly under the budget of the holy see 
this expense had previously been covered by a special vatican 
fund that had run out 
to cover the deficit the vatican said it would count heavily on 
peters pence contributions by catholics to the pope which it said 
amounted to nearly 53 million last year it said it was also 
expecting help from a special fund called the papal foundation set 
up by cardinal john krol retired archbishop of philadelphia 
the statement said that while the cardinals found the vaticans 
expenses justified it urged the holy see to make every effort to 
reduce them

aid donors pledged thursday to provide 
money and end red tape in a joint effort to save 100000 people in 
the southern war zone from starvation but success now depends on 
rebels accepting a ceasefire 
a unsponsored conference of western donor nations relief 
agencies and sudanese government officials produced pledges 
estimated at 132 million 
western health officials said an outbreak of meningitis also has 
spread into southern sudan and estimated the dead at 400 they said 
the disease began in ethiopia and was following an annual route 
through northeastern africa 
julia taft of the us agency for international development said 
the united states had pledged two military c130 transports to the 
airlift 
prime minister sadek mahdis government repeated its pledge to 
observe a truce in april so food and medical supplies could be 
stockpiled in the south before the rainy season begins in may 
no word was received from the sudan peoples liberation army 
which has fought since 1983 for more autonomy and economic 
advantages in the south most of whose people are black christians 
or animists northern sudan which controls the government is 
predominantly arab and moslem 
mahdi said i have nothing but smiles and handshakes for you 
all i thank you all and assure you that your recommendations will 
find necessary and proper response from my government 
relief workers want to move 165000 tons of food medicine and 
other supplies south before the rainy season which virtually 
isolates the region for six months 
the united nations is trying to prevent a repeat of 1988 when up 
to 500000 southerners died of starvation disease or the fighting 
many of them died in summer cut off in small towns when rain turned 
roads into swamps and made airstrips unusable 
un experts say starvation and disease threaten 23 million 
southerners this rainy season and up to 100000 could die other 
sources estimate the number at risk as high as 600000 
on wednesday mahdi endorsed a ceasefire during april but said 
the rebels also must accept it ms taft said she would visit addis 
ababa ethiopia on friday and ask the insurgents to agree

the united states must accept responsibility 
for its own drug problem and not just blame other countries for 
whats been happening to us vice president dan quayle said 
thursday 
quayle in remarks prepared for a speech to the international 
mayors conference in new york said some of the nations where drugs 
originate have met several critical milestones in narcotics 
control 
a text of his speech was released by his washington office 
we cant just blame other countries for whats been happening 
to us we must recognize that substantial efforts are being made by 
some nations to stem the drug supply problem quayle said 
he cited peru bolivia and mexico as countries making such 
strides 
peru for example eradicated more than 5130 hectares of coca 
plants used to make cocaine over a fourmonth period quayle said 
he also said the bush administration will look into a number of 
policy options that would allow us to do more to reinforce the 
antinarcotics efforts in peru and other andean countries 
the us drug enforcement administration already has agents 
stationed in south america to assist in antidrug efforts they 
gather intelligence assist local police and help in drug 
eradication 
at the same time that we work with other nations we must also 
recognize that we have become a drugsource nation ourselves about 
a quarter of the marijuana consumed in this country is domestically 
grown and a large number of drugs are illegally produced in 
clandestine laboratories in this country he said 
the vice president said there is no reason for a feeling of 
gloom that seems to envelop this issue like a thick clammy fog 
because although the situation is serious the war against drugs is 
winnable 
he cited drug use surveys by the national high school senior 
survey that show drug use among that group at its lowest level since 
the survey began in 1975 
in other words the pessimists are being proven wrong once 
again the american demand for drugs is not insatiable the american 
people are not incapable of selfcontrol

charges to the contrary from the ruling marxist government in kabul

rockets at kabul airport wednesday killing four people including a 
small child tass said 16 rockets exploded near afghan commercial 
airliners as one was preparing to take off but it did not say

the united states welcomed soviet 
acceptance of world court authority on human rights but a 
government legal expert said thursday the justices probably never 
will hear a case testing the kremlins commitment 
on wednesday the soviet union said it would accept the courts 
jurisdiction in six human rights treaties reversing its policy of 
resisting outside judgment of its practices 
president mikhail s gorbachev also has spoken recently in favor 
of a larger un role in such international areas as arms control 
and space exploration which traditionally have been dominated by 
the soviet union and united states 
un and state department legal officers said his acceptance of 
jurisdiction by the world court a un agency will bring gorbachev 
international good will with little risk of embarrassment over 
soviet human rights practices 
it also should help the soviet effort to hold a human rights 
conference in moscow in 1991 as one of several followup meetings to 
the 1975 helsinki agreements on european security and cooperation 
in january washington changed its position and said it would 
accept a moscow conference citing the soviet release of political 
prisoners easing of emigration and more tolerant views on free 
speech and freedom of religion 
the six treaties on which the soviets will recognize the courts 
authority deal with five areas they condemn genocide ban slavery 
guarantee political rights for women prohibit racism and outlaw 
torture 
state department spokesman charles redman said the united states 
welcomes any step in the submission of disputes of this kind to 
binding decisions by neutral bodies such as the international court 
of justice the courts formal name 
pieter kooijmans un special investigator on human rights said 
in leiden the netherlands it would be a real breakthrough for 
human rights if the soviet union would recognize the right of 
individuals to file complaints of rights abuses 
under the optional protocol to the international covenant on 
civil and political rights individual citizens can complain of 
rights abuses to an international body of legal experts with the 
power to order compensation hungary ratified the protocol last year 
a state department legal expert said privately the 
international court of justice has never handled a human rights 
dispute and the soviet acceptance of jurisdiction may amount to 
nothing more than a meaningless gesture 
it would be unlikely that a human rights dispute would ever 
wind its way to the world court he said 
only governments can take cases before the court which has 15 
judges and sits in the hague in the netherlands it has no authority 
to deal with complaints of individuals or private organizations 
the united states has ratified only one of the six human rights 
treaties the soviets have accepted all six 
last year the senate finally ratified the 1948 convention on the 
prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide but rejected 
world court authority over its interpretation the united states has 
signed the five other treaties but the senate has not ratified them 
we have accepted world court jurisdiction over many more 
treaties than the soviet union has bilateral and multilateral 
the state department legal expert said 
washington accepts world court rulings under about 60 treaties 
dealing with a range of diplomatic and commercial rights the 
soviets have refused to recognize the courts authority 
last year the united states soviet union britain france and 
china began negotiations toward an agreement under which they would 
submit to world court rulings on all treaties that did not involve 
sensitive national security issues or the use of force 
they are the five permanent members of the un security council 
and have veto power in the council 
the united states rejects world courts jurisdiction in national 
security cases 
in 1986 nicaragua asked the court to rule on the mining of its 
harbors and covert us support for contra rebels the court ruled 
in nicaraguas favor but the united states which did not 
participate in the case refused to accept the decision

here is a summary of a speech given by 
cardinal joseph ratzinger president of the congregation for the 
doctrine of the faith at an extraordinary meeting of us bishops 
and vatican officials the summary was made available by the vatican 
in italian and translated into english by the associated press 
phrases in parentheses were added by the ap 
as the second vatican council lumen gentium 25 teaches us 
repeating a formula established by the council of trent the bishop 
is above all an evangelizer and in that way the actual successor of 
the apostles 
the image of the postconciliar second vatican council bishop 
has positive aspects today bishops preach more than in the past 
many bishops and episcopal conferences take positions with pastoral 
letters on great issues of the day offering a response in the light 
of faith 
less positive is the evolution of catechesis which is consigned 
in great measure to socalled experts 
even more thorny is the issue of the rapport between bishops and 
theologians who today have influence not only in the worlds of 
scientific research and university teaching but who also through 
the mass media bring into the public arena their often dissonant 
contributions to the point where their voices drown out those of 
the bishops who preach 
in many parts of the world theologians have taken the place of 
the bishop as teacher leading to a growing insecurity and 
disorientation 
after the second vatican council reflection on the primacy of 
the bishops mission of proclaiming the word has remained in 
practice without commentary 
instead one comes up against ideas aimed at limiting the bishop 
to the role of spiritual administrator 
these theories which come from the academic realm have 
transformed themselves into a kind of pressure on the bishop his 
role according to these theories would be to avoid polarization 
acting as a moderator in the plurality of different opinions 
the bishops have fully adapted themselves to this regulative 
model little defending their magisterial authority over 
theologians the preached word becomes seen as something merely 
pastoral and is not presented with the authority of decision 
and it ends up not even being truly pastoral because the pastoral 
approach consists of making people face decisions and confronting 
them with the authority of truth 
in addition according to theories of modern culture it is not 
possible to distinguish clearly between faith and theology and even 
if it could be done it would be the task only of the specialist 
the theologian but not of the shepherd bishop 
the most pressing question lies in the fact that the modern world 
distinguishes two spheres of life action and reflection the former 
according to theories of the modern world requires authority 
which is justified and useful at a functional level the second does 
not need authority because it follows solely the law of thought 
there is nothing definitive but only hypotheses still to be 
verified and tested 
the church according to these theories can exercise a 
functional authority in the sphere of its actions theology is not a 
matter of authority rather one of being professional this notion 
means that the church can certainly dispense pious advice but not 
proclaim the truth in a way that is binding and thereby call people 
to a commitment 
in addition in todays hierarchy of values individual liberties 
and the consequent rights of freedom of the mass media take the 
highest place while objective moral values on which there is 
anyway no agreement are banished to the private sphere not 
meriting any social and public protection 
bluntly one can say there is a right to immorality but morality 
has no rights the responsibility of witnessing to the truth of the 
gospel leads inevitably to passion for the truth here one finds 
also the positive conclusion of our reflection the hallmark of 
truth is that it is worth suffering for 
those who announce the gospel must also be martyrs in the most 
profound sense of the word

the french government has expressed concern to 
the state department that french consular officials were temporarily 
denied access to diplomatic pouches by us customs agents in miami 
american officials said thursday 
based on xrays and an inspection by drugsniffing dogs the 
pouches were thought to contain cocaine packages when they arrived 
in miami from santo domingo wednesday night 
but once the pouches were released to french custody and flown to 
paris french officials notified us diplomats the containers were 
drugfree 
state department spokesman charles redman said that under 
international law diplomatic pouches are inviolable even if they 
are believed to be carrying illegal substances 
another official who asked not to be identified said customs 
turned over the pouches to french consular officials unopened but 
not before the containers had been withheld for a period from the 
envoys 
a french foreign service courier who accompanied the pouches was 
detained for nine hours until he was ordered released by the state 
department according to officials 
michael sheehan a customs spokesman in miami said we are 
completely confident that what our dogs alerted to and what our 
xrays saw was cocaine 
but thierry reynard the french consul in miami said the pouches 
contained paper work in boxes that were packaged in lager boxes 
im very surprised they could mistake the two things he 
said they have to do their homework on investigations

rep charles rangel dny issued a stinging 
attack thursday on health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan for supporting cleanneedle programs for drug users in 
communities trying to stop the spread of aids 
rangel said he found it shocking that sullivan who took over the 
health agency last week would advocate the idea of exchanging 
needles with drug addicts instead of proposing programs to expand 
drug treatment services 
the first step he takes in drug abuse is to appear to give 
support to addicts by giving them needles rangel said its an 
immoral thing to distribute needles to addicts the next thing you 
know theyll be distributing drugs 
it sends a message to the minority community that we dont have 
the time the resources or the will to try to get you off drugs and 
back into the mainstream but we do have the time to give you 
sterile needles he said 
sullivan in an interview wednesday said he does not believe 
needleexchange programs condone drug abuse but rather could deal 
with one way the deadly aids virus is spread among drug addicts 
through the use of shared needles once infected addicts also can 
spread the disease to sex partners and their babies 
while emphasizing that decisions on such programs should be made 
locally sullivan said needleexchange programs deserve a chance 
for an appropriate trial in communities that want them 
new york city health commissioner stephen c joseph said 
sullivans support was a tremendous boost to his program one of 
only a few in the country 
the new york program has enrolled 92 addicts 60 percent of whom 
are infected with the aids virus and thats viruses taken off 
the street he said 
however rangel called the new york program a complete flop 
he also opposes a recent hhs proposal to make it easier for heroin 
addicts to get methadone while waiting for comprehensive treatment 
saying the program would only substitute one addictive drug for 
another 
in a related development thursday the alcohol drug abuse and 
mental health association announced a 75 million grant program to 
expand drug treatment services in cities that have waiting lists of 
more than one month a critical purpose of the grants the agency 
said is to help get addicts off the streets faster to reduce the 
spread of aids

former philippines president ferdinand marcos is 
so sick he can barely lift his head or open his eyes and he is 
dying his wife imelda said in an interview 
the 71yearold marcos who was president of the philippines for 
20 years before being ousted in 1986 has been hospitalized since 
jan 15 with various respiratory ailments he was listed in guarded 
condition thursday 
the honolulu starbulletin reported thursday that one of its 
reporters was allowed to see marcos on wednesday in his room at st 
francis medical center and to interview mrs marcos 
the newspaper reported that marcos has lost so much weight that 
his legs have little muscle mass and his hip bones protrude under 
his sheet and blanket 
do you believe his condition now asked mrs marcos 59 
can you see that the former president of the philippines is dying 
that he is not a malingerer 
marcos lawyers have maintained he was too ill to fly to new york 
for arraignment on criminal racketeering charges accusing them of 
plundering the philippine economy and stashing much of the money in 
the united states 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent oct 31 in new york and was freed on 
5 million bail provided by tobacco heiress doris duke 
marcos unable to talk because of a breathing tube in his throat 
responded to his wifes greeting by turning his head slowly and 
struggling to open his eyes the newspaper said 
youre better today mrs marcos told him your fever has 
dissipated you must get better because we are going home soon and i 
am not going to carry you onto that plane you must walk 
we will be at home with peace and love and the beauty of 
god she told him we will enjoy the first real quiet with our 
family in years 
the former first lady is leading their fight to return to their 
homeland from which they were ousted in a popular revolt 
philippine president corazon aquino opposes their return for any 
purpose 
mrs marcos said it is wrong of mrs aquino to prohibit marcoss 
return on the basis of national security 
a man so sick he can hardly lift his head or open his eyes who 
needs a tube to drink water a tube to breathe a tube to eat is 
no threat she said 
last week mrs marcos was invited by the nacionalista party 
the political faction to which marcos belonged when he was first 
elected president in 1965 to attend a reorganization meeting in 
manila this week 
she declined but in a threepage letter to party chief jose b 
laurel criticized us meddling in philippine affairs and the aquino 
government for exiling the couple to a living hell 
now please dont misconstrue this she told the 
starbulletin but for me to run for the philippine presidency 
would be my last desperate option my three years of painful 
experience in the united states gives me a thousand and one options 
and the last desperate one would be running for the presidency 
she blamed their legal problems for her husbands decline 
after i was arraigned he went downhill she said can you 
imagine the philippines top trial lawyer cant be there to defend 
his wife a man who is supposed to have so much hidden wealth he 
cannot even bail out his wife he is not afraid of being arraigned 
its his cup of tea the court is his playground he is dying to 
go 
she said the world is too concerned about money 
look at the songs today she said madonnas material 
girl and michael jacksons bad all this talk about mrs marcos 
eating in rich restaurants going to nightclubs what cheap thrills 
we care about

president bush began talks thursday about a 
replacement for john tower even before his nomination to run the 
pentagon was rejected a senior official said and the 
administration promised a swift decision on a new candidate 
a new nomination may come before weeks end said the official 
who refused to be identified other than as a senior administration 
official obviously were interested in moving rapidly 
possible choices include sen william cohen rmaine and former 
rep jack edwards rala as well as onetime defense secretaries 
donald rumsfeld and james schlesinger said sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser said 
he was not in line to be defense secretary but that did not dampen 
speculation that he was being considered 
some members of congress have suggested a job swap between 
scowcroft and tower since the national security advisers job does 
not require confirmation 
two hours before the senate rejected tower 5347 bush left 
washington for a speechmaking visit in new york before his 
departure bush spoke briefly with scowcroft about a replacement for 
tower said the senior administration official 
the official said a long list of candidates had been compiled 
theres been a list for a long time the official said noting 
that names had been compiled before tower was finally selected last 
december were not starting from scratch 
other names being mentioned were sen john warner rva a 
former navy secretary former transportation secretary drew lewis 
frank borman onetime astronaut turned business executive and 
zbigniew brzezinski the national security adviser under president 
carter and a supporter of bush in the presidential campaign 
in a written statement bush said tower had devoted his life to 
public service instead of the recompense of a grateful nation 
john towers lot in the past weeks has been a cruel ordeal 
for this i am truly sorry for both him and his family bush 
said 
bush also called tower and said i am with you im sorry about 
the outcome youve done a great job we care about you and the 
family his comments were relayed by white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater 
while saying he disagreed with the senate vote bush made clear 
he wants to move on from the divisive debate over tower we owe it 
to the american people to come together and move forward bush 
said 
bush was called by senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine and sen sam nunn dga who led the fight against tower 
they expressed interest in working with bush in a cooperative and 
constructive fashion fitzwater said 
bush said he appreciated the call and the spirit in which it was 
made the press secretary said 
washington buzzed with the names of possible successors 
it must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and 
the national security adviser and any number of congressmen and 
senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on 
the tip of their tongue said fitzwater 
and they are more than willing and ready to provide those names 
and to begin consideration of them when the time comes he added 
fitzwater said there was no timetable for picking a new pentagon 
chief but said bush would act very rapidly 
after a bitter debate the senate rejected towers nomination in 
a lateafternoon vote tower had been dogged by allegations of 
excessive drinking womanizing and conflict of interest with defense 
contractors 
cohen a senior member of the armed services committee and the 
vicechairman of the senate intelligence committee helped lead the 
senate fight for towers nomination his nomination would not cost 
republican strength in the senate since maine has a republican 
governor john mckernan who would make sure the seat remains in gop 
hands 
on the other hand the selection of warner would cost the gop in 
the senate since virginias democratic gov gerald baliles would 
surely fill the vacancy with a member of his own party 
edwards was the senior republican on the house appropriations 
defense subcommittee for many years and was highly regarded for his 
knowledge of the defense budget and defense issues he most recently 
was cochairman of a presidential commission which recommended 
closing obsolete military bases 
throughout the long fight over towers nomination white house 
officials were under orders from bush not to talk about other 
candidates however that prohibition dissolved thursday when it 
became certain that towers nomination was doomed 
putting the best face on the episode fitzwater said we fought 
a long fight hard and well out of this struggle has come a good 
unity with the republican party we brought the administration team 
together and we feel that its been a tempering affair that should 
serve us well as we move forward 
white house officials scowcroft among them have complained 
that the holdup on towers nomination has slowed the administration 
down on matters of national security 
the pentagon has missed congressional deadlines for three reports 
on important military issues and does not have a secretary 
representing it during a special 90day strategic military policy 
review ordered by bush 
on a broader scale the tower battle dominated the white house 
agenda at times overshadowing other issues bush wanted to highlight 
defense officials worry privately that even under the best of 
circumstances it will be weeks more before a new candidate can be 
picked undergo a background check and win confirmation

alexandra zaharnovna a granddaughter of 
soviet revolutionary leon trotsky died thursday in moscow after a 
long bout with cancer her half brother said she was 65 
esteban volkow bronstein a mexican citizen and trotskys 
grandson said a friend telephoned him the news of zaharnovnas 
death 
trotsky born lev davidovitch bronstein was founder of the red 
army and one of the revolutionaries who overthrew the czar and set 
up a communist regime in russia he was exiled by josef stalin after 
a power struggle in the 1920s in 1940 stalin had trotsky 
assassinated in mexico 
volkow who was 14 at the time found his grandfather lying on 
the floor of his study bleeding from ice ax wounds to the head 
volkow now 62 and zaharnovna had not seen each other for 57 
years but were reunited in moscow last december when soviet 
authorities granted volkow a visa 
volkow told the associated press he saw the gesture as part of 
soviet president mikhail gorbachovs policy of greater openness and 
another step toward trotskys eventual rehabilitation 
alexandra zaharnovna was born in moscow in 1923 the daughter of 
zahar mobline and trotskys daughter zina 
volkow had last seen zaharnovna in 1931 when he and their mother 
were expelled from the soviet union zaharnovna remained behind 
volkow came to live with trotsky in mexico after zina bronstein 
killed herself in paris 
both volkows father platon volkow and zaharnovnas zahar 
mobline died in stalins concentration camps along with much of 
the family 
in the soviet union zaharnovna spent six months in jail and five 
years in internal exile she was reviled and isolated because of her 
relationship to trotsky volkow said 
she returned to moscow in 1954 after stalin died to become a 
metallurgical engineer marry and bear a daughter but she stayed 
out of the limelight volkow did not even know she was alive until 
late last year when a french historian found out where she was 
living 
alexandra had taken the decision to emerge from her anonymity 
to publicly acknowledge her relation and her heritage only a few 
weeks earlier volkow said in an interview in january 
she said she wasnt afraid of anything anymore not after all 
that had happened to her and her illness 
volkow said zaharnovnas husband anatol and her child olga 
survive her but she did not live with them and volkow does not know 
where they are 
he said zaharnovna will be buried saturday in moscow 
the cancer that sapped her body did not sap the spirit that had 
already survived decades of persecution as a member of the trotsky 
family volkow said

the senate on thursday rejected the nomination 
of john tower as defense secretary 5347 handing president bush a 
major defeat in his first highstakes showdown with the 
democraticcontrolled congress 
bush said he would act swiftly to submit a replacement candidate 
to the senate but had no timetable for making a decision white 
house officials began the process of reviewing other possible 
nominees almost immediately 
the senate has made its determination bush said i respect 
its role in doing so but disagree with the outcome 
bush said tower should have received the recompense of a 
grateful nation but instead his lot in past weeks has been a 
cruel ordeal for this i am truly sorry for both him and his 
family 
towers nomination was scuttled by concerns about his drinking 
habits coupled with senatorial unhappiness that he left his 
government post as arms negotiator and quickly began earning 
hundreds of thousands of dollars as a defense industry consultant 
the vote was the culmination of a tumultuous sixday senate 
debate and closely followed party lines howell heflin of alabama 
lloyd bentsen of texas and christopher dodd of connecticut were the 
only democrats to support the nomination and one republican nancy 
kassebaum of kansas voted against 
at the pentagon tower who watched the senate vote on 
television appeared briefly in a private dining room reserved for 
the defense secretary and read a statement before a tv camera and 
two reporters he declined to take questions simply saying thank 
you before he left 
i will be recorded as the first cabinet nominee in the history 
of the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidency 
and perhaps be harshly judged he said 
but i depart from this place at peace with myself knowing that 
i have given a full measure of devotion to my country 
he said no other public figure has been subjected to such a 
farreaching and thorough investigation nor had his human foibles 
bared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny 
and yet there is no finding that i have ever breached 
established legal and ethical standards nor been derelict in my 
duty he said 
tower said he would return to private life in texas but would 
remain deeply grateful to bush for his support and obliged to 
my old colleagues in the senate who rallied to me with fervor zeal 
and eloquence in the face of staggering political odds 
tower also received a telephone call from bush who expressed his 
disappointment with the outcome fitzwater said 
tower according to sen pete wilson rcalif had been willing 
to step aside to allow bush to select another nominee he offered 
to withdraw more than once to the president and the president would 
have none of it wilson said 
the senate rendered its verdict in an atmosphere of unusual 
formality vice president dan quayle presided over the session 
practically all senators remained in their chairs during the roll 
call and the gallery was packed with spectators 
we ought to hang our heads after what weve done to this good 
man senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said in a final 
defiant speech america has lost a good public servant the 
president has won because he stood by his man 
majority leader george mitchell summed up for opponents saying 
towers experience and competence on defense issues werent at 
issue but serious problems exist with conflict of interest and 
character integrity he said 
he said i emphasize my strongly held belief that this should 
not be interpreted as a vote to harm the president but 
acknowledged that others saw it that way 
senators of both parties condemned the bitter partisan debate 
that consumed the senate and mitchell and dole both said they hoped 
there would be no lasting damage 
after the vote mitchell and sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the armed services committee telephoned bush and expressed their 
hope that congress and the administration can work together to 
deal with the serious problems of the country in a postive and 
cooperative spirit 
bush responded positively mitchell said 
but later some senators including dole said the rancorous 
battle would not easily be forgotten 
the democrats decided this man had a mind of his own lets 
find someone else dole said in an interview on cbs news some 
said it was nunnpartisan this is going into the memory bank 
a lot of people are going to remembers this one for a long 
long time said wilson 
sen orrin hatch rutah complained that tower got the rawest 
of deals even the american civil liberties union would object to 
the way john tower was treated 
the rejection of tower marked only the ninth time in history the 
senate has turned down a presidents cabinet nominee and the first 
such decision since 1959 when the senate voted against confirming 
president eisenhowers nominee for secretary of commerce lewis l 
strauss 
names most frequently mentioned in white house speculation as a 
replacement candidate included sen john warner rva the ranking 
gop member of the senate armed services committee and a former 
secretary of the navy sen william cohen rmaine a member of the 
committee former defense secretary donald rumsfeld and former rep 
jack edwards rala 
cohen questioned after the vote said he had not heard about the 
speculation and added im interested in doing what im doing 
right now and warner said he has indicated very clearly that 
im going to finish my job as united states senator 
brent scowcroft the national security adviser also was 
mentioned but told reporters no he was not in line for the post 
the debate drew to an end with the last handful of uncommitted 
senators declaring their intentions 
kassebaum was the only republican to break ranks with her party 
she cited towers consulting work for defense contractors shortly 
after he served as an arms control negotiator saying it raised 
very serious concerns about his judgment and sensitivity to 
those major issues of conflict of interest the role of consultants 
and the revolving door 
later kassebaum said she would have voted for tower if hers was 
the deciding vote 
i had told the president i would have voted for him even though

the government has targeted nine former iranian 
embassy employees for deportation if they do not leave britain 
voluntarily within 10 days an immigration official said thursday 
the un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he has 
issued appeals to protect the life of british author salman rushdie 
whose new novel led to the britainiran dispute 
irans official radio said britain must bear responsibility for 
the sacred wrath of moslems as a result of its stance on the 
book the satanic verses 
a conservative roman catholic bishop in the netherlands joined 
moslems in denouncing the book saying it defiled the figure of 
mohammed 
spains national efe news agency quoted intelligence sources as 
saying an iranian commando team recently was in that country trying 
to obtain weapons apparently to kill rushdie and collect a 52 
million bounty offered by iranian clerics 
an interior ministry official cast doubt on the report which 
also said the team had dispersed and infiltrated britain west 
germany and france officials in britain said they had no 
information to confirm the report 
critics of the satanic verses say it blasphemes islam by 
portraying mohammeds wives as prostitutes and insinuating mohammed 
wrote the koran himself rather than receiving it from god 
the book led iran to break relations with britain on tuesday 
britain in turn announced wednesday it plans to expel a number 
of iranians because of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis refusal to 
revoke his death sentence against rushdie 
the author a british citizen who was born into a moslem family 
has been in hiding since the feb 14 execution order 
i can confirm to you that the names of nine iranian individuals 
have been sent over to the fco foreign and commonwealth office 
a spokesman for the home office the department responsible for 
immigration said thursday 
this would be to initiate the proceedings to secure their 
removal he said speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
custom when asked if they were former embassy employees who no 
longer have diplomatic status he said i can confirm that 
about 25000 iranians live in britain including 2400 students 
according to the spanish news report seven iranians were tracked 
in spain more than 10 days ago it quoted intelligence sources as 
saying the group apparently tried but failed to obtain weapons in 
spain to kill rushdie 
spains secretary of state for security rafael vera told the 
associated press there has been an error in the way the 
information has been given he refused to elaborate 
perez de cuellar in nepal as part of an asian trip told 
reporters it is important not to dramatize the issue but to make 
appeals to ensure the death order is not carried out 
i have already made more than one appeal in order to protect 
the life of this gentleman who authored the book but at the same 
time i was sad to see that expressions were written which were 
offensive for millions of moslem people all over the world he 
added 
tehran radio in a commentary monitored by the british 
broadcasting corp declared that this is just the beginning of 
the path for iran as well as for other world moslems 
in the event that britain does not want to abandon its improper 
and antiislamic posture and does not make a retreat in this regard 
it must reciprocally bear liability for everything that is to follow 
henceforth 
the sacred wrath of moslems will not subside through the 
expulsion of some iranian moslems from britain or by closing down 
the iranian consulate in hong kong tehran radio said 
bishop hja bomers of the netherlands gave unexpected support 
to moslems in an interview with dutch radio thursday 
bomers who conceded he had not read the satanic verses said 
khomeinis threat was totally wrong but added it is not the 
moslem protesters who are to blame for the furor over rushdies 
book 
you cant just go and defile a historic figure who is believed 
and respected by millions of people today bomers said in a 
reference to the prophet mohammed 
iraqs president saddam hussein made his first public statement 
on the controversy telling a newspaper khomeinis death threat 
does more damage to islam than salman rushdies book he was 
quoted by the saudi newspaper alsharq alawsat

president bush served notice thursday to 
copkilling drug traffickers that hunting season is over and 
said he is determined to attack the nations drug problem on both 
the supply and demand fronts 
kicking off what the white house has billed as drug week 
bush flew to new york to pay tribute to drug enforcement 
administration agents killed in the line of duty 
bush who headed a drug interdiction task force as vice 
president told his audience at the deas new york offices that it 
used to be unthinkable to shoot a cop 
but heightened pressure against drug traffickers has raised the 
level of violence he said citing the recent slaying of dea agent 
everett hatcher 
just before his speech bush met with hatchers widow mary jane 
hatcher 
later bush used an address to the united negro college fund to 
sound his antidrug theme 
my friends drug abuse is americas 20th century version of 
human slavery bush said it chains the spirit and imperils the 
ability to learn 
he vowed to wage unconditional war against drug abuse and 
said we must fight on every front education treatment 
interdiction enforcement 
bush had been scheduled to kick off his antidrug crusade tuesday 
with appearances in lancaster pa and wilmington del but bad 
weather forced the cancellation of that trip 
in thursdays speech to drug enforcement officers the president 
cited legislation passed by congress last year providing the death 
penalty for drug kingpins who commit murder while trafficking in 
drugs 
just as the penalty for cop killers helps even the odds 
stripping our enemies of their illgotten gains turns the table in a 
dramatic and highly effective way he said adding 
i have some bad news for the bad guys hunting season is over 
the rules on our side have changed too its about time 
here in new york city as in other cities across the country 
the war on drugs is no metaphor he said before we could bury 
everett hatcher last week another officer was gunned down felled 
by a single shot fired pointblank beneath his bulletproof vest 
today narcotics agents are sometimes the first ones shot 
targeted by criminals armed with a staggering array of battlefield 
weaponry he said 
nine dea agents have been killed in the line of duty since 1982 
bush who has opposed strict gun controls and who has defended 
the right of sportsmen and hunters to have semiautomatic rifles did 
say in his speech that he has asked william bennett his drug policy 
coordinator to look into what can be done to prevent fully 
automatic assault weapons from falling into the hands of the 
criminals you face 
in choosing new york to launch his drug campaign bush went to a 
city with an estimated 260000 heroin addicts and 600000 people 
believed addicted to cocaine 
on feb 9 bush asked congress for 55 billion for the war on 
drugs with the bulk of that going to law enforcement efforts 
including intensified border interdiction 
at the same time he is trying to put pressure on law enforcement 
officials and leaders in other countries to staunch the flow of 
drugs to the united states bush noted that he will soon receive a 
report from attorney general dick thornburgh on his justcompleted 
trip to bolivia colombia and peru 
in an apparent jab at democratic gov mario cuomo bush noted 
that its been over 25 years since anyone has faced the death 
penalty in this state the state legislature is oving to enact a 
death penalty statute which cuomo opposes 
while there may not be light at the end of the tunnel there 
does seem to be some light coming in under the door the president 
said at the apollo theater in harlem one wednesday last month 
the amateur night performances were interrupted by spontaneous 
antidrug messages from the stage and chants from the crowd 
in the text of his speech to the united negro college fund bush 
also discussed the importance of education telling his audience 
education can give minorities a greater voice and make sure that 
voice is heard 
the president also quoted slain civil right leader martin luther 
king jrs words that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere 
the president declared 
black and white together we know that america will not be a 
good place for any of us to live until it is a good place for all of 
us to live r insert000

the us coast guard intercepted 236 more haitians 
sailing to the united states on wednesday bringing to more than 550 
the number of refugees stopped and sent back home since sunday 
the latest refugees were packed onto two haitian sailboats 
stopped by coast guard cutters about 30 miles north of haiti coast 
guard spokesman jerry snyder said 
us immigration and naturalization service agents interviewed 
the refugees on board the cutters and ordered them returned to 
portauprince after deciding they were trying to enter the united 
states for economic reasons snyder said 
two separate haitian refugee groups attacked the ins procedure 
wednesday claiming many haitians who fear political persecution are 
unjustly returned to their country 
there is an automatic assumption that haitians are economic 
refugees said haitian refugee center attorney cheryl little at a 
news conference in miamis little haiti community 
the new yorkbased national coalition for haitian refugees 
released a report criticizing the ins for interviewing haitians in 
international waters rather than inside the united states 
the boat people intercepted on the high seas ignorant of their 
rights and fearful of repercussions should they testify to political 
repression are denied this opportunity the 12page report said 
many of the passengers on those few boats that do reach the 
united states safely when informed of their rights and given 
adequate private interviews ask for political asylum 
leon jennings chief interdiction officer for the ins in miami 
said nobody is ever sent back without asking them if theyre 
afraid were there to find out if anybody is going to be 
persecuted 
the coast guard intercepted 113 haitians on two 30foot wooden 
sailboats in international waters tuesday off fort lauderdale and 
miami then 202 migrants aboard the coast guard cutter bear were 
returned to haiti late tuesday 
the latest wave of refugees was caused by false rumors 
circulating throughout haiti last weekend that us interdiction and 
immigration policies were being relaxed ins and coast guard 
officials said 
the coast guard has intercepted 837 haitian migrants since 
january 1

polish voters would be the first in the 
communist bloc to nominate and elect candidates to a new senate 
under the proposal approved thursday by government and opposition 
negotiators 
the current sejm or parliament has only one chamber and in the 
past only approved candidates were placed on the ballot by the 
communist party or its two allied parties working through a 
partydominated electoral commission 
the voter had the option of crossing out candidates on the 
ballot but writein candidates were not allowed and independent 
groups could not field their own candidates for parliament 
the newly created senate was agreed upon by government and 
opposition negotiators of a working group on political reform that 
forms part of larger roundtable negotiations on polands future 
negotiators must still work out details of the electoral law but 
in general anyone nominated by an existing social or political 
group or who gathered an as yet undetermined number of signatures 
could run on the ballot in the first round of twostage elections 
negotiators said 
the government side has proposed that 5000 signatures be 
required to nominate a candidate the opposition is likely to press 
for a smaller number 
before voters theoretically had a choice among different 
candidates but a majority of the seats were contested only by 
communist candidates guaranteeing that no matter which individuals 
won the races the communists would gain the majority 
a certain negotiated minority of seats would be given in the same 
manner to the communistallied peasants party and democratic party 
plus a handful of seats to independents or members of certain 
semiindependent organizations such as the polish catholic social 
union 
until last years local elections the partys preferred 
candidate in any race was listed at the top of the ballot and any 
unmarked ballots were credited automatically to that candidate a 
party loyalist never needed even to look at the ballot before 
voting merely to drop it blank into the box 
unlike the current system in which each party receives a 
preallocated number of seats the balance of power in the new 
senate would be determined solely by the voters party politburo 
member janusz reykowski said there would be no attempt to arrange 
its composition beforehand 
in addition negotiators agreed that opposition would be free to 
run for at least 35 percent of the seats to the sejm which will 
remain the most powerful parliament chamber 
sixtyfive percent of the sejm seats would only be contested by 
the communist party and its allies 
although the new senate elections will be free for the first 
time some opposition activists have cautioned that the communist 
party will still have important advantages 
for example no opposition political parties exist legally in 
poland independent groups here have no experience in mounting 
electoral campaigns and the amount of media exposure that the 
statecontrolled press and television will give opposition 
candidates is still unresolved 
finally authorities have insisted on elections in june leaving 
the independents little time to mount effective campaigns

two commercial fishermen whose boat sank 
when pounded by a freak wave were rescued more than nine hours later 
by a navy helicopter after being spotted by a coast guard search 
jet officials said 
the captain of the patricia c don rynn of st augustine and 
crewman greg oja of jacksonville were treated at a hospital for 
hypothermia suffered in the 58degree atlantic ocean they later 
were released 
the 42foot fishing boat laden with a catch of sharks sank 
about 4 am wednesday some 32 miles northeast of st augustine 
said petty officer 1st class jim harmon at mayport coast guard 
station 
finding the two in 10foot seas was probably one of the best 
rescues we have pulled off in a while it was definitely a feat 
harmon said 
rynn said he was asleep in a bunk in the wheelhouse when the wave 
broke through the port wheelhouse wall throwing him onto the floor 
the boat was nearly swamped by that one breaking wave he 
said he quickly radioed for help and grabbed an emergency position 
transmitter and fish box lid and headed toward the back deck to jump 
into the water 
before he could jump another wave hit the boat and he lost the 
transmitter and fish box lid oja meanwhile had grabbed some life 
jackets and he gave one to rynn as both men took to the dark water 
the two men saw a coast guard jet fly over twice between 6 am 
and 7 am wednesday 
after that there was nothing and we began thinking that we 
might not make it although we were determined that we were going 
to rynn said 
about 11 am wednesday the coast guard called some of rynns 
friends in st augustine and told them they were afraid the two 
fishermen might not be found 
my friends told them where i was supposed to be shark fishing 
and thats how they found us rynn said 
at 1 pm a coast guard jet made a pass over us and dropped a 
flare then he circled back and dropped another one rynn said 
right after that the helicopter pulled us up it was an excellent 
rescue a really super job 
harmon said the hurried distress call was heard by the florida 
marine patrol and two fishing boats but none of them got the same 
location of the boat 
as soon as the call came in a coast guard helicopter from 
savannah ga a coast guard jet from miami and a navy helicopter 
were dispatched to begin searching 
the jets crew spotted debris from the boat about 1 pm 
wednesday and the men were nearby a helicopter from mayport naval 
station pulled them out 
rynn said the patricia c with about 1500 dead sharks aboard 
lies in about 120 feet of water he is making plans to try to raise 
the boat

people begged us repeatedly over the last few days tell the 
world help us please said an american from new orleans one of 
40 foreigners on the flight 
one group on the flight issued a statement they said would be 
sent to the united nations and the dalai lama tibets spiritual 
leader who fled china after the 1959 uprising 
the world community should carefully and critically examine the 
causes of this conflict and the methods and motives of the 
authorities said the statement signed by 35 foreigners 
shootings by the authorities have been excessive 
unpredictable indiscriminate and there have on occasion been 
atrocities it said 
staterun radio reported the four additional riotrelated deaths 
it said the people died in the hospital during emergency 
lifesaving procedures the report did not say whether the dead 
were tibetans 
during three days of riots that began sunday thousands of 
tibetans ransacked chineseowned shops and set fire to chinese 
property 
china imposed martial law on the city of 70000 at midnight 
tuesday and thousands of troops moved in to set up checkpoints at 
every block 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing on thursday denied chinese 
authorities were violating human rights in tibet he blamed the 
disturbances on a clique run by the dalai lama who lives in 
exile in india 
the official xinhua news agency charged that members of a 
separatist clique based abroad recently sneaked into tibet with 
weapons to instigate the riots and said the protesters fired guns 
as they please 
foreigners said demonstrators only threw rocks and used primitive 
slingshots 
the us state department on wednesday said it recognized the 
chinese governments right to maintain order but objected to the 
unwarranted use of lethal force against the protesters 
li said thursday that china will not tolerate foreign meddling in 
the situation 
in a statement marking the anniversary of the 1959 uprising the 
dalai lama said from new delhi that no amount of repression 
however brutal or violent can silence the voice of freedom and 
justice 
china claims tibet has been an integral part of chinese territory 
for seven centuries most tibetans maintain it was an independent 
nation before the communists took over in 1949 
the official media has given no figures on arrests but the 
communist partys official peoples daily reported from lhasa how 
police raided one home and pulled out a man screaming for leniency 
they then went next door and found a man hiding under a blanket 
according to the report 
the mans wife was quoted as saying hurry up and dress and go 
with them i told you not to take part in the riots but you had to 
anyway

an elderly world war ii veteran on thursday ended a 
20day hunger strike protesting prince philips attendance at 
emperor hirohitos funeral after a second appeal from buckingham 
palace 
anthony burgess 70 recently received a letter on behalf of 
queen elizabeth ii saying she was personally concerned and 
asking him to reconsider said a palace spokeswoman speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
though her majesty fully appreciates the deep feelings which 
have prompted you to take this course of action she hopes that you 
will reflect further and decide to end your fast said the letter 
written by the queens private secretary sir william heseltine 
it said the queen decided to send her husband philip to the 
funeral for the japanese emperor after receiving ministerial 
advice that she should be represented by a senior member of her 
family 
it added that she would be very sad if burgess decided to 
send back his war medals as he had threatened to do 
burgess who lives in swansea south wales stopped ingesting 
anything but black tea last month to protest the visit of the 
queens husband to hirohitos funeral feb 24 
veterans were angered that philip a veteran and patron of the 
burma star veterans association to which burgess belongs attended 
the funeral of the man in whose name so many atrocities were 
committed he vowed to fast until prime minister margaret thatcher 
and the prince apologized to soldiers 
burgess condition was not known but a friend and fellow 
veteran ken evans said he was weak he said the letter and the 
concern of his relatives persuaded burgess to stop his fast

the immigration and naturalization service 
has started deporting central americans except for nicaraguans 
under a tougher policy for political asylum cases an ins 
spokeswoman said thursday 
we have not deported any nicaraguans said ins spokeswoman 
virginia kice the meese directive stands 
former us attorney general edwin meese in 1987 issued a 
directive calling for special treatment of nicaraguan political 
asylum cases 
nine central americans were taken thursday from the ins detention 
center 20 miles northeast of brownsville and sent on buses to 
houston ms kice said the two hondurans three el salvadorans and 
four guatemalans will be flown to their countries friday afternoon 
she added 
we may not be deporting people every day but this is the 
second group we have deported under our new initiative ms kice 
said 
the ins on feb 21 began immediately detaining rejected political 
asylum applicants and marking them for deportation in a oneday 
adjudication process those detained are held under deportation 
bonds of up to 4000 here and may resubmit their asylum cases 
before an immigration judge 
the first central americans deported under the new procedure left 
the country sunday ms kice said on that day 61 were flown out of 
houston including 48 el salvadorans 10 guatemalans and three 
hondurans she said adding the ins spent 16553 to send them back 
ms kice said the meese directive does not prohibit the ins from 
deporting nicaraguans but it says we need to make a careful and 
thorough review of cases involving nicaraguans 
the ins spokeswoman said cases of nicaraguans not granted asylum 
would be referred to the justice department in washington 
of 458 asylum applications submitted in southern texas since feb 
21 only 36 all nicaraguans had been approved through wednesday 
immigration officials held more than 2700 undocumented aliens 
primarily central americans in custody thursday afternoon in 
cameron county the states southernmost 
political asylum is granted to those able to show they are 
fleeing persecution the ins contends that most central americans 
seeking political asylum are actually applying for economic reasons 
and therefore do not qualify 
some ins critics blame the meese directive for an influx of more 
than 40000 nicaraguans and other central americans seeking asylum 
after crossing the border illegally into southern texas since last 
spring

the national staff of us roman catholicism is moving into a new 
home with a new chief and a newly consolidated crew to trumpet the 
churchs message to americans 
structures on the grounds symbolize the accent on spreading the 
word a tall statue of jesus as light of the world and the 
great bulge of a satellite communications dish 
they stand beside the new washington office building that on 
april 3 becomes headquarters of the us catholic conference the 
churchs national action agency 
if jesus were on earth today he would use all the contempoary 
ways of explaining his message to the world says the rev kenneth 
j doyle director of the new office for media relations 
when he was here he used the current methods gathering crowds 
on a hillside an itinerant ministry today he would choose the most 
modern advanced means of communicating appearing on the ted koppel 
show giving interviews 
doyle 48 a priestattorneyjournalist from albany ny was 
named to his new post as a spokesman for us catholicism in a 
reorganization in january of communications operations 
as head of a key section media relations doyles job is to 
channel information about the churchs positions activities and 
personalities to secular news outlets 
the church has a very positive story to tell and were trying 
in every possible way to get that story out he said in an 
interview adding that he intends full openness in doing it 
conceding that the church sometimes has been reluctant about that 
in the past he said you dont ever have to shy away from the 
truth any organization is going to have disagreements and at times 
difficulties 
he noted that even in biblical times the early church had its 
conflicts and difficulties which were thoroughly and openly 
reported in the book of acts and the epistles 
he said that in the churchs american cultural setting of 
freedom openness and dealing with educated people they 
expect reasonable explanations of church events and positions 
you never have to pretend that the church is without its human 
elments he said my mission in this job is to tell the truth 
im utterly convinced that when the truth is known in its entirety 
the positive overshadows the negative 
the communications reorganization comes at the time of a 
changeover in management of the conference and its preparation to 
move into its new headquarters 
taking over as the new general secretary the conferences chief 
exeuctive is the rev robert lynch 47 who oversees the 
conferences approximately 20 departments in various ecclesiastical 
and social fields 
lynch succeeds monsignor daniel f hoye 43 of fall river 
mass who held the post seven years lynch from miami has been 
associate general secretary since 1984 and accompanied pope john 
paul ii on his two trips across america 
the conference with about 300 employes and an operating budget 
of 107 million has been housed at 1312 massachusetts avenue in 
northwestern washington for 42 years but had far outgrown the space 
there was incredible crowding with about twice as many people 
as could fit into the place doyle said 
he said there is twice the space in the new 269 million 
fivestory sandstone headquarters in northeast washington at 3211 
fourth st on a fiveacre tract adjoining the catholic university 
of america campus 
the deputy director of the new media relations office william a

veteran news specialist highly knowledgeable about the church 
doyle former bureau chief in rome for national catholic news 
service has for the past three years been based in the new york 
state capital of albany as director of government relations for the 
state catholic conference 
he said part of the reorganization stemmed from a conscious 
decision to seek more coverage of religion in the media and of 
the churchs activities positions and values 
religion is central to how people think and act he said 
what is more important to the life of individuals or nation than 
what they think life means religion is pivotal 
he said religion never has received its just due in the 
media but added i believe there is more and more turning of 
attention to religion and its impact in this country 
in the new national setup richard w daw 54 who for 12 years 
has been editor in chief of national catholic news service and who 
formerly was an associated press bureau chief heads the new

american universities once publicized 
themselves discreetly on pennants and tshirts sold in local campus 
stores now theyre doing it for lucrative royalties on items 
ranging from fishing lures to toilet seats sold at some of the 
nations biggest retailers 
the explosion in collegiate merchandise reflects a rising demand 
for products bearing hawkeyes buckeyes lions tigers bears and 
other school symbols a partial consequence of the enormous 
television exposure collegiate sports teams are getting nowadays 
estimated annual retail sales of such items exceeds 1 billion 
its not just in college bookstores anymore its in k mart 
sears and penneys said kim allan manager of university 
licensing programs at michigan state 
collegiate merchandise sales have doubled in the last five years 
and now nearly equal combined sales of national football league and 
major league baseball products said bill battle president and 
owner of atlantabased collegiate concepts inc 
collegiate concepts and international collegiate enterprises of 
los angeles through a joint venture handle the licensing 
arrangement for 100 schools 
universities license products bearing their names or logos known 
as marks and receive royalties in return 
battle said soft goods such as tshirts sweatshirts and caps 
account for between 80 percent and 85 percent of the collegiate 
merchandise but novelty items have flourished 
in 1981 the university of georgia licensed a local discount 
retail chain to sell a bulldog tarantula the spider had red and 
black markings matching the schools colors and sported a tiny felt 
bulldog cap 
i dont know how they did with it said avery mclean 
director promotions and licensing at georgia 
penn state university has licensed a nittany lion swimming pool 
liner iowa has approved a hawkeye fishing lure nebraska go big 
red boxer shorts and michigan state a spartan toilet seat 
the university of california at los angeles began the first major 
licensing program in 1974 
many other university followed suit in the early 1980s to get 
marketing control over their names and logos which had started 
appearing on products that either were too embarrasing or posed a 
liability threat 
one company approached penn state last year hoping to make a 
nittany lion casket with the universitys mascot embroidered 
inside the lid 
that was thought to be in bad taste said o jean barrett 
coordinator of penn states office of licensing programs 
university standards differ but most refuse licenses to 
companies making products relating to alcohol tobacco and firearms 
besides gaining better control over their monikers university 
licensing programs have provided the schools with a large source of 
income 
royalties now total more than 500000 a year at several larger 
universities with nationally known football or basketball teams 
penn state which has one of the the largest licensing 
operations has earned 430000 in the first 6 months of the current 
fiscal year for use in scholarship funds up 8 percent from the 
previous year said roger williams a university spokesman 
collegiate merchandise also has been a boon to department stores 
three years ago jc penney co started team sports shops in 
500 branches said peter mcgrath division merchandise manager for 
athletic apparel and footware for the department store 
business at the shops has grown 30 percent a year reflecting an 
increase demand for college and pro merchandise mcgrath said 
a number of universities have started exploring markets in japan 
canada and europe ucla with the largest foreign program already 
sells about 9 million to 10 million worth of goods annually in 
japan 
we have a tremendous appeal in japan because were west 
coast said jack rovoyr a ucla product licensing official 
were california were sunshine ucla is more than a university 
its a lifestyle

a judges order that a cocainedependent 
pregnant woman stop abusing drugs and seek prenatal care was simply 
an effort to safeguard her fetus the second victim in the view 
of a righttolife advocate 
but civil libertarians say the ohio case and five similar ones 
around the nation represent an intrusion by big brother on the 
rights of women 
it indicates a real trend to me said diana traub public 
education officer for the american civil liberties unions 
reproductive freedom project in new york theres a real danger of 
setting bad precedent here 
she cited cases mostly involving alleged drug abuse by expectant 
mothers in california florida michigan new york nevada 
washington dc and ohio 
in the ohio case franklin county juvenile court judge charles 
petree ii ruled last september that a fetus carried by a cocaineand 
morphinedependent woman was a person and therefore subject to 
court jurisdiction 
he ordered that janet cox 27 seek prenatal care and stop taking 
drugs 
petrees ruling was overturned in december by the 10th ohio 
district court of appeals shortly after she gave birth to her fifth 
child steven who was drugfree 
one of her four other sons was born drugdependent and she has 
lost custody of all of them including steven she has filed for 
divorce from her husband of eight years david who underwent 
emergency hospitalization for drug abuse in december 
some civilrights advocates say the state has overstepped its 
authority in mrs coxs case 
elinor alger acting legal director of the aclu in columbus 
called the attempt to take jurisdiction over mrs coxs fetus a 
local manifestation of a national movement to take control of a 
womans right to decide for herself how she treats her own body 
the judge in this case was particularly anxious to take 
jurisdiction over this fetus i would not be at all surprised if 
this issue comes up again and again she said 
janet folger legislative director of right to lifeohio scoffed 
at defending women who use illegal drugs while pregnant 
this is something illegal the woman is doing and the argument 
by abortion proponents who defend a woman saying this is some kind 
of constitutionally guaranteed right is ludicrous she said 
i think there is a small trend because its evident that there 
is a second victim here she said i think the public is finally 
recognizing that a fetus is a person whose place of residence 
happens to be the womb 
no ohio law protects fetuses in such cases and james zorn an 
assistant franklin county prosecutor added the court of appeals 
said we did not have jurisdiction over a fetus that means we cant 
pursue a case based on a mothers prenatal drug use 
but that doesnt mean we cant and wont monitor it after 
birth 
mrs cox is serving a oneyear jail term for violating terms of 
probation prosecutors contend she failed 40 drugscreening tests 
following her 1987 conviction in a prescription forgery case 
thomas shanahan the attorney for mrs cox said authorities 
should spend their time and money helping lowincome jobless 
pregnant women such as mrs cox overcome their drug dependency 
rather than waging expensive legal battles 
they were looking for a test case and they picked her all they 
have succeeded in doing in locking up a woman who has a drug 
problem he said 
shanahan also believes the trend is discriminatory 
you dont see them regulating the conduct of fathers what if 
he smokes too close to his pregnant wife do you see anyone 
going after him he said 
it is the big brother scenario all over again said ms 
traub nobody wants to see a baby born hooked on drugs but 
penalizing a woman who takes drugs because she has the audacity to 
get pregnant is simply punitive 
could this also be extended to all women in their reproductive 
years believe it they could be prohibited from doing anything a 
court determined to be bad for them including drinking or smoking 
zorn insists nobodys trying to play big brother 
the sole concern here is the best interest of the child he 
said is it in the best interest of a child to allow its mother to 
injure that child 
nobodys going to go after a woman because she drinks and 
smokes the main difference here is that mrs cox was engaged in an 
illegal activity taking drugs

for her phd thesis in political science 
maria aparecida de oliveira did some research into nepotism in the 
brazilian government what she turned up became a frontpage 
nationwide scandal 
at a time when president jose sarney pledged to lay off 90000 
government functionaries as part of a drastic plan to halt 1000 
percentplus annual inflation ms oliveira said she discovered that 
nearly half the 560 members of brazils twohouse congress have 
relatives lots of them in soft highpaying federal jobs 
senators and representatives she said employ wives sons 
daughters brothers sisters nephews and nieces as advisers 
making the equivalent of 2000 to 4000 a month in a country 
where the governmentset minimum wage is equal to 64 a month 
the 37yearold graduate student at the national university of 
brasilia who also works as a fact checker in brasilia for the rio 
de janeiro newspaper jornal do brasil released her findings to the 
press before submitting her thesis to her professors 
her revelations brought outcries for a cleanup they also 
resulted in angry warnings from some congressional staffers to ms 
oliveira to keep her nose out of their affairs 
this was not a cheap trick to sell newspapers or as some 
people have charged to provoke a military takeover of congress 
ms oliveira said in an interview i did it in the interest of 
brazilian national sovereignty 
civilian government returned to brazil in 1985 after 21 years of 
military rule and new officials promised an idealistic new 
republic 
unfortunately our new democracy is confined to paper ms 
oliveira said it has not reached peoples consciences 
she said she gathered raw data for her study from the 
congressional payroll with help from senators and representatives 
who do not practice nepotism 
she concluded that nepotism in congress exists across the 
political spectrum from right to left 
in the house of representatives ms oliveira said 197 of the 
485 members employ 279 relatives rep pedro ceolin sobrinho of the 
conservative liberal front party is the leader with 10 family 
members on his staff 
rep jose mauricio linhares barreto of the leftleaning 
democratic labor party put his 14yearold son in an advisory post 
at 1176 a month according to the study 
it also counted 32 of the 75 senators as being nepotistic with 
the leader there being sen humberto lucena a former senate 
president from president sarneys centrist brazilian democratic 
movement party he has four children a brother a soninlaw a 
niece and a sisterinlaw on his payroll 
my conscience is clear lucena commented we are talking 
about confidential appointments permitted by law my relatives 
serving in these posts will work only as long as i am in office 
they will not become permanent congressional staff members i hired 
my soninlaw now divorced from one of my daughters as a technical 
adviser not because of our relationship but because of his high 
competence my brother solon was hired by another senator not by 
me 
another star of nepotism according to the researcher is the 
presidents daughter roseana sarney who joined the staff of 
congress when her father was a senator and who now makes the 
equivalent of 4000 a month while living in in rio de janeiro 750 
miles from brasilia 
senators and representatives may legally hire advisers 
congress members also are given at taxpayer expense cars and 
drivers apartments in brasilia free mail and telephone use and 
free plane tickets to and from their home states 
whats immoral is the nepotism said ms oliveira who has 
degrees in economics agronomy and journalism 
adilson abreu dallari a judge and the author of the book the 
civil servant said in an interview that administrative corruption 
has become part of brazilian culture everybody wants 
something he said the roots of the problem go back nearly 500 
years when brazilian colonists received grants favors and 
hereditary titles from kings of portugal 
villasboas correa a widely read political columnist said the 
nepotism scandal degrades congress and political parties and is an 
invitation for a military coup justified on ground of morality 
he added that like congress state legislatures and city halls 
throughout this nation of 144 million are full of ghosts civil 
servants who do no work and show up only to pick up their 
paychecks 
the first secretary of the senate antonio mendes canalle said 
that as a result of ms oliveiras findings the senate now will 
draw up a list to see who does what and works where 
but the speaker of the house rep antonio paes de andrade who 
serves as acting president of brazil when sarney is out of the 
country told the ap that staff hiring is the exclusive 
responsibility of each legislator 
soon afterward paes de andrade made news when while sarney was 
in japan for emperor hirohitos funeral in february he loaded two 
presidential jets with friends relatives political cronies and 
journalists and flew them to a welcoming ceremony in his humble home 
town in brazils impoverished northeast

religious institutions are being hit with a tide 
of child abuse lawsuits and a leading churchstate attorney says 
churches should take steps to protect themselves and the children 
such action is long overdue says oliver s thomas general 
counsel for the baptist joint committee on public affairs in 
washington dc noting the swelling number of such cases 
its going on across the country for religious as well as 
nonreligious organizations he added in a telephone interview 
its happening and its time to take it seriously 
thomas advises churches to begin screening all childcare 
workers as well as other employees placed in regular contact with 
children to verify they have not been convicted of childrelated 
crimes 
this is not a burdensome thing and its extremely important for 
the childrens sake he said parents would be pleased and 
churches could breathe a sigh of relief that theyve acted 
responsibily 
thomas said that more than 100 claims for sexual abuse of 
children have been filed against churches nationwide and the number 
is continually growing involving various denominations 
its not a baptist catholic or methodist problem but 
everybodys concern he said its pervasive 
he said damage settlements in such cases often are in the 
millions these are bigdollar lawsuits he said churches 
dont realize their potential liability nor the greater need for 
protecting the children 
he suggests a formal screening of prospective employees of church 
childcare centers to determine if they have been convicted of sex 
offenses or other crimes involving children or of committing acts of 
abuse or neglect 
such information is a matter of public record available through 
local criminal and civil court clerks or in some localities 
circuit or district court clerks handling both criminal and civil 
records 
this would take little more than a telephone call or trip to 
the courthouse he said 
the stakes are high for both the children and the churches on 
the human side one incident of abuse can scar a child for life on 
the financial side the potential costs to the church is 
staggering 
while not suggesting formal screening of sunday school teachers 
and other lay volunteers as he does for daycare workers he 
advises extreme care in selecting anyone who will have frequent 
direct contact with children 
he said that traditionally claims against churches for abusive 
acts by employees have met with little success on grounds such acts 
were aberrations disconnected from the employment and the church 
thus was not accountable 
however he said a different possibility has been raised by a 
case against victory tabernacle church in norfolk va sued by 
parents of a young girl repeatedly raped by a church employe 
they contended it should have known of the employes past 
childabuse offenses while a trial court dismissed the case on 
grounds the church itself was not liable the virginia supreme court 
reinstated the case 
thomas said the difference is that the parents rather than 
contending the church is responsibile for acts of an employe 
contend it is responsible for its own act in placing an unfit 
employe in a job endangering others 
its a different issue he said the church is going to 
have to face it we need to take heed 
he noted that some states such as florida already have acted to 
make screening of daycare workers mandatory although churches were 
exempt from the florida law the state baptist convention has 
advised compliance with it 
thomas sees the increase in childabuse and sexual molestation 
cases as resulting largely from the much larger proportion of 
children being placed in daycare centers when both parents work 
churches operate more than half the daycare centers in the 
country studies have found 
its a whole new day thomas said the time to act is now 
both to protect our children and to protect our churches from 
excessive personal injury claims its an ethical obligation 
if we dont police ourselves the law is going to do it for 
us

ford called its escort the world car when it was introduced in 
1980 heralding a new era in auto design and production because the 
escort was a novel collaboration of fords worldwide operations 
ford would have been correct to call the escort the world beater 
too 
in 1988 the escort was as the bestselling subcompact car 
nameplate in this country outselling offerings from honda toyota 
nissan and other global competitors it has been the bestseller in 
five of the last seven years said company analyst ray windecker 
look around the roads it shouldnt take long to spot an escort 
considering that more than 25 million have been sold 
the wideranging variety of escort models and price explain much 
of the current popularity the escort seems to be able to be many 
things to many people 
the test car a 1989 escort gt in bright red had sporty appeal 
aerodynamic styling and a number of options all for just under 
10500 
then theres the base twodoor escort that starts at 6964 
something for general transportation or you could look for a 
fourdoor model starting at 7679 an upscale version of the 
fourdoor or even a station wagon 
theres no shortage of choices in the escort line buyers as 
expected are a more diverse lot than for some other cars 
windecker said 15 percent of escort buyers are in professional 
and technical jobs 12 percent are office workers 10 percent are 
business managers and 9 percent are in skilled trades 
median income is nearly 28000 a year 46 percent are women and 
median age is 335 years fiftyfour percent are married 
the 1989 escort gt test car showed the styling changes that ford 
had instituted in the middle of the 1988 model year the car was 
more rounded than the earlier boxy models and the rear hatchback 
had been redesigned for a bigger fuller look 
because it was a gt model the test car also had some dandy 
flared fender skirts near the tires 
the 19liter fuelinjected highoutput four cylinder could put 
out 110 horsepower at 5400 rpm a good amount of pep for this 
little car 
still it felt unmistakably like an escort and delivered a sane 
ride there was some sponginess in the suspension but the tradeoff 
was a notsoharsh ride over bumps as in some other subcompacts 
seats up front were adequate though ford had installed automatic 
shoulder belts that took some getting used to seating for two in 
back was fine but legroom was tight if the front seats were moved 
back all the way 
as in earlier escorts among the instruments was a large picture 
of a car with lights that would go on to indicate trouble such as 
low fuel and low wiper fluid 
other dashboard instruments were the traditional type and easy to 
read 
the shifter could have been a bit longer for me i had to reach 
way over to put it in fifth gear raising myself from an otherwise 
comfortable position in the driver seat 
and the front ashtray was a bit awkward to reach at the base of 
the shifter in the middle bottom of the dashboard 
the escorts record for trouble has been spotty according to 
consumer reports magazine it ranked the 198284 escorts as worse 
than average in owner reports of trouble for 198586 models the 
escort was average and it was much worse than average for 1987 
models 
but company spokesman paul preuss said the escort has a good 
wordofmouth reputation among owners one of the the reasons it 
sells so well is its reliability and durability he said 
thats what the general public sees in the car the sales record 
speaks for itself

standing outside former soviet leader 
andrei gromykos office while visiting the kremlin last year 
randall teague listened to a sound he hadnt heard in so long he 
nearly couldnt recognize it 
it was the taptaptapping of a manual typewriter 
i knew exactly what it was when i heard another old sound the 
sound someone makes when theyre using six carbons in a typewriter 
and they make a mistake said teague a washington attorney for 
smith corona corp who specializes in international trade law 
if thats what one of the most powerful men in the country had 
in his offices i wondered what everyone else was doing teague 
said in recalling the moment that spawned an idea for his client 
peddling typewriters to russia in what company aides called an 
unusual deal smith corona will sell a range of typewriters and 
portable word processors to vneshtorgizdat an official soviet book 
publishing concern to be paid for in us dollars 
vneshtorgizdat also known as vti will then sell the machines 
throughout the soviet union initially to universities professional 
writers and for use in some offices said smith corona president lee 
thompson 
the arrangement exploits a new soviet economic liberalization 
policy under which some soviet companies that routinely earn 
foreign currency may keep part of the money to buy imports 
the policy went into effect in 1987 but is only starting to have 
some impact because it was deferred for all of 1988 in most cases 
said ed hewett a soviet economy expert at the brookings institution 
in washington 
these are not the kind of deals that make headlines so its 
hard to know how many there are hewett said but i think well 
be seeing a lot more of these deals in the first half of the year 
on april 1 the policy will be expanded to include any soviet 
company or even a region of the country that can earn foreign 
currency and wants to spend it 
of course the problem is most russian companies dont have 
products that they can sell to get foreign currency said hewett 
in vtis case it sells soviet books around the world and earns 
dollars yen marks pounds and other foreign money 
in the past hewett said companies like vti would sell products 
to an official soviet foreign trade agency which in turn would sell 
the books and keep the foreign currency 
under the old arrangement if vti wanted to import something it 
had to make a request and go through the foreign trade agency which 
generally would select where the product would come from and what 
model or style it would be 
the smith corona deal was started when teague who specializes in 
representing us business interests in the soviet union bumped 
into an old soviet friend vladimir prokopov during a visit there in 
january 1988 
in catching up on what was new in their lives prokopov told 
teague he headed vti and wished to import typewriters and word 
processors 
that discussion triggered a flurry of telexes telephone calls 
and meetings over the course of the year culminating with an 
agreement signed in january teague said 
it just happens to be one of those situations where two 
companies had a great fit and were able to work things out said 
thompson 
the deal is part of an an explosion in foreign demand for smith 
corona machines three months ago it signed an agreement with nv 
philips a huge netherlandsbased electronics firm to supply 
typewriters throughout europe 
both developments indicate the continued rebound of smith corona 
a subsidiary of the british conglomerate hanson industries ltd 
the company lost more than 100 million during the first half of 
the 1980s consolidated from four plants to one and cut employment 
from 5000 to 850 at its low point in 1984 
today the company employs 2150 people and has regained 
dominance in the portable typewriter and word processor market the 
company does not disclose sales or profit figures 
the soviet deal sent company engineers hurriedly to computers and 
drawing boards to devise typewriters that use the cyrillic alphabet 
which contains 33 letters almost all of them different from the 
26letter latin alphabet 
to americans the cyrillic keyboard looks like a jumble of 
unusual symbols and backward letters its arranged nothing like the 
standard typewriter keyboard in the united states 
for instance the cyrllic a is located where the f would 
be on a regular typewriter the m is where the v is and the 
p is where the h is only the c is in the same place on 
both keyboards 
thats just an extreme coincidence said ray blanchard smith 
coronas director of advanced products he showed off the first 
prototype cyrillic model at the companys central new york 
manufacturing facility noting the companys smith corona logo 
translated into russian in the upper lefthand corner 
it looked roughly like cmnt kopoha 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its not a particularly difficult challenge from a keyboard and 
print wheel standpoint said thompson in a telephone interview 
from the companys headquarters in new caanan conn the difficult 
challenge is the development of a russain language spellchecker 
dictionary and thesaurus 
all smith coronas machines except the basic model xl1500 have 
dictionary and spellchecker computerized memory devices built in 
blanchard said 
the company makes more than 200 models of typewriters and word 
processors its most popular model is the xl1500 which costs about 
140 
thompson said the company expects to export cyrillic typewriters 
to the soviet union by the end of this year 
until then however the company will send typewriters and word 
processors with latin keyboards designed for use in britain to vti 
which has said theres a substanial demand for the englishlanguage 
machines 
the first shipment of three different models nearly 1000 
machines is en route said blanchard and the company is taking 
orders for the cyrillic machines 
thompson said theres a hodgepodge collection of old electric and 
manual typewriters in the soviet union including international 
business machine corp models and some inexpensive east german 
models 
ibm created a cyrillic typewriter ball for its selectric 
typewriters in the early 1970s said company spokesman tom belz but 
the company does not conduct regular business in the soviet union 
thompson said its unclear how many typewriters smith corona may 
eventually sell in the soviet union partly because theres no 
market research about the country the company is largely relying on 
information from vti he said that agency solicited interest from 
400 prospective soviet customers last year 
in the united states if you get 1 to 2 percent back youve 
done a marvelous job they got 50 percent back saying this is the 
type of equipment theyre interested in thompson said

even mildmannered bob newhart could take only 
so many slings and arrows from insult artist don rickles 
newhart as dick loudon on cbs newhart blew up and called 
rickles fat and bald 
he picks on me and picks on me and i finally blow up said 
newhart after the cast broke for lunch but the tiff was only in 
the script and he and rickles headed for newharts dressing room 
together 
off camera the quiet introspective newhart and the loud 
explosive rickles are a real odd couple as best friends their 
wives are also best friends and the two couples frequently vacation 
together 
rickles appearance on this mondays episode of newhart is 
one of their rare times together on the same stage he plays 
outofwork comic actor don prince who ends up as host of a talk 
show on the same vermont television station where loudon works 
their last joint appearance was in 1972 on an episode of the 
don rickles show rickles said it was on the same soundstage at 
the cbsmtm studios where newhart is filmed 
a guy whos a grip says it was the same stage said newhart 
painful things like that you cant recall 
weve always talked about appearing together on newhart for 
some time but we wanted it to be something special said rickles 
i said in tv guide that we hadnt been able to come up with an 
idea we got hundreds of letters saying he should do this he should 
do that said newhart the story our writers came up with is 
that don had his own show on cbs called its always moishe he did 
a special called a very moishe christmas when he gets canceled he 
comes to vermont to do a talk show im like his ed mcmahon he 
insults me the band leader the audience 
thats when newhart has had enough to bark back but he quickly 
apologizes and rickles confesses hes been insulting everybody to 
get out of his contract because cbs wants to put its always 
moishe back on the air 
newhart and rickles have been friends for more than 21 years 
our wives were friends before he even knew his wife said 
rickles whose wife barbara had been a secretary for his agent 
newharts wife ginny quinn had been an actress 
we had completely different personalities but we have the same 
values rickles said we could travel and get along we get 
along great and have never had any troubles its all due to me 
newhart said ginny and i were in las vegas and she had never 
seen his act she said barbara dons wife was there and suggested 
we get together she said don was such a nice man i warned her he 
may not be the same nice man on stage 
we went to the show and he said bob newhart is a stammering 
idiot and his wife is a former hooker from bayonne nj ginnys 
mouth was wide open the rest of the show 
newhart and rickles say they never talk about work or show 
business what do they talk about 
newhart his career 
rickles my golf and my good shots 
he makes me laugh and i make him laugh said newhart 
said rickles we come from different backgrounds he was a man 
for the books im trying to read them 
newharts wife has suggested they do neil simons play the odd 
couple 
don is the neat one newhart said its the opposite of 
what you would think 
its been done so many times said rickles i did it once 
with ernest borgnine we did it in the round with the audience all 
around us 
rickles works mostly in las vegas and atlantic city and is an 
occasional guest on the tonight show late night with david 
letterman or the bob hope specials 
his first movie was run silent run deep in 1958 and last 
movie was kellys heroes in 1970 in the 1970s he starred in 
the shortlived sitcom the don rickles show and cpo 
sharkey which ran for two years 
when i started doing my nightclub act i developed a very strong 
image rickles said producers began to back off it also became 
very hard for me to do both im not out there as a working actor 
im not looking for work

soyinkas life is threatened in nigeria 
but while these authors have received worldwide attention they 
represent just a fraction of the writers who have recently been 
jailed or harassed the writers in prison committee of the 
londonbased pen international lists 238 cases of writers 
currently imprisoned detained or forced into internal exile 
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has called for the 
death of rushdie a 41yearold bombay native of islamic parents 
because of his novel the satanic verses which offers a 
scathing portrayal of the prophet mohammed and the founding of the 
islamic religion and has been banned in several countries khomeini 
said that anyone performing the act will be granted passage to 
heaven 
the rushdie thing is certainly unprecedented said author 
susan sontag president of the pen american center a major 
exponent of writers freedom even when the nazis burned books 
there was no call for the death of the writers 
but the threat to rushdie has now drawn in soyinka a novelist 
and poet awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1986 soyinkas 
outspoken defense of rushdie and condemnation of khomeini as a 
sick and dangerous man have infuriated nigerian moslems who are 
estimated to constitute nearly half of the countrys population of 
100 million 
moslems marched in the city of lagos some carrying placards that 
read wole soyinka must die and handed a letter of protest 
against rushdie to the british consul in the late 1960s soyinka 
was jailed during the civil war in nigeria for attempting to 
negotiate with the ibo rebels 
havel one of czechoslovakias most prominent playwrights and 
whose works are banned there was jailed for nine months in late 
february for allegedly inciting a protest in january to commemorate 
the death in 1968 of jan palach a student who set fire to himself 
in protest of the sovietled invasion 
he was sentenced to four years in 1979 for sedition and has been 
consistently harassed by government officials for his efforts to 
form a political opposition 
also in czechoslovakia ivan jirous an editor and publisher has 
been jailed four times since 1976 for antigovernment activities 
his most recent arrest came in october 1988 for his role in 
organizing an open letter to protest the death of a prisoner of 
conscience pavel wonka while he was being held in detention 
jirous who faces a prison term of up to five years is charged 
under the czech penal code with assaulting state officials and 
officials of a public organization and damaging the interests of 
the state abroad his trial began march 9 
a more unusual case of a writer having trouble with the 
authorities involves joseph wambaugh author of such best sellers as 
the onion field and the new centurions 
wambaugh a former los angeles police officer based his new 
book the blooding on the rape and murder of two 15year old 
girls in leicester england the killer was eventually tracked down 
through the process of genetic fingerprinting which means that an 
individuals blood or semen has a distinctive genetic code such as a 
fingerprint 
wambaugh conducted extensive interviews with police and the 
victims families and the blooding gives a detailed account of 
the case but leicester police responding to protests against the 
authors description of the crimes have launched an investigation 
into how information was obtained for the book the police further 
said the closely detailed descriptions of the rapes and murders 
caused distress to the families involved 
in south africa among the many people in jail for their 
opposition to apartheid the governments policy of racial 
separation and discrimination is jaki seroke the editorial 
director of skotaville publishers a nonprofit organization that 
concentrates on the works of black writers 
in september 1987 seroke was arrested and confined under section 
29 of the internal security act which allows indefinite 
incommunicado detention without charge or trial for the purposes of 
security police interrogation 
he was eventually charged with possession of banned 
literature and furthering the aims of a banned organization 
and recently was sentenced to 10 years in jail seroke is believed 
to be at a police station in soweto 
although released from prison in december 1988 zwelakhe sisulu 
who has written for several newspapers is confined evenings to his 
home in johannesburg and is required to report twice a day to 
authorities 
he was first arrested in 1986 for antigovernment activities 
rearrested later that year and also confined under section 29 
officials later admitted that his detention was based on his 
involvement with the new nation an antiapartheid newspaper 
which sisulu founded 
ironically these various arrests come at a time when other 
writers have managed to win increased freedom in such countries as 
the soviet union and south korea that had long stifled artistic 
expression 
according to the writers in prison committee under soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of liberalization or 
perestroika the number of jailed writers and journalists in the 
soviet union had dropped from 93 in 1983 to 20 in 1988 improvements 
in the treatment of writers were also noted in chile and argentina 
south korea released 281 political prisoners last dec 21 as part 
of an overall amnesty program journalist kim hyonjang and poet kim 
namju were among those granted freedom although hyonjang has 
since been rearrested for holding a sitin to protest the continued 
detention of other political prisoners 
czechoslovakia has also loosened some restrictions returning the 
novels of franz kafka to the stores of his home country for the 
first time since 1968 and allowing the films of director milos 
forman amadeus hair to be shown in theaters 
the positive side is whats going on in the soviet empire which 
is with some notable exceptions such as romania improving 
vastly sontag said the other positive thing is never has 
consciousness been so alerted to the problem there really is much 
more awareness and greater ability to publicize these cases and 
exert pressure on governments

the barrage of unsolicited advice being pressed 
on the supreme court as it reexamines abortion rights illustrates 
the complex role public opinion plays in the courts search for 
justice 
dozens of partsans including the bush administration are trying 
to sway the court as it prepares to hear arguments next month over 
missouri abortion regulations the lobbying has yielded 46 
friendofthecourt legal briefs 
the court expected to rule by july is being asked to use the 
case to overturn or limit its landmark 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
is the court influenced by such external pressure 
never for a very long period is the court out of touch with the 
populace said thomas g krattenmaker associate dean at the 
georgetown university law school theyre always sensitive to what 
they perceive to be the shared values of americans 
although public opinion polls indicate that most americans favor 
a womans right to abortion the antiabortion bush administration 
wants to leave the final word to state legislatures not the high 
court 
justice department lawyers are asking the court to declare there 
is no constitutional right to abortion leaving states free to 
restrict or outlaw abortions 
they said public opinion should be given more weight than the 
courts 16 years worth of decisions on abortion indeed the fact 
that this issue touches or can touch nearly everyones life 
means that it should be capable of resolution through the process of 
political dialogue the administration contended 
many constitutional experts agree that the nations mood has an 
impact on the outcome of the courts most significant rulings 
in the sense what would happen if you took a gallup poll the 
impact of public opinion is tiny said bruce fein a conservative 
lawyer who watches court cases closely 
but in a general sense of what is fair what is just and what 
is right public opinion is not going to be always decisive but it 
is always in the background he said 
years ago the notion that the high court reflects popular 
sentiment was expressed succinctly by finley peter dunne the author 
who penned the phrase no matter whether the constitution follows 
the flag or not the supreme court follows the election returns 
the truth probably is more complicated 
georgetowns krattenmaker said that in any given case the court 
is more likely to be influenced by an elite group than by the man in 
the street 
any political scientist will tell you this is the way any 
policymaker acts krattenmaker said hes sensitive to an elite 
group of people 
for supreme court justices he said the elite group usually 
includes lower court judges highranking government officials and 
to some extent legal experts 
jerome barron a law professor at george washington university 
said a recent decision striking down an affirmative action plan in 
richmond va may be an example of the justices following the 
election returns 
but barron noted that the court today is a more conservative one 
thats public opinion too a more conservative president appoints 
more conservative justices he said 
throughout the courts history some have accused it of being 
more interested in results than applying the law and interpreting 
the constitution impartially 
but usually the charge is made by those who feel disadvantaged by 
a court ruling 
many have noted that the court always confronts competing 
pressures that it be independent from rapidly shifting public 
opinion but close enough to the mainstream that it not forfeit its 
legitimacy as an institution of the democratic will 
never in its 200year history has the court been out of 
synchronization with the general public for more than five or 10 
years said courtwatcher fein 
before the civil war the court bucked public opinion in the 
north when it ruled that dred scott remained a slave after he 
traveled into free territory 
the ruling is blamed for reducing the courts stature to its 
alltime low and undermining its authority 
when court decisions of the 1950s and 1960s dramatically expanded 
civil and individual rights some said the court was drifting far 
from the american mainstream 
the chief justice became a lightning rod for criticism by 
conservatives and impeach earl warren billboards appeared 
but two decades later many of the warren courts most 
controversial rulings remain the law of the land and have become 
generally accepted 
public opinion polls and even demonstrations outside its building 
are not likely to sway the court but the justices acknowledge that 
expressions of popular sentiment can have an impact 
chief justice william h rehnquist reportedly once told a group 
of newspaper reporters and editors that a cogent editorial could be 
influential 
he is said to have commented wryly that the court is interested 
in solid logical arguments no matter how unlikely the source

soviet doctors overwhelmed by earthquake 
casualties in devastated armenia did the best they could with 
schoolboy karen kocharians crushed hand american doctors hoped to 
finish the job with complex microsurgery in this second story in an 
intermittent series tracing karens progress associated press 
reporter bruce rule describes agonizing hours inside the operating 
room and details the surgerys results 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the boy had told everyone im going to get 
my hand back 
now far from his home in armenia where an earthquake three 
months ago maimed his right hand karen kocharian waited with his 
father to be taken to the operating room for a transplant of toes 
for missing fingers the 9yearold grew quiet and withdrawn 
when doctors came to prepare karen his father sarkis carried 
the boy from the bed to the stretcher the interpreter hadnt 
arrived so the doctors tried using hand signs to explain what was 
happening karen and his father didnt understand 
sarkis kocharian tried to keep the boy calm but karen who also 
lost his left eye in the quake kept remembering operations in the 
soviet union every time he had gone into the operating room he 
came out with something missing 
normally a stoic man the father turned away several times and 
wiped tears from his eyes once or twice he sat and covered his head 
ahead was another long operation karens first since project 
hope brought him and 36 other young armenians to us hospitals for 
special treatment 
dr lee osterman director of hand surgery at childrens hospital 
of philadelphia estimated an 8hour operation 
it was not to be 
the first four hours were routine the veins and arteries being 
labelled and the second and third toes on the left foot amputated in 
one piece osterman said the missing toes would not affect karens 
ability to walk or to play his favorite game soccer 
after attaching the toe bones to the hand with pins osterman 
wheeled a highpowered microscope over to begin microsurgery 
he used a piece of vein from the foot to bridge the gap between a 
major hand artery which had been damaged in the quake and one in 
the transplanted toes the attachment completed osterman waited for 
the blood to flow into the new toefingers 
it didnt 
the pulse is there but its dying somewhere north of the thumb 
once it is hooked together it either flows or it doesnt osterman 
said 
he held up a closed fist to illustrate we like it to boom 
hook it up and it goes boom he said quickly opening his fingers 
the blockage could be simple spasms causing the vessels to 
contract because theyre cold osterman said or something inside in 
the vessel 
this is where the technique leaves and the luck begins he 
said 
estimating where the blockage might be in the artery he cut the 
vessel closer to the wrist blood spurted spitting two three feet 
onto the floor 
a second vein was used to reattach the arteries osterman said 
he could feel a thrill a pulse to the toefingers but not 
enough its not providing sufficient flow 
the operating room telephone rang a nurse said karens father 
was asking why the operation was taking so long it was 730 pm 
three hours after he thought it should have ended 
osterman went out to talk with kocharian and george ohanian a 
soviet immigrant storekeeper whose family is acting as host to the 
boy and his father 
hes fine the doctor said showing on his own hand what had 
been done inside ohanian translated it will be three maybe four 
more hours 
kocharian smiled slightly politely then nodded and looked down 
to the floor ohanian had been walking him through the halls since 
morning if we sit he begins to ask why its taking so long 
other armenian parents and armenianamerican helpers gathered 
around kocharian offering silent support albert zamanian whose 
17yearold daughter armenuhi was being treated for crushed arms 
gave him a set of middle eastern worry beads called tesbik 
kocharian absently fondled the yellow beads repeating over and 
over peace love god 
it was now 830 pm back in the operating room one of the 
assistants leaned over to osterman the assistants car was in a 
garage that closes at midnight osterman did not turn from the 
microscope 
better move it 
by 1100 pm osterman had almost completed attaching the toes 
vein to the hand when blood started flowing through the new 
appendages 
were getting a little but its still too white we want pink 
toes 
as the vein was completely attached the flow increased but the 
blood was not traveling through the toes properly 
the doctors talked and decided to close the wound and wait to 
see if the circulation improved they wrapped the hand leaving the 
toefingers sticking through the gauze 
it was shortly after midnight more than 16 hours after the 
operation began when osterman went to find karens father 
kocharian watched as the surgeon explained to ohanian what had 
happened throwing the best possible light on the operations 
chances 
leading the men down a hall near the recovery room osterman 
stopped the doctors pushing karens stretcher a doctor touched 
karens face and his eyes opened 
his father looked down smiled and nodded the boys eyes closed 
and kocharian broke down and turned to the wall sobbing in relief 
within days of the march 3 surgery karen had recovered enough to 
ask for his favorite american food corned beef sandwiches he also 
ate an armenian treat strawberries and watched monster movies on 
television 
circulation in the transplanted toes however had not increased 
last tuesday osterman operated again stripping the skin from 
the toefingers and inserting them into a flap of skin in the groin 
area karens hand will remain attached there for a month as the 
capillaries in the skin flap graft naturally to the hand 
the flap will then be cut away leaving only a scar and will be 
cut between the toes so the boy will have two fingers to work 
against his thumb 
his father shook his head after the second operation i am not 
convinced i am not sure that this is all over now that this 
one will work

toyota motor corp says its ready to begin 
nationwide advertising for its new luxury car division after a 
federal appeals court cleared the way for the japanese automaker to 
use the lexus name 
a threejudge panel of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in 
new york decided unanimously wednesday to overturn a lower courts 
ruling that barred toyota from using the name it also removed all 
injunctions and stays 
we won it was a 30 vote toyota spokesman kurt von zumwalt 
said by telephone from the companys us headquarters in california 
shortly after learning of the courts ruling 
toyota was sued by mead data central inc of dayton ohio last 
year mead claimed toyotas use of the lexus name infringed on its 
trademark for a computerized information retrieval service called 
lexis 
mead attorney charles faruki said wednesday the next step 
probably would be to take the case to the full appeals court 
i am disappointed but i never give in he said 
faruki and toyota attorney bill plourde said a written opinion 
would be issued later 
we of course are very pleased with the decision plourde 
said we will be interested to see what the opinion says now we 
can go forward with direct mailing which we had planned 
von zumwalt said the company was prepared to market its new cars 
with another name if it lost the case or if it dragged into next 
month 
we had plans for advertising in usa today and the wall street 
journal he said we canceled those ads because of this lawsuit 
those ads are ready to go 
mead filed the suit in new york citing that states socalled 
antidilution law governing trademarks in late december us 
district judge david edelstein ruled that toyota would be unable to 
use the lexus name because it would dilute the effect of meads 
lexis name even though he agreed that nobody would confuse lexus 
the car with lexis the dataretrieval service 
later toyota was permitted to use the lexus name at auto shows 
in detroit los angeles and chicago where it introduced the new 
models but it was barred from national advertising 
toyota challenged the orders and last week asked for an expedited 
ruling von zumwalt said 
the court took this action because of certain time requirements 
that we were facing plourde said we know that was behind their 
decision to issue their letter or decision today 
toyota plans to introduce the lexus luxury car line in september 
it will consist of two models ranging in price from about 20000 to 
about 35000 
among lexus competitors will be nissan motor corps infiniti 
line the japanese models also will be in showrooms this fall with a 
similar price range

the company that lost a bitter trademark 
dispute in a federal appeals court is a futuristic computerized 
information retrieval service with banks of computers in a 
bunkered earthquakeproof building 
mead data central inc of dayton electronically stores general 
news business legal medical and other information the data is 
fed daily from newspapers magazines wire services book publishers 
and other sources 
the information is collected through satellite transmissions 
telephone lines and even in the case of court documents 
transcribed from copies then placed in meads electronic library in 
a format that can be quickly located and retrieved 
everything thats happening today will be in our system or 
most of it by tomorrow said jack simpson president of mead 
data central 
the company has about 200000 active users in 50 countries its 
computer library is open 24 hours a day 365 days a year and runs 
between 50000 and 75000 active information searches every day 
about 500 million characters of information are added to the 
library weekly the company employs about 3000 workers 1500 of 
them in dayton the workers manage the information coming into the 
system and keep the computers operating 
a customer seeking information calls mead through a computer 
hookup the information is instantly researched and relayed back via 
computer with the customer billed for the amount of computer time 
used 
during the peak afternoon hours the mead computers can be 
handling as many as 900 calls simultaneously 
discs and computers are kept in a bunkered building on 15 acres 
the building is fireproof and earthquakeproof and has five huge 
diesel generators enough to run a small city in case power 
fails 
its a very sophisticated neverdie kind of a computing 
facility simpson said the customers are not very sympathetic 
if they need information and its not there 
mead data central is a unit of mead corp the daytonbased paper 
maker the subsidiary was formed about 15 years ago with the 
creation of lexus the electronic information system designed for 
law firms and corporations 
lexus is the focus of a trademark feud with japans toyota motor 
corp which has introduced a new luxury car called lexis mead data 
central said the lexis name infringed on its lexus name 
on wednesday a federal appeals court panel in new york turned 
aside mead data centrals attempt to bar toyota from using the lexus 
name it was unclear whether mead would appeal 
the company turned in a record year in 1988 pulling in more than 
300 million in revenue simpson has said he believes the computer 
information industry is still in the process of forming 
proving that you could put all of this in a computer and 
managing all those words took a lot of doing he said making it 
economical for law firms and corporations to use has been a big 
challenge 
simpson said the company is also moving into information storage 
for the securities and exchange commission which generates massive 
amounts of data the company is part of a consortium that recently 
won a 52 million contract to computerize the sec 
simpson said the amount of data held by the sec is equivalent to 
all of the information mead has put into its computer over the past 
15 years it would be the first federal agency to place its data in 
an electronic library in this form

a feminist who works to advance career 
opportunities for women caused a stir by writing in the harvard 
business review that female managers cost corporations more than 
male ones do 
felice n schwartz also urged employers to recognize two kinds of 
woman managers those who put their careers first and those who care 
more about their children 
the cost of employing women in management is greater than the 
cost of employing men ms schwartz wrote in the reviews 
januaryfebruary issue in her article management women and the 
new facts of life 
this is a jarring statement partly because it is true but 
mostly because it is something people are reluctant to talk about 
she wrote 
published by harvard business school the review has 210000 
subscribers about 95 percent of them in business since the issue 
was published furious debate has ensued said managing editor alan 
webber woman managers are talking about it at business conferences 
and the magazine has received a dozen letters it struck a 
nerve he said 
while many readers men and women alike applaud ms schwartz 
boldness some protest that it is damaging to women 
everybodys very troubled by it us rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo said wednesday in an interview from washington 
the article gives ammunition to those opposed to womens 
advancement ms schroeder said 
theres nothing they love more if you can find a woman who can 
say we dont deserve equal pay they love it the congresswoman 
said women have really felt in the 80s they were really going 
backward anyway and this gives the aura of the seal of approval of 
the harvard business school thats the tragedy 
webber however said the reaction he has received generally 
touches on two themes a lot of people say it is a mistake to 
categorize the issue as a womens issue that its a family issue 
younger men who are interested as a generation in raising 
children are facing pressures not unlike those facing women he 
said 
other letterwriters said they were glad someone opened debate on 
the subject its been kind of a dirty little secret webber 
said 
richard lewis chairman of corporate annual reports inc wrote 
to the review that the article is a historical turning point in 
the discussion of women in business 
ms schwartz is founder and president of catalyst a nonprofit 
research and advisory group in new york that works with corporations 
to foster career and leadership development of women 
a selfdescribed social advocate for 45 years ms schwartz said 
she is the mother of three sons and has four grandchildren all of 
them in twocareer families 
in the article ms schwartz said heightened sensitivity to 
charges of sexism as well as fear of confrontation and lawsuits 
prevent people from discussing the matter 
only a minority of women put their careers first but they must 
be cultivated the article asserts at the same time women serious 
about both their careers and their families can provide corporations 
with flexibility through jobsharing and parttime work even if it 
slows the womens progress up the ladder it says 
in an interview from new york ms schwartz said ruefully that 
those who attack her ideas need to read her article more closely 
her point was that corporations need to adjust to demographic

an excuse to keep women back what they want is the best and the 
brightest to come to their companies theyre not looking for 
excuses she said

the united states spent more than 2 billion to 
support the dollars value in foreignexchange trading during 
november and december but it reversed course by early this year as 
market conditions changed a federal reserve report shows 
the latest quarterly foreignexchange report issued wednesday by 
the federal reserve bank of new york showed the fed and the treasury 
department bought or sold 43 billion for the equivalent amount of 
west german marks or japanese yen between nov 1 and jan 31 
both agencies bought 24 billion against those two currencies in 
november and early december and sold 188 billion against marks in 
january as market sentiment turned more bullish 
in the previous threemonth period from august to october us 
intervention totaled 23 billion with the government selling 214 
billion for marks and buying 200 billion with yen 
sam y cross an executive vice president of the new york fed 
said the latest operations were designed to maintain market 
stability and generally were coordinated between the central banks 
of the group of seven industrial nations besides the united 
states the g7 includes japan britain west germany france italy 
and canada 
we dont have targets for the dollar cross explained at a 
news briefing we just try to bring about greater stability 
cross said that some of the governments intervention operations 
were done jointly with other central banks but at other times the 
united states acted alone after notifying its trading partners 
currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of 
central banks in the open markets but the feds policy is to 
comment only well after the fact the fed also does not provide any 
data on intervention by foreign central banks 
the dollarbuying operations by the fed and treasury in november 
and early december came as the currency was coming under continuing 
pressure in worldwide markets especially against the mark and yen 
the dollar had started to decline in late september and reached 
its lows of the novemberjanuary period on nov 25 when it fell to 
12065 yen and 17085 marks or about 11 percent below the highs of 
the year reached in early fall lately it has been trading in the 
markets at around 180 marks and 128 yen 
the dollars weakness had come as the market began to doubt that 
the large improvement in the us trade deficit experienced during 
early 1988 would continue traders also expressed growing impatience 
with the lack of progress in reducing the nations huge budget 
deficit 
those concerns came to a head after the nov 4 presidential 
election with currency traders questioning whether the bush 
administration could reduce the twin deficits and keep its promise 
not to raise taxes 
intervention began nov 1 and nov 2 when the government bought 
350 million against the sale of yen according to the fed report 
the government also entered the market from nov 9 to nov 16 when 
it bought 625 million with yen and between nov 17 and dec 2 
when it bought 795 million with yen and 630 million against marks 
the report said 
by the new year the currency market had shed its negative view 
of the dollar the turnaround began after soviet general secretary 
gorbachev proposed soviet arms cuts in a dec 7 speech before the 
united nations 
the speech was temporarily seen as providing scope for the 
united states to reduce its budget deficit through defense spending 
cuts the fed report noted but even after that the dollar 
continued to rise as interest rates continued to move higher it 
said 
the government sold dollars against marks on the 12 days between 
jan 6 and jan 27 the report said 
the dollar reached its highest point of the decade in february 
1985 it declined slightly until september 1985 when g7 leaders 
agreed to lower its value to help narrow the us trade gap and 
stave off protectionist sentiment in congress 
the dollar touched bottom in the final days of 1987 before 
rebounding sharply at the beginning of 1988

the major commercial television networks are 
pointing to the merger pact between time inc and warner 
communications inc to support their campaign for relaxed federal 
regulation of program ownership 
but independent television stations who have become a much 
stronger competitor for the abc cbs and nbc networks in recent 
years say deregulation would unfairly skew the competition for 
programming in favor of the networks 
one of the motivations cited for the timewarner combination was 
an interest in keeping pace with what is quickly becoming a global 
market for media and entertainment companies 
time a leader in magazine publishing cable networks and cable 
system operations has the potential to provide more outlets for 
warners entertainment production units including its movie and 
television studios 
the networks say they share the ambition to compete in the global 
marketplace but are hamstrung by a court decree limiting the amount 
of primetime programming they may produce and federal regulations 
forbidding them from having a financial interest in the other shows 
they run 
the timewarner agreement is a vivid example of how greatly the 
media world has changed said cory dunham general counsel for the 
national broadcasting co but by government regulation the 
networks cant participate in this evolution 
george schweitzer a spokesman for cbs inc said those we 
compete with and are in the same business are free to think of any 
competitive situation they want they are free to grow their 
business and we are not 
under terms of a 9yearold court consent decree due to expire 
next year the television networks may produce no more than five 
hours of their own primetime entertainment programming 
even at that the networks have shown little inclination to 
produce their own shows abcs moonlighting was recently placed 
on hiatus but the other two networks have none of their own shows 
on their primetime schedules 
separately the networks are prohibited from having a financial 
interest in other shows they run or sharing in the proceeds from the 
syndication of network shows for reruns under terms of federal 
communications commission rules adopted nearly 20 years ago 
in addition there are rules that prohibit networks from 
packaging their own programs with programs others produce and 
selling them here or abroad 
the networks and hollywood studios have been negotiating 
privately for months on reaching a compromise on the issue of 
federal regulation of networks 
the networks argue that their dominance of the television market 
has slipped since the fcc rules were enacted 
as of last november the three networks share of the primetime 
audience fell to 68 percent from 92 percent in the 197879 season 
according to nielsen media research network executives say they 
expect their combined share may fall even further 
nbcs dunham said the networks are not so much interested in 
being able to buy a studio as they are in being able to invest in 
new productions and to buy and package programs for distribution 
abroad 
to be a viable player in this business you need to be a player 
in the businesses that make it up he said 
but the movie studios and the independent television stations 
argue that the networks simply want to strengthen an already strong 
market position 
lawrence laurent a spokesman for the association of independent 
television stations said before the financial interest rules were 
enacted the networks withheld their most popular shows from the 
syndication market or sold them first to their own stations and 
their own network affiliates 
enactment of the rules allowed independents to compete more 
effectively for popular shows a position they dont want to 
relinquish its very difficult to depend on your competitor for 
programming he said

the creators of channel one the daily news show 
launched this week in six schools have agreed to pull a levis 
jeans ads from the program because detroit school officials found it 
sexually suggestive 
the decision to pull the ad comes as the project begins a 25show 
test amid complaints from some educators that it is inappropriate to 
allow television advertisements in their classrooms 
the 30second levis ad which has aired on commercial 
television shows a montage of scenes with young people including a 
boys choir several youngsters dancing and a romantic couple 
walking away together 
robin oden principal at mumford high school in detroit said 
wednesaday that four of the eight people he instructed to review the 
program before it was aired in classrooms monday felt the levis ad 
was sexually suggestive 
oden said that although he had the choice of not running the 
program he ran it anyway because it was the first day of the test 
and a big media contingent was on hand to write about it 
but he said he told officials of whittle communications the 
knoxville tennbased media concern that developed channel one he 
wouldnt air the ad any more 
bill gubbins a whittle official who was in detroit that day 
said he assured oden the ad would not be repeated 
this is a test and one of the things we are learning about is 
how broad or how narrow the sensitivities are going to be in the 
individual schools he said we wanted to make sure they felt 
their concerns were being addressed 
dan chew marketing manager at levi strauss amp co in san 
francisco said wednesday his company and its ad agency were 
notified there was a problem with the ad he said it is one of four 
commercials the company planned to rotate through shows during the 
test 
we have made no changes to that plan weve heard nothing from 
anyone about it and until that request comes in formally we will 
stick with our schedule he said 
levi strauss is one of eight advertisers signed up for the test 
others are procter amp gamble cos head amp shoulders shampoo wrigley 
cos gum warnerlambert cos breath mints and gillette cos 
shaving products 
sara fortune a spokesman for whittle said she was unaware of 
any other complaints from test schools about the ads 
whittle has given each school 50000 in televisions video 
recording equipment and a satellite dish to receive the 12minute 
news program each day each show will contain up to two minutes of 
advertising 
in exchange the schools are asked to show the program once each 
school day 
several education groups including the national parentteacher 
association and the national association of secondary school 
principals denounced the commercials calling them an unwarranted 
intrusion by business into the schools 
but students and teachers who have seen the program expressed few 
reservations about the ads and said they liked a news show targeted 
to teens oden himself said that even though he wasnt happy with 
the levis commercial he was pleased with the first three shows 
the information they give to the kids is outstanding the 
students have told me this news show is not boring thats the 
general feeling the youngsters have about watching the program he 
said

actress meryl streep says her national 
television appearances warning against eating chemically treated 
apples doesnt mean shes beating up on farmers 
but the washington apple industry blasted the movie star 
wednesday saying her involvement in a nationwide controversy on the 
chemical alar is hurting growers 
three years ago movie actresses were spilling all over the 
place trying to save the family farm said chris schlect an 
industry lobbyist based in yakima now we have actresses going out 
trying to destroy agriculture 
schlect head of the northwest horticultural council said the 
academy awardwinning actress has credibility because of her movie 
roles but it doesnt make her a scientist or expert on 
nutrition 
ms streep a founder of the group mothers and others for 
pesticide limits told the associated press her lack of scientific 
training was not the issue 
im not a scientist so i have to go with the best information 
available she said i eat them and i feed them to my three 
children so i am involved in the apple issue 
im not interested in beating up on farmers ms streep said 
im interested in farmers being supported to grow in ways not 
threatening to health 
although the safety of alar has been debated for years the 
latest controversy was stirred last month because of a report by the 
natural resources defense council 
the council a nonprofit consumer group projected that 5500 to 
6200 preschoolers eventually would get cancer because of childhood 
exposure to six to eight chemicals used in fruits and vegetables 
it found the greatest risk from udmh a breakdown product of 
alar the council estimated that the average preschoolers cancer 
risk was approximately one case for every 4000 preschoolers exposed 
to udmh 
the report has been attacked by some scientists and the us 
environmental protection agency as misleading and alarmist although 
the agency did announce plans to ban alar by 1990 
fears of a consumer backlash have prompted the apple industry to 
severely cut its use of alar the growerfinanced washington apple 
commission says only about 5 percent of total apple acreage is 
treated 
washington is the nations largest apple producer growing about 
half of all supermarket apples 
ms streep whose group is affiliated with the council has 
appeared on shows like today and donahue denouncing the use 
of alar and calling on farmers to reduce chemical use 
the controversy showed no signs of easing wednesday as the new 
york board of education said it has barred the sale of apples in 
school cafeterias 
to combat the negative publicity the apple commission announced 
it was spending 1 million on fullpage advertisements that will 
appear friday in new york washington dc and los angeles papers 
as well as usa today spokeswoman vicky scharlau said 
the ads will say that alar is used only sparingly that its 
health threat isnt proven and that the benefits of eating apples 
far outweigh any risks 
alar is not a pesticide it is a chemical growth regulator 
sprayed on trees to improve the color and firmness of apples 
extending shelf life and the harvest period because it works 
internally alar cannot be washed off like other chemicals

residents concerned about a financial 
crisis that threatens mass layoffs of st francis county employees 
have paid more than 100000 in taxes in recent days seven months 
before they were due 
i know its unusual ive never seen anybody come to the 
collectors office without a tax statement to look me up and say 
heres the money county clerk dick krablin said wednesday 
its great although we are not out of the woods by any means 
the eastern arkansas county which has the states highest 
jobless rate owes about 240000 and has only about 20000 in the 
bank officials blamed the shortfall on the elimination of federal 
revenue sharing and costs such as 106000 in courtmandated jail 
improvements 
as a shortterm solution to the crisis county officials began 
encouraging early tax payments on friday the day the quorum court 
budget committee considered emergency spending cuts the full court 
is to vote tuesday on other actions including slashing payrolls by 
50 percent 
without new money the county cant meet a march 31 payroll 
the county usually mails property tax statements from march to 
june and payments arent due until oct 10 but to encourage early 
payments volunteers have crowded county offices each night to 
stuff sort and mail statements that include a letter pleading for 
early remittance 
about 9000 out of 25000 tax statements had been mailed by 
wednesday and volunteers will work through the weekend krablin 
said 
but the money weve gotten so far gosh 109000 thats 
from people who heard we had problems and just stepped right up to 
help we havent advertised its just been media coverage and word 
of mouth krablin said 
the volunteers include two dozen county employees with a personal 
stake in the fiscal crisis 
jerry smith chairman of the county office of the cooperative 
extension service said hes faced with laying off about 10 of his 
14 employees in a worstcase scenario 
these courthouse employees are doing their deadlevel best to 
help smith said theyve been working hard and we will keep 
working 
if all of the taxes are paid promptly about 4 million will be 
generated krablin said 
but the county general fund gets only 10 percent of the total 
with most obligated for schools and krablin said not everyone can 
pay quickly because the county has been battered by industrial 
layoffs a slumping farm economy and the burden of arkansas highest 
unemployment rate 234 percent in january 
its just going to be impossible for some people and we dont 
want to embarrass them krablin said it is a voluntary 
gesture

jerrell sheppard has cleaned aircraft engines at 
eastern airlines for the past five years and takes pride in a job 
well done 
six months ago he was in a car accident and was placed on 
shortterm disability at half pay that stopped last month after a 
company doctor said he could go back to work but the letter from 
the carrier authorizing his return never came 
now sheppard 43 is walking a machinist picket line wearing a 
neck brace he has medical debts of about 6000 has lost his 
insurance benefits and faces the prospect he may lose his 
30000ayear job 
you feel bad about not being at work but you have to come out 
here and support the union and what you believe in sheppard said 
wednesday 
similar sentiments came from other eastern employees including 
pilots and flight attendants who joined the machinists when they 
struck the miamibased carrier saturday 
i think people are still very pumped up said peggy richards 
34 a flight attendant picketing in front of a virtually empty 
eastern terminal at miami international airport weve all cried 
but the depression hasnt set in were still on a high 
emotion was evident wednesday night at a rally just outside the 
machinists union hall which has turned into a sometimes chaotic 
strike headquarters for pilots and flight attendants as well jesse 
jackson charged up about 3000 workers with a message that in unity 
they would prevail 
the solidarity of the machinists pilots and flight attendants 
has surprised some of the pickets 
im encouraged mainly because of the support of all the 
unions said dwight bush 43 a 22year eastern employee if 
its not going to work out were better off looking for something 
else 
many workers say they have been contacting other airlines or 
considering a career change if the company collapses but finding 
another job might prove difficult in the miami area if thousands of 
colleagues have to do the same bush acknowleged 
the machinists union has a 100 million strike fund and is paying 
100 a week to members who picket at least four hours a week the 
pilots union expects to pay its members 30 days after their last 
paycheck but no figure has been set 
flight attendants dont have a strike war chest although the 
association of flight attendants and the aflcio were expected to 
provide some funds 
richards started fulltime with eastern 13 years ago and calls 
the job addicting but she said if she cant return to the 
airline shell probably get a nursing job 
richards said she went back to school as labor turmoil escalated 
at eastern if she sought employment at another airline her 
starting pay could be half her current salary

a federal judge has allowed creditors to begin 
claiming the assets of former automaker john delorean after an 
extension ran out on a 94 million bankruptcy settlement 
us district judge james woods on wednesday accepted an order 
from creditors who seek deloreans first payment of 49 million 
the money was due feb 28 
the 1987 settlement stems from claims against delorean whose 
sports car company went bankrupt in 1984 after his arrest on federal 
cocaine smuggling charges delorean was acquitted he also was 
acquitted of fraud in detroit 
mayer morganroth an attorney representing delorean said 
wednesday that a utah bank and a new york mortgage banking company 
are preparing a loan for delorean 
the payment hasnt been made because delorean is fighting a 53 
million judgment handed down on behalf of a british creditor 
morganroth said 
deloreans assets which could be claimed and sold if he fails 
to produce the payment include a utah manufacturing company a new 
york city apartment and a mansion and farm in new jersey

trans world airlines chairman carl c icahn said 
he is willing to meet with eastern airlines unions to discuss buying 
the strikeparalyzed carrier if he is invited by easterns 
management 
but pressed to the limit eastern filed for protection from its 
creditors under federal bankruptcy laws today a move that could 
make an icahn takeover more cumbersome the acquisition of a company 
operating under chapter 11 protection requires approval from both 
creditors and the bankruptcy court 
icahns emergence in the quickly deteriorating situation at 
eastern came wednesday the fifth day of a strike at the subsidiary 
of texas air corp run by an old icahn adversary frank lorenzo 
both battled for control of twa in 1985 a fight icahn eventually 
won 
icahn said the striking machinists union had contacted him 
several times in the last week asking him to enter into talks with 
the union concerning the acquisition by twa of eastern 
i would be willing to speak to the unions only if eastern 
permits me to because i do not want to be accused by eastern of 
interfering with the collective bargaining process icahn said in 
a statement from his suburban new york office 
he had mulled a possible bid for eastern last fall when lorenzo 
was considering selling the airline but icahn and the unions 
couldnt agree on terms for a worker stake in a merger of twa and 
eastern and talks broke off in october 
the financier reportedly was seeking 250 million to 300 million 
in labor concessions in exchange for an equity stake in eastern for 
the unions brian freeman financial adviser to the international 
association of machinists said he has asked icahn to consider 
restarting merger or takeover talks since the eastern strike began 
saturday 
freeman who also advises twa employees said he first suggested 
acquiring eastern to icahn last year 
icahn seemed serious when we were discussing it with him a long 
time ago he said i think to anyone who looks at this logically 
it makes a lot of sense its not a panacea its a way to 
problemsolve lesser evils 
this is the most reasonable alternative if terms can be worked 
out he added 
a secretary for charles e bryan president of the machinists 
local in miami said the union leader would not comment on icahns 
statement 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the airline would not comment 
on icahn 
icahn one of the decades leading takeover investors has chased 
several large companies besides his takeover of twa he has 
undertaken battles for steelenergy conglomerate usx corp and oil 
giant texaco inc he remains a major stockholder in both of those 
companies 
wall street considers a sale to twa as one possible solution to 
the financial woes at eastern which analysts estimate is worth 
between 400 million plus debt assumption to 900 million if sold as 
an entity 
if icahn and this is a big if is serious about keeping twa 
a major player well into the 90s he has to make some capital moves 
to acquire some other airlines or major equipment buys said louis 
marckesano an analyst with janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia it would seem eastern would be cheapest way to do 
both 
icahn who took twa private last year reportedly was interested 
in easterns northsouth routes especially between new york and 
miami as possible feeders into the airlines transatlantic system 
twa is the nations sixthlargest airline in terms of capacity 
while eastern is the seventhlargest

iowas first television station kwqc of 
davenport has been offered for sale by palmer communications inc 
the privately held company announced 
william ryan president and chief executive officer of the des 
moinesbased communications company said wednesday that palmer has 
hired howard stark a new york television broker to sell the 
station which palmer officials said is worth more than 45 million 
ryan said the decision to sell the station was made after palmer 
agreed feb 27 to buy ktvytv of oklahoma city from knightridder 
inc terms of that sale were not disclosed 
ryan said that by selling its davenport station and reinvesting 
the capital gain in the oklahoma city property palmer could defer 
taxes on the gain from the sale no other property could be sold in 
order to get the tax deferment he said 
this was not an easy decision kwqctv is a great television 
station it has performed exceedingly well and were very proud of 
it ryan said 
while the potential sale of kwqctv is outside our normal 
activities these unique tax circumstances may allow palmer in 
effect to sell a station in the 79th largest market and buy one in 
the 39th largest market for little money he said 
ryan said the company hopes to find a buyer by late this year 
but it is possible that a transaction might not be completed until 
1990 while kwqctv is an attractive property he said the market 
for television stations has softened lately because of rising 
interest rates 
ryan announced the pending sale after flying to davenport to tell 
the stations staff kwqctv employs 98 people 
john sloan the stations general manager said employees reacted 
with cautious optimism because of the stations success he said 
any knowledgeable buyer likely would carry on business as usual 
kwqctv first went on the air in 1949 and used to have the call 
letters woc 
palmer also owns whotv and radio stations whoam and klyffm in 
des moines radio stations in tallahassee fort myers and naples

emhart corps board of directors today 
rejected an unsolicited 24 billion takeover offer from an 
investment group saying the bid was inadequate and possibly illegal 
the board raised the question of possible insider trading 
pointing specifically to the unusual trading of emhart stock 
prior to disclosure of the takeover bid 
peter l scott emhart chairman and chief executive officer 
recommended in a letter that shareholders not tender any of their 
shares to new yorkbased topper acquisition corp 
topper whose investors include oil heir gordon p getty and new 
york developers lawrence and zachary fisher had made an offer of 
35 a share on feb 24 for emhart a multinational producer of 
industrial and consumer products emhart also provides electronic 
systems technology sevices for commercial markets and the government 
the board was advised that the nature of the offer the rumors 
and the unusual trading activity that preceded the offer and 
toppers financing arrangements for the offer raise serious legal 
questions scott said in his letter to shareholders 
emharts stock was at 3275 a share when topper tendered its 
offer the stock had risen almost 10 a share in the month prior to 
the offer amid takeover rumors 
scott added in a prepared statement i have grave concerns 
about the abnormal trading activity that occurred in emharts stock 
before the announcement of the topper offer this trading raises 
disquieting questions as to whether the governments actions aimed 
at curbing insider trading on nonpublic information have been 
effective 
charles larson a spokesman for the us securities and exchange 
commission in washington dc said it was the agencys policy not 
to comment on what it may or may not be investigating 
enforcement investigations are private and nonpublic we 
do have a market surveillance section and it is that sections 
responsibility to review imbalances in trading on various 
exchanges larson said 
topper has filed a lawsuit in us district court in richmond 
va to force the sale contending that the companys shareholders 
rights plan commonly known as a poison pill or antitakeover 
measure is discriminatory emhart filed a countersuit 
scott said the board is confident that toppers lawsuit 
challenging emharts shareholders rights plan will fail but as a 
precaution the company said it would redeem the existing rights 
effective march 20 for 25 cents a share and issue new rights to 
shareholders on march 20 
the new rights will be identical in all material respects to 
the existing rights except that the new rights will not contain the 
provision about which topper complains scott said 
scott said the farmingtonbased companys board based its 
rejection on advice from its financial advisers wasserstein 
perella amp co and shearson lehman hutton inc scott said the 
advisers determined the offer was inadequate from a financial 
point of view 
in his letter scott said the board also took into consideration 
the companys restructuring effort that began in 1986 and four 
recent acquisitions he noted these efforts resulted in record 
earnings of 1266 million in 1988 following earnings of 1065 
million in 1987 
the board believes that the full benefits of the companys 
strategies have yet to be realized and that emhart is in a position 
to continue to build on the favorable results achieved over the past 
two years scott said in his letter accordingly the board does 
not believe that now is an opportune time to sell the company

negotiations between congress and the white 
house on a fiscal 1990 budget should usher in a little more give 
and take an administration spokesman said today shortly before 
the talks were to begin 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the meeting 
scheduled to begin this afternoon will build on informal sessions 
between administration and congressional officials that laid the 
groundwork 
this formalization of the negotiating process should usher in a 
little more give and take said fitzwater 
he said bush would also convene a larger meeting with staff and a 
wider group of congressional leaders possibly as soon as next week 
to work on budget compromises 
if theres enough good will here on both sides then we can 
find an answer said house budget chairman leon panetta dcalif 
who announced the new talks along with senate budget chairman jim 
sasser dtenn 
white house budget director richard darman leading the bush 
administration negotiating team has been pushing for the talks ever 
since the president sent his 116 trillion spending plan to 
congress on feb 9 
were very pleased to see this development said barbara 
clay darmans spokeswoman 
house speaker jim wright dtexas who has been cool to the idea 
of early budget negotiations with the republican white house 
downplayed expectations for the new round of discussions rather 
than calling it a summit he told reporters it was a budget 
plateau 
democrats wanted to start with a level playing field with 
military programs subject to cuts not just domestic programs as 
president bush proposed in his 116 trillion spending plan he said 
darman has been meeting with congressional budget writers of both 
parties for weeks but lawmakers insisted that those talks be 
limited to quizzing the administration on details of its plan 
the new discussions were welcomed by the white house 
congessional budget writers have been meeting privately with 
darman for weeks but democrats insisted those discussions were 
limited to finding out more detail about the budget bush presented 
last month 
many democrats contend the bush budget revealed mostly the 
politically popular aspects of a spending plan that in order to 
reduce the federal deficit will eventually require cuts in federal 
programs 
we propose that the budget task force discussions enter a new 
phase an exploration of areas of possible compromise between 
congress and the administration on a fiscal year 1990 budget said 
the letter released wednesday by sasser and panetta 
panetta said he hoped the talks would be modeled after the 1987 
agreement between the reagan white house and congress and produce 
a framework for a budget resolution agreement on overall 
spending limits for broad budget categories such as defense foreign 
aid and entitlements 
taxes also would be discussed panetta said although bush has 
insisted he would agree to no increases 
the talks were approved by senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and wright the democratic leaders planned to 
review the progress after two weeks to determine whether the talks 
would continue according to the letter 
the grammrudman law calls for congress and the president to 
reduce the federal deficit to no more than 100 billion in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 
bush contends his plan accomplished that goal without tax 
increases some leading democrats contend taxes are needed along 
with spending cuts and a report by the nonpartisan congressional 
budget office to be released thursday calculated the president 
exceeded the deficit target 
the cbo said that bushs budget would leave a deficit of about 
109 billion not including selloffs of government assets which 
dont count as deficit reduction under grammrudman thats about 
14 billion higher than the bush administration estimate 
the cbo also estimates that another 25 billion would be added to 
the deficit if bushs bailout offbudget plan for the savings 
and loan industry were included in the deficit calculations

at a late afternoon press conference wednesday 
eastern airlines said it would file for bankruptcy only as a last 
resort just 17 hours later the time arrived 
attorneys for the strikehobbled airline filed for protection 
from creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws shortly 
after 9 am today 
analysts and lawyers say frank lorenzo chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp will have a tougher time breaking union 
contracts imposing lower wages and keeping the airline alive than 
he did when he reorganized continental airlines under federal 
bankruptcy law 
eastern attorney bruce zirinsky said the company would seek to 
reorganize under the bankruptcy laws but he would not comment on 
whether the plan would dissolve the carrier or attempt to keep it 
flying 
after lorenzo put continental into bankruptcy in september 1983 
he reduced the number of employees to about 4000 from 12500 
partly because of that congress amended federal laws in 1984 to 
require bankrupt companies to negotiate with unions and prove 
economic necessity before abrogating their contracts 
lorenzo has been careful to operate continental eastern and 
texas air as independent concerns to eliminate the possiblity that a 
bankruptcy judge might raid the parent company for money to pay 
easterns creditors for example continental paid abovemarket 
prices recently to buy planes from eastern an analyst said 
he has absolutely kept them separate and at arms length said 
one wall street analyst who asked not to be identified hes got 
the best bankruptcy guys in the world going for him 
analysts said a likely scenario would be the demise of the 
60yearold carrier and a fire sale of its assets to competitors 
if the idea of chapter 11 is the way lorenzo sees to fly 
through this thing he still faces the problem of finding people to 
fly the planes said henry oechler a new york aviation lawyer 
but the bankruptcy laws do significantly reduce the financial 
hemorrhaging he is now facing 
the possibility eastern had reemerged wednesday when trans world 
airlines chairman carl icahn said eastern unions asked him to resume 
talks begun last year about acquiring the ailing carrier icahn said 
he would be willing to do so if eastern permitted the talks 
wall street analysts estimate eastern has been losing 2 million 
to 7 million daily during the sixdayold walkout by machinists 
pilots and flight attendants 
eastern spokesman robin matell said wednesday the airline would 
consider bankruptcy only as a last resort 
chapter 11 protection frees eastern of its obligations to 
creditors but it also could hamstring lorenzo in selling parts of 
the airline to raise money every deal would require court approval 
under a reorganization plan which also would be subject to creditor 
approval 
lorenzo could have sought creditor protection under chapter 7 
which governs liquidation of a company that would have meant an 
auction of easterns assets reportedly worth 38 billion last 
september 
wall street estimates eastern is worth far more in a 
piecebypiece auction than the 400 million to 900 million it 
could fetch as a unit its major assets include landing slots and 
gates at major airports its south american operation is valued at 
150 million and its miami maintenance facility at 300 million 
theyre better off opening the doors monday morning and saying 
that friday at 2 oclock well be accepting bids for any part of 
eastern airlines one analyst said 
in a move to inject cash usair announced wednesday that it had 
reached agreement to buy all eight of easterns gates at 
philadelphia international airport for 70 million and easterns 
philadelphiatoronto and philadelphiamontreal routes for 15 
million the airlines said the deal had been in the works for some 
time 
richard lieb a new york bankruptcy attorney said large 
companies with a debt as big as easterns normally file under 
chapter 11 leaving unions in a better position to receive pensions 
and allowing the company to be broken up and sold if need be 
miamibased eastern is rapidly spending the 402 million in cash 
it had at the beginning of the year most of which represented 
prepaid tickets the airline now must refund to passengers or pay to 
competitors who honor eastern tickets 
eastern had a 70 million debt payment due at the end of march 
and expenses for aircraft leases airport gates other overhead and 
salaries for the 1500 workers who remain on the job 
it also owed payments of about 25 million a month on 25 
billion in debt texas air inherited when it bought eastern for about 
615 million in february 1986

said syntro is preparing a response to upjohns suit the syntro 
vaccine was introduced in april 1988 and is marketed in eight to 10 
states where pseudorabies in swine is a major problem he said 
the viral infection causes symptoms including weight loss

his swearingin ceremony today to weed out mediocre and 
substandard practices in running the nations problemridden 
nuclear weapons complex 
nuclear power demands no less than the best from all who 
control it he told a ceremony attended by president bush and 
several hundred department employees 
i ask you to help me promote a work attitude within the 
department that rejects the mediocre and substandard said

nuclear weapons plants which are operated by private contracters 
for the energy department safety technical and environmental 
problems at many of the 16 major plants in 12 states have virtually

the federal government must assure us 
electronic manufacturers they will be protected from marketing 
policies in japan before the next generation of television 
technology can develop in this country congress was told today 
us manufacturers of tv receivers and vcrs were driven out of 
business in the 1960s and 1970s primarily because of priceslashing 
collusion and socalled dumping of lowpriced japanese tv sets in 
this country said clyde prestowitz a senior associate at the 
carnegie endowment for international peace 
faced with the possibility of that kind of competition from the 
japanese again us manufacturers may be reluctant to enter the 
burgeoning era of highdefinition television prestowitz said 
it was the marketing factors that were the most important ones 
in the demise of the us industry prestowitz told the second day 
of a house subcommittee hearing on what government policy should be 
regarding hdtv in the next century 
at the same time prestowitz said the us government must tread 
carefully in any effort to protect the us electronics industry 
because us companies also are trying to enter foreign markets 
we might consider some reciprocity requirement conditioning 
foreign participation in us efforts to develop hdtv on the 
possibility of us participation overseas 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher testified wednesday that the 
private sector should determine what if any aid it needs before 
the government becomes a partner with business to develop an hdtv 
industry in the united states 
in my view the private sector must take the lead with the 
government getting the hindrances out of the way mosbacher told 
the subcommittee 
rep edward j markey dmass asked the administration to 
provide congress with quarterly updates on progress towards an hdtv 
manufacturing capacity a burgeoning technology that witnesses at 
the house hearing said was crucial to us competitiveness in the 
next century 
markey asked witnesses before the subcommittee which he chairs 
if a governmentindustry consortium would help the united states 
overcome a big japanese lead in technology that promises wallsized 
tv screens with motionpicture clarity 
the defense department is offering 30 million to private 
companies to develop hdtv technology but markey said what we 
would clearly like to see is a civilian orientation 
mosbacher said it was premature to seek such a governmentprivate 
sector link in the face of foreign competition until the private 
sector decides what it needs 
the government is considering tax incentives and possible 
antitrust exemptions for us companies that wish to band together 
in the hdtv effort he said 
us industry must remain preeminent in the drive to develop 
hdtv which he said could represent 140 billion in sales of tvs and 
vcrs in the united states in next 20 years he said 
the impact of hdtv will go far beyond entertainment uses to areas 
such as medicine education retailing and defense he said 
establishing government policy in this area has the highest 
priority at the commerce department mosbacher said and he 
expects to be able to make a recommendation to congress on the 
government role in the next two months 
the defense department is offering 30 million to industry to 
help develop hdtv and many subcommittee members and mosbacher 
said the money should go to us companies 
some of americas largest electronics concerns and some of their 
biggest foreign competitors have filed applications for the defense 
department seed money 
the pentagon said wednesday it had received 87 proposals by its 
feb 27 deadline at least two foreign electronic giants submitted 
funding requests the sony corp of america a subsidiary of the 
japanese conglomerate and north american philips corp a 
subsidiary of nv philips of the netherlands

dennis e eckart dohio noting sonys proposal for defense 
department research funds said the government should consider 
limiting the money to us companies 
i think this committee and the american taxpayers have to 
question whether or not we want to provide us taxpayers dollars 
to foreign competitors when this gentleman is not yet convinced 
those foreign competitors are treating us fairly in other world 
marketplaces he said 
its one thing not to treat us fair he said its another 
thing for them to use american taxpayers dollars to try to elbow 
their way into the head of the line 
another witness state department ambassador sonia landau said 
the united states was urging adoption of one world standard for hdtv 
transmission in order to protect the us motion picture and tv

soybean futures prices were slightly higher 
reflecting firmer cash prices after a mixed opening today on the 
chicago board of trade while grain futures were nearly unchanged in 
early trading 
the soybean markets modest rally defied expectations that 
wednesdays steep declines would be extended into todays session 
wednesdays losses were attributed to technical factors and to 
nervousness about the looming brazilian soybean harvest which is 
expected to be the most bountiful ever for the worlds 
secondlargest soybean producer 
but instead of followthrough selling the soybean complex gained 
support from higher cash markets and from ideas that wednesdays 
losses were overdone 
grain futures were very narrowly mixed although some observers 
expected forecasts for warm dry weather in the nations midsection 
to give the wheat market a boost 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to 1 cents higher with

eastern airlines bankruptcy filing threw 
members of congress into confusion today just as they were set to 
work on legislation that would force a reluctant president bush to 
temporarily halt the crippling strike against the carrier 
the house public works and transportation committee had planned 
to approve the legislation today and send it for a vote to the full 
house next week where passage with the overwhelming support of the 
majority democrats would be expected 
but the panel postponed its meeting at least until midafternoon 
when lawmakers received word that the ailing airline had filed for 
protection from creditors in us bankruptcy court in new york 
rep james oberstar dminn chairman of the public works and 
transportation aviation subcommittee and other members of the panel 
said there were concerns that legislation dealing with one specific 
company involved in bankruptcy proceedings might be unconstitutional 
they said they believed that under the law bankruptcy 
legislation must be applied uniformly not just to one company they 
also said they believed the problem could be resolved 
i think we can sort this out oberstar told reporters 
but oberstar and rep glenn anderson dcalif chairman of the 
full committee offered no specifics when asked how the bankruptcy 
proceedings might cause the legislation to be changed 
there may be some amendments anderson said 
the legislation approved tuesday along party lines by the 
aviation subcommittee would require bush to appoint an emergency 
board to review the differences between eastern and the 
international association of machinists which represents 8500 
machinists baggage handlers and other ground workers 
the strikers would return to work for up to 60 days while the 
board studied the dispute which is largely over wages and benefits 
and recommended a solution 
the carriers pilots and flight attendants have honored the 
machinists picket lines forcing eastern to terminate most of its 
1040 daily flights 
sen phil gramm rtexas said wednesday he would oppose the 
legislation when it reaches the senate where determined procedural 
maneuvering by one lawmaker can sometimes spell the end of a bill 
i certainly am going to oppose any effort by congress to force 
the president to take any action that limits his prerogative 
gramm told a reporter 
but even if the legislation makes it through congress 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner has said he will urge 
bush to veto the bill the administration has argued that appointing 
a review board will do little to solve a fight that has been waged 
for 17 months or to move the ailing airline away from the 
possibility of bankruptcy 
democrats concede they would not have the twothirds majority in 
both chambers needed to override the veto they have pressed the 
legislation anyway arguing that to do so prods eastern and its 
unions to settle their disputes pressures bush to change his 
position and at the very least would embarrass him by placing him 
in the spotlight 
if we took every bill up on the premise that the president 
wouldnt veto it there would be few bills that wed take to the 
house floor oberstar said wednesday 
the administration has said it might submit legislation that 
would ban secondary boycotts against other airlines and railroad 
systems as are allowed under current law the democraticcontrolled 
congress would be expected to reject such a proposal

eastern airlines filed for protection from creditors in 
bankruptcy court today the sixth day of a bitter strike by 
machinists that virtually shut down the nations seventhlargest 
carrier and cost it up to 7 million a day 
the filing under chapter 11 in us bankruptcy court in new york 
is designed to give tottering eastern a reprieve from bills and 
debts while it tries to restructure and extricate itself from the 
worst crisis in the history of the 60yearold airline 
at a news conference today eastern boss frank lorenzo said the 
animosity many union leaders have expressed toward him have hurt 
my family and me 
but i suggest that the intensive focus on a single person does 
a real gross injustice to the real issues that are at stake in 
airline deregulation and indeed in our business climate today 
he said 
the issue is fundamentally whether a troubled and sick business 
in a competitive marketplace should be allowed which 
expired in june there was no immediate word what effect the court 
filing would have on talks 
also today the us house public works committee was expected to 
approve a measure that would force a reluctant president bush to 
temporarily halt the strike the bill has gloomy prospects in the 
senate and at the white house and the committees meeting was 
postponed at least until afternoon after the court filing 
in a desperate effort to help stem its losses eastern reduced 
oneway fares on its northeast shuttle to 12 on weekends from 
6999 and to 49 on weekdays down from 99 
george brennan marketing vice president denied the slashed 
fares were a move to protect the pending 365 million sale of the 
shuttle to developer donald trump 
we are confident the sale will go through despite the 
bankruptcy filing bakes said today 
pan am corp a competitor said it would not match the fares 
usair meanwhile announced that months of talks had produced a 
70 million deal with eastern to acquire the airlines eight gates 
at philadelphia international airport thirdlargest of miamibased 
easterns four hubs 
eastern stood to gain 15 million more in a separate deal 
selling usair its philadelphiatoronto and philadelphiamontreal 
routes for 15 million 
both deals would require government approval that could take 
months 
easterns sister airline houstonbased continental announced it 
was assuming easterns lucrative new yorkmiami route beginning 
today with four daily daily roundtrip flights 
among other developments 
pilots at other airlines continued strictly adhering to safety 
rules but for a second day there was little evidence of flight 
delays 
in new york a us district judge scheduled a hearing today on 
whether to extend a ban against commuter rail sympathy strikes on 
wednesday a federal appeals court refused to lift the judges order 
preventing the eastern strike from paralyzing new yorks commuter 
rail lines 
eastern lawyers have filed notice with a federal appeals court 
in atlanta on plans to continue efforts to force nonstriking pilots 
to cross picket lines bakes said the appeal would not be filed 
today 
in philadelphia a federal judge issued a preliminary 
injunction extending a temporary restraining order that prohibited 
local rail unions from honoring pickets set up by machinists

cable news network founder ted turner said thursday 
cnns coverage beamed worldwide is usoriented because its 
profits come from the united states but added that televisions 
globalization has been a positive force 
turner said his usbased network plans to begin hiring local 
nationals as reporters in overseas bureaus but it would take time 
because the vast bulk of our audience and profits come from the 
united states and were convinced that americans are used to seeing 
americans report the news 
cnn the worlds only 24hour television news network was 
founded in 1980 and claims 150 million viewers in more than 75 
countries 
turner said cnn has almost completed negotiations for the leasing 
of satellite transponders that would make it the first television 
network available to every country in the world 24 hours a day 
actual local broadcasting would depend on contracts with local 
television stations or cable systems 
responding to questions from journalists in tokyo beijing hong 
kong and jakarta during a satellitetransmitted worldnet dialogue 
sponsored by the us information agency turner acknowledged that 
cnn was usoriented in its news coverage but said that cant be 
helped 
even though we may be very usbiased when there is a major 
story anywhere we do usually carry it he said 
a larger market in europe allows cnn to tailor its programming 
for the european audience but for economic reasons it must supply 
its regular domestic us programming to asia turner said 
asian viewers have complained about too many usoriented 
features on the network such as local us weather reports 
in japan where cnn is broadcast late at night by tv asahi local 
newscasters spend time after most reports which are translated into 
japanese commenting on the contents and explaining the differences 
between us and japanese perspectives on the news 
kenji koyama codirector of cnn programs for tv asahi said the 
japanese station uses cnn to provide an alternative perspective on 
world developments as well as for coverage of us news 
turner said fears of a rapid globalization of television 
broadcasting controlled by privately owned media based in a few 
dominant nations were exaggerated 
it will take a long time he said very few companies are 
interested in advertising all around the world satellites and 
satellite television have brought the world closer together i think 
its a positive force on balance

a house panel today approved legislation to 
gradually add 130 an hour to the 335 minimum wage and democratic 
leaders said they are willing to compromise with the bush 
administration over a reduced training wage for some workers 
the measure approved by the labor standards subcommittee was 
virtually identical to legislation the senate labor and human 
resources passed wednesday and advanced democratic plans to take the 
first hike in the minimum since 1981 to the floors of both houses 
within two weeks 
both bills would raise the minimum in increments over three 
years to 465 an hour by 1991 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the full house 
education and labor committee scheduled a vote on the subcommittee 
legislation for next tuesday 
subcommittee chairman austin murphy dpa said democrats are 
drafting their own version of a training wage and specific 
requirements for education and be limited in duration 
president bush favors a more modest increase in the minimum wage 
and wants to leave the minimum at 335 an hour for the first six 
months employment for all newly hired workers 
the democratic version of the training wage will be more 
restrictive than the proposals we have heard from the president 
murphy said however our effort will show we are sincere and 
prepared to address the components of this issue 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
committee said wednesday that the bill is also on the fast 
track in that chamber and there may be floor vote there next week 
hawkins backs raising the minimum to 465 by 1991 and last week 
called the administrations more modest raise totally 
unacceptable 
the minimum wage has stood at 335 an hour since 1981 
the plan the senate committee passed wednesday would raise it 50 
cents an hour when enacted and 40 cents an hour in each of the next 
two years 
president bush said last week he wanted the minimum wage raised 
to 425 by 1991 if a lower floor is established for the first six 
months employment at any job for workers covered by the minimum 
senate democrats after softening their opposition to a second 
pay tier for new workers called on bush to compromise in the effort 
to raise the minimum for the first time in eight years 
i am hopeful that we can reach a compromise that is fairer to 
the working poor and that president bush will sign kennedy said 
later adding my own hope is that the administration may still be 
brought on board but if its the judgment that bush will veto it 
well override it 
bush has said he would veto legislation raising the minimum above 
425 an hour and told gop leaders wednesday that as spokesman 
marlin fitzwater put it his proposal is fair and firm and his 
last offer 
kennedy predicted a full senate vote on his bill next week and 
said congress may send an increase to bush by the end of the month 
one way or another im convinced this is on a fast track 
now he said 
the training wage long opposed by democrats and organized labor 
remains a key dispute 
the administration would allow a 335anhour wage for all newly 
hired workers for the first six months of their employment saying 
the lower minimum would leave employers an incentive to hire younger 
and unskilled workers 
kennedy said wednesday he is glad to listen to calls for a 
reduced minimum for some workers but said it would have to be 
coupled with specific requirements for training and education 
im open to listening to having the educational components 
outlined he said there was nothing in the administration 
proposal that had an educational component 
he added that such a plan would also have to be limited to 
firsttime workers and be for a shorter duration than six months

the securities and exchange commission will vote 
next week on a proposed settlement of civil fraud charges against 
drexel burnham lambert inc the wall street journal reported 
thursday 
the civil settlement is a crucial condition for finalizing a much 
broader settlement of criminal charges against the investment 
banking firm stemming largely from its past relationship with 
nowimprisoned former financier ivan f boesky 
quoting sources it didnt identify the journal said sec 
commissioners are expected to vote next monday on the civil 
settlement package under negotiation for more than two months 
the report quoted the sources as saying the package if approved 
would allow drexel to retain its highyield highrisk junk bond 
operation in beverly hills calif 
previously the sec had proposed in settlement negotiations that 
drexel relocate the junk bond division to its new york headquarters 
in order to more strictly supervise trading operations drexel had 
contended such a move would destroy its lucrative business in the 
highyield securities 
other elements of the civil settlement will force drexel to make 
dozens of changes in management structure and proedures to enforce 
compliance with federal and state securities laws the journal 
report said 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to comment on the report 
or speculate on when a settlement would be announced sec officials 
in washington also declined to comment in accordance with the 
agencys policy concerning pending cases 
the investment firm has been under investigation since late 1986 
when boesky implicated drexel senior junk bond financier michael 
milken and others in what federal officials have called wideranging 
abuse of securities laws 
the sec formally accused drexel and milken in september of 
engaging in a litany of fraud violations that ranged from insider 
trading to stock manipulation to client cheating 
the civil charges were overshadowed in december when the 
manhattan us attorneys office which had been conducting its own 
probe of drexel announced a criminal plea bargain agreement under 
which the firm would plead guilty to six felonies and pay a 650 
million fine federal prosecutors said that agreement could not be 
finalized until drexel settled the sec litigation 
milken has continued to assert innocence of any wrongdoing and is 
expected to be indicted soon on federal fraud and racketeering 
charges 
he also is challenging a provision of the criminal settlement 
that would force drexel to terminate his employment and deny his 
1988 compensation estimated at more than 100 million

the mexican government has decided to sell its 
controlling interest in the nations problemridden telephone 
company despite strong union opposition government and union 
sources said thursday 
such a sale would be the most dramatic example to date of 
president carlos salinas de gortaris efforts to privatize 
governmentowned companies and modernize the mexican economy 
the problem is to do it without making it sound like another 
confrontation with a labor union a government source told the 
associated press the timing of an announcement is uncertain 
the government specifically salinas has told us there is no 
alternative said a telephone workers union official the union 
strongly opposes the move he said 
both officials said they could not allow their names to be used 
because the two sides are now engaged in talks 
there is a campaign against the union against corruption 
against the union members the end of this campaign is the 
privatization of the company the union official said he said 
government proposals would require changes in 51 union contracts 
one for each department of the company 
salinas who jailed corrupt leaders of the oil workers union in 
january does not want to get an image as a union buster the 
government source said 
but if we are going to modernize the phone company we need new 
technology and more investments and some changes in unionmanagement 
relations the source added 
telefonos de mexico as the company is called has nearly 50000 
employees although the union is controlled by the ruling 
institutional revolutionary party the government has had to 
intervene at least twice in recent years to prevent strikes 
the government owns 51 percent of the company and another 10 
percent is held in the socalled mexico fund which is traded on the 
new york stock exchange stockbroker guillermina ortiz said the 
stock is fluctuating on the mexico exchange because of sale rumors 
but that it would definitely go much higher if the company is sold 
it closed at 31 cents a share on wednesday 
union head francisco hernandez juarez has accused the government 
of trying to sell out the telephone company and fears privatization 
would lead to a reduction in union membership because of dismissals 
this week hernandez complained that telephone company proposals 
were evidence of evil intentions toward the union 
government officials admit the company has a bad image that 
reflects on the government 
it is known for poor service and high rates and even before 
salinas was elected stories circulated of his disgust with the 
systems inefficiencies and his admiration for the way chile 
improved its system privatization 
in a governmentsponsored 1987 poll 13 percent of respondents 
said telmex was the worstadministered company in the public sector 
56 percent said they had found mysterious longdistance calls on 
their bills without explanation 
getting a line repaired can take months although one shortcut is 
to locate and independently hire a telephone company crew that might 
happen to be in the neighborhood employees often complain of low 
salaries they earn an average of about 14 a day in spite of the 
high rates charged by the company 
installing a telephone on unwired premises costs nearly 800 in 
mexico city as against an average of 120 in new york a heavily 
taxed threeminute phone call to new york costs 750 while the 
return phone call would cost 510 
the union started when more people were needed than are needed 
now the government source said the government says the company 
is overstaffed and accuses the union of sabotage when it doesnt get 
what it wants but the union official denied that 
the problem is outdated equipment and lack of financing 
telefonos needs 14 billion to modernize and become competitive we 
think the government should get the money the official said 
the government source said salinas hopes to turn the telephone 
company around the way it did the staterun and moneylosing airline 
aeromexico when the union went on strike last year the airline was 
declared bankrupt and was eventually sold with employee unions 
buying a minority share

with wholesale home heating oil losing about a penny a gallon in 
volatile trading 
crude oil and gasoline contracts posted more moderate declines

prices of other petroleum products he said

competitors of paralyzed eastern airlines could 
easily absorb the surplus passenger traffic that would be created if 
the carrier disappeared permanently from the nations skies 
analysts believe 
this is an industry that tends to be plagued by overcapacity 
said edward starkman an airline analyst at painewebber inc 
eastern on thursday filed for protection from creditors in 
bankruptcy court seeking a reprieve from bills and debts while it 
tries to restructure and extricate itself from the worst crisis in 
its 60year history the chapter 11 filing would not necessarily 
mean eastern would stop flying 
easterns rivals most notably delta air lines pan am united 
airlines american airlines and usair have been operating with 62 
percent to 63 percent of their seats full analysts estimate 
that means that except for peak holiday travel times such as 
easter weekend the other carriers should have plenty of room for 
passengers who would have taken flights on miamibased eastern 
archrival delta the nations thirdlargest airline is widely 
considered the hottest contender for the eastern spoils like 
eastern delta has a major hub at atlanta its headquarters city 
in the past five years rivals have added about 1600 new 
competitive flights a day in easterns market area east of the 
mississippi river eastern president phil bakes told a news 
conference thursday announcing the bankruptcy filing 
eastern carried about 100000 passengers a day on 1040 flights 
before it was hit saturday by a bruising machinists union strike 
that was supported by pilots and flight attendants leading to a 
virtual shutdown late monday eastern the seventhlargest airline 
had 7 percent to 8 percent of the national market before the walkout 
on wednesday usair announced it had reached an agreement with 
eastern to buy all eight of the crippled carriers airport gates at 
philadelphia as well as the two routes from philadelphia to toronto 
and montreal 
the agreements which will cost usair about 85 million have 
been discussed for months as a way for eastern to scrape up vitally 
needed cash 
more eastern gates routes and possibly planes could be sold in 
coming months 
airlines should be able to handle most of the eastern spillover 
with their current schedules and by adding a few flights said 
robert joedicke who follows the industry for shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
thats why the eastern situation is not in most peoples 
eyes a national emergency he said 
continental airlines which like eastern is owned by texas air 
corp announced wednesday it will begin operating daily nonstop 
flights from new yorks laguardia airport to miami continental will 
fly four daily round trips on the coveted route easterns main 
artery 
if eastern disappeared competitors air fares wouldnt 
necessarily go up analysts believe 
eastern a dominant force in the lucrative florida market was 
operating on some of the most competitive routes in the nation 
theyre still very competitive markets starkman said 
suggesting that an eastern collapse could even spark some battles to 
fill the void which could mean lower fares in those areas 
in another competitive and profitable market the northeast 
shuttle service pan am quickly jumped into the eastern breach 
monday by doubling its hourly shuttle flights to every halfhour at 
peak times 
eastern continued to run its rival bostonnew yorkwashington 
shuttle flights even after it shut down nearly all of its operations 
late monday but easterns flights have been running with few 
passengers and the air line on wednesday was forced to slash its 
oneway fares to 12 on weekends and 49 on weekdays to attract 
business 
shuttle fares for eastern and pan am which didnt match the 
eastern price cuts normally are 69 to 99 on weekends depending on 
the time of day and 99 on weekdays

emhart corps board of directors rejected 
an investment groups unsolicited 24 billion takeover offer 
thursday and the company said it had received rival buyout bids from 
other parties 
peter l scott emharts chairman and chief executive officer 
recommended shareholders not tender any of their stock to topper 
acquisition corp and raised questions about unusual movements in 
emharts stock price before the groups bid 
this trading raises disquieting questions as to whether the 
governments actions aimed at curbing insider trading on nonpublic 
information have been effective scott said in a letter to 
shareholders 
topper whose investors include oil heir gordon p getty and new 
york developers lawrence and zachary fisher offered 35 a share for 
emhart on feb 24 
a spokesman for topper who asked that his name not be used said 
the investment group would have no immediate comment on emharts 
action or the allegations of insider trading 
emhart stock rose 37 cents to 4237 a share thursday in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
the shares traded at 3275 a share when topper tendered its 
offer the stock had risen almost 10 a share in the month prior to 
the offer amid takeover rumors 
it was not known whether the federal government was looking into 
the movement in emharts shares chiles larson a securities and 
exchange commission spokesman said it was the agencys policy not 
to comment on possible investigations 
meanwhile emhart a farmingtonbased manufacturer of a variety 
of consumer and industrial products said it had discussed with a 
limited number of third parties a possible buyout of the firm the 
company did not identify the other parties 
spokesman michael claes said the board gave preliminary 
consideration to the offers at meetings on feb 28 and wednesday 
emhart said it was also exploring other alternatives to the 
topper bid including a financial restructuring or recapitalization 
in his letter to shareholders scott said emharts financial 
advisers wasserstein perella amp co and shearson lehman hutton 
inc advised the companys board the topper bid was inadequate 
from a financial point of view 
scott said the board also took into consideration the companys 
restructuring effort which began in 1986 and four recent 
acquisitions 
the board believes that the full benefits of the companys 
strategies have yet to be realized and that emhart is in a position 
to continue to build on the favorable results achieved over the past 
two years scott said 
accordingly the board does not believe that now is an 
opportune time to sell the company he said 
emharts products include lawn and garden equipment hardware and 
materials used to make footwear 
topper has filed a lawsuit in us district court in richmond 
va to block the use of emharts poison pill antitakeover 
defense emhart has countersued and scott said the company would 
amend the plan to eliminate a provision challenged by topper

transportation secretary samuel skinner 
eclipsed labor secretary elizabeth dole as the bush administrations 
lead spokesman in the eastern airlines strike because of tradition 
and his prior experience in the industry government officials say 
skinner was chosen for the role during a meeting that he and mrs 
dole had with president bush in the oval office last friday 
according to administration officials 
these officials discussing a somewhat sensitive issue on grounds 
they not be identified publicly said bush wanted skinner to take 
the lead in defending administration policy to lawmakers on capitol 
hill and in numerous interviews and news conferences 
national strikes can present presidents with public relations 
problems for their decisions seldom are likely to please both labor 
and business and the general public often has strong views as well 
especially when inconvenienced as in the current strike that all but 
shut down eastern 
the airline filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcy 
court on thursday 
in the strike by easterns machinists union bush selected as his 
chief spokesman a man who had built a reputation for dealing with 
tough labormanagement problems during his time as chairman of the 
regional transportation authority in northeastern illinois the 
nations second largest transit authority 
but skinner is a washington newcomer notwithstanding his brash 
statement on arrival here that im not going to take a back seat 
mrs dole in contrast formerly was secretary of transportation 
during the reagan administration and as head of the labor 
department now she would have seemed to have been in a unique 
position to be the outfront cabinet member in dealing with the 
eastern strike 
hes been in the lead but shes been along every step of the 
way said one administration official he said that skinner was a 
natural choice for the frontline role because the strike involves 
the airline industry which is regulated in part by the federal 
aviation administration which is a part of the transportation 
department 
it was a conscious decision that mrs dole take a secondary 
role said her spokeswoman dale tate it was an issue that was 
viewed much more as a transportation issue than a labor issue as a 
former secretary of transportation mrs dole understood that 
said skinner spokesman bob marks the major concern was air 
safety and the economic impact of the potential secondary boycotts 
by the unions an area that the department of transportation has 
responsibility for 
another theory is that mrs dole was kept in the background to 
insulate her from direct confrontation with the leaders of organized 
labor people with whom she has pledged to seek harmonious 
relations 
however an aflcio official declining to be identified 
publicly dismissed any notion that the bush administration has been 
trying very hard to protect mrs doles credibility with organized 
labor 
he said that while she had promised to seek improved relations 
with unions top labor leaders were not consulted before the 
administrations decision to seek to raise the minimum wage from 
335 to 425 an hour and retain a 335anhour wage rate for 
inexperienced youths 
the choice of skinner as the chief administration spokesman on 
the eastern strike is in keeping with the pattern that was set 
during the strike by the professional air traffic controllers 
organization against the faa in 1981 
but the two situations are not entirely alike in the former 
case the government itself was being struck and thenpresident 
reagan the controllers ultimate boss fired all of them at the 
same time he put transportation secretary drew lewis out front as 
his main spokesman thenlabor secretary ray donovan was nearly 
invisible 
on capitol hill rep norman mineta dcalif a senior member of 
the house public works committee said he found it very very 
surprising that mrs dole had not entered the eastern dispute 
its surprising that given this is the first major labor issue 
to come before the new administration and her former involvement as 
secretary of transportation she hasnt been visible in any way 
he said in an interview 
but mineta also said he believed it was typical of her actions as 
transportation secretary which he described as pretty much a 
noninvolvement process for her

securities analysts expected minorco sa to sweeten 
its hostile 55 billion bid for consolidated gold fields plc 
thursday after gold fields sent shareholders a document detailing 
the companys strengths and future plans 
however the analysts saw little in the document which contained 
numerous valuations and forecasts for gold fields various 
businesses that would cause them to change their own estimates of 
what the british mining company was worth 
south africancontrolled minorco which already owns 296 percent 
of gold fields shares has offered 2050 pounds or 3526 in cash 
and one new minorco share for every two gold fields shares 
minorco shares traded thursday afternoon at 804 pench each down 
9 pence on the day meaning the offer values each gold fields share 
at 1427 pounds however gold fields stock closed above that level 
rising 7 pence to 1430 pounds 
the deal is worth a total of 32 billion pounds or 55 billion 
analysts in london said minorco a luxembourgbased company 
would have to sweeten its offer to between 15 pounds and 16 pounds a 
share 
the real story today is that this document from gold fields 
will force minorco to come back with a higher offer price said 
huw williams a mining analyst at kleinwort grieveson securities 
in the document sent to shareholders gold fields assigned a 
value of between 844 pounds and 1039 pounds per gold fields share 
to its us gold interests these include full ownership of gold 
fields mining corp and 49 percent of newmont mining corp 
at a later press conference the company said its other mineral 
investments worldwide are worth 523 pounds per gold fields share 
gold fields owns 48 percent of renison goldfields consolidated ltd 
of australia 38 percent of gold fields of south africa ltd and 
other assets 
the gold fields document also detailed the results of its past 
mineral exploration and predicted considerable value will be 
added in the future if recent successes are repeated 
the document also questioned the management ability of minorco 
executives and the value of the companys stock gold fields also 
noted that if it were owned by the south african company it might 
lose business in the united states because of american opposition to 
south africas policy of apartheid 
it was not known what further steps gold fields planned to take 
to counter the minorco bid 
joseph perella chairman of wasserstein perella amp co inc and a 
gold fields adviser said in new york that at this point the 
company had little to do besides point out the discrepancies between 
the value of the minorco bid and the underlying value of its own 
assets 
following the release of gold fields figures london analysts 
said they saw little reason to alter significantly their earlier 
estimates that valued the companys total assets at somewhere 
between 15 pounds and just over 20 pounds a share

william clay ford said thursday he was retiring as 
a vice chairman of ford motor co paving the way for a fourth 
generation of family leadership of the automaker founded by his 
grandfather henry ford 
the retirement of ford who will be 64 tuesday is effective at 
the end of march and has been anticipated for months he will remain 
on the board of directors and as chairman of the boards finance and 
executive committees 
fords son william clay ford jr 31 and nephew edsel b ford 
ii 40 represent the fourth generation of the founding family both 
are on the companys 21member board of directors and the elder ford 
said in an afternoon news conference that he expects both to receive 
key board assignments within a year 
ford said there always should be a member of the family on the 
board and in leadership but added the next generation should not be 
rushed into such positions 
nature has got to take its course he said 
fords retirement came 40 years after he joined the company upon 
graduating from yale he was elected to the companys board the year 
before and worked on fords sales and advertising and industrial 
relations staffs 
in 1951 he became quality control manager for the 
lincolnmercury divisions jet engine defense project through the 
decade he stayed in the lincolnmercury division in a variety of 
projects 
ford in 1957 was named chairman of the companys new design 
committee of the policy and planning committee and still holds the 
post 
ford was elected chairman of the boards executive committee and 
became a member of the office of the chief executive in 1978 on 
april 10 1980 he was elected a vice chairman of the board he 
became chairman of its finance committee on nov 12 1987 
during the late 1970s and early 1980s ford took part in key 
decisions that pulled the company from financial hard times to its 
present profitability as design chairman ford had a integral part 
in developing such aerodynamic cars as the ford taurus that helped 
turn around the companys balance sheet in the mid1980s 
ford also is sole owner and president of the detroit lions 
professional football team 
he was the youngest of four children of edsel b ford who was 
president of the automobile company from 1919 until his death in 
1943 
fords oldest brother henry ford ii was the companys 
president chairman and chief executive officer before his death in 
september 1987 his other brother benson ford was vice president 
and chairman of the dealer policy board when he died in 1978 
the roles of william jr and edsel have been at the center of 
speculation since fortune magazine published a story about the 
family in december 
according to the magazine william jr and edsel have been 
pushing for more power in the operations of the nations 
mostprofitable automaker but fortune said ford chairman donald 
petersen turned aside notions that they belonged in top management 
positions simply because they were fords 
early this year petersen said the cousins were now coming of 
age 
fords other vice chairman harold poling also is chief 
operating officer

silver futures prices surged in the final minutes of trading 
thursday on new yorks commodity exchange and settled with the 
spotdelivery price above 6 a troy ounce for the first time in 
nearly six weeks 
on other markets gold futures also advanced grains and soybeans 
rebounded sharply livestock and meat futures were lower and energy 
futures retreated 
silver settled 141 cents to 153 cents higher with the most 
actively traded contract for delivery in may at 609 an ounce 
the spot contract for march delivery settled at the days high of 
6008 a troy ounce 
gold settled 140 to 190 higher with april at 39730 a troy 
ounce 
analysts said the rally was technically inspired meaning the 
buying was based on bullish interpretations of chart patterns rather 
than on any change in market fundamentals 
but the strength of silver relative to gold also suggests 
speculators and investors are embracing silver and turning away from 
gold the traditional leader of the precious metals group 
the white knight is finally performing said peter cardillo 
commodity trading adviser with josephthal amp co a new york futures 
brokerage firm i think were going to see silver emerge as the 
leader in the next major rally 
gold is often perceived as a safe haven for investment dollars in 
inflationary times but it has responded poorly to recent government 
reports of sharp rises in wholesale and consumer prices 
golds sluggish reaction to the inflation signals suggests to 
some traders that silver may outperform gold said analyst bette 
raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
she said the rally also reflected positioning by traders before 
fridays national unemployment report a decline in the jobless rate 
of more than 01 percentage point would be considered inflationary 
as would an increase in nonfarm employment of 300000 or more 
grain and soybean futures advanced strongly on the chicago board 
of trade erasing most of the previous sessions losses amid a 
variety of bullish factors 
forecasts for continued dryness in prime winterwheat areas 
supported the wheat market as did talk that the soviet union was 
seeking to buy more us wheat at subsidized prices 
soybean futures which had fallen steeply wednesday on jitters 
linked to the impending brazilian soybean harvest surged back 
thursday on rumors that brazilian dockworkers were planning to 
strike next wednesday halting exports of newly harvested soybeans 
corn futures were boosted by higher cash prices and by concerns 
about a lack of adequate soil moisture in the midwest 
wheat settled 2 cents to 5 cents higher with march at 435 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with march at 277 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with march at 207 a 
bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 12 cents higher with march at 
763 a bushel 
sluggish cash markets pressured livestock and meat futures on the 
chicago mercantile exchange heavy marketings of hogs also weighed 
on the pork complex 
live cattle settled 05 cent to 10 cent lower with april at 
7707 cents a pound feeder cattle were 40 cent to 78 cent lower 
with march at 8087 cents a pound live hogs were 05 cent to 40 
cent lower with april at 4372 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 65 cent lower to 12 cent higher with march at 3820 cents a 
pound 
energy futures retreated in technically motivated trading on the 
new york mercantile exchange reversing the previous sessions sharp 
gains in heating oil 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 4 cents 
lower with april at 1852 a barrel heating oil was 60 cent to 99 
cent lower with april at 5038 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was

pratt amp whitney customers once had 
about as much chance of communicating with management as they had of 
hearing a whisper over the roar of its jet engines 
not anymore the company says 
the result is that already this year pratt amp whitney has 
received 32 billion in commercial jet engine orders compared with 
5 billion for all of last year when the company nearly tripled its 
orders vs the year before 
we got our act together but were not satisfied said selwyn 
d berson head of the commercial division at pratt amp whitney a 
subsidiary of united technologies corp 
were going to be the best thats our goal berson said 
during an interview at his office in the companys sprawling east 
hartford headquarters 
sweetened customer relations is part of a general improvement at 
pratt amp whitneys commercial division historically one of the 
pioneers in aircraft engine manufacturing and the biggest in the 
business through the 1960s 
pratt amp whitney also has started a quality improvement drive put 
new manufacturing technology in place and cut expenses by 
eliminating 2000 jobs 
just as important these changes coincide with a broad move by 
airlines worldwide to replace aging jets and expand their fleets for 
a growing number of passengers said mark bobbi an analyst at 
forecast international a consulting firm in newtown conn 
international air traffic has been increasing about 8 percent a 
year while traffic on north american routes has been increasing 
about 4 percent a year bobbi said 
in cumulative book orders pratt amp whitney is behind general 
electric but theyre closing the gap bobbi said 
besides general electric co pratt amp whitneys chief competitors 
for commercial engine sales are rollsroyce ltd and cfm a joint 
venture of ge and snecma of france 
ges commercial engine orders totaled about 23 billion last 
year while cfms orders totaled 5 billion this year ge 
rollsroyce and cfm have combined sales of about 23 billion but 
rollsroyce accounts for only about 500 million of that total 
on the military side pratt amp whitney has bested ge in air force 
engine competition pratt amp whitneys latest victory was winning 60 
percent of a contract announced in february an order worth an 
estimated 350 million 
orders arent counted as sales until the engines are delivered a 
time lag that ranges from two to three years 
the numbers for this year and 1988 markedly differ from 1987 
when pratt amp whitneys shrinking sales were widely publicized the 
low point of that year came when japan airlines announced it was 
dropping pratt amp whitney in favor of ge the airlines decision 
stemmed partly from what it called pratt amp whitneys failure to 
adequately back up sales with service 
the criticism stung company officials who began a 2 million 
twoyear advertising campaign in 1988 aimed at publicizing 
improvement efforts and promising higher responsiveness to customers 
we always believed we were doing a great job out there but 
perception is what counts there was a perception out there that we 
werent really providing the best customer service berson said 
the effort has changed pratt amp whitneys corporate culture 
shifting away from the strictly technical side of building jet 
engines he said 
for example berson said the company now has more than 200 field 
representatives who work daily with airline maintenance crews and 
are empowered to make quick decisions without consulting with 
headquarters first 
the company also established 40 computer centers to give the 
field representatives direct access to corporate headquarters in 
east hartford 
in related step pratt amp whitney has set out to improve its 
record for delivering spare parts which can take up to two years to 
manufacture customers had criticized parts delivery even though 
pratt amp whitney led the industry by delivering parts on schedule 93 
percent of the time berson said 
it didnt matter that it was 93 percent or 94 percent what 
mattered was were we causing the customer some grief work stoppage 
thats a grief if a guy has to stop working on an engine while hes 
waiting for a part that were late on then were causing him 
grief berson said 
bobbi said another key to pratt amp whitneys success is a 
reduction of costs in building engines 
two years ago ges pretax profit margin on aircraft engine sales 
totaled about 16 percent double pratt amp whitneys bobbi said pratt 
amp whitney has just about closed that gap partly because of 
costcutting 
company officials hope the changes will enable pratt amp whitney to 
increase sales the company had been the largest jet engine company 
and had 100 percent of the market until 1970 ge is now regarded as 
the biggest jet engine maker 
berson estimates theres a worldwide market of about 100 billion 
for commercial jet engines and spare parts between now and the year 
2000 with 60 percent of that market composed of widebody airline 
sales 
up to 700 new airliners will be ordered this year and possibly 
the same number next year bobbi said after that anywhere between 
500 to 600 will be ordered annually until 1995 bobbi said 
since many will be widebody jets the future looks good for 
pratt amp whitney widebody engine orders have been a growing segment 
of pratt amp whitney business since the early 1980s the company 
captured about 50 percent of the widebody jet engine orders in 
1988 just ahead of ge industry figures indicate but for pratt amp 
whitney thats no reason to gloat 
by my own measure i think were about even up berson said 
number one they are formidable i never underestimate them i 
never think theyre down and out or anything like that even if i 
have a good day tomorrow they could come right back and rap me in 
the nose

a new york businessman whose testimony is 
considered key to unraveling the pentagon purchasing scandal pleaded 
guilty thursday to bribing a highranking navy official and 
channeling illegal contributions to congressional campaigns 
charles f gardner was joined in us district court by two 
private consultants james g neal and kenneth f brooke who 
pleaded guilty to other charges 
us attorney henry hudson told reporters outside the federal 
courthouse the pleas were a significant development in the 
2yearold investigation into fraud in the defense departments 
150billionayear procurement system 
the cooperation we will receive from these three individuals 
will move this investigation forward at a tremendous pace hudson 
said 
gardner the former general manager of unisys corps 
surveillance and fire control systems division in great neck ny 
pleaded guilty to charges of bribery conspiracy to file false 
statements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false tax 
return he faces a maximum possible sentence of 23 years in prison 
and fines of up to 750000 
guilty guilty guilty gardner said in a strong 
voice in response to judge claude a hyltons questions on three 
counts 
prosecutors said gardner bribed melvyn r paisley a former 
assistant secretary of the navy and the highestranking official 
publicly identified in the case so far 
gardner arranged to buy paisleys condominium at the sun valley 
idaho ski resort in august 1986 for an inflated price the 
government said in court documents 
gardner instructed james g neal that the condominium was to be 
purchased for 149000 and that no negotiation or attempts to lower 
the price were to be undertaken even though the unit was 
overpriced hudson said in a statement the condominium was 
subsequently sold for 100000 
the suggestion that gardner buy paisleys condominium came from 
william galvin another private consultant who is brookes 
stepfather the government said 
us attorney hudson said the condominium purchase was designed 
to influence paisleys actions on two pentagon contracts sought by 
unisys one on the aegis automated radar firing system and the other 
on the marine air traffic and landing system unisys eventually 
received a portion of the 9 billion aegis contract 
paisley now a private consultant has not been charged with any 
crime but prosecutors said that between may 1986 and november 1986 
paisley performed certain official acts to benefit unisys with 
regard to the two contracts 
another charge against gardner stems from 1000 corporate 
contributions made in 1986 and 1987 to the campaigns of rep roy 
dyson dmd and former rep bill chappell dfla both members of 
a house committee that handled defense issues dyson and chappell 
have denied knowing that illegal contributions were funneled to 
their campaigns 
in january robert d barrett a former unisys executive pleaded 
guilty to charges stemming from the complicated scheme to make 
illegal campaign contributions 
prosecutors said gardner amassed a slush fund by hiring 
consultants to unisys with the understanding that some of the 
money would be placed in bank accounts both domestic and foreign 
for purposes of bribery illegal campaign contributions and in part 
for gardners personal use 
hudsons investigation has been looking into the question of 
whether defense companies hired private consultants who in turn 
paid bribes to public officials to obtain inside information 
valuable for obtaining pentagon contracts 
unisys welcomed gardners plea the company said in a statement 
released from its headquarters in blue bell pa the unisys 
corps board management and employees have been outraged by mr 
gardners illegal activities and the negative reflection cast on the 
image of our new company the statement said 
as part of gardners arrangement with neal the private 
consultant set up a web of seven companies in order to receive money 
from unisys and its predecessor sperry corp the government said 
unisys is a giant computer corporation 
most of the companies were located in northern virginia but one 
was in the united kingdom and another in the cayman islands 
the government also said gardner caused unisys to make and 
present to the departments of the navy and air force false 
fictitious and fraudulent claims upon and against the united 
states 
neal 63 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bribe garland tomlin 
jr who was a navy engineer with the naval electronics systems 
command until his retirement in october 1985 
on instructions from gardner neal transferred in 1983 and 1984 a 
total of 400000 to longwood international a company owned by 
tomlin in order to influence tomlins official decisions 
prosecutors said tomlin has not been charged with any crime 
neal pleaded guilty to making false claims to the government and 
conspiring to defraud the government by concealing his true taxable 
income he faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of 750000 
brooke 40 pleaded guilty to evading about 66000 in taxes in 
1985 prosecutors said he faces a possible sentence of five years 
in prison and a fine of up to 250000 
the judge set sentencing for july 14

eastern airlines boss frank lorenzo singled out 
by strikers as viciously antiunion said thursday he is the wrong 
target and the real issue in the emotioncharged walkout is the 
impact of deregulation 
lorenzo also rejected criticism about his silence since the 
strike began saying he was too busy 
we do have limited amounts of time lorenzo said in a 
telephone interview following his announcement that striketorn 
eastern had filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcy court 
im not the type that travels from talk show to talk show 
there has been criticism in recent days of lorenzo for not making 
a public appearance since the start of the machinists union strike 
last saturday pilots and flight attendants have joined the strikers 
in sympathy 
lorenzo who controls miamibased eastern through his texas air 
corp holding company earlier had told a news conference that the 
animosity union leaders have expressed toward him had hurt my 
family and me 
but i suggest that the intensive focus on a single person does 
a real gross injustice to the real issues that are at stake in 
airline deregulation and indeed in our business climate today 
he said 
for labor leaders lorenzo symbolizes unionbusting and 
antagonistic management he is vilified by some as an archenemy of 
working america 
union leaders lashed out at him thursday as a robber baron 
the personalization of this has hurt me has hurt my family a 
lot lorenzo said in the interview he added that its difficult 
when his four children aged five to 15 ask him dad whats 
going on 
but lorenzo said he is far more troubled by the thousands of 
employees whose lives have been very severely affected by the 
eastern strike 
eastern announced monday that it was shutting down virtually all 
its operations and laying off around 9500 nonunion employees the 
airline had 31200 employees before the strike 
i know the emotions i know how difficult it is for them to 
make individual decisions lorenzo said

delta air lines refused to say thursday if it was 
considering buying gates or other properties from strikebound 
eastern airlines but acknowledged an interest in any new 
opportunities 
there has been industry speculation that delta would be among 
those seeking to snap up easterns assets if the miamibased airline 
starts selling some or all of its property as part of its bankruptcy 
reorganization 
eastern virtually grounded since its machinists union went on 
strike saturday filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcy 
court on thursday 
among the companys assets are 48 domestic gates at hartsfield 
atlanta international airport where eastern has its largest hub 
archrival delta has 55 of the airports 132 domestic gates 
according to airport spokesman john braden 
delta spokeswoman jackie pate said company and federal regulatory 
policies prevented any comment on possible mergers acquisitions or 
major investments 
asked if the company generally would be interested in acquiring 
more gates at hartsfield atlanta international airport where delta 
is the dominant carrier ms pate said in the past we have 
expressed interest in acquiring new gates and would be interested in 
any new opportunities 
systemwide delta has 389 jets and handles 2265 flights a day 
ms pate said the company had earnings of 1851 million during its 
last quarter ended dec 31 
deltas major acquisition of recent years was its 860 million 
merger with western air lines in 1987 western 102 airplanes to the 
delta fleet and increased the number of cities served by delta to 
153 
braden said easterns lease on its hartsfield space runs through 
2010 
those gates are valuable braden said they have a 
proprietary interest in them 
last year braden said eastern paid a total of 23 million to 
hartsfield for gate rental landing fees security fees cargo space 
and other facilities 
delta and some of the smaller airlines operating at hartsfield 
have absorbed much of the traffic that eastern would be handling 
from atlanta but ms pate said delta flights are not full and 
passengers should have little trouble getting tickets 
we still have a lot of empty seats she said there are 
even still some discount seats available if the passengers are 
flexible about schedules 
delta spokesman neil monroe said the airline will be increasing 
its daily flights out of atlanta from 400 to 406 next week but he 
said that increase has been planned for several months

yugo america inc on thursday won an early 
victory in the companys effort to reorganize its finances as a 
bankruptcy judge barred a liquidator from selling 4800 automobiles 
below wholesale 
such a sale would erode consumer confidence in yugo and would 
destroy any effort by the company to emerge from chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection which it sought in papers filed jan 30 the 
judge and the company said 
us bankruptcy judge vincent j commisa told the liquidator 
norauto ltd of columbus ohio it could not sell the cars 
if the sales were allowed most dealers would lose money and 
never carry the yugo car again commisa said in his ruling it 
in effect could completely destroy all efforts of reorganization 
impex car corp the us agent for the cars yugoslav maker has 
battled for control of the cars 
norauto insists it bought the cars last fall and should be 
allowed to sell them at whatever price it wants 
but yugo of upper saddle river and impex of new york argued 
that the financial pact with norauto was meant only to pump some 
much needed cash into the financially ailing company 
jeremy golton an attorney for norauto declined comment on the 
judges decision but said an appeal is likely 
the 4800 autos in question are among 6000 sitting at us 
ports manufacturers hanover trust co has liens on the balance 
along with yugo parent company global motors inc and sister 
company proton america filed for bankruptcy protection they said 
more than 300 companies and individuals led by manufacturers 
hanover may hold claims against them 
yugo touted its boxy subcompact cars as the cheapest new auto in 
the united states when they went on sale in august 1985 at 3995 
sales topped 39100 in the first 10 months of 1987 but dropped 
to 26000 in the same period of 1988 according to figures released 
by the company

striking eastern workers initially stunned by 
thursdays announcement that the airline would seek bankruptcy 
protection quickly became angry and vowed to keep picketing and 
fighting robber baron frank lorenzo 
hang in there its not over local vice president frank 
ortis shouted to hundreds of eastern employees who gathered at a 
machinists union hall as news of the chapter 11 filing began 
circulating in the morning 
the machinists union called for a boycott of easterns sister 
airline continental and easterns unions said they would devise 
their own plan for reorganizing the airline 
chapter 11 means theres still a patient and its undergoing 
surgery and its coming back said john bavis head of the eastern 
pilots thats better than the continued slow dismantling of 
eastern under texas air 
workers at the union hall temporarily put aside worries about 
their futures including the immediate problem of trying to get 
paychecks due this week to await news of the company action at the 
hall across the street from corporate headquarters 
jammed around tv sets workers booed and shouted epithets at 
lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp and eastern 
president phil bakes as they told reporters about the bankruptcy 
filing in new york 
there were cheers for machinists district 100 president charles 
e bryans televised news conference at the nearby district 
headquarters 
it certainly is a sad day for eastern said bryan the 
combative union leader who leads 8500 mechanics baggage handlers 
and other ground workers who went on strike saturday after talks 
broke down in their 17month contract dispute the strike virtually 
shut down eastern when pilots and flight attendants refused to cross 
machinists picket lines 
the pilots union blamed by eastern management for forcing the 
bankruptcy reorganization planned a news conference later 
we will prevail said bryan his voice rising and his eyes 
flashing this is frank lorenzos conspiracy this is frank 
lorenzos strike 
bavis said management continued calling pilots at home in hopes 
some would return to work he said the effort would fail 
bryan said poor management not unions were to blame and he 
repeated charges he has made for three years that lorenzo intended 
from the start to try to break the unions and carve up eastern 
bryan said his union will fight lorenzo in bankruptcy court and 
in washington and will picket everything touched by texas air 
ranging from eastern to a fuel tanker in corpus christi texas to 
sister carrier continental where lorenzo had labor contracts 
abrogated during bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 the union is 
urging a nationwide boycott of continental which bryan says is 
lorenzos war machine to take advantage of easterns shutdown by 
expanding its lowcost services on eastern routes 
theres never been a more classic example of a robber baron 
bryan said anytime anyone buys a ticket on continental theyre 
making a contribution to treachery to atrocity to evil 
the entire labor movement learned something from the 
continental experience and this time lorenzo and his flunkies are

texaco inc president james w kinnear 
reluctantly admitted thursday that its restructuring was at least 
partly due to an old adversary and the oil giants biggest 
shareholder takeover investor carl icahn 
youd like to say no kinnear told a meeting of business 
executives but if you say that what icahn did galvanized and 
got the attention of the rest of the organization id have to say 
thats possible i think you have to ask yourself at what cost but 
i think theres an element of that 
at a meeting sponsored by the conference board a new yorkbased 
business research organization kinnear also announced a new 
incentive program for texacos top management 
kinnear said compensation would be based on several criteria 
including how well executives improve company earnings and return on 
investments 
in my case about threequarters of my compensation will vary 
with how well we do clearly its to the benefit of 
shareholders he said 
texaco in january announced the completion of a restructuring 
plan which involved the sale of more than 7 billion in assets 
streamlining of management and decentralization of decisionmaking 
the restructuring followed the companys emergence from chapter 
11 bankruptcy last year and was completed only after texaco made a 
deal with icahn a takeover speculator who acquired a big chunk of 
the companys stock during and after the bankruptcy period 
he made an unsuccessful offer for texaco last year an effort 
that the companys management dismissed as an insincere attempt to 
blackmail texaco into buying his shares 
the nations thirdlargest oil company originally sought refuge 
in bankruptcy court in april 1987 to avoid having to post a 
potentially ruinous security bond of more than 10 billion as part 
of a court battle with pennzoil co over texacos acquisition of 
getty oil co four years earlier 
since the restructuring many industry analysts have credited 
icahn texacos largest shareholder with igniting texaco management 
into making changes that they believe it otherwise would not have 
made 
in late january texaco announced it had struck a deal with icahn 
under which the financier agreed not to boost his 17 percent stake 
in the company for seven years or to make another takeover bid 
texaco in turn agreed to spend 24 billion in special dividend 
payments to shareholders and to repurchase some of its stock in 
order to boost the value of the shares analysts estimate that icahn 
stands to gain 300 million if the plan is approved by shareholders 
at the annual meeting in may 
on thursday kinnear called for changes in public policy and tax 
laws that encourage takeovers and attention to shortterm gains 
instead of longterm growth one law that should be changed he 
said allows a tax deduction for interest on loans for takeovers 
such tax reforms would encourage shareholders to view holdings 
as longterm investments not simply the local roulette table he 
said

a taiwanese exporter said thursday it had 
canceled a large order for washington apples because of concerns 
over the health effects of the chemical alar the latest sign of 
slowing sales due to the controversy 
wlh group of seattle this week cancelled an order for 5000 
boxes of washington apples and may not order any more us apples 
the rest of the season said sue lin an employee in the seattle 
office 
taiwanese consumers have stopped buying us apples after hearing 
alarming news accounts about alar ms lin said 
everybody is scared about that alar ms lin said in a 
telephone interview the market has become real bad 
taiwan is the largest offshore importer of washington apples 
buying about 50000 42pound boxes per week according to the 
northwest horticultural council 
ms lin said her companys weekly orders are worth about 70000 
the current selling season extends into august so the loss to 
washington growers could top 15 million 
that is a fairly small amount compared to the 312 million the 
5000 growers in washington state earned last year but it is also 
the most disturbing sign that the alar controversy is hurting the 
industry 
alar made by uniroyal chemical co is a growth regulator that 
is sprayed on trees to make the apples hang longer that gives them 
better color and firmness and allows growers extra harvest time 
the controversy erupted last week when the private natural 
resources defense council issued a report that claimed preschoolers 
exposed to alartreated apples ran a cancer risk of about one case 
for every 4000 children exposed 
growers and the us environmental protection agency have 
denounced the report as misleading and alarmist 
growers contend they voluntarily have cut back on alar the 
trade name for daminozide since concerns about the chemical first 
were raised three years ago 
only about 5 percent of the total us apple acreage is treated 
with the chemical and it is used within allowable federal limits 
the industry contends 
the epa has proposed banning alar by 1990 but its health effects 
are still in dispute and the chemical is legal to use 
the first accurate indication of how much the nrdc report has 
hurt apple sales was expected friday when major applemarketing 
organizations in washington state release their weekly shipping 
reports 
we have had a few isolated reports of sales dropping said 
maureen miklavic spokeswoman for the international apple institute 
in mclean va 
she said the decision by the taiwanese company was the only 
international cancellation she had heard about 
ms lin said her company intends to purchase apples from chile to 
send to taiwan 
the 5000box cancellation was with the northern fruit co of 
wenatchee export sales manager greg clevenger said his impression 
was that domestic sales are down but he said it will turn around 
once the public gets more informed

gov judd gregg announced wednesday that the 
state will ask a federal bankruptcy judge to block lowpower testing 
of the seabrook nuclear power plant 
the move is a stunning reversal of policy for the state of new 
hampshire which has officially supported the project for 17 years 
lead seabrook owner public service company of new hampshire 
sought bankruptcy protection in january 1988 because of licensing 
delays the 59 billion project was completed in july 1986 but 
remains idle because of evacuationplanning and financial obstacles 
in a statement gregg said the state will argue to the bankruptcy 
judge that letting seabrook conduct atomic tests is not sound 
business judgment unless it has first obtained the clearances 
necessary to begin fullpower operation including final evacuation 
plans 
if seabrook never goes online commercially then lowpower 
testing will have been a wasted exercise the resultant 
contamination will have been avoidable and the expense will have 
been unnecessary the republican governor said 
consistent with this position i have elected to petition the 
federal bankruptcy court to prevent seabrook from conducting such 
tests a motion to this effect will be filed within the next two 
weeks gregg said 
a seabrook spokesman rob williams said gregg must be 
misinformed and that prompt testing of the reactor is prudent 
project officials hope to start the tests within weeks 
nicholas ashooh a spokesman for lead seabrook owner public 
service company of new hampshire said company officials have 
concerns that this may lead to additional unnecessary delays and 
cost increases for seabrook and may further delay our getting 
seabrooks power which we need 
in december the nuclear regulatory commission said seabrook may 
start lowpower tests when the plants owners prove they can come up 
with 721 million to decommission the reactor if it conducts the 
tests but never operates commercially 
seabrook owners initially hoped to give that assurance in 
january in the form of a surety bond but they have yet to do so 
public service owns 36 percent of seabrook and gregg said the 
state opposes letting the company take on what he estimated as an 
additional 25 million liability for lowpower decommissioning 
a company in bankruptcy should not voluntarily accept 
additional liabilities gregg said 
gregg also said that contaminating seabrook with atomic testing 
will needlessly render the facility useless for alternate 
applications

a house panel on thursday approved legislation 
to gradually add 130 an hour to the 335 minimum wage as 
democratic leaders said theyre willing to compromise with the bush 
administration by adding a reduced training wage for new workers 
the move to raise the minimum for the first time in eight years 
was approved on a partyline vote by the house labor standards 
subcommittee the bill nearly identical to one approved by the 
senate labor and human resources committee wednesday would raise 
the minimum over three years to 465 by 1991 
the administration wants to increase the minimum wage to 425 an 
hour over three years and insists on the training wage provision 
allowing the minimum to stay at 335 an hour for all newly hired 
workers first six months on the job 
a spokeswoman for labor secretary elizabeth dole said thursday 
the administration is sticking by its last offer and is prepared 
to veto a more ambitious plan 
nothing that happened in the congress was unexpected said 
spokeswoman dale tate the entire package is the bottom line both 
the 425 figure and the sixmonth training wage at 335 weve 
come more than halfway towards meeting the goal in terms of meeting 
the minimum wage increase proponents 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committee said he expects negotiations over the 
subminimum despite the strong bush administration stance 
hawkins was asked whether he takes the veto threat seriously and 
replied 
no i dont its the nature of a presidents position to say 
such things were not going to be threatened by a veto we still 
have to legislate 
house democrats said they are prepared to include a subminimum 
wage if strict education and training requirements are included and 
committee staffers said they are considering a duration of 30 to 90 
days 
i can see justification in a short training period for some 
minimumwage employees said subcommittee chairman rep austin 
murphy dpa 
hawkins said the full house education and labor committee will 
take up the increase next tuesday and he predicted a vote by the 
full chamber the following week a spokeswoman for senate majority 
leader george mitchell said late thursday that a vote in the senate 
is not expected until april after the easter recess 
the minimum wage has stood at 335 an hour since 1981 
democrats would make the minimum 385 an hour this year and add 
40 cents an hour in each of the next two years republicans want to 
add 30 cents an hour annually for three years 
democrats and organized labor have long opposed a training wage 
but gave qualified acceptance to the idea this week sparking hopes 
that congress would pass an increase in the minimum wage agreeable 
to bush who has said he would veto legislation raising the minimum 
above 425 
if they want to have a training wage we will discuss it with 
them hawkins said thursday he said such a provision along with 
specific training would have to be limited to firsttime workers 
and would have to be for a shorter duration than six months 
recent white house proposals are both constructive and 
encouraging said murphy on the question of a training wage we 
are working hard to put together a proposal to be introduced either 
in full committee or on the house floor 
our amendment will be more restrictive than the proposals we 
have heard from the president however our effort will show we are 
sincere and prepared to address all the components of this issue 
he said

filing for bankruptcy protection gives eastern 
airlines a chance to fly again without worrying about more than 3 
billion in liabilities but doesnt stop the striketorn carrier 
from selling assets or shutting down for good 
industry analysts and bankruptcy lawyers said thursdays filing 
for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
law does not guarantee the airlines survival 
they dont have much left i think theyre a dead duck said 
paul gibson jr a new york attorney who was an american airlines 
vice president in the 1970s and early 1980s 
eastern said it had 45 billion in assets 339 billion in 
liabilities and 15696 creditors it filed its petition in us 
bankruptcy court in manhattan 
the filing does not specify how miamibased eastern plans to 
resurrect its crippled operations but analysts said the sale of the 
carrier possibly to trans world airlines owner carl c icahn or 
a piecebypiece dismantling were possibilities 
eastern must prove to bankruptcy judge burton r lifland that any 
asset sale is crucial for raising money to stay airborne or that 
the airline cant survive at all and must be sold 
if they have to raise cash to operate weektoweek or 
monthtomonth they can get by with the sale of a couple planes 
said richard lieb a new york bankruptcy lawyer but if its a 
very significant transaction there is some real doubt whether it 
could happen 
as such eastern filing throws the pending 365 million sale of 
its northeast shuttle service to new york developer donald trump 
into the judges hands 
it also delays a proposed 85 million sale to usair of eastern 
gates in philadelphia and routes from that city to toronto and 
montreal 
chapter 11 is designed to allow companies to operate normally 
during reoganization but assures nothing 
eastern for instance must find pilots to fly its planes in 
1982 braniff airways tried to reorganize and keep flying under 
chapter 11 but had to suspend operations before it was sold and 
brought out of bankruptcy 
any reorganization plan must be approved by the judge and by 
creditors 
secured creditors who have collateral from the airline would be 
the first to get paid unsecured creditors including passengers 
with unused eastern tickets have no security in case of default and 
cannot get reimbursed until the end of the case if at all 
eastern reported secured debt of 149 billion while its largest 
unsecured creditor the bank of new york is owed 150 million 
some industry analysts believe bankruptcy court was a better 
option for eastern than a total sale of assets where buyers 
probably would have bid rockbottom prices 
now because bankruptcy court is protecting the company and the 
creditors eastern will only accept an offer that is a fair offer 
said james carey vice president for research for airline economics 
inc 
easterns major individual assets include airport gates and 
landing slots its south american routes and its miami maintenance 
facility wall street estimates eastern is worth 400 million to 
900 million as a unit 
eastern president phil bakes said in court papers the airline had 
200 million in cash left from more than 400 million on hand at the 
outset of 1989 that money needed to run daily operations would 
have run out in about 45 days and eastern would have been forced out 
of business he said 
eastern has lost 102 billion this decade compared to industry 
earnings of 289 billion the papers said the airline said it was 
losing 4 million a day during the walkout by mechanics pilots and 
flight attendants which began last saturday 
while other airlines have been able to apply revenue to 
expansion projects eastern has been required to apply its 
revenue to primarily servicing debt obligations and meeting labor 
costs bakes said 
eastern said its payments on total debt of 25 billion were 
about 575 million last year the airline says it needs more than 
200 million in labor cost savings to remain in business 
bakes blamed unions for forcing eastern to seek bankruptcy 
protection saying they want to wrest control of the airline from 
parent texas air corp and avenge the 1983 takeover of continental 
airlines by texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
lorenzo took continental into bankruptcy in 1983 broke union 
contracts fired twothirds of its workers and emerged with a 
nonunion airline that led congress to amend bankruptcy laws that 
now require lorenzo to negotiate with eastern unions and get the 
judges approval before abrogating any pacts 
experts believe lorenzo miscalculated that easterns 3600 pilots 
would support the machinists walkout and probably did not envision 
bankruptcy but some also said lorenzos longterm intentions after 
acquiring eastern in 1986 may have been less than innocent 
i think he wanted to walk along the edge and continue his 
stripping down of the operations as a wheelerdealer he doesnt 
want a court looking over his head said gibson the former 
american executive
