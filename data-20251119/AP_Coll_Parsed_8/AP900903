two inmates apparently escaped monday night from 
the federal prison where manuel noriega is being held pending his 
drug trial police said 
the deposed panamanian leader wasnt involved 
the two inmates were seen scaling a fence on the extensive 
grounds of the federal metropolitan correctional center south of 
miami said prison spokesman charles davis but it was unclear if 
the men actually got beyond the outer fence he said 
our perimiter patrolman fired on the inmates and claims he hit 
one on the shoulder davis said they may have gotten out of 
the perimiter of the property 
police believed they may have gotten into a large public park 
nearby 
police identified the prisoners as omar fernandez a convicted 
bank robber and charles carew who is serving time for cocaine 
possession 
at least three helicopters squadrons of police officers and 
police dogs surrounded the prison 
police checked every car leaving the prison grounds and at least 
one us customs helicopter fitted with infrared lights for night 
vision hovered over the area 
guards searched inside the prison grounds but the most of the 
search concentrated outside the fence 
many of the inmates are allowed relative freedom inside the 
wooded 48acre compound southwest of miami but noriega is under 
constant watch by a guard posted outside his specially built cell 
in the administration building 
the mediumsecurity mcc was designed to hold 425 inmates between 
trips to the federal courthouse in miami about 25 miles away now 
more than 1100 live there sleeping two to a cell taxing the 
ability of guards to watch over them about 700 of the inmates are 
in pretrial detention 300 were returned from prisons outside 
florida to await trials here and about 100 inmates are serving full 
sentences 
security was tightened after barry kramer a former powerboat 
racing champion serving life without parole for leading a drug 
trafficking ring arranged for a friend to pick him up by 
helicopter in april 
the copter crashed into the fence surrounding an exercise yard 
injuring both the wouldbe escapee and the pilot 
three successful escapes have occurred since 1981 davis said 
once a prisoner walked out the front door with visitors made up 
in lipstick and dressed in his wifes clothes 
another inmate slipped out by hanging onto the undercarriage of 
a dade county bookmobile he was captured two years later 
the third rode out in a trash bin and narrowly escaped being 
compacted

president bush wrapped up a threeweek 
vacation monday and returned to the white house to get ready for 
his summit in helsinki with soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
white house aides said bushs trip may be extended an additional 
day to give the president a chance to meet on saturday with finish 
president mauno koivisto in that case bush will leave for finland 
on friday said deputy press secretary roman popadiuk 
the president will meet with gorbachev for about five hours on 
sunday including luncheon talks and then return to washington 
the crisis in the middle east tops the agenda although the 
president and white house aides have stressed that several other 
subjects including progress toward an agreement on reducing 
troops and tanks in europe will also be discussed in some detail 
side meetings between aides to bush and gorbachev are not 
planned for this summit said an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity such sessions usually are standard during summit 
meetings 
another official described the oneday session as more an 
informal meeting between the two leaders 
bush has said he does not expect the soviet union to mediate 
between iraq and the united states but the administration would 
welcome any pressure gorbachev can bring against iraq a longtime 
recipient of soviet arms 
popadiuk said there was no doubt bush would spend much time 
in the days ahead preparing for his third summit with gorbachev 
but that there were few details of the presidents schedule at this 
time 
im assuming hell take into acount the view of allied 
leaders popadiuk said 
in advance of other summits with gorbachev the president spent 
hours on the phone conferring with other western leaders 
members of congress begin to return to washington and this week 
and two foreign affairs committees will begin their official 
scrutiny of the monthold persian gulf crisis 
twentytwo house members returned monday night from a tour of 
bahrain egypt and saudi arabia with lawmakers from both parties 
supporting the administration 
all of us left here with the conclusion that the presidents 
action was a correct action said house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo all of us come back believing that is the case 
but the house members were concerned about the cost of the 
operation and gephardt said his colleagues believed the financial 
burden should be shared by other nations 
budget talks stalemated when congress left in early august for 
its recess resume late this week administration officials say the 
1billionamonth us military operation in the persian gulf will 
make reaching a deficitcutting agreement even more difficult 
bush spent his final day at his maine family retreat boating and 
playing golf taking along national security adviser brent 
scowcroft on both outings 
he was to meet with his cabinet on tuesday to brief it on 
developments in the persian gulf 
on thursday the president was to travel to topeka kan and 
tallahassee fla to help raise funds for republican candidates 
the trip was expected to give bush a chance to use a newly 
delivered air force one for the first time the new plane a 
converted boeing 747 is much larger than the current planes used 
for air force one a pair of boeing 707s that are more than 20 
years old 
bush was then to take the new plane to helsinki and back 
with only a weeks advance notice on the summit white house 
aides had little time to work out logistics 
everybodys scrambling to put their pieces together one 
official said 
sig rogich who oversees white house advance logistics and 
imagemaking ended his vacation early on sunday to coordinate the 
planning 
meanwhile the rev jesse jackson said that any diplomatic 
solution to the persian gulf crisis must regain kuwaiti 
sovereignty assure saudi arabian security and assure the 
integrity of iraq 
jackson returned from iraq on sunday with 47 freed american 
hostages after he met for six hours with iraqi leader saddam 
hussein 
the civil rights leader and former democratic presidential 
aspirant urged bush to pursue a diplomatic solution to reverse 
iraqs takeover of kuwait and cautioned against relying solely on 
military pressure 
just as our generals are in saudi arabia with a military 
presence our politicians should be as evident in seeking 
diplomatic solutions he said on nbctvs today on monday 
jackson who met with jordans crown prince hassan as well as 
the iraqi president said a diplomatic solution must regain the 
sovereignty of kuwait assure the security of saudi arabia and 
assure the integrity of iraq he called for an end to the 
drumbeating hostile rhetoric 
jackson in an interview on abctvs good morning america 
said he challenged saddam on his takeover of kuwait saying the 
annexation and his threats against saudi arabia were errors 
asked to respond to criticism that he was exploiting the 
hostages plight for his own political gains he said suffice it 
to say blessed are the peacemakers even when they are beguiled

wolfgang jung had spent his first two years 
in college absorbing communist economics when abruptly the world 
changed so did his homework 
jung is spending his last two years of college cramming for 
capitalism at east berlins college of economics where even the 
teachers are taking a crash course in freemarket thinking 
the college is part of a vast educational system that is both 
trying to reshape itself quickly and continuing to train young 
people for jobs that may not exist on graduation day 
nearly 21 million east germans from elementary to graduate 
level are beginning a new school year that will be much different 
from the previous 42 
millions of new textbooks free of communist ideology have 
flooded in from west germany bloated departments devoted to 
marxistleninist theory have been dissolved 
hundreds of russianlanguage teachers spent the summer learning 
to teach english more than onethird of the nations 1 million 
teachers are enrolled in retraining programs 
on the secluded campus where the communist secret police once 
learned their fearsome skills music science and languages are 
taught to an ordinary student body 
still experts say the changes are almost superficial 
most of the old teachers former guardians of ideology and 
components of a vast domestic intelligence network will be back in 
their classrooms 
all principals rectors and chancellors were fired but the 
communities entrusted with refilling those jobs returned more than 
half to their former positions 
what has happened to east germanys schools in the year since 
communism fell is only the beginning of a process that may need a 
generation to complete the experts say 
for jung and others in the class of 92 that is too long 
i didnt know what a corporation was when we began learning a 
market economy said jung 24 sitting in the school cafeteria 
bent over a west german textbook 
it was socialism socialism socialism now we have to go back 
to the beginning 
the democratic government elected in march has only begun 
decentralizing the system reteaching the teachers and eliminating 
the rigidity of lesson plans said hansjoachim meyer the 
education minister 
meyer believes the five state governments that will be created 
oct 14 to fit in with the west german system will have a more 
formidable task when they assume full responsibility for the 
schools 
he said the hardest job will be to change the way people think 
to instill individuality and imagination in a system dulled by 
decades of restrictive paranoid stalinism 
we need probably four to five years to introduce the necessary 
structures he said but in order to develop new attitudes 
toward life toward society yes that will take a generation 
meshing the east german education system with west germanys is 
another problem east german students for example need 12 years 
of schooling to qualify for a university while west germans must 
have 13 
it is a major problem to get east germany to fit into the 
whole context said monika renz a researcher for the standing 
conference of education ministers of the 11 west german states 
the group is debating how to merge the systems and not all 
the states are convinced east german schools are up to par she 
said 
all have agreed some grudgingly to allow east germans equal 
access to west german universities with admission quotas based on 
percentages of east german applicants 
east german educators bristle at criticism of their schools and 
what they feel is condescension by west germans 
they give us their textbooks their lectures their 
seminars said heidi klemm who teaches english they say 
its all rubbish your schools 
she pointed out that the exodus to west germany last year which 
helped bring down the communist government in east germany was 
largely of people judged to be highly skilled 
ms klemm spoke while strolling across her college campus 
outside the small farm community of golm 25 miles south of berlin 
and just outside potsdam 
ivy covers many buildings and barbed wire rings the periphery 
the college was the officers training school of the former stasi 
secret police where only the brightest in the feared organization 
could gain admittance 
stasi students and faculty were expelled late last year and the 
school was converted into an extension of a teachers college in 
potsdam 
the potsdam school occupies beautiful colonnaded buildings in a 
complex of 19th century palaces and gardens built for frederick the 
great the prussian king in them nearly 3000 students study 
languages medicine art and geography 
it is the largest teachers college in east germany and has a 
severe case of nerves 
all administrators of all schools were dismissed in june 
committees of local officials students parents and teachers have 
been meeting to recommend who should be retained 
the potsdam schools committee began work sept 1 
if you come here in january maybe someone else will be 
sitting here knut kiesant the vice chancellor said in his 
spacious office 
kiesant has been with the school for six years and wolfgang 
strauss director of international relations for 25 both say 
people who rose to high levels in the old regime are being 
persecuted 
whether i am good or i am bad is not a question of black or 
white as a child would decide strauss said 
both men said they favor the new politics in east germany 
most school committees have completed their work and more than 
half perhaps 65 percent rehired their old administrators said 
meyer the education minister 
he attributed that to a lack of qualified alternative 
candidates apathy in local committees and deference to the old 
headmasters 
meyer predicted more administrators would be replaced when the 
new state governments took over but recommended against wholesale 
dismissals of teachers 
teachers are such a large group he said that they deserve a 
chance to change with the changing society 
many may be weeded out by economic collapse unpaid bills are 
mounting at the potsdam school and it has a 51 ratio of students 
to teachers compared with 301 in west germany strauss said 
economic problems are increasing across the country presaging 
hard times for students nearing graduation 
agriculture students have learned techniques applicable only to 
the dying collective farms thousands of trade school students are 
apprenticed to factories expected to close 
no school has had to shift gears more quickly than the 
4500student college of economics 
about 60 of the 200 professors have been replaced with western 
experts said hanspeter krueger the new vice chancellor 
krueger said the school added crash programs so students and 
teachers could catch up with capitalism 
we not only have to learn how to teach a market economy we 
have to teach how to live in a market economy he said

robert ostman spotted sen dave 
durenbergers state fair booth right between the cider and nut hut 
and a stand hawking inflatable teenage mutant ninja turtles 
the 68yearold man was ready to give the minnesota republican a 
piece of his mind ostman is one minnesotan who says he voted for 
durenberger before but wont vote for him again 
what were you thinking queried ostman face to face with 
his senator you thought you could get by with it you had a good 
thing going and you blew it 
later a teenager in braces brought durenberger a different 
message the only difference between you and the rest of them is 
that they didnt get caught he said 
i hope youll be able to support me durenberger replied 
softly 
durenberger had expected this ever since he was formally 
denounced on the floor of the senate on july 25 for financial 
wrongdoing the senate found that he violated its rules by 
laundering speaking fees through a book contract and billing the 
government when he stayed in his minneapolis condominium 
some senators used the long august recess to relax on long 
vacations before the postlabor day crunch of congressional 
business 
but durenberger whose support in public opinion polls has 
plunged faces a long period of political rehabilitation before 
heading to saudi arabia with a congressional delegation friday he 
attended much of the twoweek minnesota state fair to take what 
came from the 15 million who visit it each year 
in some of them he found support a knot of wellwishers stayed 
around durenberger who posed with fairgoers for an aides 
polaroid camera and listened patiently to constituents 
stay in there were behind you 100 percent said an elderly 
woman who identified herself as matilda 
durenberger had braced himself for the worst the 
democraticfarmerlabor party booth down the street was passing out 
buttons that read i paid more rent than dave durenberger a 
reference to his condo deal 
minnesotans are known for their congenial manner a collective 
personality trait known as minnesota nice but some fairgoers 
let durenberger know they were disappointed in him or couldnt 
understand how he got off so easy as they saw it for stealing 
from the government 
earl cromey a retired railroad worker from stillwater demanded 
to know why durenberger was still in office if former house speaker 
jim wright was out 
he quit on his own he made the decision durenberger 
explained 
durenberger insists that he was acting in good faith when he 
pursued the schemes that resulted in the senates disciplinary 
action durenberger was first elected to the senate in 1978 and his 
current term expires in 1994 he has not said whether he would run 
again 
somehow they think i stole 40000 from the government 
durenberger said in an interview before heading to the fairgrounds 
i cant change peoples minds about what they think are the 
facts ill just have to change their minds about how they view me 
as a senator he said

virtually all those convicted of savings and 
loan fraud are firsttime offenders but they are getting harsher 
prison sentences than the typical whitecollar criminal according 
to justice department figures 
these are traditionally norecord defendants said marvin 
collins the us attorney in dallas whose office has prosecuted 
about a quarter of the major sampl cases they appear often very 
contrite at sentencing and generally make sympathetic defendants 
for sentencing 
given all of that i feel reasonably comfortable with the 
types of sentences that we have been receiving collins said 
most of the people are receiving jail time 
there were 128 people convicted since oct 1 1988 who received 
average prison sentences of 32 years according to department 
statistics 
that compares with an average 25 years for all federal fraud 
cases including embezzlement and forgery according to a study 
compiled last year by the justice departments bureau of justice 
statistics that study used figures from 1987 the most recent year 
available 
the average sentence for embezzlement in 1987 was 18 years 
while the average sentence for mail and wire fraud was 26 years 
thirtyseven of those convicted for sampl crimes since oct 1 
1988 have not been jailed 
the justice department defines a major sampl case as one involving 
fraud or loss of more than 100000 or in which the defendant was 
an executive or officer of a thrift institution 
sentences have ranged from probation to the 30year term given 
woody f lemons former chairman of the failed vernon savings amp 
loan association near dallas earlier this year 
lemons who could have been sentenced to 65 years in jail was 
convicted of 13 counts of bank fraud misapplication of funds 
conspiracy and bank bribery 
other important sentences include 
a 15year prison term given to robert hopkins former chairman 
of commodore savings association in dallas for making illegal 
campaign contributions with the thrifts money and concealing the 
donations from federal regulators he also was ordered to pay 
restitution of 122980 
the 12year prison terms given to oscar tharp president and 
john odonnell the vice president of first mutual savings 
association of pensacola fla for conspiring to steal money from 
the sampl through kickback schemes involving multimilliondollar bank 
loans for georgia real estate projects 
the 12year sentence that julian seidel president of first 
maryland savings and loan received for embezzlement by approving 
speculative loans losses to the silver spring md thrift were 
estimated at 60 million senior vice president james porter 
received a sevenyear prison term 
the average is brought down by a large number of defendants who 
are shown leniency in exchange for cooperating with federal 
investigators to help convict higherlevel officers or executives 
we always make cooperation known to the court at the time of 
sentencing collins said 
we want other people out there to distinguish between those 
people who are willing to cooperate and testify against others who 
have broken the law and those who want to thumb their noses at the 
system collins said 
short prison sentences or probation were imposed on defendants 
in cases in which the fraud was not directly related to the failure 
of a thrift institution collins said 
because most of the sampl crimes occurred before new government 
sentencing guidelines took effect those serving time will become 
eligible for parole after serving a third of the prison term minus 
good time 
by comparison many of the defendants convicted in the justice 
departments investigation of pentagon procurement fraud 
nicknamed operation ill wind were sentenced under the 
guidelines which do not allow for parole 
the major figures in the ill wind investigations have 
received sentences ranging from 18 months to nearly three years 
sentences for the major participants in the recent 
insidertrading scandal on wall street ranged from two months for 
trader martin siegel to four years for investor paul bilzerian 
ivan boesky received a 3year sentence and paid 100 million in 
fines and restitution 
members of congress often like to compare sampl fraud to bank 
robbery an analogy that makes law enforcement officials wince 
these officials note that bank robbers are often armed 
the justice department study of 1987 sentences found that the 
average sentence for defendants convicted of federal robbery 
charges was 123 years but unlike the sampl offenders many of these 
criminals were not firsttime offenders 
a study by the us sentencing commission found that firsttime 
offenders convicted of robbery were sentenced in 1985 to average 
sentences ranging between 25 years and 47 years depending on the 
amount involved in the holdup

cellular phone subscriptions grew nearly 25 
percent in the first half of 1990 despite economic hard times in 
some industries that depend on mobile communications an industry 
group said monday 
in the face of a quivering economy cellular continues to be 
extremely strong said robert w maher president of the cellular 
telecommunications industry association 
the average bill paid by subscribers of the 44 million cellular 
phones declined slightly in the first six months of the year to 
8394 from 8930 while the average length of calls remained 
about the same at 23 minutes according to an association survey 
maher said a cellular phone increasingly is considered an 
essential item not a luxury by industries such as construction 
and real estate that have been hit recently with business slowdowns 
it shows increasing public and business acceptance of cellular 
at a time when the economy was not growing very much said 
charles j many president of nynex mobile communications and 
chairman of the association 
the survey of 552 cellular companies found that 859742 
subscribers were added between jan 1 and june 30 a 245 percent 
growth rate by comparison 817151 subscribers were added from 
june 1989 through december 1989 a growth rate of 303 percent 
maher said the industry no longer was experiencing the huge 
growth rates of the mid1980s when cellular first began but that 
its growth was steady any declines have been more in usage than in 
subscribership he said 
companies facing a little problem with the bottom line are 
probably cautioning on the use of cellular to make sure its 
business only maher said 
industry service revenues were up 10 percent in the first six 
months of this year to 213 billion 
the industry has grown from 32 systems in december 1984 
representing a total capital investment of 3548 million to 592 
systems with a total capital investment of 52 billion at the end 
of june the 52 billion is 16 percent above december 1989

endangered species pop up in the strangest 
places like flowerbeds 
plantprotection activists say some species of bulbs bought to 
decorate american and european gardens are being collected by the 
millions in the wild threatening to wipe out those flowers in 
their home turf 
the world would lose an irreplaceable treasure said 
marjorie arundel of warrenton va an adviser to the garden club 
of americas horticulture committee theyre the ancestors of all 
of our spring bulbs today 
mrs arundel and other activists are urging american gardeners 
to buy only commercially propagated plants which experts say make 
up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway 
wildcollected flowers are a small percentage of the trade 
but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants said faith 
campbell director of the plant conservation program for the 
natural resources defense council an environmental group 
working with the world wildlife fund and the garden club of 
america the nrdc has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to 
avoid most kinds of cyclamen sternbergia and galanthus or 
snowdrops which they say are collected in the wild in turkey 
those three species are listed as endangered in the convention 
on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and 
flora or cites but this treaty effective in fighting trade in 
some endangered animal skins horns and tusks has had little 
effect on the flower trade ms campbell said 
snowdrops are greatly depleted in turkeys mediterranean 
regions forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions 
the popular angels tears narcissus are being collected in 
the wild but experts are not sure if the source is portugal or 
somewhere else 
other wildflowers such as trillium are being collected from 
the wild in the united states and canada japan china india and 
the soviet union appear to be the sources for still other rare 
flowers 
some species of these plants may be produced by growers in the 
united states or europe but buyers are being counseled to check 
the origins as carefully as they can 
this may become easier as a result of the decision last may by 
the dutch commodity board for ornamental horticultural products to 
require exporters to use a bulbs from wild sources label to 
identify wildcollected plants 
under the negotiated agreement dutch exporters will also label 
their cultivated bulbs beginning in 1992 for minor species and in 
1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths 
because the netherlands has long dominated the world flower 
trade the action by the dutch regulatory body should have a major 
impact ms campbell said it is not binding though on dealers in 
the united states or other countries 
also the agreement was reached too late for most of this falls 
catalogs so even if american gardeners order from dutch dealers 
covered by the rules they might not know they were buying 
wildcollected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail labeled 
wild sources 
we can just hope they wont order those again ms campbell 
said it is a messy phasingin 
the longrange solution she said could be in helping people in 
turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting wild flowers to 
start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat 
she said 
gardeners shouldnt think theyre aiding nature by keeping alive 
a species that might be disappearing in its native habitat 
we dont consider that a contribution to conservation in any 
way ms campbell said its not playing its role in the 
ecosystem in which it evolved

despite a recent improvement in usisraeli 
relations foreign minister david levys visit to washington may 
prove the most difficult task in his three months as israels chief 
diplomat 
levy who is scheduled to meet wednesday with secretary of state 
james a baker iii declared when he was named foreign minister in 
june that improving ties with washington would be his chief goal 
then relations with the united states were touchy because of 
israels refusal to agree to usproposed compromises meant to 
open a peace dialogue with palestinians the rightwing likud bloc 
leading the new government was the chief opponent of the american 
proposals 
since then iraqs invasion of kuwait and the american buildup 
in the persian gulf have helped change views in israels favor 
israels repeated warnings that iraqi president saddam hussein 
posed a danger to the world have proven true israels adamant 
refusal to talk to the palestine liberation organization is viewed 
more favorably because of the plos backing for saddam 
washington which gives israel 3 billion a year in military and 
economic aid is reportedly open to hearing israels request for 
additional sophisticated weapons levy is expected to raise the 
topic at his meetings with baker and other us officials 
still the main stumbling block in israelius relations the 
palestinian problem will not disappear from the agenda israeli 
officials say 
israeli officials are concerned that president bushs 
administration eager to please the new arab allies who have joined 
the campaign against iraq will apply pressure on israel to make 
concessions for peace 
levys reputation as a hardliner may make the talks more 
difficult as housing minister since 1979 he played a key role in 
building many of the 130 jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories washington defines the settlements as obstacles to 
peace 
levy also was instrumental in pressuring prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to reject bakers proposals for an israelipalestinian 
dialogue 
critics say levys communication with american officials may be 
hampered by his lack of experience in foreign policy and weak 
command of english 
sometimes ministers prefer to meet alone noted an israeli 
government official who spoke on condition of anonymity but 
here there will certainly have to be someone else in on the meeting 
unless he baker has learned hebrew 
israeli newspapers already have blamed levy for at least two 
gaffes as foreign minister 
last month levy demanded immediate distribution of gas masks to 
civilians following threats from iraq of a chemical attack critics 
saw the demand as linked more to his rivalry with defense minister 
moshe arens who opposed such a move than to concern for public 
safety 
levy also reportedly leaked an israeliegyptian plan to open 
israels border so as to ease the exodus of egyptian refugees from 
iraq coming home via jordan both jordan and egypt were embarrassed 
by the public revelation and the plan was canceled 
supporters say however that the moroccanborn levys fluency 
in arabic and his familiarity with the arab world could become an 
important asset in possible peace negotiations with the arab states 
and the palestinians 
levy a fiery orator who immigrated to israel in 1957 worked 
his way up from ditchdigger to the highestranking job ever held by 
a north african immigrant he is seen as a symbol of the 
integration advocated by israels founding fathers

rep mickey edwards has found it hard to talk 
about the budget and the federal deficit lately as he campaigns for 
reelection in his oklahoma district 
all of the speeches i gave in the last week ended up being 
primarily discussions of iraq the seventerm republican said at 
coffees public forums civic clubs every question i would get 
was about iraq for me its shoved everything else off the 
table 
edwards is not unique across the country this election season 
the crisis in the middle east has thrown carefully laid campaign 
plans aside and blunted the efforts of challengers to attack 
incumbents records in some cases campaigns are locked in a 
virtual freeze frame 
for incumbents iraqi president saddam husseins aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait was at least a temporary windfall 
it meant that instead of answering questions about why congress 
didnt prevent the savings and loan scandal or why it cant 
balance the budget lawmakers were in sudden demand as local 
experts on foreign policy 
in some places political discourse has been reduced to a 
contest to see which candidate can most strongly support president 
bushs troop deployment and denounce saddam in the harshest terms 
nearly three dozen members of the house and senate traveled to 
the middle east last weekend and the days and weeks ahead will be 
consumed with hearings on foreign policy military policy energy 
policy all far removed from the quagmire of issues that 
incumbents dread 
both ed rollins political director of the republican house 
campaign effort and howard schloss spokesman for the democrats 
national house campaign arm described the iraq phenomenon in 
precisely the same words its knocked everything else right off 
the radar screen 
across the land the middle east is popping up on the campaign 
trail 
in washingtons northern virginia suburbs democratic 
challenger jim moran called a news conference to talk about womens 
issues an area he viewed as a weak point for incumbent gop rep 
stan parris in response to a question he urged caution in any 
military commitments in the middle east 
parris called his own news conference in response declaring 
the only three people i know who support saddam husseins 
position are moammar gadhafi yasser arafat and jim moran moran 
shot back that parris is a deceitful fatuous jerk i want to 
break his nose 
jim gallaway the frontrunner in tuesdays nevada gop 
gubernatorial primary got a boost and a flurry of publicity when 
he was called to active duty by the marine corps because of the 
gulf crisis a marine reserve colonel he spent a week doing 
military logistics work in arlington va then returned to the 
campaign trail 
democratic senate candidate ron twilegar in idaho accused gop 
nominee rep larry craig of accepting 65000 from the fossil fuel 
industry while allowing his oil company friends to jack up 
gasoline prices and take advantage of the middle east crisis craig 
responded that he is seeking answers about possible price gouging 
and denied acting against constituents interests 
political analyst and newsletter publisher charles cook said the 
diversion from politics as usual helps both republicans who stood 
to lose ground largely because of a weak economy and incumbents 
generally 
bushs approval rating which had been dropping along with 
perceptions of the nations economic health has been given new 
vitality by his handling of the persian gulf crisis another 
factor that benefits gop candidates 
the economy was starting to snowball as a political issue 
and then it was stopped cook said what this may do is ensure 
another statusquo election one in which neither party makes 
substantial gains 
cook and other analysts note however that nov 6 still is more 
than two months away and that the situation in the middle east is 
unpredictable 
if the iraq crisis turns into a longterm standoff and the issue 
fades from the front pages the economy abortion ethics the sampl 
crisis and the budget all could return as hot political topics 
putting incumbents once again on the defensive 
but if the gulf region boils over into military conflict voters 
will be grasping for stability and unlikely to make changes such 
as throwing incumbents out of office the analysts said 
the result said rollins will be an abbreviated campaign 
season the fall campaign usually kicks into high gear on labor 
day but this year the battles will be fought in the final two or 
three weeks before the elections he said 
those who spend their lives drafting carefully scripted campaign 
battle plans find themselves at the mercy of events 
lamented rollins from a political managers perspective its 
the worst of all possible nightmares

a judge monday ordered a sixmonth jail sentence 
for a train driver who ran a red light and caused a crash that 
killed five people and injured 87 
robert morgan 47 pleaded guilty to two manslaughter charges 
arising from the crash at purley south london on march 4 1989 
i do not believe it is possible to deal with a case such as 
this but by a sentence of imprisonment said justice ian kennedy 
morgans train failed to slow down after he passed two warning 
signals and it slammed into the back of a slower train 
julian bevan the prosecutor said morgans train was traveling 
at about 70 mph when it hit the other train 
the judge issued an 18month sentence but suspended 12 months 
because you have never pretended it was anyone else at fault and 
have never contemplated throwing the dust in the eyes of 
investigators you also have had a particularly good character

anc leader nelson mandela called 
monday for an independent investigation of police partiality 
following a judges scathing attack on police actions that left 
five people dead during a march protest 
the matter is too important to be given to the police the 
very culprit to investigate mandela told a news conference in 
soweto 
he and other black leaders have accused police of aiding zulu 
backers of the conservative inkatha movement in township battles 
with xhosas and other african national congress supporters 
police found 25 bodies over the weekend after clashes erupted 
following several days of relative quiet the fighting in the 
townships near johannesburg has killed at least 540 people since 
aug 12 
gangs armed with spears axes and knives fought in tokoza and 
tembisa townships and a minibus filled with armed men shot down 
residents in the townships police said security forces said they 
were unable to stop the killings 
what can you do were always too late said one police 
officer who declined to give his name 
authorities reinforced police and soldiers patrolling the 
townships elite army battalions were moved into johannesburg late 
last month to help police 
president fw de klerk called sunday for an investigation of 
alleged police bias in the recent township violence de klerk said 
he told law and order minister adriaan vlok to conduct an urgent 
and indepth investigation into charges made by black political 
and church leaders 
de klerk and police have repeatedly denied the charges of 
antianc bias saying individual police may have acted improperly 
but that the force as a whole was impartial 
on saturday a government inquiry sharply criticized police for 
firing on demonstrators in the sebokeng township last march five 
blacks were killed and 156 wounded by gunfire 
mandela said the sebokeng report showed the government lacked 
control over police 
i think its findings are a very scathing attack on the 
training of the police he said he called for a similar judicial 
inquiry of police actions in the townships during the recent 
fighting 
mandela just back from a nineday trip to norway libya 
algeria and zambia also said he rejected a facetoface meeting 
with zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi because the question of 
violence is not a question of individuals 
he said working groups had been formed to try to end the 
fighting 
buthelezi has repeatedly sought a meeting with mandela to 
discuss the inkathaanc feud which started five years ago in natal 
province 
the anc charges inkatha spread the violence to the johannesburg 
area this month to broaden its constituency from the traditional 
zulu homeland inkatha charges the anc is trying to terrorize other 
black opposition groups to monopolize power 
on other issues mandela said 
he questioned a government plan to study converting migrant 
worker hostels in the townships into family dwellings much of the 
recent fighting has involved township residents and hostel dwellers 
he was satisfied with the response of government leaders he met 
with during his trip he refused to discuss details such as 
reports he would ask libyan leader col moammar gadhafi for money 
the governing national partys move toward opening itself to 
nonwhites would make little difference to the anc i doubt if 
any black personality of stature would commit suicide by joining 
the national party he said 
in other developments two bombs rocked the office late sunday 
of beeld a leading progovernment afrikaans newspaper a car was 
damaged and windows shattered but there were no injuries 
a beeld editor said monday that an extreme rightwing group 
claimed responsibility such proapartheid groups have used 
dynamite in a recent series of bombings to protest government 
attempts to end white minority rule 
also monday 11 anc members were released from robben island 
prison near cape town they had been charged with crimes such as 
treason and terrorism 
the government had said it would release up to 15 political 
prisoners after the weekend under an agreement with the anc reached 
last month

saudi arabia has increased oil 
production by 227 million barrels a day and will give priority to 
supplying developing nations hit hardest by the embargo on iraqi 
and kuwaiti oil officials said monday 
but because of lag time in shipping it will be several weeks 
before these nations see the oil 
the increased production is designed to make up for the 
shortfall created by the un embargo on products from kuwait and 
iraq according to saudi and western officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
most of the increase derives from saudi aramco the 
governmentowned oil giant that controls 96 percent of the 
countrys production 
aramco is aiming to produce about 75 million barrels a day up 
from 53 million which is about the companys sustainable 
capacity according to western sources 
the price of oil on world markets has already fallen from about 
30 a barrel to 26 a barrel in anticipation of the increased 
production the sources said 
aramco has a shortterm surge capacity of 85 million barrels 
company officials said the oil giant peaked at 10 million barrels 
in the 1980 
many facilities were shut down during the 1980s oil slump but 
even before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait aramco had embarked 
on an ambitious multibillion dollar program to refit and retool 
production and storage capacity 
at the heavily guarded shipping terminal here on the arabian 
gulf officials are expecting an increase in tanker activity in two 
to three weeks 
the decision to increase production was taken only a few days 
ago said mohamed yones chief harbor pilot at the huge terminal 
he said the increase will be reflected in more ships coming 
here in the next several weeks the delay stems from the lag time 
needed to schedule tanker visits he said 
saudi arabia will give priority to supplying developing 
countries whose oil supplies have been cut off saudi officials 
said the embargo dried up about 4 million barrels a day 
the countries suffering most include turkey brazil the 
philippines india pakistan bangladesh taiwan and south korea 
according to the middle east economic survey a nicosiabased 
newsletter 
next on the list are the japanese the newsletter said in last 
place are increases for us and european buyers 
roughly 75 percent of saudi oil exports leave from the ras 
tannura terminal and two sister terminals 
on monday two tankers were at ras tannura which has docking 
space for as many as 25 tankers at the height of the oil boom in 
the 1980s the complex handled 320 tankers a month yones said 
aramco has also boosted production of jet fuel and other refined 
products to cope with demand from operation desert shield the 
military buildup in the persian gulf region

pope john paul ii on monday lamented 
that millions of people are living in misery because of the failure 
of development policies but he urged africans not to give up hope 
despite so much poverty and suffering so many instances of 
neglect and injustice the final word is not one of suffering 
and hopelessness but of love and victory over sin he said 
the pope on the third day of a 10day fournation african 
pilgrimage crisscrossed tanzania flying from the indian ocean 
port city of dar es salaam to the southern town of songea and then 
to this northern city on the edge of lake victoria 
john paul spoke bluntly of africas problems and hardships a 
common theme in his seven visits to the continent in tanzania a 
nation of 25 million people the annual per capita income is below 
200 it is one of the poorest countries on earth 
the pope compared africas plight to the original chaos 
described in the opening of the book of genesis the world as a 
formless void and there was darkness over the deep 
that biblical image is a good representation of the real 
difficulties and frustrations that accompany the daily life of 
millions of our brothers and sisters he said in his homily 
during a mass at songea 
the pope said many developing countries had high hopes for the 
future when they gained independence but had failed to realize 
their promise 
the failure of development is evident in continuing hunger and 
malnutrition in the plight of refugees in exposure to disease and 
the lack of even basic health care 
it can also be seen in scarcity of educational facilities of 
decent living conditions of productive employment in unfair 
competition for positions in the crime corruption and unscupulous 
ambition present at many levels of social life 
how many young people are deeply affected by the lack of hope 
that overshadows their future 
still john paul said africans can retain hope in the future if 
there is a a new attitude diametrically opposed to a selfish 
desire for profit and the thirst for power 
the change of attitude which the world so urgently needs is 
not brought about by ideological tensions or social conflicts he 
said the love we are speaking about includes a profound respect 
for the dignity of every person without discrimination of any 
kind and effective service of others 
about 25000 people many waving tanzanian and vatican flags 
attended the mass in a dirt field in the middle of the african 
savannah the pope spoke in english with several passages of 
swahili mixed in from an altar with a bamboo backdrop 
he received the traditional welcome of african dance and music 
including a performance at the songea airport by a group of tribal 
warriors with spears and animalskin shields 
after the mass the pope flew to mwanza a city of 200000 
people on the southern shores of africas biggest lake to visit 
the cathedral and give his blessing to 26 sick people 
on tuesday he will celebrate mass in mwanza fly to tabora for 
another service and then travel to moshi at the foot of mount 
kilimanjaro africas tallest mountain 
the popes tour will also take him to burundi rwanda and ivory 
coast

of summer with her family farm workers who live in a ramshackle 
homeless shelter on the edge of town 
this fall shell return to stanford university where she hopes 
to maintain her bplus average as a sophomore studying science and 
engineering 
id like to think the second year will be easier but i dont 
think so the 18yearold said im going to have harder 
classes and a heavier load 
when she graduated second in a class of 397 students from oxnard 
high school in june 1989 she was accepted by six california 
universities she chose stanford because she thought it had the 
best science program 
stanford with annual costs topping 21000 also is the most 
expensive university in the state shes using private 
scholarships state and federal grants and loans to pay for her 
education and shes saving money from her two summer jobs 
on a recent weekday the teenager sat at a table in the 
enclosed patio of a family friends home studying calculus and 
listening to spanish pop music 
i dont even want to remember my first year it was so hard 
she recalled with a grimace my brain was just going all the 
time i could never get to sleep before 3 in the morning and 
finals were just awful 
the first two to three weeks i really felt homesick said 
ms vasquez i wanted to see my mom i wanted to go back to the 
zoe 
thats the zoe christian center a former japanese internment 
camp that is now a homeless shelter 
ms vasquezs mother stepfather and four younger siblings have 
shared crowded rooms there for two years struggling to save enough 
to rent an apartment in town

home to about 150 people mostly couples and single mothers with 
children 
she found it hard to concentrate and took a room in her former 
high school counselors home she finds time to visit her family 
almost daily 
i lived in an unsettled situation for years ms vasquez 
said and i just found i couldnt return to an unstable 
condition 
that lack of balance began when ms vasquez was 2 years old and 
her mother and father separated the mother maria leyva left 
chihuahua mexico bringing her two eldest daughters lupe and 
virginia with her to mirage ariz 
mrs leyva 39 said lupe has loved school ever since she 
entered kindergarten at age 4 mrs leyvas schooling ended with 
fifth grade 
even when lupe was sick she forced herself to go to her 
classes mrs leyva said in spanish she was born to study 
soon little lupe was carrying armfuls of library books home to 
the succession of crowded apartments and boarding house rooms her 
family shared 
mrs leyva met her second husband in the onion fields the 
couple had three children together 
for years the family of seven moved with the crops throughout 
arizona they eventually landed about 60 miles northwest of los 
angeles in oxnard where ms vasquez spent her last two years of 
high school 
this summer ms vasquez works at a bank in the afternoons in 
the mornings she works for the california rural legal assistance 
doing research on the effects of pesticides on farm workers 
shes bright and talkative and has a good incisive mind 
said crla staff attorney marco antonio abarca its funny i went 
to yale and then stanford law school and lupe is one of the 
smartest people i know 
ms vasquez said that even though her freshman year was 
difficult it also was intellectually invigorating and filled with 
new experiences 
she took karate classes she went to parties she visited san 
francisco she heard her first symphony 
getting my independence was the best part she said echoing 
the sentiments of many 18yearolds whove left home for the first 
time now i can come and go as i please

diplomats are suffering from heat thirst 
and isolation at embassies that kept their doors open in kuwait 
city and defied iraqi orders to close 
the skeleton staff at the us embassy was boiling swimming pool 
water to drink and sleeping outdoors at night to keep cool despite 
swarms of mosquitoes according to american civil rights leader 
jesse jackson and others who returned from kuwait sunday 
iraqi troops kept up a menacing presence outside embassy gates 
trapping those inside 30 embassies including the us british 
japanese canadian and egyptian missions 
soldiers took up positions and started cutting water power and 
phone lines aug 24 the deadline set by iraq for embassies to shut 
down and clear out their personnel 
governments reduced staff but ordered diplomats to stay on the 
premise that closing their embassies would imply recognition of 
iraqs claim to kuwait 
the tense 10day standoff has become an endurance test for 
stoic diplomatic staffs holed up in offices lacking air 
conditioning

heavily armed bedouins sit under a 
tent guarding a building identified by a new sign outside as 
housing offices of the kuwaiti governmentinexiles ministry of 
oil 
this is the forward command post for the kuwaiti resistance 
movement its daytoday operations include smuggling ammunition 
and communications equipment into iraqioccupied kuwait kuwaiti 
exiles say 
the saudikuwait border is just three miles to the north 
all the operations to kuwait come via khafji said a senior 
kuwaiti guerrilla leader who spoke on condition of anonymity out 
of fear of iraqi reprisals 
all communications all orders all border crossings you 
saw the trucks the aerials he said 
he said the resistance movement has already recruited thousands 
of volunteers from among the estimated 70000 kuwaiti refugees in 
saudi arabia 
a senior saudi official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said sunday that the kuwaiti resistance is growing in strength 
and stepping up its attacks on the iraqi occupiers 
an associated press reporter visited the kuwaiti resistance 
headquarters last week over the weekend the saudi government 
barred journalists from traveling to khafji without an official 
escort 
the resistance and the kuwaiti army which has offices nearby 
remain loyal to the governmentinexile headed by kuwaits emir 
jaber alahmed alsabah the government is based in taif in 
southwest saudi arabia 
the redgreenwhiteandblack kuwaiti flag flies outside the 
building which is also the new headquarters of the kuwait branch 
of the arabian oil co a concern kuwaiti exiles say is jointly 
owned by the kuwaitis saudis and japanese 
that is somehow appropriate because kuwaits oil wealth 
guarantees that the resistance movement will not lack for funds 
saudi officials estimate that the kuwaiti governmentinexile has 
access to assets worth about 100 billion 
the kuwaiti guerrilla leader said money is not a problem what 
we need is weapons he said 
some arms have been obtained from iraqi defectors he said 
others came from the arsenal of kuwaits national guard which 
kuwaitis broke into a day after the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
the guerrilla leader refused to provide details about us 
assistance to the kuwaiti resistance except to say that americans 
were involved in recruiting kuwaiti refugees for training in saudi 
arabia 
last week several us television networks reported that the 
cia and army special forces troops were helping the kuwaiti 
resistance organize hitandrun attacks on iraqi occupiers 
no americans were involved in the fighting but kuwaiti fighters 
based near the saudikuwait border were reported to be getting 
intelligence weapons radios advice on target selection and 
instruction from us advisers the networks said 
president bush would not confirm directly that his 
administration is supporting the kuwaiti resistance but he said 
in a broad way i support the kuwaiti underground i support 
anybody who can have a hand in restoring legitimacy there to kuwait 
and to getting the iraqis out of kuwait 
the kuwaiti guerrilla organizer said the resistance is still in 
its formative stages it is headed by three kuwaiti sheiks two 
based in khafji and one in hafr albatin to the west near king 
khalid military city a major saudi military base he said 
in addition to coordinating attacks on iraqi troops inside 
kuwait the resistance runs a radio and television station 
guerrillas have also managed to smuggle ammunition into kuwait 
the guerrilla organizer said 
he said and saudi officials confirmed that kuwaiti women are 
playing an active role in the resistance in one instance he said 
a kuwaiti woman threw a grenade at a group of iraqi soldiers 
killing several before she was slain 
the resistance is supported by a network of committees set up by 
kuwaiti exiles in saudi arabia 
anwar alduaij the head of a group assisting kuwaiti refugees 
in khobar 180 miles south of the border said the military branch 
of his organization was registering volunteers wishing to return to 
kuwait to fight the iraqis they are then sent north to infiltrate 
into kuwait 
he said most of the volunteers did not require training since 
most kuwaiti men had served in the national guard and were familiar 
with weapons 
every day we hear of 70 iraqi soldiers being killed by the 
resistance this is correct this is not an exaggeration 
alduaij said 
his figures could not be independently verified

hilary donofrio arrived at wesleyan 
university for freshman orientation last week excited at beginning 
college life 
but she admits the turmoil that kept the exclusive liberal arts 
college in the news much of last year gave her parents second 
thoughts about her choice of schools 
two campus firebombings the slaying of a student activist 
rising racial tensions and publicity about drug use gave parents 
plenty to think about 
i wasnt really disturbed by it but there was a point where 
my father said maybe you shouldnt go there donofrio 18 of 
southport she spoke last week as she waited in line to register 
for classes which begin wednesday 
school officials acknowledge that events of the past year 
contributed to a decline in enrollment thirtysix percent of those 
accepted by the school have enrolled down from 38 percent last 
year or 663 freshmen down from 684 among connecticut residents 
who were closer to the publicity enrollment in this years 
freshman class is down from 71 to 47 
we took a hit but i think its momentary said wesleyan 
president william m chace im just not of the belief that were 
some deeply wounded crippled institution that is worse off than 
other universities 
wesleyan where annual costs for each of the 2700 students will 
top 20000 this year has a reputation for academic excellence 
pursued in a less formal more pastoral setting than its neighbor 
to the south yale university 
but school last year began inauspiciously with news stories 
about an unofficial annual rite of passage at wesleyan a 
marijuanasmoking bash some students asserted that the 
administration looked the other way when it came to drug use 
something school officials vehemently denied 
the campus was outwardly quiet until april when the firebombing 
of chaces office fomented simmering racial tension a second 
firebombing at the wesleyan boathouse followed a few weeks later 
several students including nicholas b haddad a 21yearold 
sophomore from lebanon charged that the administration and local 
police unfairly singled out black students in their investigation 
of the firebombings 
tensions increased when racial slurs were found spray painted in 
the basement of the malcolm x house a residence housing 26 black 
students some students staged demonstrations including a nineday 
hunger strike to protest the universitys minority policies 
just when the summer break promised a respite haddad was found 
shot to death in a hartford park a cache of weapons in his car 
police concluded he was slain by two men with whom he was setting 
up a drug distribution ring 
among those charged in haddads death was kumar viswanathan the 
21yearold son of tanjore viswanathan an adjunct professor at 
wesleyan and a prominent musicians 
then viswanathans cousin sudhama ranganathan 18 was charged 
in the firebombing of chaces office his late father also was a 
faculty member at wesleyan 
chace said last week that the school is addressing student 
concerns over minority issues it has hired boosted minority hiring 
and received a 100000 ford foundation grant to develop new 
courses in multiculturalism freshmen attended discussions on race 
relations during orientation week 
but some students say the school may have a hard time returning 
to its former calm 
i thought when we returned in the fall things would have 
mellowed out but with the murder of nick haddad there will still 
be some tension here said christina daly a sophomore from 
middletown ny 
other students said they are optimistic that last years turmoil 
wont spill over into the new school year 
last year a lot of consciousness was raised and people are 
talking more than they used to said liz martin a senior from 
barre vt 
donofrios mother margaret said she and her husband no longer 
have reservations about their daughters attending wesleyan 
im really not worried because most of the things that 
happened seemed limited to a few people she said the students 
seem to be able to roll with it and handle it

for abc sports announcer al michaels the 
arrival of brent musburger from cbs this spring was nothing to 
worry about although there was speculation that musberger might 
unseat michaels as abcs top announcer 
hey that was the last thing i had to worry about really 
michaels said in this weeks tv guide my contract specifies what 
events i do its locked in 
brent is a great addition for abc and theres lots for him to 
do college football spring football golf bowling a lot of 
stuff 
michaels is perhaps best known as host of monday night 
football and for his announcing during the 1980 olympics when the 
us hockey team upset the soviet union and during the earthquake 
that interrupted the 1989 world series 
its such an irony that a guy who so loves baseball is best 
known for a hockey game and an earthquake he said

mikhail gorbachev has been a lead player on the 
stage of history for years so maybe its appropriate that that he 
will soon be portrayed on a real stage 
moscow gold opening in london later this month will bring 
to theater audiences an array of communist giants from lenin to 
the presentday soviet president to be played by david calder 
the play was written by london playwrights howard brenton and 
tariq ali who were responsible for last years iranian nights 
about the plight of author salman rushdie under moslem death threat 
calder says the play treats gorbachev as someone on whom the 
fickle finger of historical fate suddenly lands rather than a man 
of ambition desperate to get into the old lenin seat

japan and the soviet union hold toplevel talks 
this week amid growing willingness on both sides to improve 
relations even if a stubborn 45yearold land dispute remains 
unresolved 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arrives tuesday for 
talks with his japanese counterpart and japanese prime minister 
toshiki kaifu 
moscows ties with japan have not kept pace with its improving 
relations with western countries this is because of continuing 
bitterness over a group of small islands off northern japan seized 
by soviet troops in the final days of world war ii 
for years japan has demanded that the islands be returned the 
two countries never formally signed a treaty ending world war ii 
hostilities as a result of the dispute 
but both sides now say they are willing to discuss a broad range 
of cooperation while continuing their negotiations on the 
territorial question 
theres definitely been a shift said george komarovsky 
counselor at the soviet embassy in tokyo 
we have begun to find a common language he said in the 
recent past when the two sides met they talked only about the 
territorial problem and there was only confrontation now there is 
a very constructive dialogue on international relations and on 
many issues our positions are identical 
that view was echoed by a japanese foreign ministry official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
we consider a solution of the border issue as being the most 
important goal but at the same time we have made it clear that we 
are not saying that japansoviet relations consist only of this 
single issue the official said we are prepared to find other 
common areas where we can make progress 
in another sign of change kaifu directed japans defense agency 
to delete references to a soviet threat in its annual policy 
paper due out this month kyodo news service reported monday 
shevardnadzes talks with foreign minister taro nakayama and 
kaifu are expected to focus on preparations for a visit by soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev next year the first by a soviet leader 
japan has proposed 10 areas in which agreements could be reached 
during the visit including economic technical and cultural 
cooperation and assistance to victims of the chernobyl nuclear 
power plant accident the foreign ministry official said 
japan has indicated its willingness to provide technical support 
for gorbachevs reforms in areas such as management training said 
the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
shevardnadze is expected to ask that soviet banks be allowed to 
open branches in japan and to seek japanese joint ventures in the 
soviet union 
he also is likely to ask for japanese participation in a new 
collective asian security organization details are expected to be 
outlined in a speech the soviet official is to give in the eastern 
soviet port city of vladivostok before his arrival ministry 
officials said 
some analysts predict the soviet union will urge japan to join 
the security arrangement in exchange for a withdrawal of soviet 
troops from the contested islands 
the two sides also are likely to discuss the middle east crisis 
cambodia and tensions on the korean peninsula japanese and soviet 
officials said 
in meetings in china last week shevardnadze and chinese foreign 
minister qian qichen urged that force be avoided in the gulf 
shevardnadze is likely to make the same point with japanese 
officials

presidents george bush and mikhail s gorbachev 
plan an informal meeting in helsinki focusing on the persian gulf 
and other issues without the theatrics of previous summits a 
soviet spokesman said monday 
the summit proposed by bush will build on the personal rapport 
the presidents established at previous meetings foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady gerasimov told a news briefing 
such personal meetings both presidents believe offer a 
unique possibility to compare notes on the fastchanging situation 
grasp each others reasoning better and consequently help enhance 
constructive trends and neutralize negative developments in the 
world today gerasimov said 
the first summits they were to establish personal relations 
and to discuss things in general terms but now they have concrete 
business what to do in the persian gulf what to do with our arms 
talks in vienna and geneva what to do with germany 
gorbachev and bush will meet in the finnish capital for one day 
with only their foreign ministers and chiefs of staff gerasimov 
said he said the presidents discussed the possibility of holding 
such meetings on short notice with no formal agenda during their 
talks at camp david in june 
the concept of promptly arranged trustful contacts at summit 
level fits in perfectly with the new fiber of sovietamerican 
dialogue based on the renunciation of cold war stereotypes he 
said 
the soviet spokesman said relations between moscow and 
washington are moving away from theatrics to really a working 
level when the leaders meet not to exchange compliments not to 
organize a mutual admiration society but to talk business and 
now they have business a lot of business 
gerasimov said he doubted gorbachev would try to contact iraqi 
president saddam hussein before the summit he said moscow has not 
been asked to play a mediating role in the crisis that began with 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the last of the 941 soviet women and children stranded in iraq 
returned to moscow on monday but gerasimov said he did not know 
when about 7000 soviet men remaining in iraq could be evacuated 
he acknowledged the continued presence of 193 soviet military 
advisers in iraq was embarrassing but said removing them was a 
very delicate situation for us 
the military experts have been training iraqi soldiers how to 
use sovietbuilt weapons and repairing and maintaining those 
weapons soviet officials insist they were not advising baghdad 
about the invasion of kuwait 
its an unhappy situation that we have so many soviet experts 
there but we started this in 1972 when we signed a treaty of 
friendship and cooperation with iraq and they asked us to send 
advisers to many places gerasimov said

president bush is dispatching two highlevel 
missions this week on a global search for billions of dollars to 
support the economic and military campaign against saddam hussein 
a strategy some say is unbecoming of a superpower 
one delegation led by treasury secretary nicholas brady leaves 
tuesday for stops in paris london seoul south korea and tokyo 
passing the plate in search of as much as 25 billion to help 
defray the expense of the american troop deployment and to aid 
nations suffering hardships from the economic embargo against iraq 
secretary of state james a baker iii leaves later in the week 
on a similar whirlwind trip looking for assistance in the capitals 
of oilrich persian gulf countries 
bush announced the burden sharing effort just last thursday and 
on monday officials were still scrambling to put together 
itineraries for the hastily scheduled trips 
the fact that bush was sending two of his closest cabinet 
advisers served to emphasize the importance the president was 
attaching to the task of getting other countries to share the 
burden however administration officials conceded that the sales 
job was not going to be easy 
bushs effort has also raised questions about the propriety of 
issuing a global call for donations to support the us military 
critics charged that it left the appearance that americas soldiers 
are up for hire as mercenaries 
i dont want to leave any impression in the world that we pay 
for our soldiers and our sailors if we send them into another part 
of the world only through another countrys money said sen 
patrick leahy dvt this is not a rent military its not a 
mercenary force 
leahy said a better approach to take would be to boost taxes if 
necessary to pay for the persian gulf buildup 
bush has vigously rejected suggestions that putting pressure on 
the allies for money to support the us military was improper and 
he has received support for this position from other members of 
congress 
the japanese have a hell of a stake in this and they ought to 
pay a hell of a share said sen frank lautenberg dnj 
many congressmen noted that japan and many countries in europe 
are more dependent on the flow of oil from the persian gulf than 
the united states is 
still many private analysts saw the pledgeseeking missions as 
stark examples of where americas global fortunes now stand 
as the worlds largest debtor nation burdened by huge trade and 
budget deficits the united states no longer has the economic 
muscle to go it alone 
we are no longer the economic super power we used to be 
said lawrence chimerine of the economic strategy institute a 
washington research organization our changing role in the world 
economy is clearly in evidence here 
in launching the burden sharing initiative last week bush 
maintained that the shape of the postcold war world was at 
stake in the persian gulf crisis 
c fred bergsten a former treasury department official in the 
carter administration said that bushs hasty effort could well 
serve as a prototype for future global cooperation in which the 
us military would stand ready to preserve peace with financial 
backing from other countires 
bergsten said that a more formal agreement perhaps under the 
auspices of the united nations may evolve from the current 
conflict with the expected contribution from each country spelled 
out more clearly in advance of any conflict 
that would relieve one of the problems in the current crisis in 
which many us allies have been slow to make economic commitments 
while it is recognized that germany is facing huge costs in the 
reunification effort in its country critics contend that the 1 
billion pledged so far by japan stops far short of what that 
country should be doing 
however a more formal arrangement that committed the united 
states to putting us soliders in harms way to police the worlds 
hot spots would raise political opposition bergsten concedes 
some americans are not going to like that because it sounds 
like we are mercenaries bergsten said but the fact is that 
the world is an insecure place and we have the military capability 
to make a difference

with corn borers in the corn bread and 
crickets in the chocolate there must be fly in the ointment at 
iowa state university 
but not so say the entomologists their insect horror film 
festival at the ames campus this week is designed to give bugs a 
better name not to mention a better flavor 
not only can you see how bugs are portrayed in bad movies but 
there will be treats for those with enough intestinal fortitude 
to try chocolate covered grasshoppers or roasted larvae 
those who prefer their bugs on the hoof will delight in a 
petting zoo featuring cockroaches drone bees tarantulas giant 
walking sticks water beetles and dragonfly nymphs for some 300 
guests there will be praying mantises to take home 
when we think of bugs we tend to dwell on those insects that 
we dont like or make us uncomfortable said john obrycki an 
entomology professor 
insects get a lot of negative press 
thats especially true in iowa where farmers are on a mission 
to stamp out bugs 
yes there are pests said obrycki but when you go out 
and try to kill all the bugs in a field youll kill far more good 
ones than bad 
but that wisdom hasnt sunk in for adults he said hence the 
horror show which runs thursday through saturday 
in kids films bugs are mostly friendly jiminy cricket type 
stuff and honey i shrunk the kids he said ive taken 
2inchlong cockroaches into first grades and the kids love it 
they all want to hold it 
but you take the same insect into the undergraduate class i 
teach here most people would just as soon not handle it he 
said i dont know where the dividing point is but somewhere 
along the line we learn not to like insects 
especially not for meals but theres nothing harmful about corn 
borers roasted and ground up as a flour substitute he said 
and well have garlic fried larvae that you find on clover 
leaves said entomology undergraduate student cynthia lidtke 
what kind large green and yellow ones she said i gave some 
to my daughter and she thought they were good 
the festival kicks off thursday with an itch in time a 
cartoon featuring a singing flea two bug cartoons will be shown 
before each feature things like the fly bug and them

ethnic albanians staged a general 
strike monday to protest serbian rule in kosovo province in 
defiance of warnings that they would face suspension or lose their 
jobs 
we are striking to show how we feel about the bad situation in 
kosovo for albanians said salem lepaja a university lecturer 
the strike was called by independent trade unions set up 
recently by kosovos 19 million ethnic albanians who make up 90 
percent of its population 
serbias communist government took administrative control of 
kosovo last spring saying it had to abolish the provinces 
autonomy to protect the serb minority from alleged harassment by 
the majority ethnic albanians 
in july the kosovo parliament proclaimed the provinces 
independence from serbia which reacted by dismissing the lawmakers 
streets in this provincial capital were virtually deserted 
monday almost all shops were closed pristinas usually lively 
bazaar was deserted with empty stalls the previous days trash 
strewn about and a big metal gate chained shut 
there were no reports of violence last week serbian 
authorities said 21 police and scores of demonstrators were injured 
in clashes with thousands of ethnic albanians waiting for a us 
congressional delegation investigating charges of human rights 
abuses 
the delegation headed by sen robert dole a kansas republican 
criticized what it called a systematic pattern of violating the 
rights of albanians 
trade union leaders asked us not to go out to avoid conflicts 
with the police lepaja told journalists in his home near the 
center of the city 
we all expect we could lose our jobs he said adding that 
his wife who works for a state firm had already emptied her desk 
because she is convinced she will be fired tomorrow 
but albanians are ready for sacrifices the community has 
never been so united before lepaja declared 
officials of serbias provisional government in kosovo said any 
ethnic albanians absent from work in state companies on monday 
faced dismissal they threatened to replace them with workers 
brought in from serbia 
ethnic albanian managers and experts responsible for vital 
services will be replaced and suspended for taking part in the 
walkout the tanjug news agency quoted momcilo trajkovic serbias 
vice premier in charge of the economy as saying 
disciplinary and other legal measures will be taken against 
all strikers and energetic actions will be implemented against 
the owners of private shops and groceries that fail to open 
trajkovic said 
kosovo was the core of serbias medieval kingdom and has strong 
sentimental value for most serbs 
serbian leaders contend that if it were given sovereignty it 
would secede and merge with neighboring albania 
more than 60 ethnic albanians have died in the province in the 
past 18 months during protests against serbian dominance 
the bloody riots a wave of arrests of ethnic albanians and 
other serbian policies have drawn strong protests from 
international human rights monitoring groups

an exkgb general who alleged the secret police 
agency continues to spy on soviet citizens scored a decisive 
victory in a runoff election for a seat in the soviet parliament 
officials said monday 
oleg kalugin won 579 percent of the vote in sundays voting for 
the seat in the southern russian province of krasnodar about 750 
miles south of moscow said vladislav busheyev chairman of the 
regional election commission 
kalugin defeated nikolai gorovoi an agricultural official who 
won 392 percent of the vote busheyev said in a telephone 
interview 
my election victory is a manifestation that the revolutionary 
process is shifting from the center to the provinces kalugin 
told the independent interfax news agency 
the win ensures that kalugin will have broad immunity to 
continue criticizing his former employers without fear of 
prosecution 
kalugins campaign focused on his allegations that the kgb 
continues to tap telephones infiltrate trade unions and the 
russian orthodox church and play dirty tricks abroad despite a 
campaign to shed its image as an instrument of purges and 
repression 
kalugin 55 was dismissed and stripped of his rank after going 
public with his accusations in june the soviet prosecutor has been 
investigating him since july 17 under a law against divulging state 
secrets but no formal charges have been filed 
as an elected lawmaker kalugin cannot be prosecuted on criminal 
charges without the agreement of the soviet legislature 
the former major general was a kgb agent in the united states 
from 1958 to 1970 first under the cover of being a radio moscow 
correspondent and later as a first secretary in the soviet embassy 
in washington 
the kgb and its supporters tried to discredit kalugin before an 
initial vote was held last month in krasnodar an agricultural 
region along the black sea kalugin outpolled 20 other candidates 
but did not win the required majority 
kalugin told the independent news agency interfax on monday that 
kgb agents were very active in krasnodar and followed his 
campaign workers 
on saturday the kgb accused him of slander for saying that two 
people who had once worked as assistants to kgb chairman vladimir 
kryuchkov and his deputy chairman viktor grushko later defected 
kalugin made the allegations friday night on the popular television 
program vzglyad or viewpoint 
the kgb called it another slanderous allegation by oleg 
kalugin in a statement released by tass the kgb also said it 
is impossible to bypass the fact that many statements by kalugin 
betray striking affinity to numerous statements by one of the 
defectors 
the kgb said neither kryuchkov nor grushko ever had assistants 
who betrayed their country 
krasnodars seat in the national congress of peoples deputies 
which meets twice a year was vacated by ivan polozkov who left to 
become the communist party chief of the russian republic

soviet citizens are used to waiting in line for 
bananas paying under the table for meat and using ration coupons 
for sugar but bread that staple of the russian diet was always 
fresh and plentiful 
now that has changed on monday soviets lined up for bread at 
stores across moscow for the first time in years 
many were grumbling blaming president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms for shortages of a growing list of products that includes 
tobacco paper cheese and gasoline 
russian bread which is chewy but wholesome and cheap because of 
government subsidies had been one of the few products soviet 
consumers could count on the last time people remember long bread 
lines was under premier nikita khrushchev who was ousted from 
power in 1964 
thats perestroika were not moving forward were going 
backward said viktor lyubeznov a 52yearold electrician who 
went to four moscow bread stores before finding a loaf 
now we think freely we speak freely but the economic 
situation is more severe than ever said irina samoruppa 65 
the shortage could undermine support for the political and 
economic reforms known as perestroika initiated by gorbachev 
inside moscows bread store no 150 on monday tempers flared as 
customers accused saleswomen of saving the last few loaves of white 
bread for themselves 
look comrades they have more left back there they just 
wont sell it one woman cried 
you dont know what youre talking about so just be quiet 
answered a husky saleswoman in a white apron 
outside people stood in clusters commiserating and arguing 
never in my life have i ever had to search for bread before 
said anatoly znamensky a 66yearold retired taxi driver 
vegetables fruit cheese butter meat they appear and 
disappear but with bread there was never a problem until now 
everything will be fine said mrs samoruppa it isnt 
possible for this to continue very long 
anythings possible you cant rule anything out anymore 
said valery myutek 
the bread shortage which began late last week and worsened over 
the weekend appeared to be limited primarily to moscow although 
bread rationing has been introduced in tarusa a small city to the 
south 
the newspapers moskovskaya pravda and izvestia said the 
capitals bakeries were unable to keep up with the sudden rise in 
demand when residents returned from their traditional august 
vacations 
the problem is not a lack of grain a record harvest is expected 
this year 
izvestia said the bottleneck is moscows central bread bakeries 
which have undergone little expansion or modernization since the 
1950s when the population was about half the current 88 million 
the shortage could be especially hard on the citys retirees 
some receive pensions of only 48 to 96 a month and survive 
largely on bread which costs just 11 to 18 cents a pound 
depending on the variety 
the lack of bread comes on the heels of a summerlong shortage 
of tobacco which led to street demonstrations in moscow strikes 
in other russian cities and a riot in siberia 
in addition gasoline has become hard to find hard cheese has 
virtually disappeared from stores in moscow in recent weeks as 
school reopened shelves were bare of the notebooks children are 
required to use in class 
of all the shortages however bread is potentially the most 
politically troubling if only because of its historical symbolism 
when lenin returned from exile to lead the revolution in 1917 his 
slogan promised communism would bring peace land and bread

a former cia agent embroiled in the irancontra 
affair goes on trial tuesday in a case expected to shed light on 
who made how much in the secret arms supply network to iran and the 
contra rebels in nicaragua 
thomas g clines who retired from the cia in 1978 after a 
29year career is accused of underreporting his earnings from 
arms sales on his 1985 and 1986 tax returns he also is charged 
with failing to tell the internal revenue service about overseas 
bank accounts 
clines of middleburg va pleaded innocent march 9 to all four 
counts if convicted of all charges clines could be fined up to 1 
million and sentenced to 16 years in prison 
as ive said in open court we thought the case should never 
have been brought said clines attorney paula m junghans he 
intends to defend it vigorously 
she declined to comment further 
prosecutors contend clines reaped about 882000 in commissions 
for helping buy and sell arms to iran and the contra rebels 
fighting the marxist sandinista government in nicaragua some of 
the money was kept in a foreign account codenamed ctea 
according to the congressional irancontra report issued in 
november 1987 
clines was in the arms business with richard v secord a 
retired air force major general and albert hakim an iranianborn 
businessman the indictment said 
the business allegedly operated in 1985 and 1986 it was 
directed by former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
retired marine lt col oliver l north a former national security 
council aide court papers said 
north and poindexter played critical roles in providing the 
funds that clines hakim and secord used to pay for the weapons the 
contras eventually received according to court documents 
those funds also provided the source of the profits that 
clines and his partners kept which are at the heart of this case 
prosecutors claim evidence will show that clines received about 
423000 in 1985 and 459000 in 1986 
clines reported gross receipts of 265000 for the tax year 1985 
and 402513 for 1986 the indictment said 
hakim who managed bank accounts in the irancontra affair is a 
key witness in the case against clines 
hakim pleaded guilty nov 21 1989 to a misdemeanor of 
supplementing norths salary he was sentenced in february to two 
years of supervised probation and was fined 5000 
hakim was a principal shareholder of lake resources inc a 
company that pleaded guilty to stealing government property that 
was done by diverting the proceeds from arms sales to iran to the 
contras 
the government also is expected to put secord on the stand 
secord pleaded guilty nov 8 1989 to one felony count of making 
false statements to the irancontra congressional committees he 
was sentenced in january to two years of probation 
clines worked for the cia as an agent in southeast asia and was 
involved in the bay of pigs invasion in cuba he became director of 
training in the directorate of operations also known as the 
clandestine services 
in 1984 clines pleaded guilty on behalf of a company he owned 
to overcharging the defense department for shipping military 
equipment to egypt he was fined 10000 
in a plea agreement in richmond va clines also agreed to pay 
100000 in exchange for assurances that he wouldnt be sued for up 
to 8 million his company allegedly overcharged the government

the capture of a jail escapee has provided 
leads in the search for a second escapee and the woman guard who 
investigators believe is romantically linked to him authorities 
said monday 
james v barnes 35 of romney was captured sunday night in a 
vacant vacation home said west virginia state police cpl ee 
bolyard he escaped early wednesday from a jail in cumberland md 
30 miles to the north 
about 15 law enforcement officers surrounded the house and a 
police dog and its handler who entered through a window found 
barnes hiding behind a door said maj gary simpson of the allegany 
county sheriffs department in maryland barnes was treated for a 
bite from the police dog 
barnes waived his right to fight extradition and was being held 
in the hampshire county jail until he could be taken back to 
maryland 
barnes and edgar eugene kerns jr 30 escaped from their 
maximumsecurity cells at the allegany county detention center in 
cumberland another prison guard watched them take guard sandra kay 
beeman with them grabbing her neck in a choke hold 
at first authorities regarded beeman as a hostage although they 
wondered how the men armed just with hard objects in white socks 
were able to force beeman to open two sets of locked doors 
then on saturday the 46yearold guard telephoned her daughter 
in frostburg md to tell her im fine im with him 
a warrant charging beeman with aiding in the escape a felony 
that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years was issued later that 
day 
the capture of barnes clears up who beeman is with simpson 
said barnes told authorities kerns and beeman were together when 
the trio separated earlier in the week 
statements by barnes confirmed police beliefs that kerns and 
beeman are romantically linked simpson said barnes also provided 
new leads about where the pair may have headed simpson said 
barnes had been sentenced to 50 years in prison in virginia for 
rape kidnapping and robbery he entered the cumberland jail feb 
14 to await trial for rape kidnapping and assault with a deadly 
weapon a knife 
kerns of martinsburg wva had been in the cumberland jail 
since jan 13 he was awaiting sentencing on charges of grand 
larceny and writing bad checks he had been charged with assault 
for allegedly beating his wife but that case wasnt prosecuted 
because she declined to testify authorities said 
on the night of the escape coworkers said beeman asked an 
officer to pick up dinner from a nearby carryout restaurant 
leaving beeman and another guard on duty beeman then went upstairs 
for a routine round carrying keys to all the cells a breach of 
policy 
the two men who had been in maximum security cells and beeman 
walked downstairs and through a series of doors including one that 
was supposed to be locked at all times 
the men threatened the other officer who locked herself in a 
bathroom coworkers said 
the three then left in beemans car 
ive known kay said allegany deputy craig allen robertson 
the detective in charge of the case she was a friend of mine 
but now shes crossed a border it makes it very hard

the session lasted about 10 hours said the source who spoke in 
a telephone interview from the mongolian capital on condition of 
anonymity 
everyone really felt free to get up and speak their piece and 
did so he said 
the source said the leader of the communist party formally 
called the mongolian peoples revolutionary party nominated 
ochirbat and the opposition social democratic party seconded the 
nomination he said ochirbat will be sworn in tuesday

ochirbat a former mining engineer was trade minister when 
first named president last march during a leadership shuffle forced 
by months of prodemocracy protests

countries outside the soviet bloc to which mongolia has belonged 
since a 1921 communist revolution he came to china in may to 
normalize relations after many years of coolness caused by the

of the opposition party members changed the atmosphere of the 
entire legislature 
it clearly was a departure from previous hurals everybody

an influential shiite moslem leader on 
monday ruled out any quick release of the six american hostages in 
lebanon but indicated seven europeans could soon be freed 
if there is going to be a hostage release it will be 
europeans not americans hussein musawi said in baalbek a town 
in eastern lebanon 
the united states has spearheaded the wests occupation of 
saudi arabia after iraqs invasion of kuwait and that eliminated 
the chance of releasing american hostages in lebanon this year 
musawi told reporters 
musawi heads a prosyrian wing of hezbollah or party of god 
the reputed umbrella for extremist shiite moslem factions in 
lebanon he is said to be the mentor of proiranian shiite factions 
believed to hold the hostages 
there are four britons two west germans and an italian in 
addition to the six americans held in lebanon 
he was commenting on reports published in beirut newspapers 
quoting unidentified lebanese sources close to iran as saying all 
13 western hostages including the americans would be freed by the 
end of the year 
these reports quoted the sources as saying backstage 
negotiations and preparations are under way to free anglican church 
envoy terry waite soon 
barring unforeseen hitches waite will be the next hostage to 
be freed otherwise it will be john mccarthy 
waite 51 was kidnapped on jan 20 1987 after leaving a west 
beirut hotel for a rendezvous with representatives of islamic 
jihad a group that claims to be holding american hostages terry 
anderson and thomas sutherland 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld western hostage in lebanon he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
sutherland was dean of agriculture at the american university of 
beirut when he was abducted june 9 1985 
no group has claimed to be holding waite and none of the freed 
hostages this year has mentioned seeing him in captivity 
mccarthy 33 a british reporter for the londonbased worldwide 
television news was kidnapped april 17 1986 as he drove to 
beirut airport to catch a flight to london 
no group has claimed to be holding him either but several 
lebanese shiite leaders recently asserted that waite was alive and 
well which suggests he is being held separately from the other 
hostages 
five western hostages have been released the past four months 
the first two were americans robert polhill and frank reed 
freed 10 days apart in april 
 
swiss orthopedic specialists of the international committee of 
the red cross emanuel christen and elio erriquez were released 
respectively last month after 10 months in captivity 
 
the latest freed was irish teacher brian keenan who was 
released on aug 24 keenan said upon his release that he had seen 
anderson and mccarthy in captivity and that both were well

young people left the sand and surf 
at the end of the labor day weekend with city officials and 
merchants pleased there wasnt a repeat of last years violence 
some of the young visitors complained much of the fun also was 
missing 
i think ill be in the bahamas next year said tracy jordan 
21 of new york city its just too much trouble to get down here 
and then they kept us from going anywhere 
last year the informal endofsummer party that draws thousands 
of students many from predominantly black east coast colleges was 
marred by violent confrontations between police and young people 
more than 100 stores along the main beachfront avenue were looted 
hundreds were arrested and damage was estimated at more than 14 
million 
this year facing accusations that the city didnt want black 
visitors officials took an active role in planning the weekend 
turnout was low down from an estimated 100000 last year to about 
28000 this year 
the city closed a 200block section of the oceanfront to 
traffic visitors with hotel reservations could drive in but 
others had to walk or take buses 
i think the restrictions have significantly helped in the 
planning of the event said city manager aubrey v watts 
but many of the young visitors complained we couldnt go 
nowhere said 28yearold elaine alexis of new york city cant 
have any fun here theyre just too strict 
jack gravely president of the virginia chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said the civil 
rights group supported the citys control of access to the 
beachfront but was uncomfortable with the high profile of police 
it seemed as if the city had a south african frame of mind 
its sending an ominous message that anytime you have a large 
number of blacks gathering you are under a state of siege he 
said 
hundreds of extra officers were on duty when the weekend 
started but after peaceful nights friday and saturday state 
police scaled back operations 
the violence last year prompted a call for an economic boycott 
of this years party by some blacks and businesses along the 
resort strip reported lower than normal sales on what is generally 
the busiest weekend of the summer 
but for the most part merchants were content 
my business was off but im happy with what we got im glad 
this is over and everybody had a good time said herman davison 
at the showboat bar

about 500 british women and children are expected 
to travel in a bus convoy from kuwait to baghdad on tuesday the 
foreign office said 
once in the iraqi capital they hope to continue overland to 
neighboring jordan or to fly to amman en route home 
a foreign office spokesman said the estimated 500 people will be 
housed in hotels after the halfday journey to baghdad while their 
exit visas were arranged 
we are willing to take any route which we can use to get our 
citizens out any option is as easy or as difficult as the iraqis 
choose to make it the spokesman said 
the british broadcasting service was to transmit instructions by 
radio to those wishing to join the convoy to be at the sultan 
center car park in salmiyah before dawn tuesday carrying one 
suitcase per person plus hand luggage 
they should be prepared for a long journey and take water and 
food accordingly the planned broadcast said 
the foreign office said it knew of 25 british citizens with exit 
visas in baghdad 
it said it was also considering chartering iraqi planes to 
evacuate britons from baghdad were not talking about a ransom 
here to get people out were talking about paying a commercial 
fare the spokesman said 
the government estimates 2500 britons are still in kuwait and 
about 500 in iraq 
an iraqi airways jet that landed in paris london and washington 
on sunday carried 199 britons mostly people detained in kuwait 
the boeing 747 returned to london on monday to pick up about 105 
iraqis in britain 
britain also said it has protested to iraq over the detention of 
seven british men who were held with three americans while seeking 
exit visas for their wives 
the foreign office said the 10 men all employees of the bechtel 
corp were thought to have been taken to civilian 
installations around baghdad after being picked up saturday 
the washington post reported from baghdad that the americans 
were lured from haven at the us embassy when iraqi immigration 
authorities asked them to report in connection with their wives 
exit visas 
the foreign office spokesman briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity said he did not know whether the britons had been in the 
british embassy their homes or hotels 
we have protested to the iraqi authorities both in london and 
baghdad about this said the spokesman 
the foreign office earlier said it was checking reports that 
iraq has banned all foreign flights intending to pick up western 
women and children 
a british airline virgin atlantic said it had been refused 
permission to land in baghdad a french aircraft was also denied 
permission 
virgin atlantic said it would fly a jumbo jet with blankets 
food and medicine to amman on tuesday and fly out about 150 
britons europeans and americans who have fled iraq 
it said the remaining seats would go to egyptian refugees with 
the plane stopping first in cairo the passengers would be carried 
free of charge it said 
virgin atlantic said it was acting on an appeal by king hussein 
of jordan to its chairman richard branson for help in coping with 
the tens of thousands of refugees who have poured into jordan from 
iraq

nasas third countdown for the space 
shuttle columbia and its astronomy mission proceeded uninterrupted 
monday as the space agency aimed for a thursday liftoff 
we want the shuttle columbia and the science payload to be 
right when we launch said vance brand commander of the 
sevenman crew we are enthusiastic about the mission and ready 
to fly it 
the latest countdown began early monday and liftoff is scheduled 
for 120 am edt thursday if the columbia takes off it will be 
the first shuttle launched since hydrogen fuel leaks grounded 
nasas threeshuttle fleet in the spring 
columbia originally was scheduled to lift off with the 150 
million astro observatory in march 1986 however the january 1986 
explosion of the challenger which killed all seven crew members 
postponed all shuttle missions 
columbias launch was eventually rescheduled for may 30 of this 
year but hydrogen fuel leaks halted the countdown 
a month later the atlantis shuttle also was found to have 
hydrogen leaks prompting the national aeronautics and space 
administration to ground the whole fleet atlantis classified 
pentagon mission originally scheduled for july is now set for 
november 
last week communications problems with astros xray telescope 
halted columbias second countdown the launch had been scheduled 
for saturday 
four astronomers on board will take turns operating astros 
three ultraviolet telescopes round the clock but the xray 
telescope has to be managed by computer commands sent from goddard 
space flight center in greenbelt md 
the communication problem was corrected over the weekend when 
workers replaced an electronic component in the 1500pound xray 
telescope anchored along with the ultraviolet telescopes in 
columbias cargo bay a minor software problem was fixed sunday 
the columbia would be the first shuttle launched since april 
when discovery carried the flawed hubble space telescope into 
orbit the stretch between missions is the longest since flights 
resumed in 1988 following the challenger disaster 
a beleaguered nasa has spent the summer also contending with 
hubbles defective mirror and communications problems with the 
venusorbiting magellan spacecraft 
at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in california engineers 
hoped computer commands radioed this week and next would restore 
the magellan spacecraft to normal operation they have not 
determined why the magellan suffered two long communications 
blackouts but hoped its 744 million mission to map venus with 
radar would begin this month 
weve had some trouble but responding to trouble fixing 
problems is our strong suit said columbia test director mike 
leinbach weve been disappointed several times of course but 
thursday morning we hope thats all behind us 
im ready to get this one off the ground and move on to 
discoverys planned flight in october with the ulysses spacecraft 
leinbach said ulysses is to study the sun 
columbias nine to 10day mission will be one of the longest 
since the first shuttle flight in 1981 it also will be the first 
shuttle mission in five years devoted entirely to scientific 
research 
astro will examine some of the hottest objects in the universe 
including a supernova and comet levy which is making its first 
recorded pass through the solar system the observatory will remain 
in the cargo bay and be returned to earth for possible use on a 
future mission

the ruling socialists are offering to 
take a minority share of seats in a new cabinet to induce the 
opposition into joining a coalition government an opposition 
leader said monday 
petar dertliev chairman of the opposition bulgarian social 
democratic party said after meeting with premier andrei lukanov on 
monday that the socialists were willing to accept only 4045 
percent of the positions in a new cabinet 
dertliev also said lukanov a leading socialist had offered to 
freeze his membership in the socialist party 
the meeting created an atmosphere of dialogue between the 
government and the opposition and it gave certain guarantees for 
the civil peace dertliev said 
the socialists are the renamed communist party now dominated by 
the reformers who ousted hardline leader todor zhivkov in 
november the sole exception to the trend away from communism in 
eastern europe they won multiparty elections in june 
but the socialists have seen their popularity plummet since then 
because of bulgarias worsening economy 
many key food and consumer items are rationed and bulgaria has 
placed a moratorium on paying its 103 billion foreign debt the 
socialists newspaper duma said sunday that the country is 
threatened with famine 
president zhelyu zhelev a prominent opposition figure last 
week asked lukanov to form a new government 
the socialists want to draw opposition figures into the 
government because they say comprehensive economic reforms cannot 
be made without broader public support than they alone can muster 
and that no western aid will be forthcoming if the socialists 
govern alone 
the opposition has refused to enter a coalition government if it 
has a minority in parliament 
zhelev last week said an outright coalition is out of the 
question dertliev on monday termed the idea destructive for 
the socialists opponents 
but dertliev said the agrarian party one of the largest 
opposition parties was ready to accept the socialists invitation 
to enter a coalition there was no confirmation from the agrarian 
party 
an opposition spokesman also told reporters that parliament had 
gone into closed session friday to discuss a claim of 
responsibility for a fire that gutted the socialist party 
headquarters on aug 26 
michail nedelchev a spokesman for the union of democratic 
forces a coalition of opposition political parties told reporters 
the claim was made by an anonymous caller to vice president atanas 
semerdzhiev on behalf of a group calling itself the bulgarian 
secret central revolutionary committee 
no information about the committee was available and its claim 
to have set the fire could not be verified 
the party headquarters in downtown sofia was torched during an 
anticommunist demonstration on aug 26 the protesters were 
demanding the removal of the red star the symbol of communist 
oneparty rule atop the building

the supreme court on monday 
overturned charges of nepotism and abuse of power against ehsanul 
haq piracha who was deputy finance minister under ousted prime 
minister benazir bhutto 
president ghulam ishaq khan removed ms bhutto on aug 6 on 
charges of corruption incompetence and abuse of power 
weeks earlier the lahore high court accused piracha of nepotism 
when he granted a relative permission to start a stock exchange at 
islamabad 
the case was a civil matter aimed at stopping establishment of 
the stock exchange no criminal charges were filed 
but the charge was widely used by opposition politicians to 
attack ms bhuttos government that and other allegations prompted 
ishaq khan to dismiss her 20month administration 
the nations highest court disputed the lahore finding saying 
relationship with a director or promotor or a sponsor of a 
publically owned company or a trade organization does not 
disqualify an administrative decisionmaker 
the ruling will make only a minor dent in corruption charges 
leveled against ms bhutto her former cabinet and members of her

mitterrand on monday that jordan is suffering the most in the 
persian gulf crisis sources close to their talks said 
mitterrand pledged emergency aid of 770000 to jordan to help 
ease the crush of refugees from neighboring iraq 
husseins trip on the crisis has already taken him to nine 
countries

support tightening the unimposed economic embargo of iraq to 
include cutting off iraqs land and air links 
if the embargo proves ineffective frances position would be 
to extend it he said on the tv interview show lheure de 
verite 
dumas expressed hope that at the ussoviet summit next sunday 
in helsinki the americans and soviets agree on a solution that 
can be a solution of peace or a solution of greatest 
firmness that is reinforcing the embargo and eventually 
forcible action 
dumas said a joint frenchus command will be set up in 
bahrain just off saudi arabia to coordinate movements of us and 
french fleets 
hussein told mitterrand he was deeply preoccupied that jordan 
is the country suffering the most from the situation sources 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
more than 250000 refugees have poured across jordans border 
with iraq since iraqs invasion jordans resources are severely 
strained trying to provide shelter and food for them 
the aid promised by mitterrand is in addition to about 4 
million granted to jordan by the european community 
hussein a longtime friend and strong ally of iraqi president 
saddam hussein has been criticized for his reluctance to join 
international sanctions on iraq

iraq on monday suspended repayment of its 
foreign debt in response to the united nations trade embargo the 
official iraqi news agency reported 
iraqs outstanding debt has been estimated at 30 billion to 35 
billion most of it owed to the united states britain france the 
soviet union west germany and japan for purchases of weapons 
technology and food 
in another development iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz urged 
countries that have large number of expatriates in iraq to take 
urgent measures to send them food supplies according to ina 
monitored in cyprus 
suffering as it is from the effects of the international 
siege iraq will not be responsible for their suffering resulting 
from the shortages in food supplies aziz was quoted as telling 
cornelio sommaruga president of the international committee of the 
red cross on monday 
ina quoted mohammed mahdi saleh the acting minister of commerce 
and finance as saying the debt suspension would have extremely 
adverse effects on countries and companies incapable of 
withstanding the current situation 
he was referring to the economic difficulties faced by poorer 
countries who count on trade with iraq for generating critical 
foreign exchange 
some countries like sri lanka and jordan have asked the united 
nations to clarify what items are covered by the embargo 
jordan relies heavily on income from iraqi shipments through the 
port of aqaba it has asked for international financial help to 
make up for the loss caused by the embargo 
saleh was quoted as saying compensation is not going to be a 
solution for the economic crisis because it is temporary limited 
and ineffectual for dealing with the losses suffered by these 
countries dragged into the aggressive schemes of the us 
administration 
the un security council imposed the trade embargo aug 6 to 
force iraqi president saddam hussein to withdraw from kuwait which 
he invaded aug 2 and subsequently annexed 
ina said iraq had paid 55 billion on its debt in the first 
half of this year 
saleh a useducated economist said the impact of the crisis 
on the world economy was indicated by us moves to obtain help in 
paying for its persian gulf deployment 
president bush last thursday appealed to prosperous countries in 
western europe and asia to subsidize the cost of un economic 
sanctions enforced by a great fleet of warships in the gulf region 
in his comments to the red cross aziz said he hoped the 
organization would assist the countries involved in taking needed 
measures to supply foreign nationals in iraq with food ina said 
iraq has said previously that should food shortages occur 
because of the un sanctions foreign hostages would suffer the 
same as the iraqi population 
the invasion of kuwait caught about 3 million foreigners in iraq 
and kuwait including about 3000 americans and 18000 other 
westerners

prime minister geoffrey palmer 
resigned tuesday as opinion polls indicated his ruling labour party 
would be routed in next months national elections 
external relations and trade minister mike moore who palmer 
defeated in a party vote when former premier david lange resigned 
13 months ago was named to succeed palmer in the oct 27 
balloting the opposition national party is leading by a large 
margin over the labour party in the latest polls 
moore 41 who in recent months had repeatedly denied he would 
seek to unseat palmer had been ranked third in power behind palmer 
and deputy prime minister helen clark 
moore told a news conference that new zealanders wanted a new 
direction and that his bid for the leadership in no way is a 
reflection on mr palmers service to new zealand 
new zealand with 35 million residents has been hit in recent 
months by a weakness in its general economy and a rise in 
unemployment 
palmer 48 had denied he would step down as recently as monday 
new zealand press association quoted sources as saying he had 
enough support to stay in office but decided to quit because the 
internal power struggle would have devastated the party 
palmer told a news conference he may well have had the numbers 
to remain but i took the view that to have a leadership contest on 
a vote would be destructive it would be divisive that it was not 
in the best interests of the collective 
palmer said ive done the best that i can do and i certainly 
hope that we will improve our fortunes for victory in the next 
eight weeks 
palmer appears ready to leave politics altogether he said he 
would not seek reelection to parliament although he agreed to 
stay on as environment minister a noncabinet position through 
the election 
labour parliamentarians who met briefly tuesday were to meet 
again thursday 
the move comes as labour members have voiced concern they could 
not hold onto power with palmer as leader some have run campaign 
ads without the labour logo 
a radio new zealand poll in late july showed the conservative 
nationals leading by a 46 percent to 21 percent margin over labour 
polls also have shown moore to be leading all candidates for 
prime minister moore was the clear choice too in a survey of 
business chief executives 
some political commentators say labour may even be hard pressed 
to hold onto 20 seats in the 97seat parliament a result that 
could oust several cabinet ministers including ms clark 
labour holds 56 seats the nationals 40 and the breakaway 
leftwing new labour party one the 5monthold green party has 
been running third in opinion polls 
however a large section of voters remain undecided including 
many traditional labour supporters opinion polls in some 
electorates have put the undecided vote at 3847 percent 
labour took power in 1984 ousting the nationals it won 
reelection in 1987 despite losing some support because of its 
deregulation policies 
palmer defeated moore for the prime ministers job at a 
government caucus after lange resigned in august 1989 due to health 
reasons both palmer and moore represent districts in christchurch 
the largest city on new zealands south island 
palmer is a former attorney who taught law at the university of 
iowa and university of virginia 
moore became the youngest person ever elected to parliament when 
he won his first seat in 1972 at age 23 he was ousted in 1975 in 
labours landslide loss but returned three years later

north korean prime minister yon hyong 
muk and 90 of his countrymen crossed the heavily armed korean 
border into south korea on tuesday for a historic visit aimed at 
easing four decades of hostilities 
yon and the six official north korean delegates to the premiers 
talks were welcomed by their south korean counterparts at the truce 
village of panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone separating the 
rival koreas 
a korean proverb says a thousand miles start with a first 
step said south korean unification minister hong sungchul who 
was among those to greet the visitors 
the north koreans were given bouquets of flowers a traditional 
korean gift of friendship and tea before being escorted to south 
koreanmade sedans for a 35mile trip south to seoul 
a military helicopter hovered overhead as the motorcade of 12 
cars and three buses prepared to move south toward seoul 
the group is the first to cross the border since 1985 and only 
the third delegation to travel to the south since the end of world 
war ii in 1945 
south korean prime minister kang younghoon was to meet the 
north koreans at a luxury hotel near olympic park official 
headquarters for the talks 
the premiers meeting is seen as a new phase in capitalist south 
koreas efforts to coax the totalitarian communist north out from 
four decades of isolation and begin a thaw in their cold war 
south korean officials say the meeting will be the first in 
which both sides recognize the legitimacy of each others 
governments north korea has steadfastly refused to recognize the 
seoul government since the koreas established separate capitals in 
1948 
during the visit the north korean prime minister is expected to 
make a courtesy call of south korean president roh taewoo 
possibly delivering a letter from north korean leader kim il sung 
if all goes well a second round of talks is to be held oct 
1619 in north koreas capital of pyongyang 
the korean peninsula still remains in the grip of the cold war 
era that has placed south and north korea in a state of mutual 
distrust and confrontation said unification minister hong 
sungchul spokesman for the south korean delegation 
this continued national tragedy should not be permitted to go 
on endlessly he said every effort must be made to establish 
regular dialogue between the two sides 
the korean peninsula was divided at the end of world war ii into 
the communist north and capitalist south the two sides fought the 
195053 korean war but a peace treaty was never signed 
the border between the koreas remains the most heavily fortified 
permanent demarcation in the world with more than 15 million 
armed men on either side behind bunkers and barbed wire there is 
no travel mail or other communication between civilians of the two 
sides 
stock prices in seoul jumped monday by four percent in 
anticipation of the visit businessmen believe the visit could lay 
the groundwork to joint ventures combining the norths resources 
and cheap labor with south korean capital and technology 
formal talks were scheduled wednesday and thursday and the 
delegation is to return north on friday the schedule also includes 
informal talks and sightseeing lavish dinners a stage show and a 
trip to the national museum which houses relics of shared korean 
history

spree of shootings and robberies sunday night throughout this 
central california city of 350000 people said sgt mike guthrie

confiscated five guns early monday all of those arrested are from 
fresno guthrie said 
each was charged with one count of murder six counts of

one suspect remained at large and additional charges were 
pending against the four held police said 
besides the three shotguns one rifle and a handgun police 
seized crack cocaine from one of the youths guthrie said 
the rampage began after uniformed officers patrolled a 
druginfested west fresno neighborhood called the u said 
guthrie 
five gang members intended to shoot rivals but left the area 
because of the police guthrie said 
after the fatal shooting downtown one juvenile left the group 
guthrie said the other four robbed and shot people along an 
eightmile stretch north to near fresno state university then

the shooting spree was unprecedented in our city he said 
i can recall nothing of this magnitude there very easily 
could have been half a dozen or more murder victims

campus life was returning to normal 
monday for many college students frightened by a string of 
mutilation murders but police warned that the killer could still 
be on the loose 
students returning to the university of florida for the second 
week of classes said they were less worried than they were last 
week by the deaths of five students who were found slain in their 
apartments 
all you can do is be very careful im usually in my room 
before dark said ava a sophomore from fort lauderdale who 
refused to give her last name 
everyone i know is calming down said aaron sotala 20 a 
sophomore from copper harbor mich it has been almost week but 
there is still tension on the campus 
police said they have eight suspects but warned residents 
against dropping their guard 
students should know that the killer has not been apprehended 
the killer is not in custody and assume that person or persons 
is still in the area lt sadie darnell a police spokeswoman 
said monday 
police said an emotionally troubled university of florida 
freshman in custody in brevard county for allegedly assaulting his 
grandmother remained a suspect 
edward lewis humphrey was held on 1 million bond public 
defender jr russo said he would seek a hearing tuesday to request 
reduced the bond 
are we just holding a citizen just because he fits a certain 
mental pychological profile or do they have specific evidence which 
justifies a million dollar bond russo said monday 
lt spencer mann an alachua county sheriffs office spokesman 
said there is a presumption that humphrey is simply the 
suspect in this case he is one of a possible number of suspects 
it is premature to say he is the prime suspect in the case 
the gainesville sun reported monday that humphreys psychiatric 
records were subpoenaed by the task force investigating the 
killings 
prosecutors and humphreys public defender said they likely 
would seek a psychological evaluation of humphrey this week 
humphreys psychiatrist phillip k springer said he opposed 
being legally compelled to turn over the records and didnt believe 
humphreys mental condition should be a basis for suspicion in the 
murders humphrey has been treated with lithium a moodstabilizing 
drug 
brevard circuit judge john antoon signed an order sunday 
allowing investigators to take humphreys footprints to compare 
with those found at one of the crime scenes 
police guarded his apartment over the holiday weekend while 
other officers continued searching a creek behind the apartment 
complex 
police have said the killer or killers spent a lot of time at 
the crime scenes leaving deliberate clues and relishing the 
confrontation with police police have refused to characterize the 
messages other than to say they were not in the form of notes or 
other writings 
the bodies of university of florida freshmen sonja larson 18 
and christina powell 17 were found aug 26 the body of sante fe

government did not intend to fulfill its promise to free remaining

due to the confrontation according to statements distributed 
monday by the official saudi press agency

military moves including kuwait iraq now holds 20 percent of the 
worlds oil reserves the un embargo on iraq and kuwait led to a 
world shortfall of 4 million barrels of oil a day 
diplomats at 30 embassies in kuwait continued to defy iraqi 
orders to close their doors and get out one reason they stood fast 
was that leaving could be seen as implying recognition of iraqs 
annexation of kuwait

iraqi authorities grabbed its envoy and took him to baghdad when he 
ventured out of his embassy troops ring the missions and power

somewhat of a weak link in the enforcement chain

peaceful solution are good are reasonable he said

the sanctions in exchange for freeing japanese hostages 
the report quoted iraqs cultural and information minister 
latif nasif as saying iraq would release japanese if japan resumed 
buying iraqi oil and allowed iraq to buy food and medicine 
jesse jackson who escorted 47 freed american hostages out of 
iraq on sunday cautioned monday against relying solely on military

rival christian forces battled with 
machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades for two hours before 
dawn monday police said 
warring shiite moslem factions meanwhile pledged to observe a 
ceasefire brokered by syria and iran to halt an inconclusive power 
struggle 
police said troops loyal to rebel gen michel aoun clashed with 
lebanese forces militiamen led by rival christian leader samir 
geagea in east beirut and the adjoining 310squaremile christian 
enclave 
they said no casualties resulted 
aoun and geagea have waged an inconclusive battle for control of 
the christian enclave since jan 30 
military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said over 
the weekend that syrian troops and lebanese soldiers loyal to 
president elias hrawi were being deployed around the gateways into 
the christian enclave 
they said the buildup indicates an attack may be imminent to 
drive aoun from the presidential palace in baabda five miles east 
of the capital 
on monday aoun warned opposing troops in a radio address they 
would pay a heavy price if they attacked 
military sources in predominantly moslem west beirut where 
hrawis government is based said about 6000 lebanese troops and 
20000 syrians backed by 300 tanks have been positioned around 
the main approaches to metn province where aoun has been holding 
out with 19000 troops 
the buildup followed a summit in damascus wednesday between 
hrawi and syrian president hafez assad who pledged to help 
lebanons government extend its authority over the whole of lebanon 
aoun refuses to recognize hrawi who was elected nov 24 to 
implement an arab leaguebrokered plan to end lebanons 15yearold 
civil war 
aoun wants a guarantee for withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops 
deployed in lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
the peace plan gives the moslems who make up 55 percent of 
lebanons 4 million people an equal share of power with the 
traditionally dominant christians 
hrawi has fired aoun as interim prime minister and army 
commander but the general refuses to step down 
the ceasefire between rival shiite forces was called at 8 pm 
sunday after meetings between representatives of the iranianbacked

army commanders on monday ordered troops to 
halt their advance on the last stronghold occupied by armed mohawks 
as they tried to persuade the indians to surrender 
earlier monday a shot was fired as soldiers moved through a 
wooded area toward the mohawk positions both mohawk and army 
representatives denied shooting 
the incident took place as a nearly 2monthold standoff wore 
on with troops surrounding about two dozen members of the militant 
mohawk warriors society and 30 women and children holed up in a 
drug and alcohol detoxification center on indian land in the 
kahnesatake settlement 
mohawk warriors with rifles and automatic weapons manned 
foxholes around the center which was encircled by a tight cordon 
of troops armored vehicles and barbed wire 
lt gen kent foster commander for the montreal region told a 
news conference monday the armys next move is to stay in place 
and keep the perimeter closed around the detoxification center 
there will be no more military movement we will stay here until 
this is over 
foster said the army has a phone line open to the mohawks in the 
detoxification center 
he said the commander on the scene brig gen armand roy was 
negotiating with terry doxtater a chief of the six nations 
iroquois confederacy in an effort to persuade the indians to lay 
down their arms 
doxtater described the situation as desperate 
the people of the pines the kahnesatake mohawks are not 
going to lay down their arms if the canadian army moves in this is 
a decision made by the men and the women he said the army has 
created an environment which they hope will trigger the allout 
bloody assault they seek 
another iroquois confederacy chief bob antone said the 
negotiations centered on creation of a native peacekeeping force to 
replace the quebec provincial police in kahnesatake 
the indians have said they will not give up their weapons 
without some guarantees of protection from police reprisals they 
fear the quebec police might seek revenge for the death of a 
policeman in a july 11 clash that triggered the oka standoff 
on sunday about 350 soldiers demolished the last barricades 
blocking access to the kahnesatake settlement and seized control of 
most of it the mohawk militants were confined to a small wooded 
area about the size of a football field around the detoxification 
center 
the indians had erected the barricades at kahnesatake and 
another mohawk community kahnawake in a dispute over plans by oka 
town officials to expand a golf course onto what they claim is 
tribal land 
the barriers had blocked traffic on an oka highway and about 20 
miles to the east on the mercier bridge over the st lawrence 
river connecting montreal with its southern suburbs 
in northern new york mohawks set up a roadblock monday 
afternoon on the international bridge between canada and the united 
states near hogansburg 
the mohawks set up the roadblock on the canadian side of the 
bridge but were persuaded to move by canadian police after about 
an hour according to state police in massena ny traffic was 
impeded on the new york side but was moving again by 1 pm 
at the mercier bridge near the kahnawake mohawk reserve south of 
montreal indian women and children staged a peaceful demonstration 
to support the oka natives 
the army asked quebec transport department employees working to 
reopen the bridge to withdraw and moved three armored personnel 
carriers onto the structure 
later quebec provincial police entered the longhouse a site of 
traditional mohawk government on the kahnawake reserve army troops 
helped cordon off the building but did not enter said an army 
spokesman maj jeanpaul macdonald 
mohawk leaders said several indians were hit by rifle butts and 
injured in scuffles with police who entered the longhouse to 
interrogate the 75 people inside most of them women and children 
police and army officials denied the allegations 
meanwhile mohawks charged that a rockthrowing incident last 
week contributed to the death of 65yearold mohawk joe armstrong 
armstrong was in a convoy of mohawks fleeing the kahnawake reserve 
who were pelted by stones thrown by angry local residents 
armstrong died of a heart attack in a hospital early sunday 
armstrong was not struck but was scared to death said 
kahnawake band counselor hazel lazare he was however already a 
very sick man when his family decided to take him off the 
reserve she added 
the army moved into the kahnesatake mohawk settlement on 
saturday afternoon after factional fighting broke out between 
moderate and militant mohawks 
the dispute over the golf course expansion was solved when the 
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to 
the indians 
but the mohawks seized the situation to publicize a much wider 
range of grievances including demands for sovereignty

pavel lungins movie taxi blues examines 
soviet life at a time when in the opinion of many citizens it 
couldnt be worse 
into a daily mixture of ethnic unrest shortages and a rising 
crime the soviet director has dropped the story of the lovehate 
relationship between a coarse russian taxi driver and a drunken 
jewish jazz saxophonist 
the twohour commentary on the tensions between ethnic groups 
and classes in what was supposed to be a classless society won 
lungin the bestdirector prize at the 1990 cannes film festival 
only days after its premiere last week the film became the 
sensation of moscows fall season 
it depicts the taxi drivers confusion endemic to contemporary 
russians when he realizes a way of life he has been taught was 
superior is in reality backward 
like the acclaimed soviet documentary this is not the way to 
live about a crimeridden society taxi blues could not have 
been shown before glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs policy 
of openness 
a leading moscow theater was sold out for the threeday premiere 
an important drawing card is pyotr mamonov a soviet rock star 
who plays the musician the master of ceremonies at the opening 
described him as the idol of soviet youth 
the predominantly young audience at the premiere seemed to 
regard the film as upbeat focusing on the ultimate success of the 
jewish jazzman rather than the frustrations of the russian cab 
driver 
its about our times and how people are very different but 
everyone lives together said lena a 22yearold in the october 
theater audience 
the movie is to be released in france in september and the 
united states in november 
veteran actor pyotr zaichenko plays the cab driver opposite 
mamonov 
they meet when mamonovs character lyosha rides in the cab 
driven by zaichenkos character vanya shlykov after walking away 
without paying lyosha becomes shlykovs livein slave to work off 
the debt 
as the story progresses they grow to like and understand each 
other but the relationship eventually breaks down first because 
of lyoshas success with shlykovs girlfriend and later over his 
success in the west 
both characters are selfdestructive but the similarities end 
there 
lyosha is a freewheeling individual with antiestablishment 
views whose musical career collapsed because of alcohol he engages 
in such antics as drinking a bottle of cologne in the bathroom and 
romping around naked 
shlykov seeks escape from lifes miseries in body building and a 
simple stern philosophy revealed in his attempt to sober up 
lyosha break your back like every russian fellow 
his crude behavior includes beating up teenagers and drunks and 
forcing his girlfriend to have sex with him on a windowsill 
another dark side of shlykov is his bigotry what are you a 
jew he says when he sees lyosha drinking heavily not believing 
jews have drinking problems 
lyosha rebels against shlykovs attempts to sober him up through 
hard labor and exercise and retorts you cant make an animal 
out of me and youre a goat 
the film explores prejudices and how difficult they make it for 
a soviet who works with his mind like the musician and one who 
does physical labor like the cab driver from getting along with 
each other 
vignettes show a soviet society plagued by alcoholism 
antisemitism and moral decay 
most young people interviewed after seeing the movie sympathized 
with the irresponsible musician rather than the hardworking taxi 
driver 
shlykov is bitter said lalai a 20yearold student he 
doesnt understand that a musician can make money and that music is 
a profession he can only drive a cab 
lalais friend dima noted that lyosha who tours the united 
states was like many soviet cultural figures appreciated at home 
only after his talent is recognized abroad

heavily armed bedouins sit under a 
tent guarding a building identified by a new sign outside as 
housing offices of the kuwaiti governmentinexiles ministry of 
oil 
this is the forward command post for the kuwaiti resistance 
movement its daytoday operations include smuggling ammunition 
and communications equipment into iraqioccupied kuwait kuwaiti 
exiles say 
the saudikuwait border is just three miles to the north 
all the operations to kuwait come via khafji said a senior 
kuwaiti guerrilla leader who spoke on condition of anonymity out 
of fear of iraqi reprisals 
all communications all orders all border crossings you 
saw the trucks the aerials he said 
he said the resistance movement has already recruited thousands 
of volunteers from among the estimated 70000 kuwaiti refugees in 
saudi arabia 
a senior saudi official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said sunday that the kuwaiti resistance is growing in strength 
and stepping up its attacks on the iraqi occupiers 
an associated press reporter visited the kuwaiti resistance 
headquarters last week over the weekend the saudi government 
barred journalists from traveling to khafji without an official 
escort 
the resistance and the kuwaiti army which has offices nearby 
remain loyal to the governmentinexile headed by kuwaits emir 
jaber alahmed alsabah the government is based in taif in 
southwest saudi arabia 
the redgreenwhiteandblack kuwaiti flag flies outside the 
building which is also the new headquarters of the kuwait branch 
of the arabian oil co a concern kuwaiti exiles say is jointly 
owned by the kuwaitis saudis and japanese 
that is somehow appropriate because kuwaits oil wealth 
guarantees that the resistance movement will not lack for funds 
saudi officials estimate that the kuwaiti governmentinexile has 
access to assets worth about 100 billion 
the kuwaiti guerrilla leader said money is not a problem what 
we need is weapons he said 
some arms have been obtained from iraqi defectors he said 
others came from the arsenal of kuwaits national guard which 
kuwaitis broke into a day after the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
the guerrilla leader refused to provide details about us 
assistance to the kuwaiti resistance except to say that americans 
were involved in recruiting kuwaiti refugees for training in saudi 
arabia 
last week several us television networks reported that the 
cia and army special forces troops were helping the kuwaiti 
resistance organize hitandrun attacks on iraqi occupiers 
no americans were involved in the fighting but kuwaiti fighters 
based near the saudikuwait border were reported to be getting 
intelligence weapons radios advice on target selection and 
instruction from us advisers the networks said 
president bush would not confirm directly that his 
administration is supporting the kuwaiti resistance but he said 
in a broad way i support the kuwaiti underground i support 
anybody who can have a hand in restoring legitimacy there to kuwait 
and to getting the iraqis out of kuwait 
the kuwaiti guerrilla organizer said the resistance is still in 
its formative stages it is headed by three kuwaiti sheiks two 
based in khafji and one in hafr albatin to the west near king 
khalid military city a major saudi military base he said 
in addition to coordinating attacks on iraqi troops inside 
kuwait the resistance runs a radio and television station 
guerrillas have also managed to smuggle ammunition into kuwait 
the guerrilla organizer said 
he said and saudi officials confirmed that kuwaiti women are 
playing an active role in the resistance in one instance he said 
a kuwaiti woman threw a grenade at a group of iraqi soldiers 
killing several before she was slain 
the resistance is supported by a network of committees set up by 
kuwaiti exiles in saudi arabia 
anwar alduaij the head of a group assisting kuwaiti refugees 
in khobar 180 miles south of the border said the military branch 
of his organization was registering volunteers wishing to return to 
kuwait to fight the iraqis they are then sent north to infiltrate 
into kuwait 
he said most of the volunteers did not require training since 
most kuwaiti men had served in the national guard and were familiar 
with weapons 
every day we hear of 70 iraqi soldiers being killed by the 
resistance this is correct this is not an exaggeration 
alduaij said 
his figures could not be independently verified

by the time youve pronounced it youve probably hooked a bass 
in this popular fishing spot in southern massachusetts which 
boasts the longest name in the united states also known as lake 
webster its indian name means i fish on my side you fish on 
your side and nobody fishes in the middle 
the lake is among dozens of geographic oddities celebrated in a 
new library of congress exhibition titled a world of names 
which opens thursday through jan 15 
the show marks the 100th anniversary of the us board on 
geographic names the federal authority that has officially 
recognized nearly 7 million foreign and domestic names for use in 
government maps and publications 
if youre an optimist youll feel at home in top of the world 
nm or carefree ariz if youre a pessimist you might be more 
comfortable in lowpoint ill or droop wva 
the romantically inclined will enjoy an odyssey through venus 
texas and romeo mich followed by ogle ky valentine neb 
kissimmee fla romance ark bridal veil ore and blissville

when christmas comes youll find a holiday mood in 836 places 
across america with bethlehem in their names there are a dozen 
places named holly in maryland a town called santa claus in 
georgia and an oregon stream called donner and blitzen 
theres a yankeetown and a crackertown in florida towns called 
laurel and hardy in iowa burns and allen in michigan carpenter

place there youll find towns called loco faker bug tussle cut

ronald grim an official of the geography and map division of 
the library of congress and curator of the exhibition said the 
rich diversity of americas geographic names tells much about the 
countrys history and cultural origins from indians through french 
spanish and english settlers 
some names like the border towns of calexico calif and 
mexicali mexico are artificial some like rome canton and 
stockholm ny are borrowed from the great cities of europe and 
asia many towns were named by postmasters after their wives 
daughters or girlfriends 
explorer john wesley powell named the mesas and buttes of the 
grand canyon for ancient gods and spiritual leaders buddha 
zoroaster wotan isis and vulcan the contours of the rocky 
mountains range in northwest wyoming reminded french explorers of

and mole hill became mountain wva in the mountains of 
southeastern oregon is whorehouse meadow named for frontier

changed its name to naughty girl meadow but local residents 
succeeded in reverting to the original name for historical reasons

bursting from behind a clump of 
shrubs a white chevy pickup roars into the open and drives in 
frantic dustraising circles two truckloads of soldiers chase 
behind their m16s cracking in the desert air 
finally the driver jumps from the pickup and tries to flee on 
foot but the long skirt of his arab dishdasha makes it easy for an 
officer to grab him 
saudi officials staged this episode sunday for visiting 
television crews the idea was to show how saudi arabias frontier 
force catches smugglers and illegal aliens along the countrys 
1600 miles of coastline and 1200 miles of land frontier most of 
it open desert 
in normal times the frontier force spends considerable effort 
tracking smugglers of alcohol illegal in this orthodox moslem 
kingdom 
but these are not normal times in addition to watching for 
smugglers of contraband the frontier force is preparing for war 
its units are the farthest north of any saudi forces ahead of 
the saudi army and right on the iraqi border an officer said 
us troops are further to the south 
although any move by iraqi troops toward the border would 
probably be detected first by radar and other hightech systems 
operated by the us military the frontier patrols have their own 
orders should they encounter any sign of trouble send the alarm 
and get out of the way 
we are the first line we are the human early warning 
system said a frontier force officer who requested anonymity 
he said that in the first days after the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
of kuwait saudi border guards could see the iraqis on the other 
side of the line but they have pulled back and we cant see them 
now he said 
the frontier force is stretched thin of its 25000 members 
about 3000 are assigned to the border in the crisis zone south of 
iraq and kuwait about two per mile according to gen mojab 
alqahtani who commands the force 
at sea the frontier force is using most of its 16 aging 
hovercraft to patrol the coastlines and watch for saboteurs or 
other unusual activity 
in one notable incident earlier this year sea patrols caught a 
greekflagged freighter anchored offshore which was operating as a 
floating liquor store for small boats running the contraband to 
shore 
alcohol confiscated by the frontier force is destroyed under the 
supervision of officials of the force saudi customs officers and 
the muttawa the officially designated islamic religious police

while the middle east crisis will occupy 
center stage when president bush meets with mikhail gorbachev next 
sunday the soviet leader certainly could be forgiven if he also 
tries to steer the conversation around to his own economys 
desperate situation 
gorbachev has been struggling with a myriad of economic problems 
in recent weeks ranging from a continued shortage of consumer goods 
on store shelves to wrangling among competing economic commissions 
over just how fast the soviet economy should move to a freemarket 
system 
gorbachev is appealing for massive financial aid to turn the 
situation around but the united states and many of its allies are 
demanding a look at the soviet balance sheets before they commit to 
any major assistance programs 
many analysts believe those studies especially one being 
conducted by the international monetary fund could prove critical 
in determining the fate of gorbachevs faltering economic reforms 
in announcing the hastily scheduled summit in helsinki finland 
the white house on saturday said it would focus primarily on the 
middle east but bush said the discussions would not be limited to 
that area 
whatever the agenda the summit will allow gorbachev to turn 
briefly to statesmanship and away from his economic problems 
at the last meeting between the two leaders may 30june 3 in 
washington gorbachev stressed the need for western aid to insure 
the success of his efforts to rescue the faltering soviet economy 
bush however has remained opposed to direct soviet aid and 
even the ussoviet trade agreement which the two leaders did sign 
remains stalled awaiting passage in the soviet parliament of 
legislation to ensure free emigration 
the impasse is occurring as the soviet economy continues in a 
steep nose dive the total output of goods and services actually 
shrank during the first six months of the year while the countrys 
trade deficit has more than doubled and both unemployment and 
inflation are up sharply 
the soviet economy is disintegrating said marshall goldman 
the associate director of harvards russian research center 
everybody is standing around watching moscow burn but nobody 
knows what to do about it 
gorbachevs appeals for western aid will be considered this 
month when the imf and its sister organization the world bank 
hold their annual meetings in washington on sept 2027 
no decisions on those appeals are expected from the meetings 
but finance ministers from the 152 nations that make up the two 
organizations will discuss the imfled study which was ordered by 
president bush and other western leaders this summer at the 
economic summit of leading industrial nations in houston 
the study was a compromise between demands by the french and 
west germans for an immediate 15billion aid package and 
resistance to direct economic aid by bush and other summit leaders 
it is scheduled to be completed in december 
the international monetary fund generally is viewed as the top 
cop of international finance its clout stems not just from the 
loans it hands out but also from the fact that other lenders take 
their cue from the fund 
if for example the imf does not approve of a nations plans to 
get its economic house in order that nation has a hard time 
getting credit 
but imf austerity programs have in the past triggered bloody 
riots in third world nations unhappy with the prescription to curb 
runaway inflation 
whether the soviet union with its long history of distrust of 
western capitalism will readily accept imf dictates remains to be 
seen 
the study team faces other formidable obstacles 
there is the question of how to measure the soviet economy 
which operates with a currency that is not convertible into other 
foreign currencies 
while the central intelligence agency estimates that the soviet 
economy was roughly 51 percent the size of americas 42 trillion 
economy in 1989 other experts have attacked those figures as 
grossly inflated and suggested that the total output of soviet 
goods and services is really only onethird that of americas gross 
national product 
the imf study may resolve this debate since one of its main 
jobs will be to conduct an exhaustive look at a host of economic 
statistics these include soviet gross national product trade 
statistics and the amount of hard currency on hand to pay for 
shortfalls between what the country sells overseas and what it 
imports 
for decades the soviet union was considered a good 
international credit risk because the government always promptly 
paid its import bills but because of a widening trade gap the 
soviets have fallen behind on their payments and are seeking trade 
credits from other nations 
west germany already has agreed to 3 billion of such credits 
and other european nations are expected to follow suit 
the bush administration however has so far rejected proposals 
for direct financial aid and instead offered technical assistance 
including advice on improving the collapsing food distribution 
system or how to establish private banking 
but many experts believe that the soviet problems are so severe 
they can be resolved only by a major overhaul of the economy and 
massive economic support from the west 
the soviets face fundamental economic problems that are not 
amenable to quick fixes said jeffrey schott an expert at the 
institute for international economics a washingtonbased research 
organization the question of restructuring their entire economy 
and their distribution system will take quite a number of years to 
accomplish

the countdown began today for nasas 
third attempt to launch columbia with the astro observatory after 
engineers solved the latest problem to befall the mission 
liftoff is scheduled for 120 am edt thursday it will be the 
first shuttle launch in more than four months the longest gap 
between missions since flights resumed following the 1986 
challenger disaster 
its been a long hot summer and were just glad to be 
getting back into the flight business said nasa spokesman dick 
young the shuttle fleet had been temporarily grounded after 
hydrogen leaks were discovered on two of the three orbiters 
including columbia 
nasa decided on a thursday launch after reestablishing full 
contact with the xray telescope inside columbias cargo bay the 
telescope is one of four that constitute the 150 million astro 
observatory 
contact between the instrument and launch control computers was 
lost wednesday night after the cargo bay doors were closed and 
nasa scrubbed saturdays launch attempt 
workers installed a new electronic component for the telescope 
inside the cargo bay and finished testing it sunday 
engineers also had trouble verifying the telescopes ability to 
send signals over a radio link that would be used during the 
flight the problem was caused by faulty software and was corrected 
sunday young said 
columbias liftoff would have been delayed until at least friday 
if the problem had not been solved by midnight sunday young said 
thats when workers planned to begin freezing the argon used to 
keep the xray telescopes instruments cold 
columbia was supposed to have gone up may 30 but hydrogen 
leaked during fueling and nasa called off the launch atlantis was 
the next shuttle scheduled to fly but its classified pentagon 
mission was delayed from july to november when it too was found 
to have hydrogen leaks 
columbia returned to the launch pad in august with new hydrogen 
lines 
nasa has not sent up a shuttle since april when discovery 
carried the flawed hubble space telescope into orbit 
columbia has a crew of seven astronauts the largest since 
challenger 
four of the crew members are astronomers who will work in 
nonstop shifts to operate astros three ultraviolet telescopes 
during the nine to 10day mission astro will return to earth with 
the shuttle and might be used again on a later flight 
astro is designed to observe some of the hottest objects in the 
universe including a comet and a supernova it will be the first 
shuttle mission in five years dedicated entirely to scientific 
research

saddam hussein has a fleet of more than 
150 transport aircraft including airliners plundered from kuwait 
that could be used to beat the united nationsordered embargo on 
trade with iraq 
but aviation experts stress that any attempt at airborne 
blockadebusting is fraught with difficulties and dangers for both 
sides 
they note too that an airlift would likely be little more than 
a gesture of defiance because it could never carry enough supplies 
to feed iraqs 17 million people or enough military materiel to 
make a serious difference in saddams confrontation with the west 
the sheer amount of cargo that would be needed to resupply a 
whole country by air is mindboggling said don kerr of londons 
international institute for strategic studies 
you only need to look at the us airlift into saudi arabia to 
get some idea of the logistics and equipment involved and the 
iraqis have nothing to compare with that kerr said in a 
telephone interview 
during the berlin airlift in 194849 the united states and its 
allies flew more than 277000 missions to haul nearly 2 million 
tons of food coal and other lifesaving provisions into west 
berlin after the soviets cut it off 
at the peak of the 15month operation the allied air forces 
were flying 1200 missions a day that carried 13000 tons of 
supplies 
the state department reported last week that iraq may 
increasingly rely on air transport as a means of avoiding the 
tightening naval embargo spearheaded by the us navy 
the washington post reported saturday that north korea and cuba 
have been flying militaryrelated materiel into iraq 
but britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said sunday that 
these flights are not a major problem at the moment one of 
the calculations is that saddam will run out of money to pay for 
such air shipments because the oil trade will be blocked 
kerr and other experts say iraq may be able to maintain an 
aerial lifeline providing us and other members of the 
multinational force enforcing the unordered embargo do not 
decide to begin shooting down transport planes 
us and other warships have un permission to use minimal 
force to prevent ships supplying iraq that could be done without 
causing casualties by shooting off the rudders of blockaderunning 
ships 
but its a different matter in the air 
what do you do if you challenge an aircraft and it doesnt 
turn away said kerr the only alternative is to shoot it down 
and that could cause an outcry with all kinds of moral and 
political ramifications 
it is not clear whether un rules of engagement for enforcing 
the embargo permit firing on aircraft flying into iraq 
but hurd said the british and others are considering how one 
would set about blocking the flying embargobusters 
iraqs staterun airline iraqi airways and arab air cargo a 
freight line operated with neighboring jordan have more than 70 
aircraft between them 
these include boeing 747 jumbo jets that can carry more than 100 
tons and sovietbuilt antonov an24 transports with payloads of 
more than 80 tons 
the iraqi air force has 82 transport aircraft including an24s 
and ilyushin il76s each is capable of carrying 45 tons of freight 
but many would probably be needed for military movements and might 
not be available 
kuwaiti sources in the persian gulf say the iraqis seized at 
least 15 of kuwait airways 21 airliners in the aug 2 invasion 
flying them to iraq 
in theory iraq has the capacity to fly in hundreds of tons of 
cargo a day provided it has friendly countries willing to provide 
airfields and to covertly ship in supplies for baghdad 
jordan is a close ally of iraq and has said it will abide by the 
un sanctions but the jordanians who depend heavily on trade 
with iraq are quibbling about compensation before they lower the 
boom 
yemen another country with strong links to baghdad has said it 
also will adhere to the sanctions but western officials suspect it 
might be a conduit 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi declared saturday that tripoli 
will also comply with un efforts to block oil exports from iraq 
and occupied kuwait but he stressed that it is impossible for us 
in the end to take part in starving people in iraq 
but iraq is ringed by syria saudi arabia turkey and iran 
which if not downright hostile are not disposed to allow iraqbound 
planes to fly through their airspace 
only jordan to the west could provide an avenue for a baghdad 
airlift but would in doing so risk international reprisals

four bestselling authors questioned by tv 
guide couldnt agree on who killed laura palmer in abcs twin 
peaks but say the series better solve the crime in a hurry 
jackie collins andrew m greeley tony hillerman and iris 
ranier dart were asked to pick the most likely villain of the 
quirky show directed by david lynch and set in a sleepy logging 
town in the pacific northwest 
their answers appear in the sept 8 issue of the magazine 
the show that received 14 emmy nominations began with the murder 
of homecoming queen laura palmer and subsequent shows revolve 
around the investigation of her death with a dizzying number of 
plot twists and turns 
it offers an eclectic mix of characters ranging from fbi agent 
cooper a straightlaced law enforcement type who loves cherry pie 
to the log lady a woman who walks around town carrying a log 
greeley the author of the 1990 best seller the cardinal 
virtues believes the killer is dr lawrence jacoby a 
psychiatrist 
laura was driving jacoby crazy greeley said he was 
attracted by her innocence and by her evil 
ms collins author of 12 best sellers that have sold 100 
million copies concluded the killer was sheriff trumans deputy 
andy because he appears to be the least likely 
cooper was shot in the last episode of the past season but ms 
collins said he has to survive 
hes the whole show she said its obvious he wears a 
bulletproof vest because he needs one to hold in his stomach 
hillerman author of coyote waits a current best seller 
believes the killer will turn out to be leland palmer the victims 
father 
its possible that he could have bumped her off in a rage 
after he found out she was working at oneeyed jacks a 
brothelcasino he said 
but hillerman complained that he wasnt sure the shows writers 
have even decided who the killer is 
by normal standards the series is sloppy and inconsistent 
he said twin peaks sets things up and then does nothing with 
them 
ms dart whose best seller beaches was made into a feature 
film starring bette midler came up with the idea that laura was 
the killer and not the victim 
the victim she believes is really madeleine lauras cousin 
laura wanted to come back as madeleine so she could start 
afresh and escape her tainted past ms dart theorized 
greeley ms collins and hillerman all said the mystery has to 
be wrapped up in the first episode of the fall season a twohour 
show scheduled for sept 30 
its not going to be popular with a mass audience unless they 
start coming up with answers ms collins said but they should 
find another murder victim when the killer is identified just to 
raise some doubt

diplomatic exchanges between iraq and britain are 
getting a touch personal 
prime minister margaret thatcher has called president saddam 
hussein of iraq a person who has taken hostages cruelly 
brutally and a person who has hidden behind the skirts of women 
and children 
this man is a loser she added in an interview broadcast 
sunday on britains tvam network 
the iraqi news agency fired back the old hag thatcher seems 
to have been upset by the permission given women and children to 
leave iraq as she had wanted to make an issue of them in her 
electoral campaign 
thatcher would do well to bear in mind that the empire on 
whose possessions the sun did not go down has long been defunct 
and neither she nor any of her allies will be able to set the clock 
back it said 
it referred to thatchers canine harsh voice and empty 
bluster 
the state newspaper aliraq called her a circus buffoon who is 
dancing on american ropes vomiting poison like a spotted 
serpent waging an imperialist zionistcolonialistreactionary 
aggression against iraq 
thatcher the frenzied and corrupt lady does not frighten the 
glorious iraqi knights aliraq editorialized 
in london interviewer david frost asked mrs thatcher whether 
she thought saddam was mad 
calculating not mad she replied fanatical in that his 
personal ambitions must come before everything and everyone else 
and he has no regard for human life or liberty or justice

joseph doherty a folk hero in the 
irishamerican community who has a manhattan street named for him 
could soon be free on bail after seven years behind bars and in 
legal limbo 
dohertys allegiance to the irish republican army and its 
control over his decisionmaking is the focus of a bail hearing 
tuesday it was called by us district judge miriam g cedarbaum 
who is considering a bail request for doherty while he pursues 
political asylum in the united states 
she wants to know what his relationship is if any and if 
hes still a member of the ira and would he follow their orders 
in violation of a bond if it were to be set said dohertys 
attorney stephen a sommerstein 
doherty 35 has been imprisoned in a manhattan jail since his 
1983 arrest in new york he faces a life sentence in the united 
kingdom for the 1980 slaying of a british officer and prison 
escape 
he won a series of court battles in the united states to avoid 
extradition some of which were later reversed by the justice 
department 
doherty has acknowledged that the british officer was killed in 
a gunfight between troops and dohertys fourman ira unit but 
claims the fighting was political 
his lawyers argue he should be freed on bail claiming his right 
to due process has been violated by his lengthy imprisonment 
the constitution just doesnt permit indefinite imprisonment 
under these circumstances sommerstein said 
the us government opposes dohertys release assistant us 
attorney claude a millman argues the government can detain an 
alien who entered the country illegally as a convict 
given the governments substantial interest in assuring 
dohertys availability for deportation it simply cannot be said 
that dohertys detention has any constitutional dimension 
millman said in court papers 
unquestionably dohertys deportation case is of extraordinary 
importance to our foreign relations he said 
sommerstein has proposed a bail package that would allow 
dohertys release on a 100000 bond posted by former city council 
president paul odwyer 
the attorney also has arranged a 35000ayear job for doherty 
at a long island factory sommerstein said other supporters have 
offered to post money and their homes to insure that doherty wont 
flee 
in an effort to establish ties to the community sommerstein 
described in court papers the wide support doherty has received 
from politicians religious leaders and irishamerican 
organizations 
he said doherty had received visits in jail from numerous 
senators and congressmen roman catholic cardinal john oconnor 
the rev jesse jackson and the rev lawrence jenco a former 
hostage in lebanon 
doherty also has been designated honorary grand marshal at st 
patricks day parades across the country new york city gave his 
name to a street near the jail where he is housed 
ive never seen a group of people so incensed at what has 
happened odwyer an attorney said of the irishamerican 
community the constitution is violated in letter and in spirit 
doherty fled to new york in 1982 after more than a year on the 
run in ireland he was arrested by the fbi in 1983 and the british 
government requested his extradition 
earlier this summer doherty won his latest legal victory when a 
federal appeals court ruled that he is entitled to seek political 
asylum in the united states 
the us government is appealing the decision which said us 
attorney general dick thornburgh was improperly influenced by 
political concerns when he denied doherty the chance to show he 
would be persecuted if returned to the united kingdom 
doherty last was questioned about his loyalty to the ira at a 
hearing in 1984 he indicated he still took orders from the ira 
the judge then barred his extradition ruling that the british 
officers killing was an act related to iras political goal of a 
unified ireland 
when asked to characterize dohertys mood going into the 
upcoming hearing sommerstein said joes got no fears stating 
his position

as a young chicago architect in 1902 
frank lloyd wright got a dream job build a house with no limit on 
cost or creativity 
wright spent two years and 60000 planning every detail from 
walls to chairs now nearly nine decades later the state has 
spent three years and 5 million restoring the vision of the man 
who became americas most famous architect 
the result goes on display friday when the house wright designed 
for a wealthy widow opens to the public for the first time since 
1987 
this building is probably the most perfectly preserved of his 
early buildings said site manager donald hallmark literally 
almost everything he designed for it is still here 
the danathomas house named for its owners was one of 
wrights first large homes said wright expert elaine harrington 
curator at the wright home and studio foundation in oak park 
by 1902 the architect was growing in prominence but most of 
his work was still small homes in chicago suburbs 
the building is an example of the prairie style of 
architecture which emphasizes horizontal lines and an open 
flowing floor plan the twostory home looks vaguely like pagodas 
joined by a low walkway coppergreen rain gutters form a prominent 
border to the sloping roof a green plaster frieze runs near the 
top of the walls linking the roof to the pale brick below 
inside low dim rooms will suddenly give way to high ceilings 
and shafts of sunlight rooms seem connected at random with open 
spaces here and sudden turns there 
hallmark said architects usually have limited control over a 
homes furniture and decorations but wright designed everything 
like a composer writing music 
it is a long symphony hallmark said it is probably the 
greatest symphonic collection of decorative art objects that youre 
ever going to find from the early 20th century 
that collection of wright lamps stainedglass windows and 
furniture makes the danathomas house stand out experts say 
not all buildings are allowed to survive with all that 
intact harrington said if youre going to explain the work 
you need as much of that stuff as you can possibly afford 
gov james r thompson was a a chief supporter of the 
restoration the project spent 704000 in privately raised money 
to buy a lamp wright designed for the house the furniture is so 
valuable that its location was kept secret while it was being 
restored 
wright built the house for widow sarah lawrence dana to hold 
lavish parties poet carl sandburg sometimes read his work there 
and dana once held a reception for conductor john philip sousa she 
threw frequent parties one with 1000 guests 
eventually dana was hit with financial and health problems the 
thomas publishing co bought the house in 1944 using it as office 
space but also taking care to preserve the building as wright had 
designed it the house was sold to the state in 1981 for 1 
million a fraction of its value hallmark said

republicans and democratic challengers claim 
they are on their way to upsetting senior senators but the 
prospects are slim that the 1990 elections will alter washingtons 
balance of power 
barring an extraordinary political upheaval on nov 6 president 
bush will spend at least two more years dealing with a congress 
controlled by the opposition democrats 
familiar faces may disappear however democrats say this is the 
year they can defeat sen jesse helms rnc republicans have high 
hopes of unseating sen claiborne pell dri 
major changes are certain to occur in state capitals where 13 
governors are retiring including those in california texas 
illinois and ohio 
when the dust settles in november the most significant result 
of the 1990 elections is likely to be which party won the political 
control in key states to redraw congressional and state legislative 
district lines to conform to the 1990 census 
according to preliminary census figures population trends will 
require shifting 19 house seats before the 1992 elections most of 
the seats will move south and west with california picking up 
seven florida four and texas three new york will likely give up 
three seats and illinois pennsylvania michigan and ohio will 
probably give up two apiece 
the political importance of controlling the redistricting 
process has made the race to succeed republican george deukmejian 
as governor of california the most important race of the year 
democrat dianne feinstein and republican pete wilson are 
spending millions of dollars to blanket california with television 
appeals for support 
the democrats already control the california legislature if 
feinstein is elected governor the republicans will have little 
voice when lines are drawn for the states seven new us house 
seats a victory by wilson would force the two parties to come up 
with a compromise plan 
florida faces a similar situation in which former sen lawton 
chiles and rep bill nelson are competing for the democratic 
nomination to challenge gov bob martinez rated by democrats as 
one of the most vulnerable republican incumbents 
one of the most closely watched senate races is in north 
carolina where former charlotte mayor harvey gantt is running 
neckandneck with helms the republican conservative icon whose 
latest crusade has been an attack against federal grants for art 
work he deems obscene so far gantt who is black has surprised 
observers by the amount of support he has attracted in opinion 
polls 
all told the 1990 numbers look like this 
35 senate seats are up for grabs 18 now held by republicans 
and 17 by democrats the democrats now control the senate by a 
5545 margin the republicans are given a good chance to narrow 
that margin but are considered very unlikely to regain the 
majority they lost in 1986 
the entire house faces reelection and the current democratic 
majority of 257 to 176 isnt expected to change much two seats are 
now vacant 
36 states will elect governors twenty of those now have 
democratic governors 16 republicans nationwide 29 states have 
democratic governors and 21 have republicans eight democrats and 
five republicans are not seeking reelection 
voters also will fill 6262 state legislative seats and elect 
hundreds of mayors including a successor to marion barry the 
embattled mayor of the nations capital awaiting sentencing on a 
misdemeanor cocaine possession charge barry is running as an 
independent for a seat on the district of columbia city council 
all these campaigns are getting into high gear while the 
publics attention is riveted on the persian gulf and the buildup 
of american forces following the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
pollsters and politicians agree there is no way of assessing 
what impact the middle east crisis will have on the november 
elections at the same time they also agree that the threat of a 
desert war is making it tougher than usual for candidates to get 
the voters attention 
iraq knocked everything off the radar screen said ed 
rollins cochairman of the house republican campaign committee 
i dont know where it goes from here he conceded before 
the iraqi invasion rollins said he hoped republicans would benefit 
from an antiincumbent mood that was starting to build and was 
being fed by public unhappiness over the political ties between 
members of congress and operators of savings and loan institutions 
its awful hard to talk about savings and loans when youre on 
the verge of war he said 
whether voters are listening or not candidates are raising 
other issues 
abortion a major issue in the handful of races last year is a 
big concern throughout he country with politicians in both parties 
scrambling to get on what they consider the safest ground 
typical of one approach is the television ad run in ohio by 
democratic gubernatorial candidate tony celebrezze 
i believe you can be personally opposed to abortion 
celebrezze says in the ad while recognizing as i do that 
politicians shouldnt dictate to a woman what choice to make 
his republican opponent former cleveland mayor george 
voinovich countered that celebrezze was completely reversing 
his former strong antiabortion position 
in many highprofile races the two candidates are on the same 
side of the abortion question 
feinstein and wilson in california are both proabortion 
rights as are democratic sen paul simon of illinois and his 
rival republican rep lynn martin and pell of rhode island and 
his challenger republican rep claudine schneider 
republicans say they think the popular 43yearold schneider has 
a good chance to upset pell 71 the patrician chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee

brains and beauty highlight this 
weeks miss america pageant heralding a new era in the 70yearold 
contest better known for skintight swimsuits than generous college 
scholarships promoters say 
competitors for miss america 1991 still spray glue on their 
swimsuits to prevent skin spillover and swab their teeth with 
petroleum jelly to ensure a shiny smile but pageant executive 
director leonard horn said change is coming horn eliminated 
precompetition photo opportunities featuring contestants in 
swimsuits this year and for a second straight year the swimsuit 
competition will account for 15 percent of pageant scoring an 
alltime low 
the swimsuit competition is our achilles heel horn said 
i find it difficult to rationalize putting a young college woman 
in a swimsuit and highheel shoes but it would be folly for us 
to eliminate it unless we can find an acceptable alternative 
the search for such an alternative goes on he said adding the 
emphasis should not be on swimsuits but rather on the 5 million 
in scholarships awarded at state and national levels 
many contestants are working toward masters degrees or 
doctorates he said they range in age from 19 to the pageant 
maximum of 26 the winner receives a 35000 scholarship 
this program is involved in volunteerism and wholesome 
american values that in a world teeming with negativism is one 
little positive light horn said in todays world role models 
are more important than ever 
the pageant is celebrating its seventh decade it was created in 
1921 by local merchants trying to squeeze in an extra tourist 
weekend after labor day 
returning this year is 75yearold bert parks who was fired in 
1980 for being too old to croon there she is to the new miss 
america 
cohost gary collins will still fill that role but parks will 
serenade 26 former miss americas with his trademark song during one 
segment of the twohour production miss america 1971 phyllis 
george joins collins as cohost

vaguely described as messages left by the killer of five 
college students 
investigators on sunday also said they reduced their list of 
prime suspects from eight to four and clues left by the killer are 
helping 
the slayings have terrorized the campus where students are on a 
labor day break until tuesday 
the messages were given to us from the crime scenes said 
police lt sadie darnell the messages are indirect that were 
interpreting to be messages of some importance 
the killer left no notes or other writings she said declining 
to provide further details sheriffs lt spencer mann added that 
no calling cards were found on the bodies its not a 
signaturetype homicide he said 
autopsies on tracy inez paules and manuel taboada both 23 
showed they died of stab wounds similar to those that killed the 
other victims mann said unlike the first three the bodies of 
miss paules and taboada were not mutilated 
mann would not say whether the same weapon was used in all five 
slayings 
police said an ohio fugitive 58yearold warren virgil tinch 
was dropped from their prime suspects list tinch is sought in 
ohio in the stabbing death of a 52yearold woman and is suspected 
of stealing cars in ocala and gainesville a week before the 
killings 
mann would not say whether 18yearold edward lewis humphrey is 
among the top four suspects and would not otherwise disclose who is 
on the list 
humphrey a parttime freshman at the university whom 
authorities describe as emotionally troubled is in jail on 1 
million bail for allegedly assaulting his 79yearold grandmother 
and has been questioned as a suspect 
miss paules and taboada were found tuesday at the apartment they 
shared at a complex where humphrey lived for a few weeks this 
summer a neighbor said humphrey was romantically interested in 
miss paules and often waited for her by the pool 
police took prints of humphreys feet in jail and two officers 
in hip waders sunday used a metal detector to search a creek next 
to his apartment complex darnell said police said all they found 
was an old street sign 
the victims were students at either the university or santa fe 
community college their deaths terrified classmates including 
about 100 who dropped out or transferred 
university president john lombardi said campus security was 
tight 
we believe this community to be as safe as any other 
university community in america he said would i send my child 
back to the university of florida yes i would 
student body president michael browne said that his classmates 
are still afraid but that dropping out would be a mistake above 
all we must not be held hostage to our fears he said giving 
up will not solve anything 
also slain were christina powell 17 of jacksonville sonya 
larson 18 of deerfield beach and christa hoyt 18 of newberry

the government has acknowledged that it is 
instituting food rationing but says iraqis would rather eat mud 
than bow to foreign powers who have isolated baghdad as punishment 
for its seizure of kuwait 
government spokesman naji alhadithi on sunday denied reports 
that the unordered embargo on trade with iraq had caused 
shortages 
he said however that as a precaution his government was 
instituting steps to reduce food consumption 
we have a wartested society we have a wartested economy so 
even if we eat mud we will resist pressure and not kneal down to 
any foreign power he said referring to the eightyear war with 
iran that ended in 1988 
foreigners who left the country reported lines for bread and 
other food 
last week iraqi sources said rationing was to begin sept 1 
but on sunday a shopkeeper said he thought the rationing would 
begin on wednesday it was not immediately clear whether the 
measures affected all of iraq at once 
the embargo backed by a usled armada of warships from 
several countries has halted nearly all of iraqs vital oil 
exports and food imports aiming to force an iraqi pullout from 
kuwait 
alhadithi and information and culture minister latif nasaif 
jasim took a defiant stance in a meeting with reporters on sunday 
saying iraq wanted peace but was prepared for war 
jasim said iraq was not afraid of war with the united states 
which has deployed tens of thousands of troops in the saudi desert 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 he said his country has 15 
million men under arms and 55 million volunteers ready to fight 
during the war with iran hundreds of americanmade planes 
darkened our skies and even our children used to throw rocks at 
these planes jasim said so if bush wants to stay in power he 
will pull out his soldiers and not make war 
under a plan organized by the ruling baath party stores will 
limit the quantity of certain products that can be sold at one 
time alhadithi said 
we need only bread and water we need no more than that we 
can live for a long time jasim said dignity is more important 
than food 
earlier sources said coupons had been issued to iraqis 
entitling them to a monthly allocation of 13 pounds of flour 33 
pounds of rice 22 pounds of sugar 35 ounces of tea 11 pounds 
of oil 17 ounces of detergent and one bar of soap 
two food store owners in baghdad said they were told the 
rationing plan would limit purchases of such items as rice sugar 
tea cooking oil baby food detergent and soap 
we really dont think about this im not hoarding everything 
is here we are not worried about it one shopper said on 
condition of anonymity 
alhadithi said the plan was a precaution prompted by the un 
sanctions but not a response to any spot shortages 
we are determined to live on our own cultivation he said 
iraq reached selfsufficiency in vegetables and fruit during the 
war with iran 
he said production of rice and wheat were up significantly and 
that the government had taken steps to encourage farmers to put 
more land into cultivation and to entice businessmen to take more 
interest in the countryside

murdersrapeabuseduisdrugsshopliftingmore 
a retrospective of summer films no its the subheading for the 
prototype of the informer a new florida newspaper promising crime 
stories and no glory 
fed up with bigcity newspapers missing all but the most 
sensational crimes a florida man is publishing a tabloid listing 
every local arrest including those for alleged shoplifting and 
drunkendriving as well as murder 
the informer plans to fight crime by filling pages with a 
blotterstyle listing of every suspect even though theyre 
innocent until proven guilty 
this is going to be a deterrent said publisher ray aden 
what is happening is the great majority of people violating our 
laws are not known to their neighbors their bosses sometimes 
even their family 
but nobody wants to get their name in the paper 
some daily newspapers already print crime blotter information 
theres nothing unlawful about printing arrests from the public 
record but civil libertarians and attorneys say the tabloid is 
treading dangerous legal ground and could trample the rights of the 
accused 
from a small office in this st petersburg suburb aden and a 
handful of employees are busy preparing for the oct 3 premiere of 
the twicemonthly 89cent publication 
aden a 70yearold marketing analyst has spent nine months and 
more than 150000 getting ready to print the paper slated to be 
about half advertising and half listings of arrests along with 
articles such as how to deal with obscene phone calls 
the areas big dailies report only a few arrests a day focusing 
on major murders and drug busts but each issue of the informer is 
designed to bulge up to 48 pages and list hundreds of arrests in 
st petersburg clearwater and surrounding pinellas county 
communities 
all of them list only the standard booking information name 
address age and arresting charge 
were not crime reporting or editorializing thats not the 
concept aden said we give the community information it 
probably will evolve into more area crime watches which will 
benefit the community 
and on every page beneath boldface headers reading domestic 
violence and shoplifting disclaimers in the newspapers 
tiniest type read note being arrested does not mean the person 
is guilty 
they have an absolute right to print arrests said robyn 
blumner executive director of the american civil liberties union 
in florida but i would only hope the public is smart enough to 
know that arrests by themselves are legally irrelevant 
patricia anderson a libel attorney whose clients include the 
st petersburg times said publishing arrests is fine but they had 
better be accurate 
one wrong first name or one wrong middle initial and you could 
have a big lawsuit on your hands she said

share prices on the tokyo stock exchange fell 
sharply today and the dollar declined against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average the tokyo exchanges most 
closely watched indicator plunged 55794 points or 215 percent 
closing at 2542043 points a light 360 million shares changed 
hands 
kazuhiro nomura a trader with new japan securities co said 
the stock index had risen robustly in the morning along with bond 
prices but collapsed in the afternoon on a rumor of a price 
increase for imported liquefied natural gas 
if there is the slightest bit of news traders are poised to 
begin selling nomura said 
a security dealer with nippon kangyo kakumaru securities added 
that shares were sold on a rumor that authorities were 
investigating possible manipulation of paper company shares 
the dealer speaking on condition of anonymity also said buying 
enthusiasm declined after a japanese news report quoted a british 
newspaper as saying the united states had decided to use military 
force against iraq 
the price movement of the benchmark no 119 10year government 
bond closely paralleled that of the nikkei average after a morning 
rise the price fell back at the finish to the same level as 
fridays close of 8307 the yield also matched fridays close of 
8105 percent 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 14355 yen down 095 
yen from fridays close of 14450 it opened at 14340 yen and 
stayed in a narrow range between 14332 yen and 14370 yen 
exchange dealers attributed the lower opening to cross trading 
between the yen and principal european currencies especially the 
british pound 
there are no incentives to buy the dollar or to sell it 
said toru kanai exchange analyst for new japan securities he said 
many participants were staying on the sidelines becaued of the 
labor day holiday in the united states and beginningoftheweek 
slowness in tokyo 
sumitomo banks sumio fukushima added that weak consumer 
confidence in the united states and expected poor us employment 
figures due out friday also were stimulating japanese dealers

cambodian guerrillas have moved at 
least 60000 refugees from camps in thailand back into cambodia and 
some have died from disease as a result western aid officials said 
today 
most of the refugees were from camps run by the communist khmer 
rouge said a senior aid official speaking on condition of 
anonymity the others were from a camp controlled by the allied 
guerrilla forces of prince norodom sihanouk 
he said the movements began after the september 1989 pullout of 
vietnamese troops from cambodia but most of the refugees had been 
relocated in the past six months they were moved apparently to 
consolidate areas the guerrillas recently liberated he said 
the relocations continue amid stepped up efforts to end the 
11year cambodian war 
the vietnameseinstalled phnom penh government has accepted an 
invitation to join the guerrillas in talks in jakarta indonesia 
on wednesday on an interim government and a new united nations 
peace plan 
its premier hun sen said in a statement broadcast on state 
radio sunday he hoped the meeting would open the way toward a 
common solution for the cambodian problem 
hun sen said he will attend if sihanouk the main guerrilla 
leader also attends otherwise the government will be represented 
by hor nam hong a minister in the prime ministers office in 
charge of foreign affairs 
the khmer rouge and the noncommunist sihanouk forces are allied 
with the khmer peoples national liberation front against hun sen 
the khmer rouge relocated millions during its brutal attempt in 
the 1970s to turn the country into a radical agrarian commune 
hundreds of thousands of people were executed or died of hunger and 
disease before vietnams late 1978 invasion ousted the fanatical 
regime 
the aid official said some refugees fell sick after the latest 
relocations and tried to return to unaided camps in thailand for 
treatment but some were prevented or delayed from doing so and had 
died mostly from malaria and anemia he said he said he could not 
give a figure 
you have people who are going voluntarily people who dont 
mind and people who are forced to go back he said 
our officers in the field believe the total number to be close 
to 100000 he said we believe we are facing a tremendous 
problem 
international relief officials have seen trucks taking the 
refugees to border crossing points said another aid official 
you can say that they died from a political decision that 
brought them back inside cambodia without providing them with the 
minimum of medical care he said 
as well as medical supplies we know there are shortages of 
food too although no one is starving yet he said 
in the past month some 1000 people had returned to the khmer 
rouge camp of site 8 with malaria tuberculosis and other diseases 
rife in the border region he said 
aid officials stressed they had an incomplete picture of the 
movements they said many refugees habitually cross the border and 
later return to the un camps in thailand they also raised the 
possibility the thai military had a hand in the movements 
there are more than 300000 refugees in camps along the thai 
border run by the guerrillas and given humanitarian aid by the un 
border relief operation 
however most of those moved by the khmer rouge were from their 
hidden satellite camps closed military and civilian 
communities near the un camps the khmer rouge and the thai 
military do not allow western aid agencies to work inside these 
camps but have let many refugees there seek medical assistance 
outside 
the senior relief official said the satellite camps near site 8 
the main unaided khmer rouge camp in prachinburi province and 
those farther south near the unaided site k camp in trat 
province were empty 
other movements were reported from areas along the northern part 
of the border near the un camp of otrao in sisaket province 
the refugees from the satellite camps near site 8 had to travel 
only a few miles to the border but those in the south had to walk 
for several days to reach their new homes where the medical 
situation was very bad the official said 
he said sihanouks authorities moved between 10000 and 20000 
people from site b a unaided camp along the northern border in 
surin province they were being moved mainly to two new settlements 
just across the border

the scheduled execution of a man 
convicted in the rape and murder of a nurse has taken on political 
overtones for gov bill clinton who is seeking a fifth term this 
fall 
civil rights groups want clinton to delay the execution of barry 
lee fairchild a black man who contends he was coerced into 
confessing they warn the democratic governor could lose his 
traditionally strong support in the black community if fairchild 
dies as scheduled wednesday 
there is too much uncertainty in this case for an execution to 
take place the rev ellihue gaylord president of the state 
national association for the advancement of colored people said at 
a recent news conference 
clinton 44 has nurtured a zealous anticrime reputation the 
past few years supporting prison boot camps and the states first 
drug czar in a 1989 legislative package 
hes in a tough spot no matter which way he turns said 
mahlon martin one of several black appointees to clintons 
cabinet martin left the administration last year 
the execution of fairchild 36 would be the third in arkansas 
this year copkiller john edward swindler and mass murderer r 
gene simmons were white swindler was the first arkansas inmate 
executed since 1964 
fairchild was convicted in the 1983 rape and murder marjorie 
mason 22 a little rock air force base nurse a key for 
prosecutors was two videotapes in which fairchild unemotionally 
detailed the abduction and rape of ms mason his head is bandaged 
in the videotapes 
the head wound was received during the arrest and he also was 
bitten by a police dog police said 
on appeal fairchild said he was beaten by police and confessed 
to a crime he didnt commit us district judge g thomas eisele 
dismissed the claims wednesday he said nobody testified that they 
saw fairchild being beaten 
the fbi is investigating alleged inmate abuse while us rep 
tommy robinson rark was pulaski county sheriff from 1980 to 
1984 little rock is in pulaski county but the judge said he is 
convinced the matter doesnt pertain to fairchild 
eisele also rejected arguments that fairchilds limited mental 
capacity could cause a second jury to believe fairchild was 
coerced he said the inmate wasnt so retarded that he confessed 
to a murder he did not commit 
opponents of the execution want clinton to issue a reprieve 
until the fbi inquiry is complete 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals in st louis will hear an 
appeal tuesday that court and the supreme court have turned 
fairchild away twice 
im going to try to depoliticize this as much as possible 
read the facts of the case against the law and hopefully make the 
right decision clinton said thursday 
the case gained an added political dimension when the naacp 
amnesty international and the american civil liberties union held a 
news conference thursday to pressure clinton 
keith jennings deputy director of amnesty internationals 
southern region at atlanta said national black leaders will 
contact clinton to let you know that should you have national 
aspirations the african community wont forget 
clinton toyed with the idea of running for president in 1988 
the governor may be worried about more than the black vote 
theres another political issue here that makes it 
different said martin now president of the winthrop rockefeller 
foundation weve had two executions this year and those were 
white people 
unless the white community agrees there are unique matters in 
this case and differences which i think there are i think they 
may see a granting of a stay as strictly a racial issue 
martin said that perception could hurt clinton in the november 
election 
arkansas black population is about 16 percent and clinton is 
already in trouble with some rural white voters who blame him for 
the closing of their small school districts 
clinton appears willing to leave the matter in the courts 
hands my leanings are to give great weight to the decisions of 
the federal district court he said

pope john paul ii decried today the 
failure of development in africa blaming a thirst for power and 
profit for plunging the continent into poverty and injustice 
how many young people in africa are deeply affected by the 
lack of hope that overshadows their future the pope said on the 
third day of a 10day african tour 
john paul flew from the countrys commercial capital the port 
city of dar es salaam 380 miles to southwestern songea to 
celebrate mass 
the pope was greeted by traditional dancers and music people 
singing hymns and ululating about 25000 people attended the 
service which was held in an open field in the african savannah 
certainly it is not easy for people especially young people 
to be selfgiving and generous when they see around them so much 
poverty and suffering so many instances of neglect and 
injustice he said in his homily 
john paul said the hopes of many third world countries have been 
dashed by hunger malnutrition crime and corruption 
he compared the situation to the chaos discribed in the book of 
genesis the world was a formless void and there was darkness 
over the deep 
but he urged africans to maintain hope 
many problems of development no matter how overpowering can 
be solved if there is a new attitude diametrically opposed to a 
selfish desire for profit and the thirst for power 
the pope was to fly to northwestern mwanza on the shores of 
lake victoria later in the day to bless 100 patients at an 
episcopalrun hospital make a speech and dine with the archbishop 
monsignor anthony mayala 
on sunday the pontiff called for cooperation and brotherhood 
between christianity and islam in africa where the worlds two 
largest religions have occasionally clashed in competition for 
converts 
the pope hailed good relations between the two faiths in this 
largely moslem country where catholics are only 21 percent of the 
population of about 24 million 
the moslem community contributed financially to the popes 
visit according to vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
the nations moslem president ali hassan mwinyi attended an 
openair mass sunday morning he also provided a small plane for 
the pope to travel in from dar es salaam to mwanza 
john paul winds up the tanzania leg of his seventh trip to 
africa on wednesday he will go on to burundi rwanda and ivory 
coast where he ends the trip sept 10 with the consecration of a 
massive basilica

emigration from hong kong will leap almost 50 
percent this year because of fears of communist chinas takeover in 
1997 the british colonial government announced today 
the government said 62000 people are expected to leave the 
territory in 1990 compared to 42000 last year an increase of 
476 percent 
mike rowse head of a government task force on emigration 
predicted about 60000 people a year or 1150 people a week 
would leave the colony in 1991 and 1992 
but after that youre getting into crystal ball gazing he 
said 
some analysts say emigration from hong kong will skyrocket after 
1992 five years before china resumes control of the colony and the 
year chinas controversial daya bay nuclear power plant is 
scheduled to come on stream 30 miles north of hong kong 
reports of numerous construction problems have dogged the plant 
causing worries about its safety 
rowse said most of the people leaving are members of hong kongs 
vibrant welleducated middle class who have turned this 
410squaremile patch of islands and peninsula on the southern 
chinese coast into an economic powerhouse 
their departure has sparked fears of economic and social 
problems in hong kong once china resumes control of the territory 
in 1997 
interest in emigration has increased since china cracked down on 
a movement for freedom in beijing in june 1989 the crackdown 
convinced many in the territory that china could easily break its 
promise to maintain the colonys freewheeling economic and social 
system for 50 years 
londons refusal to give most of its hong kong colonial subjects 
the right to live in britain also played a role in encouraging 
emigration the british government has recently approved a package 
that will give about 225000 of hong kongs 57 million people the 
right of abode in britain 
only certain individuals such as senior civil servants top 
businessmen educators and highlyskilled workers qualify 
rowse said applications for the package would begin to be acted 
on in november and that the first passports under the plan would be 
issued by spring 
but he said the government has no way to predict whether 
people who receive the passports will stay as the plan intends or 
leave immediately for britain 
horatio cheung an emigration specialist who has criticized hong 
kong in the past for softpedaling the emigration problem said he 
thought the governments predictions were accurate this year 
but its significant that they didnt look past 1992 he 
said thats when i believe youll see a mass exodus 
so far the most popular destination has been canada australia 
will probably surpass the united states this year for the second 
slot 
but that lineup soon could change 
a bill being debated by the us congress would raise hong 
kongs immigration quota to america from 5000 to 20000 people

saudi arabia will boost its daily oil 
production by 227 million barrels this month to make up for the 
loss of iraqi and kuwaiti output the middle east economic survey 
reported today 
in addition the united arab emirates will boost output from 
fields in abu dhabi by about 450000 barrels a day the respected 
nicosiabased oil industry newsletter said 
before iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 iraqs president saddam 
hussein warned that he would retaliate for the violation of opec 
quotas by kuwait and the uae the extra oil on markets was 
driving down crude prices 
a united nations economic embargo imposed on iraq four days 
after the invasion stopped iraqi and kuwaiti oil exports slashing 
available opec production by 4 million barrels a day and driving up 
prices 
the new increase in daily output follows an agreement by 
organization of petroleum exporting countries in vienna on aug 29 
to suspend quota restrictions and allow production to rise toward 
225 million barrels a day 
that was the production level set in geneva by the oil cartel on 
july 27 six days before iraq invaded kuwait 
the move to boost oil production by saudi arabia and the united 
arab emirates will boost saudi output to 765 million barrels 
daily and the emirates to about 2 million barrels a day 
the newsletter estimates that opec production will reach 221 
million barrels a day this month and rise to 231 million barrels 
daily by years end 
the vienna agreement was aimed at restoring market stability and 
salvaging opecs credibility in the wake of the persian gulf crisis 
the accord was seen as a major political victory for saudi 
arabia which had lobbied for a rapid production boost against 
opposition from other opec members notably iran the kingdom had 
threatened to boost production unilaterally if necessary 
the economic survey said saudi arabia will give priority to 
supplying developing countries whose oil supplies have been 
affected by the iraqkuwait cutoff 
these include turkey brazil the philippines india pakistan 
bangladesh taiwan and south korea 
next on the list are the japanese the newsletter said in last 
priority are increases for us and european buyers it said 
at the same time saudi arabia is also to supply crude on a 
commercial basis to two opec countries hit by the crisis the 
survey reported 
the kuwait petroleum co will be receiving 150000 barrels a 
day of saudi crude in september rising to 220000 barrels a day in 
october it said 
indonesia will be receiving saudi crude to make up for a 
30000 barreladay supply contract it had with iraq the 
newsletter reported 
the survey said 75 million barrels a day of the increased saudi 
production will come from aramco fields that is roughly the oil 
giants sustainable capacity although it has a shortterm surge 
capacity of up to 85 million barrels a day 
the rest of saudi arabias output will come from its half of the 
socalled neutral zone which it shares with kuwait 
the land fields in the zone whose production installations are 
on the kuwaiti side of the border have been closed since aug 2 
but the offshore fields which lie on the saudi arabian side 
remain in operation 
all the united arab emirates increase will come from abu dhabi 
the federations main producer dubai its other producer will 
maintain its current output of 400000 barrels a day the 
newsletter said 
whether abu dhabi production goes even higher in the fourth 
quarter will no doubt depend mainly on technical oilfield 
factors the newsletter noted 
venezuelan production is also expected to rise this month by 
350000 barrels a day increasing another 150000 barrels daily in 
november to a total of 500000 barrels a day 
newsletter editor ian seymour said the vienna accord stands a 
good chance of defusing the oil supply crisis in its present form 
that is to say unless anything worse happens in the middle east 
arena

americans freed from the us embassy in 
kuwait after weeks as virtual prisoners of iraqi soldiers outside 
the walls say the comrades they left behind face mounting hunger 
thirst and weariness 
as the 47 americans arrived sunday the few who met with 
reporters painted a grim picture of life inside the eightblock 
compound just across a sixlane highway from a persian gulf beach 
the situation is deteriorating daily former hostage lloyd 
culbertson 76 said today he estimated that 20 to 25 americans 
remain at the embassy

japanese embassy and possibly others he said 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat who

on sunday told them i come to welcome our guests here 
his remarks got a cold shoulder 
i wasnt a guest said the whitebearded culbertson of el 
paso texas i damned near starved to death 
bonnie anderton of denver said it is the only hotel i have 
ever been a guest in that i dont intend to leave a tip we were 
sleeping on the floor there was no water and no power and we were 
being eaten alive by bugs 
mrs anderton was accompanied by her daughter jennifer 10 who 
nervously twirled a red baseball cap as her mother spoke 
jennifers father richard anderton an engineer remained 
behind in the embassy where the family took refuge the day after 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iraqi officials cut off power and water to the embassy after 
washington refused a demand to close it 
jesse jackson the american civil rights leader who arranged for 
more than 100 foreigners to leave baghdad and kuwait city on 
saturday urged the iraqis to restore water and power saying that 
otherwise he did not believe the embassy could hold out more than a 
few days 
he doesnt know us said mrs anderton well make it i 
think theyll stay as long as they have to 
d michael cheers a freelance photojournalist who accompanied 
jackson said the americans in the embassy were boiling water from 
the swimming pool for drinking and breaking up furniture to burn in 
wood stoves 
many of the hostages were greeted in their hometowns by joyful 
relatives 
long live america 16yearold sayyeda mirzas father 
masood said after he his daughter and his wife arrived at new 
york citys la guardia airport on the last leg of their journey to 
their manhasset hills ny home 
mirza said that when he learned he was being released i was 
happy i was crying 
and the next moment i thought what about the others 
prabhavathi murikpudi 40 wept with joy when she and her 
10yearold daughter sylaja were met at chicagos ohare 
international airport by her husband whose monthlong effort to 
gain their release included a videotaped plea sent to saddam 
sylaja celebrated her 10th birthday while in iraq 
some ladies mentioned her birthday to the cook and they 
arranged a big celebration including champagne music gifts and 
a candlelight dinner she said 
we were really treated very well physically mrs mirza 
told television station wcbstv in an interview at the familys 
manhasset hills home others disagreed 
a us official said 24 women 11 men and 12 children arrived 
sunday but declined to identify them citing privacy laws about a 
third of the women were reported to be pregnant the state 
department said about 1000 americans remain in kuwait and about 
500 are in iraq 
among the men was edward johnson 62 a vice president in the 
st louis office of fasco industries which makes electric motors 
we dont want to leave the embassy he said its american 
ground 
cheers said the men who were allowed to return after iraqi 
president saddam hussein announced he would free women and children 
were chosen because of medical problems 
johnson a diabetic said he took refuge at the embassy aug 17 
on the advice of an embassy official culbertson who taught 
electronics to the kuwaiti military had been in the embassy since 
aug 10 
of the americans aboard the green iraqi jumbo jet who had been 
held in baghdad only one spoke to reporters she gave a markedly 
different picture of her captivity than those from kuwait city 
i have had an enjoyable time said beth krekeler of st 
louis a former english teacher in baghdad i have had a 
crosscultural experience 
mrs krekeler who spoke to reporters while cuddling her 
twoyearold cat minutiae also said she did not object to the 
iraqi policy of ferrying hostages to potential bombing targets to 
serve as human shields 
i think it is a very noble thing to be there to stop the 
bombing of cities and the bombing of people she said 
culbertson criticized president bush for vacationing during the 
crisis and said if it were not for the grace of god and jesse 
jackson we would not be here the state department has not lifted 
a hand for us 
asked if the people left behind feared for their lives 
culbertson said yes they certainly do 
mrs anderton said iraqi troops often fired shots near the us 
embassy compound during the day 
jackson said at the airport now that the military has played 
its role diplomacy must work if preconditions make talks 
impossible war is inevitable

kgb continues to tap telephones infiltrate trade unions and the 
russian orthodox church and play dirty tricks abroad despite a 
campaign to shed its image as an instrument of purges and 
repression 
kalugin was dismissed and stripped of his rank after going 
public with his accusations in june the soviet prosecutor has been 
investigating him since july 17 under a law against divulging state 
secrets but no formal charges have been brought brought against 
him 
as an elected lawmaker kalugin cannot now be prosecuted on 
criminal charges without the agreement of the soviet legislature 
the 55yearold former major general was a kgb agent in the 
united states from 1958 to 1970 first while working as a radio 
moscow correspondent and later as a first secretary in the soviet 
embassy in washington 
the kgb and its supporters tried to discredit kalugin before an 
initial vote was held last month in krasnodar an agricultural 
region along the black sea 750 miles south of moscow kalugin 
outpolled 20 other candidates but did not win the required majority 
on saturday the kgb accused him of slander for saying that two 
defectors had once worked as assistants to kgb chairman vladimir 
kryuchkov and his deputy chairman viktor grushko kalugin made the 
allegations friday night on the popular television program 
viewpoint 
the kgb called it another slanderous allegation by oleg 
kalugin in a statement released by tass the kgb also said it 
is impossible to bypass the fact that many statements by kalugin 
betray striking affinity to numerous statements by one of the 
defectors 
the kgb said neither kryuchkov nor grushko have ever had 
assistants who betrayed their country 
krasnodars seat in the national congress which meets twice a 
year was vacated by ivan polozkov who left to become the 
communist party chief of the russian federation the largest of the 
soviet unions 15 republics

a shot was fired this morning as soldiers 
moved closer to the last area under control of armed mohawk 
warriors 
there was no immediate indication which side fired the shot but 
it did not appear anyone was hit both mohawk and army spokesmen 
denied firing 
the incident took place as a 2monthold standoff wore on today 
with troops surrounding about 30 mohawk indian militants who 
refused to surrender and retreated to a drug and alcohol 
detoxification center on indian land 
on sunday about 350 soliders demolished the last barricades 
blocking access to the kanesatake indian reservation and seized 
control of most of it mohawks were confined to a small wooded area 
around the center 
late sunday the militants issued a statement saying the army 
had given them an ultimatum to surrender by 8 am edt today or 
face attack but an army spokesman maj jeanpaul macdonald said 
that was absolutely wrong 
the canadian forces are not in the business of giving 
ultimatums in such sensitive situations macdonald said 
native representatives including three chiefs from the six 
nations iroquois confederacy met late into the night at the center 
to discuss ways to end the standoff without violence 
the indians had errected the barricades at kanesatake and 
another mohawk community kahnawake in a dispute over plans by oka 
town officials to expand a golf course onto what they claim is 
tribal land 
the barriers had blocked traffic on an oka highway and about 20 
miles away on a bridge connecting montreal to southern suburbs 
on sunday the warriors a militant mohawk organization 
periodically came out from the trees and stood facetoface with 
soldiers at oka on one occasion a warrior approached a soldier 
stood chesttochest with him and stared into his eyes as a group 
of reporters watched 
finally he let out a war whoop turned and walked away i 
want to see their face before i kill them the warrior said 
the mohawks fortified their positions by using a frontend 
loader to pile earth on a road near the twostory detoxification 
center in the woods some crouched behind trees in wait for the 
army 
when asked whether the warriors were prepared to shoot it out 
with the army one militant said definitely 
this is it we cant be pushed any further he said 
however no fighting broke out between the soldiers and indians 
sunday military helicopters flew overhead and about 80 armored 
vehicles were in the area the army said 
mohawk spokesman ellen gabriel said the indians are pretty 
squeezed in right now theres no way out really 
last week quebec premier robert bourassa ordered the army to 
dismantle the barricades 
the army moved into the kanesatake mohawk settlement in oka 18 
miles west of montreal saturday afternoon after factional fighting 
broke out between moderate and militant mohawks two indians were 
hurt before the army moved in 
when the soldiers pushed forward only one shot was fired by a 
mohawk on saturday said army commander lt col pierre daigle 
there were no casualties 
the dispute over the golf course expansion was solved when the 
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to 
the indians 
but the mohawks seized the situation to publicize a much wider 
range of grievances including demands for sovereignty and their 
campaign caused numerous brief sympathy blockades across canada 
one week ago provincial authorities gave the military the 
goahead to end the armed standoff that began july 11 when the 
quebec provincial police attempted to storm the mohawk barricade at 
oka one officer was killed in that assault but it is still not 
clear by whose gunfire

the civil rights leader and former democratic presidential 
aspirant urged president bush to pursue a diplomatic solution to 
reverse iraqs takeover of kuwait and cautioned against relying 
solely on military pressure 
just as our generals are in saudi arabia with a military 
presence our politicians should be as evident in seeking 
diplomatic solutions he said on nbctvs today

the iraqi president said a diplomatic solution must regain the 
sovereignty of kuwait assure the security of saudi arabia and 
assure the integrity of iraq he called for an end to the 
drumbeating hostile rhetoric 
jackson in an interview on abctvs good morning america

annexation and his threats against saudi arabia were errors 
if war breaks out over the crisis jackson said innocent people 
will be killed and oil wells destroyed 
asked to respond to criticism that he was exploiting the 
hostages plight for his own political gains he said suffice it 
to say blessed are the peacemakers even when they are beguiled

kuwait is the only problem in the crisis and that only a military 
solution will work to resolve it

un chief javier perez de cuellar says hes deeply disappointed 
by iraqs intransigence in two days of talks and baghdad is 
starting to ration food and promising that iraqis will eat mud 
before yielding to foreign pressure 
perez de cuellar said sunday that diplomatic efforts to resolve 
the monthold standoff between iraq and usled multinational 
forces in the persian gulf should now be turned to the weekend 
superpower summit in finland 
the first beneficiaries of tentative moves toward diplomacy in 
the crisis returned to freedom sunday in the first major airlift of 
western captives from iraq some had been held at strategic iraqi 
sites to deter any us attack 
despite attempts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis 
iraqs saddam hussein precipitated by having his troops seize 
oilrich kuwait on aug 2 the baghdad government seemed to be 
settling in 
it appeared intent on waiting out the roughly 100000 american 
troops now positioned in saudi arabia and on us ships in the 
region 
but the roundtheclock deployment was continuing five us 
amphibiouswarfare ships transited the suez canal today en route to 
the gulf region to join the multinational armada 
in order to withstand a unimposed economic embargo iraq 
announced sunday that it would begin rationing food there have 
been reports of food shortages in iraq although iraqi government 
spokesman naji alhadithi has denied those claims 
it was not immediately clear when the rationing would begin 
some sources said it was to have begun over the weekend but a 
baghdad shopkeeper said he was told the plan would take effect on 
wednesday 
we have a wartested society we have a wartested economy so 
even if we eat mud we will resist pressure and not kneel down to 
any foreign power alhadithi told a news conference iraqs 
8yearwar with iran ended in 1988 
iraq appeared in no hurry to compromise on its aug 6 annexation 
of kuwait or on its policy of holding thousands of westerners as 
hostages 
after seven hours of meetings with iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz in jordan perez de cuellar said he was deeply 
disappointed because he had expected a certain flexibility on 
the part of iraq 
what iraq wants is to stay in kuwait which is unacceptable to 
the international community to the un security council and to 
its secretarygeneral perez de cuellar told reporters sunday in 
paris after arriving from amman jordan 
perez de cuellars negotiations were the only direct talks held 
with the iraqi leadership since the early days of the crisis 
the un chief said he still held out hope that iraq would 
become more accommodating i am available he said if at 
any given time they wish to modify their position i will be 
delighted to listen to them 
the only major public talks on the persian gulf crisis now 
scheduled are the helsinki summit on sunday between president bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the european commission announced today that the foreign 
ministers of the 12 european community nations will meet in rome on 
friday to discuss the crisis in the gulf it will be their second 
such meeting since the invasion 
the superpower summit in helsinki does not raise many hopes for 
a speedy resolution 
we have to settle down for a long haul which will require a 
good deal of steady determination on the part of all concerned 
said british foreign secretary douglas hurd 
hurd was in yemen today the fourth stop in a tour of the gulf 
region yemen remains a weak link in the embargo and yemenis have 
been demonstrating in the streets to display support for saddam 
in bangladesh at least 50 people including six policemen were 
reported hurt today in a demonstration protesting the dispatch of 
bangladesh troops to the gulf united news of bangladesh reported 
in dhahran saudi arabia on sunday house majority leader 
richard gephardt said a lengthy us military presence in saudi 
arabia might strain the american publics patience but that time 
will be a worse enemy for saddam 
theres a patience problem on the iraqi side as well said 
gephardt dmo who led a congressional delegation in a visit to 
us troops its the world against him its not the world 
against us 
but the standoff was taking its toll on the skeleton staffs of 
embassies in kuwait that are resisting iraqi orders to close at 
the us mission diplomats were breaking up furniture for firewood 
and boiling water from the swimming pool to drink said a 
photographer accompanying the rev jesse jackson 
the us embassy like many other missions in kuwait has had 
its power and water cut by the iraqis for defying the closure order 
the photographer freelancer d michael cheers traveled to 
kuwait and baghdad with jackson who helped secure the release of 
some american captives 
perez de cuellar indicated that the iraqi foreign minister gave 
some indication of possible movement on the issue of foreign 
embassies in kuwait 
tariq aziz promised me to do something to display some 
flexibility to avoid diplomats expulsion he said on french 
television but he added i regarded it as unlikely 
former hostage lloyd culbertson 76 who had been among those 
trapped in the us embassy compound in kuwait said today the 
situation at the mission is deteriorating daily 
the food is spoiling there is no electricity culbertson 
said on cbs this morning we have no means of communicating 
with other people our ambassador is not allowed to talk with other 
ambassador or to american citizens he cant leave the compound 
a diplomatic source in brussels said on sunday that the east 
german ambassador to kuwait was picked up by iraqi authorities and 
taken to baghdad he had ventured out of his embassy to visit the 
west german mission 
jackson accompanied 300 westerners mostly women and children 
on an iraqi airways boeing 747 plane that carried them out of iraq 
and stopped in paris london and washington the plane left baghdad 
on saturday along with two other planeloads of foreigners 
for most of those freed joy upon reaching safety was muted by 
fears for husbands and fathers left behind bonnie anderton of 
denver got out with her daughter jennifer 10 but jennifers 
father richard remained behind 
they were among 47 weary americans arriving at dulles 
international airport outside washington earlier sunday 
at tokyos international airport 68 japanese women and children 
arriving on a japan air lines flight were greeted by tearful 
relatives and friends 
a lufthansa plane with 250 women and 61 children on board 
including 60 americans and 71 germans landed early sunday in 
frankfurt west germany 
the airlifts came after saddam in what he called a humanitarian 
gesture announced last week that women and children among the 
foreign captives would be allowed to leave iraq 
however the departure of others was apparently delayed sunday 
as iraq withheld landing clearance for two special flights from 
britain and france 
western governments have demanded the release of all the 
hostages and denounced iraqs footdragging in freeing the women 
and children as promised

president bush is returning to 
washington for a hectic few days of preparation before his third 
summit meeting with soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
as aides scrambled to work out logistics and prepare an agenda 
for the hastily called summit bush today was concluding a 
threeweek vacation in maine that he took under the cloud of the 
persian gulf crisis 
he returns to washington two days after announcing that he would 
meet with the soviet leader in helsinki next sunday 
meanwhile administration officials said today that details are 
still being worked out on the upcoming summit including the 
possiblity of extending it by one day so that bush can meet with 
finish president mauno koivisto 
deputy press secretary roman popadiuk said that such a courtesy 
session would likely come on saturday and that it could mean that 
the president would leave for helsinki on friday instead of on 
saturday 
bush spent sunday hosting his longtime friend evangelist billy 
graham at his seaside vacation home the pair went to two churches 
for morning services 
these are rather trying times and right now i would suggest we 
get our strength from being one nation under god bush told the 
congregation at the first congregational church 
officials said bushs oneday summit with gorbachev will likely 
entail about five hours of talks focusing on the persian gulf 
crisis they said the two men would also discuss conventional arms 
reduction talks between the two nations and regional issues 
including cambodia and afghanistan 
the president said he was pleased with soviet cooperation on a 
number of global issues 
i think it is important at this juncture that we discuss 
issues not just as they relate to europe and try to update where we 
can on these arms negotiations but also to discuss the middle 
east the president said 
on the persian gulf one official said of the two superpowers 
were comparing notes we would be explaining where we think the 
situation is where we would go 
side meetings between aides are not planned for this summit 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity such 
sessions usually are standard during summit meetings 
another official described the oneday session as more an 
informal meeting between the two leaders 
on the subject of conventional arms talks one official said the 
two leaders discussion would just be a review of the continuing 
negotiations to reduce soviet and us troop strength in europe 
bush has said he does not expect the soviet union to mediate 
between iraq and the united states but the administration would 
welcome any pressure gorbachev can bring against iraq a longtime 
recipient of soviet arms 
bush said he has not spoken to gorbachev since iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 he said he has not telephoned gorbachev 
something he has done to many other world leaders because i had 
anticipated seeing him 
bush proposed the meeting to gorbachev a week ago he held his 
proposal so closely that several top white house staff members did 
not know about it when they were in the soviet union last week 
they were there with white house chief of staff john sununu at 
gorbachevs request to explain the technical workings of the us 
executive branch sununu was informed of the arrangements for the 
summit meeting but was not a key player in setting it up aides 
said 
white house staff members met sunday to begin working on 
logistical details and plans for contacting their soviet 
counterparts 
everybodys scrambling to put their pieces together one 
official said 
sig rogich who oversees white house advance logistics and 
imagemaking ended his vacation early on sunday to coordinate the 
planning 
sununu was driving his family back to washington from his home 
state of new hampshire on sunday a day after his arrival from the 
soviet union 
bushs wife barbara and gorbachevs wife raisa also will 
travel to helsinki

saddam hussein has a fleet of more than 
150 transport aircraft including airliners plundered from kuwait 
that could be used to beat the united nationsordered embargo on 
trade with iraq 
but aviation experts stress that any attempt at airborne 
blockadebusting is fraught with difficulties and dangers for both 
sides 
they note too that an airlift would likely be little more than 
a gesture of defiance because it could never carry enough supplies 
to feed iraqs 17 million people or enough military materiel to 
make a serious difference in saddams confrontation with the west 
the sheer amount of cargo that would be needed to resupply a 
whole country by air is mindboggling said don kerr of londons

usx corp chairman charles a corry has 
explored the possibility of selling the companys steel operations 
to foreign investors in the last few months according to a report 
published monday 
corry told the new york times he would be willing to sell the 
steel unit at the right price but said he did not expect such a 
sale to occur soon because of a weakness in the industry 
the company has been growing in the energy business and 
reducing its exposure to the steel business corry said and 
that will continue to be the trend 
the discussions with british steel plc and others came on the 
heels of a usx effort to defeat a similar proposal made by new york 
financier carl c icahn who holds a 13 percent stake in usx 
shareholders rejected icahns plan in may 
usx executives whom the times did not identify said icahns move 
made it clear to the company that there was increased sympathy for 
splitting the steel business from energy interests icahn had 
advocated issuing shares in separate companies upon a split and 
said the value would grow afterward 
an economic forecaster said corry opposed icahns proposal 
because he thought the timing was wrong last spring 
the market was still headed downward during the icahn 
situation said christopher plummer of the wefa group of 
balacynwyd pa and usx would not be in the best position to 
sell assets 
usx which owns marathon oil and texas oil and gas was known as 
us steel until 1986 
analysts told the times another possible purchaser of the usx 
steel units is pohang iron and steel co the south korean company 
operates a joint venture with usx in pittsburg calif 
neither pohang nor british steel would comment on the matter

the soviet union hungry for hard currency is 
reaping a windfall from higher oil prices and would like to 
increase exports to take advantage of shortages caused by the 
mideast crisis but it cant 
the problem is an antiquated and long mismanaged soviet 
petroleum industry unable to boost production it may in fact 
yield 500000 fewer barrels a day this year than last western 
analysts say 
the soviet union produced about 121 million barrels of oil a 
day last year a sixth of the worlds total and more than saudi 
arabia iraq and kuwait combined 
it exported 37 million barrels a day more than iraq with 
about half going to the west 
they are producing at maximum capacity and their production is 
declining theres no way they can get increased production said 
john lichtblau chairman of the petroleum industry research 
foundation 
not only is the soviet industry unable to boost production its 
problems with nuclear reactors have added to the domestic demand 
the soviet unions appetite for oil is second only to the united 
states 
theres no way that they can take advantage of whats 
happening in the market said robert ebel vice president for 
international affairs for the enserch corp an engineering and 
construction company 
ebel and other us experts acknowledge that the soviets are 
expected to gain hundreds of millions of dollars in additional hard 
currency in the coming months if the higher oil prices stand 
its estimated that every 1 a barrel increase could mean 1 
billion a year in additional hard currency for the soviet economy 
last year oil exports brought 20 billion in hard currency into 
the soviet union accounting for about 40 percent of the countrys 
hard currency earnings 
as oil prices began to climb after iraqs invasion of kuwait 
soviet oil bound for exports also became more valuable a moscow 
business publication kommersant estimated recently that the 
worldwide jump in oil prices could increase soviet hard currency 
revenue by 750 million by the end of the year 
some western analysts suggested the increase could be twice that 
if the soviets export 13 million barrels a day to the west and 
prices continue to hover at 25 a barrel compared with 16 a 
barrel before the iraqi crisis they stand to gain 15 billion in 
additional hard currency this year 
the soviets also have said they want eastern block countries 
where the other half of soviet oil exports are sent to begin 
paying in hard currency next year according to us oil experts 
but the soviet windfall will be muted by declining production 
that also will force down exports production at its mammoth field 
on the edge of siberia reportedly has declined by onefourth since 
1988 
based on performance over the first seven months of the year 
the soviets may average only 116 million barrels a day in 1990 
compared with 1214 million barrels a day in 1989 
thats a rather dramatic drop said ebel the enserch 
executive and former us intelligence expert for what they have 
to sell to the west theyre going to get more money but the 
amount of oil is going to be less 
soviet oil reserves are estimated to be more than 60 billion 
barrels twice that of the united states and the soviets are 
wooing western petroleum companies in the hope of expanding 
exploration and improving production facilities plagued by years of 
mismanagement outdated equipment deteriorating pipelines and a 
shortage of money for capital improvements 
in the past the soviets shied away from seeking out foreigners 
in developing its vast oil reserves even when oil prices were 
declining the soviet government poured large amounts of funds into 
oil development and boosted production revenue from oil exports 
pumped up other areas of the economy 
but the cost of exploration for soviet oil has nearly tripled in 
the last five years and the kremlin last year began to reduce funds 
for oil development 
it also stepped up its search for outside technical assistance 
and began negotiating possible joint exploratory ventures with 
western oil companies 
both chevron corp and texaco corp have reached preliminary 
agreements with the soviets on joint oil exploratory ventures a 
number of us service companies also are involved in oil 
exploration with the soviets as is elf aquitaine frances largest 
oil company 
they want to get western technology and capital says 
lichtblau of the new yorkbased petroleum industry research 
foundation but he adds those new ventures are unlikely to have 
an impact on production for years to come 
they desperately need american technology and american 
finances to boost oil exploration and production said henry 
shuler a soviet expert at the center for strategic and 
international studies in washington 
about all they can hope to do in the short to medium terms is 
slow the rate of oil production decline

upjohn co and other pharmaceutical 
firms are offering medicaid discounts as they try to preempt 
proposed legislation that would cap the cost of drugs sold to the 
poor 
last week kalamazoobased upjohn followed other industry 
leaders discount offers by proposing a 135 rebate for each 
medicaid prescription filled with its drugs 
i think its a smart move to try to eliminate the need for 
legislation said ronald nordmann an industry analyst with 
painewebber it probably wont mean much in terms of losses 
either since medicaid sales represent only about 10 percent of the 
market 
but theres a catch any state that accepts a companys discount 
must offer all of the companys drugs to medicaid patients even 
the expensive ones that some states now refuse thats expected to 
create virtual monopolies in some states by knocking competing 
drugs off reimbursement eligibility lists 
most of the largest drug companies have refused in the past to 
offer the same discounts to medicaid programs that they have given 
to the departments of defense and veterans affairs as well as 
hospitals and large health maintenance organizations 
but earlier this year the us health and human services 
department said it wanted to cut 1991 medicaid expenditures by 300 
million prompting a legislative proposal that would restrict the 
drugs covered by medicaid thereby forcing competitive bidding by 
drug companies 
sen david pryor dark who introduced the bill said it would 
save between 100 million and 200 million each year congressional 
hearings on the plan will be held in midseptember 
the cost of drugs sold to medicaid totals 35 billion a year 
at least 19 state medicaid programs have already limited the 
drugs they offer poor patients often excluding more expensive 
patented drugs as a way to get the drug companies to negotiate 
medicaid officials say drug prices are the fastest rising segment 
of their programs 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers association is adamantly 
opposed to legislation that would restrict access to any drug it 
says a federally mandated program for competitive bidding would 
lead to inferior health care for the poor 
under the bill manufacturers of chemically different drugs 
that treat the same disease would be required to bid against each 
other and the cheapest medicines which are almost always the 
oldest ones would win the bid association spokesman jeff 
trewhitt said friday 
medicaid patients would be deprived of some medicines and in 
many cases would be getting secondclass care 
trewhitt said many medical groups and advocacy groups for the 
poor are also opposed to the legislation the association has 
remained silent on the individual companies discount plans 
pryor chairman of the senate special committee on aging said 
last week that the current discount plans offered by merck amp co 
pfizer inc glaxo inc and upjohn arent good enough 
while i commend these four companies for offering national 
proposals the savings for medicaid and the safeguards to assure 
these savings are just not there pryor said 
merck which has agreed to offer states the same discounts it 
gives other health care providers has already signed up about 20 
states upjohn which announced its plans more than three months 
later has signed up just maryland so far 
while the discounts could cost the participating companies a 
significant amount in the short run analysts say those losses 
could be more than made up over time if the companies win enough 
medicaid contracts

when franklin d roosevelt told a nation mired in 
the depression that the only thing we have to fear is fear 
itself he was talking about the kind of economic fright that 
turns rumors into reality 
bank of new england got a taste of just what kind of damage 
false rumors can do in a nervous economic climate last week when 
talk hit wall street that federal regulators were preparing for a 
takeover 
area economists said massachusetts souring economy and the 
recent spate of federal bank takeovers nationwide have given 
rumors a potency they might not hold in better times 
i do think that the bad news sometimes can be cumulative and 
indeed feeds on itself said wayne ayers chief economist at the 
bank of boston 
james howell a former bank of boston economist who now runs his 
own consulting firm agreed that rumors thrive during a faltering 
economy 
when things begin to turn sour there is sort of a notion that 
i hope the bad things that are happening to other people wont 
happen to me therefore i respond to rumor as if some of it or 
all of it may be fact he said 
in the bank of new england flap a congressional candidate gave 
the rumor a substantial push democratic hopeful ted dimauro faxed 
a statement to news organizations lamenting the supposed federal 
takeover 
the bank has been struggling to recover from a downturn in the 
states economy especially from a decline in the real estate 
market and has operated under federal scrutiny since early this 
year 
federal officials issued strong statements that reports of the 
banks demise were wrong but there was some damage bank of new 
englands stock plunged 385 percent to 1 a share thursday on the 
new york stock exchange 
the problem is that irresponsibility like this press release 
can kill a bank ellen stockdale a spokeswoman for the 
comptroller of the currency in washington which regulates 
federally chartered banks said after dimauros statement appeared 
dimauro later apologized blaming an aide for releasing a 
statement without his final approval and the banks stock more 
than doubled the next day rising 112 to 212 
the incident highlights just how jittery investors and others 
watching the market have become in particular it demonstrates an 
uncertainty about banks sparked by the savings and loan crisis and 
the recent spate of bank failures nationwide banks traditionally 
are considered conservative reliable financial institutions 
for the first time since 1933 people are wondering whether 
or not they have their savings or deposits in the right bank the 
one that will not fail howell said that is the most 
significant change in thinking in the postworld war ii period 
howell and ayers agreed that the recent problems in the banking 
industry have been sparked in part because there are too many 
banks and the industry is adjusting 
there are between 13000 and 14000 commercial banks in the 
country and about 4500 savings banks they said 
we dont need any of the 4500 period you can just mark them 
off howell said 
rumors may threaten to become selffulfilling prophecies until 
the economy levels off ayers said 
i think a lot will depend on the health of the economy he 
said i think if we can sidestep recession nationally these 
rumors this falloff in confidence will gradually arrest itself
