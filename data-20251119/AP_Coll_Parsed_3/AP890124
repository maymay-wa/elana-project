former army doctor jeffrey macdonald 
convicted of killing his wife and daughters may keep just 50000 
of the 325000 settlement he won in a dispute over a book about the 
killings a judge ruled tuesday 
superior court judge edward ross deducted 92000 from the 
remaining 275000 to cover attorneys fees stemming from 
macdonalds lawsuit against fatal vision author joe mcginniss 
the rest of the money will be placed in a trust with the 
beneficiaries to be determined later the judge said 
attorneys for macdonalds motherinlaw mildred kassab had 
argued that state law bars a convicted criminal from profiting from 
his crime and therefore macdonald should not be able to keep the 
funds 
mrs kassab said earlier she wanted the money to go toward a 
memorial or charity in honor of her dead daughter and granddaughters 
macdonald had sued mcginniss claiming the author lied to gain 
his confidence to write a book which concluded the former green 
beret doctor killed his wife and their daughters ages 2 and 5 at 
their fort bragg nc apartment in 1970 
macdonald who had contended the slayings were the work of 
drugged hippies was convicted in 1979 and is serving three life 
sentences 
ill hold that macdonald had a viable claim against 
mcginniss ross said but the judge said macdonalds argument that 
he needed the money to care for needy relatives pay future legal 
fees and fund an investigation into the slayings did not entitle him 
to the full settlement 
however he said it would be impossible to recoup an estimated 
90000 received earlier and spent by macdonald through the book 
contract

operators at a south carolina nuclear weapons 
plant made mistakes during a routine pressure test last weekend and 
caused more damage to valves and pipes in the plant according to 
the washington post 
the accident damaged a backup cooling system for the k reaator 
one of three reactors closed since april because of safety problems 
at the savannah river sc plant the newspaper report in its 
wednesday editions 
the incident didnt pose any public health or safety dangers the 
newspaper quoted unnamed energy department officials as saying but 
it did raise new questions about operating procedures at the aging 
plant 
earlier government officials said more study will be needed to 
determine the severity of numerous cracks in the cooling systems at 
savannan river 
department of energy officials told an advisory panel they needed 
more time to assess cracking problems at the savannah river plant 
the nations only source of tritium a perishable and increasingly 
scarce gas vital to making nuclear warheads 
the threereactor complex has not been producing tritium since 
last april when the energy department shut down the last active 
reactor for safety reasons 
ei du pont de nemours amp co the operator of the reactors 
disclosed earlier this month it had discovered and was monitoring 27 
cooling system cracks including 15 in the reactor it hopes to 
restart by the end of this year 
john ahearne chairman of the energy departments advisory 
committee on nuclear facility safety said the panel was told by 
richard w starostecki a department safety official the cracking 
problem was probably not as serious as has been suggested but 
its still an open question 
ahearne said the department planned to continue assessing the 
severity of the problem 
if the cracked pipes need to be replaced the work could cause 
further delays in restarting the reactors 
the department said earlier this month it hoped to resume tritium 
production at savannah river by late this year although it gave no 
firm target date 
starostecki also reaffirmed to the panel that a phased restart of 
plutonium processing at the rocky flats nuclear weapons facility 
near denver colo had begun late last week 
the plant which reprocesses plutonium from old warheads for use 
in new ones was shut down by federal authorities last october 
following an incident in which three employees were accidentally 
exposed to plutonium particles 
starostecki said the processing plant could be back in full 
operation as soon as late march 
energy department officials also outlined the findings of a 
report based on a lengthy inspection of safety procedures at rocky 
flats last november and december 
the officials said the report which has not yet been made 
public is highly critical of the labor practices of rockwell 
international the operator of the rocky flats complex 
starostecki and other department officials said a practice of 
permitting workers to shift job assignments without proper 
preparation had led to poor performance of duties and inadequate 
attention to safety problems and procedures 
the officials said they also found inadequate training of workers 
who monitor radiation within the plant as well as flaws in the fire 
protection system 
they added however that rockwell in recent months had shown a 
genuine willingness to change its procedures and adopt a longterm 
strategy for improving safety

the white house is considering a program to 
force customers of banks and of savings and loans institutions to 
pay a large part of the multibilliondollar cost of rescuing the 
sampl industry the washington post reported 
treasury department officials tried last week to win support from 
congress for a proposal to tax depositors who put money in federally 
insured institutions the post said in its wednesday editions even 
as president bush was promising he wouldnt raise taxes 
according to the paper treasury officials met secretly with 
leaders of the house banking committee last week and treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady met with senate republican leaders on 
tuesday to discuss the proposal it would impose a tax of as much as 
30 cents for every 100 deposited at a federally insured 
institution according to the posts unnamed sources 
the newspaper quoted federal deposit insurance corp chairman l 
william seidman as saying its the reverse toaster theory 
instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit 
you give them one 
earlier the sampl industrys largest trade group on tuesday 
recommended tapping the us treasury to close insolvent 
institutions while slashing the amount contributed by healthy sampls 
the proposal by the us league of savings institutions if 
adopted would have the effect of shifting all of the burden for 
solving the problems of the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
onto taxpayers and freeing the industry from further responsibility 
the group which plans to present its proposal thursday at a 
hearing of the house budget committee wants to create a resolution 
corporation as a new independent federal agency 
the resolution corporation would be responsible for liquidating 
or selling the more than 350 insolvent but still open sampls as well 
as any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the next three 
years 
it also would take over all of the obligations the fslic has 
acquired in rescuing institutions in the past for instance the 
fslic resolved the cases of 205 insolvent institutions last 
year largely by issuing promissory notes and guarantees against 
loss these obligations would be transferred to the resolution 
corporation 
the resolution corporation would raise money by issuing notes 
which would be guaranteed by the treasury any money the resolution 
corporation gets from selling failed sampls to new investors or from 
selling the assets would go toward paying off the notes however 
the treasury would have to pay most of the bill 
in the meantime a new industryfunded fslic would be created to 
insure the deposits of healthy sampls which would pay an insurance 
premium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks to 
their fund the federal deposit insurance corp 
banks currently pay 8 cents per 100 in deposits since 1985 
sampls have been paying a higher fee 21 cents per 100 in deposits 
barney r beeksma chairman of the us league argued that sampls 
already have paid 5 billion in extra assessments and cant afford 
to pay more if they are to build their capital a key reform 
advocated by the league and private analysts 
capital represents the amount of money put up by an institutions 
owners as backing for public deposits the more capital there is 
the greater the cushion against failure and the more incentive the 
owners have to operate the sampl safely 
weve paid all that we can pay and what were concerned with 
now is creating a viable insurance fund for the future beeksma 
said in a telephone interview somebody has to decide whether they 
want us to pay the bill for the fslic or build our capital to make 
sure this doesnt happen again we cant do both 
he said tapping taxpayers funds is a price for the mistakes 
that were made in the past by the congress the regulators and the 
few in our business that shouldnt have been let in 
the trade group also is recommending that both the resolution 
corporation and the new fslic should be independent of the federal 
home loan bank board the regulator of the nations 3000 federally 
insured sampls it said the current system of consolidated sampl 
regulation has not provided the necessary checks and balances 
the league rejected for now proposals to merge the insurance 
funds for sampls and commercial banks beeksma said the issue should 
be revisited by congress in three years after the furor 
subsides 
meanwhile the treasury department is finishing its own 
recommendations to president bush it hasnt disclosed the plan but 
it has said a key principal of its recommendation will be that 
further industry resources and additional insurance premiums should 
be tapped before public funds 
bush in a meeting tuesday with congressional leaders said he 
would propose substantial revisions next month to ronald reagans 
budget including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis 
in another development rep bob michel of illinois the house 
republican leader announced the creation of a gop task force to 
recommend solutions to the sampl crisis it will be chaired by rep 
stan parris rva a member of the house banking committee

the indiana shoreline of lake michigan is home to 
the nations steel giants and perhaps no rust belt city better 
typifies a steel town than gary the steel slump of the 80s hit 
hard in gary already struggling with crime decay and a declining 
tax base but steel is making a comeback and gary hopes it can too 
the third story of a fourpart series the changing heartland 
looks at the resurgence in gary and northwestern indiana 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this steel town has long been a fourletter 
word for all thats gone wrong in industrial america a shrinking 
workforce sooty skies a sorry future 
with the citys fate tied to steels fortunes when the industry 
hurts so does gary now that steel is surging this archetypal rust 
belt city says it is on the mend too 
unemployment is down companies are moving in real estate is 
being snatched up more importantly gary is looking beyond steel 
a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed 
were on an upturn now said mayor thomas barnes the 
optimism we feel is not because weve resolved the problems that 
exist its because were right now on a track to resolving them 
theres growth as opposed to further decline people are taking 
another look at gary 
they will still find a depressed city shuttered stores gutted 
homes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store but 
there also is new prosperity due in part to a leaner profitable 
steel industry thats been boosted by increasing demand import 
limits the low dollar and new technology 
after losses of almost 12 billion in 198286 the industry 
nationwide earned 1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double that 
for 1988 
that improvement has contributed to an upturn in gary and other 
parts of northwestern indiana site of the worlds greatest 
concentration of steelmaking capacity for example 
five steel companies in porter and lake counties the latter 
including gary have spent more than 25 billion on their 
facilities since 1982 said the indiana steel advisory commission 
indiana is americas no 1 steel producer 22 percent of the 
nations steel is made there the industry pumps almost 20 million 
daily into indianas economy 
unemployment in the garyhammond ind area fell from 157 
percent in 198283 to 95 percent in 1987 the 1987 numbers would 
have been lower but for a sixmonth walkout at uss gary works the 
citys biggest employer and flagship of usx corp 
novembers unemployment rate was 61 percent 1988 was the first 
year this decade without doubledigit employment in any month those 
figures however do not reflect huge population losses the areas 
labor force shrunk by 38100 from 1980 to november 1988 
new and expanding businesses in the gary area have filled 124 
million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6500 
jobs since 1984 much of the growth is steelrelated 
gary is one of the best heavy industrial locations in 
america said john gates an investor and redeveloper youre 
close to all the major manufacturers in the united states most of 
these peoples customers are nearby youve got very inexpensive 
rents and real estate costs 
if someone needs steel youre going to be near the biggest and 
cheapest source of supply nationwide added gates who has helped 
24 companies some from west germany and austria expand or settle 
in the area 
the newandimproved status may even be reflected in a 1988 money 
magazine survey that ranked the garyhammond area 41st among 300 
us living spots two slots above considerably more picturesque 
honolulu and up from 92nd place a year earlier 
that might seem surprising considering garys reputation as 
aging crimeinfested and polluted city planner taghi arshami says 
thats more myth than reality though he concedes garys center 
section with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres is devastated 
the problem we have generally for downtown is lack of 
investment lack of confidence on the part of business and on the 
part of banks that are not willing to put the money down he said 
but he is optimistic about developing garys downtown into a 
public and service sector hub noting that 12000 people work there 
some of garys image problems stem from lean times of the last 
decade jobs and people disappeared unemployment soared garys 
population now about 137000 fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986 
even now experts say growth in northwestern indiana is occurring 
in rural areas 
the mills shrank too while becoming more efficient 
northwestern indiana now has 35300 steelworkers a 47 percent drop 
from 1979 uss gary works has 7500 workers compared with 
2100022000 in the late 1970s 
although mill investments spur related business some say gary is 
in a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel 
the danger of gary is not that they arent doing fairly well 
said frank cassell professor emeritus of industrial relations at 
northwestern university but theyre likely to delude themselves 
into thinking that what theyre doing is the most powerful 
influence 
instead he said bigger factors are external demand the 
dollar and the nations economy gary is doing good work for 
itself thats commendable he said but one doesnt want to 
think thats the whole picture 
some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job of 
diversifying but others point to such changes as the growth of the 
health industry which provides 20400 jobs in the area 
gary is also touting recreation promotional brochures feature 
the indiana dunes and lake michigan photos of children bicycling 
along the beach a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a local 
boy who made good michael jackson 
we have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in the 
world barnes said we have far from taken full advantage of 
it 
gary hopes to rectify that with an ambitious 150200 million 
1400slip marina adjacent to the uss site that could eventually 
include a hotel shopping center and amphitheater officials hope to 
build the first 250 slips this year 
gary also hopes to have the third commercial airport in the 
chicago area its present airport provides only charter and private 
corporate service 
an expanded airport would relieve congestion at ohare 
international and midway in chicago one report said it would 
attract 65 million passengers to gary annually and create 122000 
jobs with a payroll of 16 billion 
though these projects are critical barnes said the city also has 
a much healthier manner of looking at problems whether its 
cleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs 
theres already a renewed spirit of cooperation that hasnt 
existed in 20 years said bill brown transportation planner for 
the northwestern indiana regional planning commission 
people he said feel a lot more confident about garys 
future

george herbert walker bush looks like a guy 
whod be more at home with the whiffenpoof song than soul 
man 
but by golly there was the new president up on stage trying to 
match licks and looks with lee atwater the wunderkind of gop 
politics and atavistic rhythm and blues man from columbia sc 
it was saturday night at the final and finest bash of the 
inaugural weekend a rollicking party for young americans at the 
convention center that will go down as one of the new republican 
party chairmans greatest triumphs 
atwater lived out a chuck barry fantasy on stage falling to his 
knees and writhing on his back while belting out highheeled 
sneakers with such heavy hitters as sam moore percy sledge and 
guitarists ron wood of the rolling stones and steve cropper of blues 
brothers fame as well as longtime sidekick donald duck dunn on 
bass 
and there was george bush who practically had to be dragooned 
into dancing a few ceremonial steps with the first lady at friday 
nights balls taking it all in giving a double thumbsup sign and 
then mounting the stage himself to accept a gleaming white gibson 
guitar marked the prez from moore sole survivor of the soul 
duo sam and dave 
barbara bush and several of the bush children were among the 
clapping crowd that cheered the musicians on during the frenetic jam 
session 
this has got to be the most active event of the inauguration 
said bush in the understatement of the year that was marvelous 
absolutely wonderful 
and when the band began beating out soul man the president 
dutifully began fingerpicking the prez making no sound because 
the guitar wasnt plugged in but doing a mean imitation of the fish 
face that atwater assumed at the height of his guitar ecstasy

if the atwater affair was the only inaugural party that 
registered on the richter scale the texas black tie and boots 
shindig earlier saturday night wasnt halfbad 
the president teased photographers and the crowd by lifting 
his pants leg to offer fleeting glimpses of the map of texas 
enameled on his boots 
it had to be the first time anyone ever yelled at bush take 
em off 
stop whistling at me he rejoined 
barbara bush cracked what i ought to do is make george stand 
on his head and really show you those boots 
the first couple tarried longer at the texas party than they had 
at any of the balls staying to sing both texas our texas the 
state song and god bless america

bush may have martin van buren to thank for his example of how a 
sitting vice president can capture the white house but he also has 
van buren to blame for the 15 stops he made in fridays marathon 
ballhopping 
van buren was the first president to have two inaugural balls 
and he infuriated supporters by attending only the higherpriced 
one since then every president has felt compelled to visit all the 
balls even as they multiplied into the teens 
it meant crossing the capital in a long but silent motorcade 
under moonlit skies from 8 pm est friday until 1245 am saturday 
the second stop at the district of columbia armory set the 
pattern with people in evening gowns and tuxedos jammed up against 
the stage armed with cameras intent on checking out barbaras gown 
and shaking bushs hand although it was a youth ball most of the 
people who had muscled to the front would never see 40 again 
as the hours wore on and the waits grew longer the crowds grew 
testier when the media pool came in to block their view moments 
before the presidents arrival ballgoers screamed and booed only 
to be assured by a tuxedoed secret service agent that the reporters 
would crouch when bush arrived 
the newly remodeled union station still a train depot but now 
filled with chic shops as well looked enchanting like a set from 
a hollywood movie of the 1940s with the crowd of swells lined up to 
greet the bushes who gazed down upon the scene from a balcony 
but few stops seemed as memorable there was no waltzing going on 
when the bushes came in just the same densely packed throngs 
waiting for their picture or handshake 
as the presidential party beat its retreat from one ball a 
young darkhaired woman in evening gown desperately gave a reporter 
two postcards she had hoped to give bush handwritten pleas for help 
for relatives behind the iron curtain 
a white house aide took them to forward to the presidents mail 
handlers

life is tough in the refugee camps of 
pakistan and iran for the millions of afghans who fled the civil 
war but most apparently prefer it to coming home 
more than 5 million people about onethird of the population 
have left afghanistan since the moslem insurgency began after a 
communist coup in april 1978 
by official count just 188000 have come back in the year since 
the sovietbacked government proclaimed national reconciliation 
and offered enticements to refugees who return including a 
sixmonth exemption from military service 
with the deadline for soviet withdrawal approaching and no peace 
in sight even that trickle is slowing 
red army soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 were in the country when the withdrawal began may 
15 under a unmediated agreement half had left by aug 15 and all 
are to be gone by feb 15 
afghan officials accuse pakistani bureaucrats and insurgent 
leaders of siphoning off international aid intended for the refugee 
camps 
that gulbuddin hekmatyar hes got 300 cars its from the 
money for the camps mirkhall jalla deputy minister for 
repatriation said of one leaders of the sevenparty guerrilla 
alliance based in pakistan 
pakistan iran the opposition parties they prevemt them 
refugees from coming by force with guns and they plant land 
mines on the border he said without the refugees they have 
nothing 
jalla denied reports of government bribes to returning refugees 
particularly young men wanted for the army 
he insisted in an interview that the regime of president najib 
asks no questions of returning refugees and would take no reprisals 
against guerrillas or sympathizers who come home under the program 
even if the guerrillas believe that they still are fighting the 
soviets and the najib government with aid that comes primarily from 
the united states and pakistan 
because the insurgents control most of the countryside families 
who fled villages devastated by soviet and afghan bombing raids 
would return under guerrilla auspices 
for such peasant families fear of mines and of continuing war 
after the soviet withdrawal are major deterrents to repatriation 
millions of mines have been planted in a decade of war 
the map in jallas office has a look of unreality some of the 
colored buttons marking 28 government reception centers for refugees 
are well within guerrilla territory 
nearly all refugees who reach the capital are from iran 
afghanistans western neighbor kabuls guest house has room for 700 
people but often is empty 
the refugees tales are similar flight from war hearing about 
the repatriation plan and paying other afghan exiles to take them to 
the border young men speaking through an official interpreter 
told a reporter they would be willing to join the army after the 
sixmonth exemption 
hashem 18 said he was barely 10 when he and an uncle fled to 
pakistan then iran from their village in the central province of 
oruzgan he is illiterate has had no contact with his parents and 
said longing for them caused his return 
i heard there was a new policy he said i wanted to come 
home i want to see my parents ill go into the army when they 
say 
no one at the kabul center knew whether hashems parents were 
alive 
the un refugee agency known as the high commissioner for 
refugees established a kabul office in june but dutch director 
reinout wanrooy said there really isnt much we can do 
our expectation was that people might come back in large 
numbers this spring or before now we think they might wait another 
year but if things get worse after the soviets leave the refugee 
problem in pakistan may get worse 
both pakistan and the insurgents seem opposed to the return of 
refugees partly because the afghan mountain fighters are more 
effective without families who need protection and are in danger of 
air or artillery attack 
little aid is available for afghans returning home most western 
nations refuse to deal with najib and expect his government to fall 
after soviet forces are gone his government says its program could 
handle a million people but that seems doubtful in a desperately 
poor nation devastated by war 
the soviet union made the major contribution 600 million to a 
11 billion rehabilitation fund set up by the united nations but 
most of that is in blankets and tents not money 
afghan officials say the equivalent of about 5 million already 
has been spent to bring back refugees including compensation for 
seized or destroyed property

alderman timothy evans bypassing the democratic 
primary in favor of a thirdparty bid for mayor submitted 100000 
petition signatures monday for a spot on the april 4 election ballot 
evans running under the harold washington party named for the 
citys first black mayor said he turned in four times the number of 
names needed to qualify a thirdparty candidacy for mayor 
what you see is a testament to the thousands of people who 
participated who passed the petitions who signed the petitions 
evans told a crowd of 200 supporters at city hall 
he is skipping the democratic primary to avoid splitting the 
black vote with mayor eugene sawyer evans and sawyer are both black 
unless the petition signatures fail to withstand challenges 
evans will meet the winners of the democratic and republican 
primaries in an election that will determine who serves the 
remaining two years in washingtons term 
while filing his petitions he pledged to reform what he called 
the remnants of the political machine of late mayor richard j 
daley who died 12 years ago 
daleys son cook county states attorney ricard m daley is the 
democratic frontrunner attracting support from whites hispanics 
and some blacks but sawyer appears to be chipping away at the lead 
according to polls 
we dont know who our opponents will be but weve got to 
defeat the daley machine evans said 
washington suffered a heart attack and died in november 1987 
evans was his floor leader in the city council

the bottom line about songs of paradise at 
the offbroadway public theater is that youll enjoy it a lot more 
if you understand yiddish than if you dont 
this retelling of the story of genesis in yiddish has just enough 
english narration and singing to let the englishonly speaker 
realize that its amusing but there is much humor that the 
nonyiddish speaker cant share 
songs of paradise which opened monday is a purimshpiel a 
telling of a biblical story in an idiomatic way it uses broad humor 
but without a tone of disrespect 
the musical takes us through the stories of adam and eve cain 
and abel abraham his wife sarah and concubine hagar essau and 
jacob jacob and his wives leah and rachel and joseph 
adam dressed in a hawaiian shirt trades a bone for eve the 
serpent is a puppet on the hand of a man dressed as a tree and 
wearing a tshirt that reads dont eat the apples 
essau is a brandolike motorcyclist who trades his birthright to 
jacob for a bowl of lentil soup in rifkes diner jacobs dream 
with three angels dressed like house painters is narrated by a tv 
sports announcer 
when jacob gets to his uncles house uncle laban does a groucho 
marx imitation leah her biological clock relentlessly ticking 
away and rachel fight for jacob with boxing gloves 
all this could be very amateurish but the performances are

crime rose sharply last year in part because of 
economic development with serious crimes such as murder and 
robbery increasing 657 percent the vice minister of public 
security was quoted today as saying 
vice minister yu lei said 827000 crimes were reported last year 
up 451 percent from 1987 the official china daily newspaper 
reported 
he said 80 percent of all the crimes were theft 
yu blamed the crime increase on economic development which made 
more goods and money available to some people and on the countrys 
transient population peddlers construction workers and drifters 
now estimated at 50 million 
yu said drug trafficking and smuggling by overseas gangs also 
increased but china still has one of the lowest crime rates in the 
world

hundreds of soldiers backed by 
tanks and mortars regained control of most of an infantry base 
monday night after 15 hours of gun battles with civilian commandos 
the government said were leftist guerrillas 
five soldiers were killed and more than 30 soldiers and police 
wounded the government news agency telam reported carlos becerra 
secretary general to president raul alfonsin said at least 20 
commandos were killed 
at 930 pm a handful of commandos were holed up in an officers 
club that soldiers had attacked with tanks and set on fire 
moments earlier a small armory exploded sending bright flames 
100 yards high into the darkness sporadic gunfire and an occasional 
mortar round could be heard from inside the spacious compound 
the battles began when an estimated 30 to 50 commandos used a 
stolen coca cola delivery truck to crash through the main gate of 
the 3rd infantry regiment in la tablada on the outskirts of buenos 
aires 
the casualty toll was much higher than in the three military 
insurrections against alfonsins government during the past 21 
months 
in the military revolts of april 1987 and january and december 
1988 soldiers were extremely reluctant to fire on fellow soldiers 
the commandos did not identify themselves or state their motives 
but a woman who called the independent news agency diarios y 
noticias said she was part of the commando group and said it acted 
to prevent a military coup 
it was to defend democracy and now theyre massacring us 
said the woman who refused to identify herself or the commando 
group please do something 
military officials and government spokesmen including alfonsins 
press secretary jose ignacio lopez said the commandos were leftist 
guerrillas and not soldiers or members of a rightwing group 
no similar incidents were reported at other bases throughout this 
south american country of 31 million 
the officials offered little evidence to support their contention 
that the commandos were leftists but party leaders and unions from 
across the political spectrum who denounced the incident did not 
challenge the governments claim 
hundreds of area residents who gathered outside the base shouted 
support for the troops kill them people shouted as troops led 
away commandos captured after they fled burning smoking buildings 
live national television coverage showed tanks rumbling along 
city streets bleeding soldiers carried to ambulances and 
helicopters residents fleeing and burning smoking buildings 
cesar jaroslavsky president of the ruling radical civic unions 
bloc in the house of deputies said some of the commandos were 
members of the peoples revolutionary army which engaged soldiers in 
open battle a decade ago but has been inactive since he identified 
one as jose luis caldu but he provided no details 
after entering la tablada at about 6 am the commandos found 
themselves trapped almost immediately when buenos aires provincial 
police surrounded the base 12 miles northwest of the capital 
by early afternoon the commandos were confined to the red brick 
officers club and several other buildings soldiers including 
members of an elite paratroop brigade blasted the buildings with 
tanks and mortars and set them on fire 
some fled the base and hid out in buildings firing sniperstyle 
at police and soldiers local news agencies reported the firing 
dropped off after nightfall leading to speculation that some 
commandos escaped 
the incident was the most serious of its kind since a combined 
attack by montonero and erp guerrillas on the monte chingolo army 
arsenal nine miles south of buenos aires in 1975 
government house in downtown buenos aires where alfonsin was at 
work monday and the presidents official residence in suburban 
olivos were reinforced with additional troops 
defense minister horacio jaunarena and army chief gen francisco 
gassino took steps to retake the la tablada base immediately and 
sent elite airborne troops to assist soldiers and provincial police 
only about 100 officers and troops were at la tablada at the time 
of the attack and the rest were spending the weekend off base 
telam said several dozen escaped from captivity after the 
counterattack began 
buenos aires provincial police quickly surrounded the base 
evacuated some area residents diverted traffic and took up 
sharpshooter positions in homes and buildings 
the commandos threw out pamphlets saying long live rico and 
long live seineldin as they entered the base they referred to 
the leaders of the three military insurrections cashiered lt col 
aldo rico and col mohamed ali seineldin 
the pamphlets created the impression the commandos were 
rightwingers who supported the military position that the trials of 
officers for human rights abuses committed during the 197683 
military dictatorship should be terminated 
rico and seineldin both of whom are in military prison had 
demanded cancellation of the trials and amnesty for those officers 
already convicted 
military sources said the commandos may have intended only to 
steal weapons from the base and depart quickly leaving the 
pamphlets behind to throw off pursuers

those beachbronzed aussies are paler 
this southern summer because they say the fabled sydney shores are 
too polluted for safety 
state officials claim pollution is no worse than 30 years ago 
but a cleanup of sydney harbor by 20000 volunteers this month 
produced tons of garbage including a car 3000 syringes and 
hundreds of tires and shopping carts 
lifeguards are getting vaccinations against hepatitis b because 
of the dirty water syringes and broken glass 
you dont need to be a scientist to realize that things are 
getting worse said barton lynch world surfing champion who will 
not train at the wellknown bondi and manly beaches because of 
pollution 
des renford who swam the english channel said he has stopped 
training at many of sydneys 37 beaches solely due to the 
pollution 
some are in a disgusting state he said and drew this 
comparison polluting the ocean is like pouring sewage over the 
opera house 
on monday the daily telegraph joined radio station 2day in 
asking the new south wales government to clean up the mess 
give us back our beaches the newspaper said in an appeal to 
nick greiner the state premier it said the gross pollution of 
sydneys beaches is an immense problem that could frustrate the 
effort to attract more than 2 million tourists a year 
at the very least it is stopping tourists getting full 
enjoyment from their holidays the daily telegraph declared at 
worst it is turning them off and away 
surfline which monitors beach pollution daily said it had 
issued 170 warnings since the southern hemisphere summer began oct 
1 and that six beaches were hazardous 
we dont want to cause a major panic but something has to be 
done said gus staunton of the surf life saving association which 
is associated with surfline it is a major health risk 
his group said monday it is encouraging its 64000 members to be 
vaccinated against hepatitis b because of the health risks involved 
in patrolling beaches and saving lives 
lifesavers fall into a much higher risk than most because they 
are often required to rescue people who are bleeding from injury or 
who need mouthtomouth resuscitation said ian mackie 
association medical officer 
in addition there are an increasing number of used 
hypodermic needles being found on australian beaches and if they 
accidentally pricked themselves they could end up with the 
disease he said 
water board spokesman christopher speary said the state 
government was spending 490 million 400 million us to build 
three longrange ocean outfalls and upgrade existing sewage and 
industrial waste treatment facilities 
by 1991 the problem will be fixed he told the associated 
press 
speary said 1 million tons of sewage is dumped each day off 
sydney a city of 35 million residents he blamed complaints of 
pollution on isolated incidents like a huge oil slick three weeks 
ago and the dumping of more than 500 gallons of paint by mistake 
i dont accept the beaches are now more polluted than they were 
30 years ago he said 
existing sewage outlets were built during the edwardian era when 
necktoknee suits were required for bathing and sydney was a very 
small town speary said nobody could have known it would grow 
into the sprawling metropolis that it has 
the water board sponsors television commercials asking housewives 
not to pour oil and other greasy substances down kitchen drains 
were spending millions of dollars to clean the beaches but you 
wont be able to see where its going one says

the highest courts of the state and the 
nation refused monday night to block the tuesday morning execution 
of ted bundy who during the last three days confessed to 20 murders 
in western states 
the 42yearold law school dropout was described as subdued and 
emotional as he met with psychiatrist dorothy lewis apparently as 
part of his lawyers preparations for a possible lastminute 
argument that bundy was mentally incompetent to be executed 
gov martinez told reporters in tallahassee three psychiatrists 
were standing by to examine bundy if necessary and certify his 
mental competency 
after confessing during the weekend to two colorado murders he 
talked with colorado investigators again monday but disclosed no 
information about three unsolved slayings in the state officials 
said 
bundy also met with james dobson host of a california christian 
radio show during the afternoon in a onehour interview dobson 
said bundy tearfully expressed great remorse but wanted to 
stress that he believes hardcore pornography was the fuel for his 
fantasies that spurred him into violent crimes 
dobson a psychologist whose show focus on the family is 
heard daily on about 1300 radio stations said bundy admitted he 
was a murderer and said society had a right to protect itself from 
people with his weakness 
dobson said bundy now is thankful that again he is in touch 
with his feelings and his guilt and he feels great remorse for what 
hes done 
bundy was scheduled to die in floridas electric chair at 7 am 
tuesday for the 1978 kidnapmurder of 12yearold kimberly leach of 
lake city he also was convicted of killing two sorority sisters in 
tallahassee in 1978 
us supreme court justices voted 54 to reject an emergency 
request aimed at keeping bundy alive until a formal appeal could be 
filed with the nations highest court the justices had four times 
previously rejected formal appeals from bundy 
bundys lawyers argued that jurors in the leach case were misled 
about the importance of their role in determining whether bundy 
would receive the death penalty or life in prison for his crime in 
florida juries in capital cases recommend a punishment but the 
presiding judge is free to accept or reject the recommendation 
the justices rejected a related argument by a 63 vote and they 
voted 72 to turn down a request to delay the execution until the 
high court could hear an appeal claiming that bundys death sentence 
was tainted because his lawyers were not shown all the information 
considered in the sentencing 
the attorneys also filed an appeal in state supreme court 
claiming the jury instructions were improper the state supreme 
court on monday night denied his request for a stay and denied 
related requests for stays so that higher courts could review it 
said supreme court deputy clerk tanya carroll 
we gave him nothing she said 
meanwhile a forensic psychologist in portland ore said he 
believes bundy started his killings in the east long before the 
seattle murder that is the first publicly linked to the condemned 
killer the oregonian newspaper reported in tuesdays editions 
the psychologist art norman spent 90 to 100 hours interviewing 
bundy over 15 months in 1986 and 1987 while working on bundys first 
appeal of his death sentences bundy attended temple university in 
philadelphia in 1969 
it is the fourth time an execution has been set for bundy 
but this weekend he began confessing to a string of murders he 
has been linked to as many as 36 killings and disappearances of 
young women in washington colorado utah and other western states 
but colorado attorney general duane woodard accused him of 
stringing along investigators to avoid or delay execution 
martinez said the execution would go forward whether or not bundy 
has time to tell all he knows about killings and locations of bodies 
i think the way in which ted perhaps is using the confessions 
to bargain for time with the law enforcement people has been 
difficult for some folks to deal with the rev david ernst 
pastor of the tacoma wash church where bundys family worships 
weekly said in an interview sunday 
a san diego man william taylor asked martinez to put off the 
execution until bundy could say if he was involved in the january 
1968 disappearance of his sister in concord nh 
martinez aide brian ballard said monday that even the 
approximately 100 requests similar to taylors would not make the 
governor delay the execution 
its easy to see how people who oppose the death penalty on 
principle make an exception for bundy said kathleen taylor of the 
american civil liberties union in seattle anybody in their right 
mind hates that man youre going get that kind of emotional 
response she said 
once cocky and confident in the courtroom bundy acted monday 
like a man who believed his time may be running out a prison 
spokesman said 
hes more emotional and subdued than under the previous 
three death warrants said bob macmaster a prison spokesman 
he knows what he is doing he knows why he is confessing his 
only remorse is that he got caught and hes going to die said 
hugh aynesworth coauthor of a bundy book called the only living 
witness 
salt lake county sheriffs detective dennis couch said sunday 
that bundy mentioned his involvement in up to eight utah killings 
two more than authorities had suspected earlier sunday bundy 
confessed to two murders in idaho where officials had never linked 
him to any killings 
idaho attorney general jim jones said a number of police agencies 
were asked to come to boise to talk about bundy and determine which 
old cases might be connected with his confession 
bundy also provided investigators friday and saturday with 
details of eight washington killings and two in colorado for which 
he has long been suspected authorities said 
michael radelet a university of florida sociology professor and 
bundys paralegal assistant for a decade said there was 
disagreement in the bundy camp about his decision to talk about the 
crimes 
for the last three days ive been trying to get him to shut 
up the way hes doing it now is a sideshow and a circus he said 
adding bundy should have provided details only through his lawyers

south korea and north korea are 
involved in the biggest drive since the korean war to reduce the 
tensions between them the bitter rivals are talking about 
everything from a nonaggression pact to trade and cultural 
exchanges 
in recent months they have bombarded each other with proposals on 
ending their 40year confrontation and both show a willingness to 
talk that would have been unthinkable even a year ago 
expectations are running high for achieving peace and stability 
on the basis of improved relations with north korea and working 
together toward the longrange objective of reunification the 
korea times said in a jan 19 editorial 
but even optimistic observers warn against expecting a sudden 
breakthrough they say that long and difficult negotiations will be 
needed to make even minimal progress past talks on improving 
relations have failed 
just the fact that they are talking is a big step and the wide 
range of possible contacts is unprecedented said a western 
diplomatic observer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the two nations technically are still at war since they did not 
sign a peace treaty at the end of the korean war in 1953 each 
claims to be the legitimate government of korea 
north korea agreed jan 16 to a south korean proposal for talks 
between the nations prime ministers in what would be the highest 
level of contact ever between the sides preliminary talks are to 
begin feb 8 on procedural issues 
lawmakers from both sides are to resume meeting feb 10 on 
clearing the way for separate parliamentary talks on a 
nonaggression agreement and other issues 
south korean president roh taewoo said on jan 17 his government 
was working on a new policy under which the two sides could work as 
partners south korea no longer wanted to see the communist nation 
as an enemy he said 
besides clearing the way for trade and exchanges between south 
and north korea i will realize interkorean summit talks in the 
near future and achieve epochmaking progress in resolving the 
korean question he said 
trade has begun for the first time with seoul importing north 
korean goods in small quantities and south korean companies seeking 
permission for deals worth tens of millions of dollars north korea 
has indicated it may accept joint economic ventures seoul officials 
say 
the chairman of south koreas powerful hyundai conglomerate 
chung juyung left saturday for north korea on the firstever visit 
by a top south korean businessman to discuss possible trade ventures 
proposals have been made for personnel and cultural exchanges 
including visits to the north by south korean students academics 
and doctors but the north has indicated such exchanges may depend 
on political progress 
south korea long one of the worlds most anticommunist nations 
is making strides in developing ties with the soviet union china 
and other allies of north korea to ease tensions and persuade 
pyongyang to seek better relations 
the united states has expressed guarded hope that the peace 
feelers could produce major changes about 42000 us troops are 
based in south korea under a mutual defense treaty 
the korean peninsula is one of the worlds major trouble spots 
hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops on both sides face 
each other on the 150mile border and the archrivals have clashed 
repeatedly over the years 
the border is sealed and the the only link is a single hot line 
the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by us and soviet forces 
which ended the japanese colonial occupation 
chances of improving relations depend largely on how serious 
north korea is about changing its stance toward the south south 
korean officials and western diplomats say there are signs that 
little has changed in the north 
north korean leader kim il sung continues to rule over one of the 
worlds most repressive totalitarian states kim launched the 1950 
invasion that started the korean war and still talks of 
liberating the south 
there is no sign of soviet style reforms in north korea and 
there may be little hope of major change while kim rules north 
korea often has attacked the south and it was widely blamed for the 
1987 bombing of a south korean airliner that killed all 115 people 
aboard 
but north korea reportedly faces growing problems 
its economy is collapsing after years of mismanagement and the 
souths increasingly powerful economy may be the best hope of help 
the south korean officials and diplomats said moreover north korea 
may fear international isolation if it continues its belligerent 
position they said 
seoul officials concede the north may be trying to use the talks 
to secure withdrawal of us forces from south korea pyongyang has 
said the annual ussouth korea team spirit military exercises must 
end if there is to be progress in negotiations 
despite his optimism roh said any progress would be gradual and 
stressed the need for a strong defense and retaining us forces he 
ruled out unilateral arms cuts by seoul 
roh also is seen as having political motives for pushing for a 
breakthrough his government lacks support among many south koreans 
and the president hopes his northern policy may reduce domestic 
opposition even if it fails

meat producers say the agriculture department 
should give them more time to review proposed changes in federal 
regulations designed to ensure the safety of precooked hamburgers 
and certain other kinds of meat patties 
the american meat institute said monday that a 30day comment 
period does not give the industry enough time to study rules 
proposed by the departments food safety and inspection service on 
dec 27 
the proposed rules would establish requirements for the storage 
of raw ingredients processing times and temperatures handling to 
prevent contamination after processing and labels that include 
cooking instructions 
last month agency administrator lester m crawford said there 
had been increasing evidence over the past several years that 
foodborne pathogens survive in products that many consumers 
erroneously consider to be fully cooked 
but george d wilson the meat institutes vice president of 
science and prepared meats said in a letter to the federal agency 
that contrary to suggestions in the proposal ami fails to see the 
grounds for associating a public health emergency with the 
production and consumption of precooked meat patties 
products that would be covered by the rules include items 
marketed as charbroiled beef patties and prebrowned fresh 
pork sausage patties according to crawford 
recently he said a bacterial strain was linked to an outbreak 
of food poisoning which hospitalized six minnesota school children 
with severe diarrhea and cramps 
crawford said the centers for disease control determined that 
undercooked beef patties caused the illness although the specific 
bacterial strain that infected the children has not been isolated 
crawford said that under the proposed rules for example a label 
for partially cooked ground meat patties would bear the statement 
partially cooked for safety cook until well done internal 
temperature of 160 f 
wilson disputing the need for such rules said agriculture 
department laboratory tests did not confirm the presence of the 
specific bacteria implicated in the minnesota incident 
wilson said the proposal was hastily prepared using an 
associated but inappropriate data base resulting in a proposed 
regulation which is a product safety overkill and is commercially 
impractical

dairy farmers are still feeling cost effects of 
last years drought but agriculture department analysts say 1989 
milk output could still edge higher to another record 
droughtcaused increases in feed costs probably will have some 
effect on milk output in the first half but 1989 milk production is 
likely to total about the same or slightly higher than the year 
before the departments economic research service said monday 
milk production rose to a record level of 1453 billion pounds in 
1988 due entirely to a boost of almost 3 percent in milk output per 
cow the number of cows declined by 1 percent to a record low 
average of 102 million head during the year 
any production rises should be easily absorbed by a 1 percent 
to 3 percent rise in commercial use the report said government 
purchases probably will decline to 5 billion to 7 billion pounds 
milk equivalent from 88 billion in 1988 
the department buys surplus cheese butter and nonfat dry milk 
to support the price of milk paid to farmers by dealers 
retail dairy prices rose in december and are higher than they 
have been in recent years at this time the report said over all of 
1989 retail prices of dairy products are expected to gain an 
average of 2 percent to 4 percent compared with last years 2 
percent 
a late1988 surge in domestic commercial use of milk and dairy 
products is combining with a vigorous export demand for nonfat dry 
milk to create strong dairy markets in early 1989 the report said

the agriculture department says it will begin 
charging a fee for the voluntary or industrysolicited inspection of 
tobacco for export 
j patrick boyle administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said monday the fee will be 00025 per pound or 
a rate of 25 cents per 100 pounds of tobacco he said the fee will 
recover costs of salaries and other expenses 
the new fee scheduled to take effect jan 24 does not affect 
charges for any inspection or grading service for tobacco used 
domestically he said

an advocacy group says that despite george

mark in the 101st congress 
the group americans for democratic action based its prediction 
in part on an analysis of the voting records of members of congress 
in 1988 which showed the house of representatives with a liberal 
quotient of 52 percent the highest figure since ada began rating 
voting records in 1947 
in the senate the average score was 48 percent on the key 
liberalconservative issues selected by ada for its ratings 
the groups national director marc pearl noted that senators 
who were up for reelection last year averaged higher liberal scores 
than the rest of the senate and their liberal voting records 
proved not to be a liability 
an exception pearl did not mention was lowell p weicker jr of 
connecticut at 90 percent the highestscoring senate republican 
who was beaten last november by democrat joseph lieberman 
because so many champions of social and economic justice have 
been elected and reelected and the democrats have added seats in 
both chambers the prospects for holding president bush accountable 
on his campaign pledge to create a kinder gentler nation appear 
excellent pearl said in a statement 
he noted that even bush raised many issues during the campaign 
which the ada considers part of its legislative agenda including 
child care education and environmental protection 
in spite of the gratuitous rhetorical beating that liberals 
took during the presidential campaign support for our agenda 
remained strong and solid pearl said 
pearl also noted that in the senate leadership sen robert byrd 
dwva who had a 55 percent ada rating in 1988 has been replaced 
as majority leader by sen george mitchell dmaine who had a 95 
percent rating 
a new congress and a new president have the responsibility to 
restore the social and economic balance that was so severely 
shredded during the reagan years pearl said given the results 
of 1988 we are optimistic that the 101st congress will have the 
muscle to do it 
the ada vote ratings for each chamber are based on a set of 20 
floor votes on bills and amendments that the organization believes 
most clearly reflect liberalconservative differences issues 
include civil rights labor issues womens rights foreign and 
military policy 
twentyfour house members all democrats scored 100 percent 
along with two senate democrats twentyfive house members all 
republicans had scores of zero along with 11 senate republicans

raising social security benefits for a few 
million retirees who think they are being discriminated against 
because of the notch problem could jeopardize the entire pension 
system government auditors and other witnesses told a senate panel 
the argument that the notch represents a major inequity is not 
compelling says the general accounting office an arm of congress 
that oversees federal agencies 
many of the 66 million to 7 million people who were born between 
1917 and 1921 the socalled notch babies think otherwise 
they have been complaining to their lobbyists and members of 
congress for several years that they are being robbed of part of 
their monthly social security checks 
but even if there were merit to solving the problem doing so 
may not be a prudent course of action at this time joseph f 
delfico senior associate director of gao told the senate finance 
social security subcommittee monday 
he cited the competing needs to reduce deficits meet other 
pressing national needs and maintain the social security system on a 
path toward financial health 
the problem was created in 1977 when congress cut back a 
generous costoflivingallowance formula enacted in 1972 the new 
formula was phased in and affected those born from 1917 through 1921 
as a result some retirees born a year or two before 1917 can get 
about 100 more a month in pensions than can a person under similar 
circumstances who was born during the notch period the difference 
in benefits for those two groups is called the notch 
we are concerned that you and your colleagues have 
underestimated the damage to the integrity of the social security 
system that the notch and the failure to correct it has caused 
bruce sumner a director of the national committee to preserve 
social security and medicare told the subcommittee 
but the american association of retired persons and the national 
council of senior citizens urged congress not to tinker with the law 
for the benefit of the notch babies 
to focus on the unwarranted demands of one small group of 
beneficiaries could threaten the fiscal soundness of social 
security thereby affecting everyone said eugene lehrmann of 
madison wis vice chairman of aarp 
hardest hit by the notch problem are highearning retirees who 
had long careers and worked past their 62nd birthday 
some bills propose to correct the problem by raising social 
security taxes which would affect most workers others would reduce 
benefits to those born before 1917 still others would boost 
benefits for the notch group and pay for the increase by raising the 
federal deficit 
using existing social security trust funds for this purpose 
could put the system at additional risk should we experience an 
economic downturn in the next few years said gaos delfico 
robert j myers former chief actuary for the social security 
system chaired a special nongovernment nonpartisan panel of 
social security experts that studied the notch problem the panel 
he told the finance subcommittee recommends that congress take no 
legislative action on the notch benefit issue 
the real problem is that those persons who were born before 
1917 who worked well beyond age 62 after 1978 receive undue 
windfalls myers said those born after 1916 are equitably 
treated consistent with the intent of congress and receive proper 
benefit amounts 
there is no reason why younger workers should over the years 
pay more taxes to provide windfall benefits to this group myers 
said conversely although there is a case for reducing gradually 
or otherwise the windfall benefits for some persons born before 
1917 this would not now be equitable

a couple in their 80s who had been 
missing at sea for almost five days four of them without food or 
fresh water were plucked from an island on the south carolina 
coast by a marine helicopter monday 
im telling you it was worth all the tea in china to see that 
helicopter thomas pettigrew 81 said from a hospital bed at 
beaufort memorial hospital where he and his 80yearold wife katie 
were listed in fair condition 
the pettigrews left charleston early thursday on a daylong 
fishing trip in their 18foot fiberglass boat 
after being blown out to sea running out of gas and being tossed 
about in 12foot waves the craft washed up late saturday on bay 
point island about 50 miles southwest of charleston 
the couple were spotted monday afternoon by a helicopter on a 
training exercise from the marine corps air station in beaufort 
authorities said 
they were transported to the hospital by the helicopter said 
petty officer james turner of the charleston coast guard base 
the coast guard had started a search of the offshore waters 
friday after the couple were reported overdue at the lockwood 
municipal marina but the search was suspended late sunday 
a storm system that moved through the area over the weekend 
brought winds of 25 to 45 mph temperatures dropped to 35 degrees in 
charleston early sunday 
considering the fact that they have had no food for four days 
and significant exposure i think theyre doing great said dr 
lester haddad the director of the emergency room at the hospital 
when they got to the hospital the first thing we gave them was 
a good meal he added 
he said the couple would remain in the hospital at least 
overnight for observation and treatment for exposure 
pettigrew said he never gave up hope through the ordeal with his 
wife of 44 years 
no i always had hope i didnt give up my hopes he said 
pettigrew added he had no doubt the couple would be rescued when 
they washed ashore on the island 
i wasnt afraid of anything no more once i got on that 
island he said i knew i was on dry land i was hoping i would 
get something to eat 
lt quain kahler of the coast guard said there was a caretakers 
cottage on the uninhabited island about 500 yards off the beach 
where the couple could have gotten food but he said the couple 
didnt know it was there 
haddad said the couple is doing well and its nice to have a 
happy story to report for once

civil rights leaders say the supreme courts 
latest affirmative action ruling puts a chill on efforts by states 
and cities to help minority businesses 
but others say the potential harm from the decision can be 
overcome with more careful development of remedies to past 
discrimination 
the justices ruled 63 in an opinion released monday to strike 
down a richmond va plan that set aside 30 percent of the value of 
public works projects for companies at least half owned by 
minorities 
the quota violated the constitution by imposing reverse 
discrimination on whiteowned contractors the court said 
the courts decision is a grievous blow to the struggle of 
blacks to gain a fair share of the american dream said benjamin 
l hooks executive director of the naacp one would have to be 
blind not to know that racial discrimination flourishes in the 
construction business and this decision will help ensure that it 
continues 
but hooks and others said the ruling is far from the death knell 
for affirmative action 
you have to show with more particularity that there is 
discrimination said john payton a lawyer who argued richmonds 
case before the high court i dont think the court meant to 
articulate a standard for upholding an affirmative plan that cant 
be met 
ron ellis of the naacp legal defense fund said the ruling means 
the court is going to require much more dotting of is and crossing 
of ts before remedial plans can go into effect that creates more 
of a burden for state and local governments 
the ruling could have farreaching impact on public works 
setaside programs and possibly other forms of affirmative action 
as well 
most states and more than 190 local governments have such 
setaside programs according to a study by the minority business 
enterprise legal defense education fund 
executive director j thomas cochran of the us conference of 
mayors which supports setasides said many setaside programs 
could come to a halt and the delivery of municipal services would be 
jeopardized 
but jim supica president of the associated general contractors 
welcomed the ruling and said business leaders should respond by 
voluntarily eliminating bias 
the injustices that some construction contractors have suffered 
under quota requirements have surely brought home to us the 
injustices visited upon minority enterprises by the discrimination 
that existed in our history but which has no place in todays 
society he said 
the decision also was applauded by the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith as a firm rejection of the false concept that each 
racial group is entitled to its share of public jobs and contracts 
writing for the court justice sandra day oconnor said that 
richmond once the seat of the old confederacy and now with a 
majority of blacks on its governing body improperly relied on 
past societal discrimination to justify the quota 
none of the evidence presented by the city points to any 
identified discrimination in the richmond construction industry 
she said 
richmonds population is about half black the citys 
minorityowned businesses historically have received less than 1 
percent of the value of the citys public building contracts 
according to court records 
justice thurgood marshall in a stinging dissent said the ruling 
sounds a fullscale retreat from the courts longstanding 
solicitude to raceconscious remedial efforts 
todays decision marks a deliberate and giant step backward in 
this courts affirmative action jurisprudence he said 
the court in recent years has upheld key affirmative action 
programs in many areas although always by narrow margins and with 
no clear consensus on how to evaluate their lawfulness 
mondays decision is in contrast to a 1980 ruling that upheld a 
congressional plan requiring that 10 percent of federal public works 
contracts be earmarked for minoritycontrolled businesses 
oconnor said congress has unique power to legislate against 
discrimination she said rigid quotas might be justifiable had 
richmond tried racially neutral alternatives first and if that 
failed then adopted a narrowly tailored plan based on evidence 
that whiteowned companies systematically excluded minority 
businesses as subcontractors 
in other action the court 
ruled in a case from florida that police do not need court 
warrants before searching from helicopters for marijuana growing in 
fenced yards 
rejected an effort to preserve longshoremens jobs threatened by 
changing technology labor leaders warned that without the courts 
help strikes that have disrupted the industry for more than 20 years 
could resume 
refused to let a financially troubled utility company increase 
electric rates to help pay for the nuclear power plant in seabrook 
nh 
rejected an appeal by actress vanessa redgrave who sought to 
revive a suit against the boston symphony orchestra for canceling 
her performances following threats by protesters

queen elizabeth ii once had a musical tribute 
composed just for her by duke ellington but 31 years passed before 
it got its first live public performance 
the queens daughter anne was guest of honor at a royal 
festival hall benefit concert monday night to hear the 15minute 
work the queens suite performed by us musician bob wilber 
and his band 
duke was so overwhelmed at meeting with the queen in 1958 that 
he composed this longer orchestral work for her recorded it with 
his band and instructed that only a single disc should be pressed 
for the queen herself wilber said in a preconcert interview 
because no sheet music existed wilber transcribed it by 
listening to the music which ellingtons son mercer allowed to be 
issued on a disc for public sale in 1976 two years after his 
fathers death 
duke set a precedent for his extended music with the queens 
suite because its about nature wilber said all his previous 
compositions were about city life this is in six parts and is about 
sunsets insects birds animals and the single petal of a rose 
wilber described the queens suite as a short pretty work 
considered by musicians and critics comparable with dukes other 
longer compositions

cocaine mixed up in shipments of fruit pulp and 
anchovies were among us customs service discoveries that led to 
record seizures in the past three months 
a lot of it is coming in by ship which have these tremendously 
huge containers customs spokesman dennis shimkoski said monday as 
he announced seizures of almost 23 tons of cocaine in the first 
quarter of fiscal 1989 
sometimes its in hollowedout lumber he said weve found 
it in shipments of beeswax fruit pulp industrial gear boxes 
anchovies and false walls of containers 
occasionally bags of the drug were interspersed in huge 
containers of items such as chocolates bulk lumber and fruit pulp 
but sometimes the cocaine was just mixed in with such cargo 
requiring it to be cooked out later he said 
with the technology that they use the skys the limit on what 
theyll try next said shimkoski 
according to customs figures announced monday the service seized 
45530 pounds of cocaine just short of 23 tons between oct 1 
and dec 31 1988 which is the first quarter of fiscal 1989 that 
was 11276 more pounds than in the same months in 1987 a onethird 
increase he said 
much of the cocaine found mixed with other cargo was discovered 
through the automated commercial system which uses computers to 
compare cargo manifests to find who the highrisk importers might 
be or the highrisk imports shimkoski said 
for the entire 1988 fiscal year which ended sept 30 1988 
customs officers took in a record high 138808 pounds of cocaine 
nearly as much as they took in the two previous years combined 
the drug enforcement administration is estimating that cocaine 
production overseas is decreasing in fiscal 1989 from a high in 
fiscal 1988 
this would mean that the dramatic increase in seizures by customs 
in the first quarter of fiscal 1989 reflected an actual cut in the 
amount of cocaine coming in not just a cut in a much larger supply 
said dea spokesman maurice hill 
without a doubt its a cut in imports hill said but you 
realize with the numbers were dealing with its not a dent 
in fiscal 1989 production of finished cocaine by the four major 
producing countries colombia peru bolivia and ecuador will 
range from 708400 pounds to 919600 pounds according to dea 
estimates 
meanwhile the customs services 21 international mail branches 
in fiscal 1988 seized record quantities of other drugs heroin 
opium and marijuana shimkoski said 
those branches seized 164 pounds of heroin compared with just 23 
pounds in fiscal 1987 he said meanwhile opium seizures increased 
from 1019 pounds to 1600 pounds and marijuana seizures increased 
from 1141 to 1310 pounds there were no significant amounts of 
cocaine mailed he said 
to increase such seizures in the future the customs service is 
cooperating with the postal service on a program in which mail from 
29 highrisk drug sources countries would be cleared at the port of 
arrival 
this will prevent ground transfers to inland destinations 
eliminates potential monkey business that could occur if the bags 
were not checked immediately shimkoski said

an interagency intelligence panel in the bush 
administration could determine whether additional criminal charges 
are dropped against fired national security aide oliver l north 
the group began its review after us district judge gerhard 
gesell issued a sealed order last thursday detailing how much 
classified information must be disclosed by the defense in order for 
north to get a fair trial 
no final decisions have been made sources familiar with the 
process said monday speaking on condition of anonymity 
an earlier review by the interagency group led to dismissal of 
conspiracy and theft charges against north in the closing weeks of 
the reagan administration that review was of documents prosecutors 
planned to use against north 
the interagency group concluded in that earlier review that due 
to national security concerns it would not declassify much of the 
material which gesell ordered must be disclosed at trial gesell 
declined to reconsider his decision requiring extensive disclosure 
and as a result independent counsel lawrence walsh sought dismissal 
of the conspiracy and theft charges 
the detail gesell said must be disclosed after that earlier 
review included verbatim texts of various intelligence reports and 
the names of five central american countries and israel foreign 
leaders were to be identified by relative rank and field of 
activity though not be name 
gesell has limited the defense to presenting 300 classified 
documents the same number that would be presented by walshs office 
to prosecute north in the irancontra case 
twelve criminal charges remain against north 
nine of the 12 counts focus on norths efforts to conceal from 
congress and former attorney general edwin meese iii his efforts on 
behalf of the contras fighting the leftist government of nicaragua 
four of the nine counts deal with alleged concealment of the 
diversion of money to the contras from the administrations secret 
arms sales to iran 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras 
the conspiracy and theft counts that were dropped accused north 
of illegally diverting to the contras more than 14 million in 
proceeds from the reagan administrations arms sales to iran

public school officials abandoned a trendsetting 
program offering overnight shelter to homeless students after a 
trial run at two innercity schools drew no more than eight 
youngsters a night 
superintendent joan raymond told school board members she now 
wants to keep the two campuses open until 10 pm each night in an 
effort to attract children living on the streets and refer those 
needing help to the proper social agencies 
if the need had been there if we had discovered that these 
kids would come only to the schoolhouse then i would have come to a 
different decision ms raymond said friday but i think it 
would take a very very long time before a shelter could be 
established as an institution 
the schoolhouse shelters program which operated for eight 
nights was based on the premise that homeless children who feared 
seeking help through traditional agencies may turn to a more 
familiar environment for assistance 
two schools one for high school students and the other for 
younger children were available with food and overnight 
accommodations under the plan which was staffed beginning jan 12 
by volunteers at a minimal cost to the district officials said

a study by two congressional subcommittees 
recommends imposing fees on companies that dump toxic wastes and 
other pollutants into the nations coastal waters 
a fee system would create powerful economic incentives for 
companies to reduce the amount of wastes dumped into oceans bays 
and estuaries while raising money to pay for new environmental 
programs according to the report released monday 
the fees would be imposed on companies that are meeting federal 
regulatory standards which allow some dumping companies found to 
be illegally dumping toxic wastes and other pollutants already are 
subject to criminal penalties including fines 
the 48page report released by rep gerry e studds dmass 
stems from nine hearings held during the past two years by the house 
merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and the 
environment headed by studds and the oceanography subcommittee 
the panels painted a bleak picture of the state of the nations 
coastal waters 
the continuing damage to coastal resources from pollution 
development and natural forces raises serious doubts about the 
ability of our estuaries bays and near coastal waters to survive 
these stresses the subcommittees wrote 
if we fail to act and if current trends continue unabated what 
is now a serious widespread collection of problems may coalesce 
into a national crisis by early in the next century 
the subcommittees warned against quick fixes and noted that 
installing an effective and fair fee system would be difficult 
they did not offer specifics 
many variations and alternatives should be examined but the 
twin imperatives of increasing funds for pollution control and 
decreasing wastes justify the effort the report said 
the study said spending for marine research and monitoring 
decreased during the reagan administration from a 1981 level of more 
than 150 million to about 110 million last year 
for the past eight years we have tried to defend past 
accomplishments against the encroachments of a hostile 
administration studds said today we have a president who 
campaigned from boston harbor to the jersey shore to santa barbara 
as an environmentalist and we have both the opportunity and an 
urgent national need to reverse the tide of coastal degradation and 
move forward once again 
the subcommittees recommended development of a national coastal 
protection policy increased funding levels stricter pollution 
enforcement efforts and new incentives for voluntary compliance

john gotti the reputed head of the gambino 
organizedcrime family and two of his associates were arrested 
monday night on charges they had ordered a union leader shot three 
years ago 
gotti was arrested while walking with his bodyguard in 
manhattans little italy section about 530 pm and charged with 
firstdegree assault and conspiracy said district attorney robert 
morgenthau 
gotti was arraigned before manhattan criminal court judge 
patricia williams who ordered him held without bail 
an indictment by a grand jury was expected to be unsealed tuesday 
the other defendants arrested on the same charges were angelo 
ruggiero and anthony guerrieri 
the fbi has identified ruggiero 48 as a captain in the gambino 
group and guerrieri 60 as a soldier 
the fbi and other new york state law enforcement officials have 
said that gotti 48 heads the gambino family syndicate which is 
believed to be the largest and most powerful organized crime group 
in the country 
assistant district attorney michael cherkasky declined to comment 
on the charges but sources said the sealed indictment involves the 
shooting on may 7 1986 of john oconnor vice president and 
business manager of carpenters union local 608 
oconnor was shot several times in the buttocks in what 
investigators said was retaliation for his having ordered vandalism 
in 1986 at a restaurant using nonunion carpenters oconnor 
apparently was unaware that the owners were friends of gotti 
morgenthaus office said law enforcement officials overheard 
gotti via a courtordered listening device talk about killing a 
union leader shortly before oconnor was wounded 
the contract for killing oconnor allegedly was given to james 
coonan the reputed leader of the westies a gang that operated on 
manhattans west side some of the gang members are expected to be 
named in the indictment

in a major policy shift leftist 
rebels have offered to participate in and respect the outcome of 
national elections if the usbacked government meets their 
conditions 
the proposal from the guerrillas who have waged war against the 
government for nine years comes in a document obtained by the 
associated press on monday signed by the five senior rebel leaders 
the document was to be made public today at a mexico city news 
conference 
rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front have 
contended that all five elections held this decade were maneuvers of 
the usimposed counterinsurgency project they say that 
despite a civil administration the armed forces are still the most 
powerful element of government 
the insurgents say the elections scheduled for march 19 must be 
put off until sept 15 if they are to participate 
the rightwing republican nationalist alliance or arena 
virtually rejected the guerrilla proposal before it was made public 
arena controls the legislature and is leading in presidential polls 
armando calderon sol mayor of san salvador and a top arena 
leader told journalists this is typical of the subversion they 
attack mercilessly kill assassinate strike then come along and 
say okay now we offer negotiations 
rene roldan vicepresidential candidate of the leftist 
democratic convergence said his party endorsed the proposal it 
hopes to advance the peace process 
the christian democratic government of president jose napoleon 
duarte had no immediate comment 
the document says the wars recent escalation places before the 
armed forces the dilemma of having to carry out genocide and thus 
provoke insurrection or wait for governmental power to disintegrate 
completely and face insurrection caused by hunger 
the guerrilla force is estimated at about 7000 combatants and up 
to 15000 militiamen and women rebels move freely through and 
exercise some governmental functions in about onesixth of the 
country 
last year rebels increasingly brought a predominantly rural war 
to the capital with attacks on major military bases in the city 
they also resorted to the use of car bombs and the assassination of 
mayors 
the government says those terroristic tactics demonstrate the 
rebels relative weakness yet 56000man army has been unable to 
defeat the rebels despite about 800 million in military aid 
received since 1981 and considerable air power which the guerrillas 
lack 
most military observers say the rebels have almost no chance of 
defeating government forces and the new proposal may be recognition 
that the military path to power is not viable 
in the document the rebels acknowledge the existence of an 
international situation in which the majority of wars are being 
resolved by means of negotiation 
expressing a willingness to respect the elections outcome they 
effectively dropped their longstanding demand that they share power 
in a transitional administration that would pave the way for popular 
government 
the insurgents set the following conditions besides postponement 
a halt to what they call the armed forces repression of 
labor and campesino leaders and of street demonstrations 
the confinement of military and police personnel to barracks on 
election day 
the awarding of a central elections council seat to the 
democratic convergence and formation of a watchdog panel to 
guarantee clean elections 
revision of the current electoral code through negotiations 
among all parties 
respect for absentee ballots cast by salvadorans who left the 
country during the war 
the united states cannot interfere in the electoral process or 
give aid to any party 
the guerrilla army in turn would promise to 
respect political activity of all parties and government 
election authorities 
respect the lives of mayors unless they perform 
militaryrelated functions 
observe a truce beginning two days before elections and ending 
two days after 
fully participate in the campaign and election activity the 
rebels have boycotted and tried to sabotage previous elections they 
endorse candidates of the democratic convergence whose leaders 
maintain links to the rebel army 
the fmln would accept the legitimacy of the the electoral 
result the document says and respect the continuation of the 
present christian democratic government until the elections 
duarte met with the countrys roman catholic leder archbishop 
arturo rivera damas on monday to disucuss the guerrilla document 
the rebels gave rivera damas the proposal on friday in mexico city 
in the document the rebels call for immediate discussions 
with the government on the proposal and say the archbishop can 
contribute to the arrangement of these conversations 
the document does not mention a halt to fighting other than the 
fiveday election truce and it was not clear how they think 
legitimate elections can be staged if fighting continues up to 
election day 
the war has killed an estimated 65000 people mostly civilians 
politically motivated slayings of civilians by government forces 
rightist death squads and the guerrillas rose sharply in 1988 over 
the previous year 
arena trounced incumbents in legislative and municipal elections 
last march and has led the christian democrats in recent polls 
three rounds of guerrillagovernment peace talks between 1984 and 
1987 ended in stalemate the government last year rejected at least 
two guerrilla proposals to resume negotiations

supermarket salad bars are growing in 
popularity but an agriculture department nutritionist says they 
also can be more expensive than tossing something together at home 
eileen p newman of the departments human nutrition information 
service said monday that a study showed the costs per pound for many 
common salad ingredients were significantly higher at salad bars 
than the same items bought elsewhere in the store 
the study of 55 prepared items showed that consumers may want 
to weigh the cost of salad bar purchases against preparing the items 
at home newman said 
it shows for example that many common salad ingredients 
including cucumbers iceberg lettuce tomatoes spinach and green 
peppers cost from two to four times more at salad bars she said 
but there were also bargains the perpound prices of items of 
animal origin such as cheese ham and tuna were actually less at 
the salad bars 
the price information was collected in the washington dc 
metropolitan area last july

an elevator that goes through the roof and into 
outer space colonies orbiting earth a giant hook that swings from 
the sky and scoops goods and passengers into space 
impossible 
then again 
sixty years ago men walking on the moon lie detectors and 
instant cameras sounded equally implausible to most people 
the 1929 predictions and many more like them were made in the 
comic strip buck rogers set in the year 2429 on monday the 
grandchildren of one of the cartoons creators gathered to make new 
predictions on what would have been bucks 60th anniversary 
in 1929 when they came out with the numerous predictions in 
buck rogers they thought they were 500 years in the future and 
much of it came true within a century said flint dille 
grandson of john flint dille who died in 1957 
dille and his sister lorraine williams plan to bring back the 
strip as well as release a series of books and possibly a movie 
but first they said they must revamp the future since much of 
their grandfathers future has already become reality 
so like their grandfather the pair assembled a team including 
scientists and artists to create a world in which to set the 
stories they talked about the future at the henry crown space 
center of the chicago museum of science and industry 
they devised the space elevator which is a tube that rises from 
earth into the outer atmosphere the sky hook which would scoop 
cargo into space an environmental suit that would adapt itself to 
any atmosphere and energy guns that would replace pistols 
its a classic adventure set in the plausible future dille 
said this is all a logical extension of what we have now 
everything in the story has to be something that with present 
theories of science could be done 
in 1929 john flint dille president of the national news 
syndicate created the strip with artist dick calkins and writer

not yet anyway but theatergoers may begin to wonder when they 
spot the new poster for the hit musical les miserables the one 
in which the orphaned waif cosette is sporting a mohawk haircut 
pitiable at the best of times the poor child looks utterly 
pathetic with a single sheaf of hair sprouting out of a bald 
rounded head whats going on here 
as it turns out little cosette is being used to make a point 
about ticket scalpers who have been preying on customers eager to 
see the tony awardwinning show 
dont get scalped reads the headline on the poster we may 
have seats for todays performance 
the show has been selling out producer cameron mackintosh 
explained monday but at this time of year we do have some tickets 
available a few days before and even on the day of performance we 
have 16 student tickets or sometimes 25 ticket in the rear

pope john paul ii and the us catholic hierarchy who sparred 
over the issue of church dissent during the pontiffs visit to los 
angeles in 1987 will tackle the volatile issue of usvatican 
relations in a march meeting in rome 
more than 30 us bishops and two eastern rite metropolitans have 
been invited to the march 811 meeting which follows a year of 
private discussions with us bishops the united states catholic 
conference announced monday 
it was a good start in los angeles and now we hope to make it 
a little more indepth said archbishop john l may of st louis 
president of the national conference of catholic bishops he is 
very strong for the meeting he wants to have it 
when the two sides last met in september 1987 the pope 
challenged american bishops to crack down on dissenters from church 
teaching while the us bishops told the pontiff an authoritarian 
approach alienates many of the countrys 53 million catholics 
in his talk the pope decried reports that many catholics veer 
from official teaching on issues such as sexual morality and divorce 
it is sometimes claimed that dissent from the magisterium is 
totally compatible with being a good catholic and poses no 
obstacle to the reception of the sacraments this is a grave error 
that challenges the teaching office of the bishops of the united 
states and elsewhere the pope said 
but archbishop rembert g weakland of milwaukee told the pope 
that in the united states the faithful are more inclined to look 
at the intrinsic worth of an argument proposed by the teachers in 
the church than to accept it on the basis of the authority itself 
in many cases he said an authoritarian style is 
counterproductive and such authority for the most part then becomes 
ignored 
archbishop john r quinn of san francisco said he recognized the 
popes concerns but we cannot fulfill our task simply by an 
uncritical application of solutions designed in past ages for 
problems which have qualitatively changed or which did not exist in 
the past 
the state of usvatican relations had fallen to the point in 
november 1986 that bishop james malone thenpresident of the 
national conference of catholic bishops called for a meeting 
between us leaders and the vatican to discuss the growing and 
dangerous disaffection of american catholics from the holy see 
in his letter this month to us bishops the pope said he was 
aware of their keen interest in meeting with him as a group 
the letter did not set a specific agenda but said the theme of 
the meeting would be evangelization in the context of the culture 
and society of the united states with particular emphasis on the 
role of the bishop as the teacher of faith 
may said in a telephone interview that the topic will be similar 
to the issues raised in los angeles in 1987 but that was just a 
beginning 
he said the climate of usvatican relations has changed since 
malone made his appeal at the bishops meeting following the papal 
visit 
for example he said seattle archbishop raymond hunthausen who 
had been unilaterally stripped of some of his authority by the 
vatican for alleged abuses has regained effective control of the 
archdiocese and is the one delegates to the papal meeting in march 
i personally think that things are much more even right now and 
much more peaceful than at the time bishop malone made his 
suggestion archbishop may said i think things are on a nice 
even keel 
archbishop may also noted that the pope has largely praised the 
us church during the bishops private meetings with the pope 
throughout last year the meetings were part of the required ad 
limina visits all episcopal leaders must make to rome every five 
years 
he said the pontiff paid tribute to mass attendance in the 
united states the schools and social service programs run by the 
church and the bishops pastoral letters on peace and the economy 
among the problems cited by the pope during the ad limina visits 
were a lack of appreciation of penance inappropriate use of 
eucharistic ministers to give communion and a need to recruit more 
vocations may said 
the us delegation also plans to make its own points in rome 
may said 
we do believe that it will be helpful for the holy father as 
well to know more about the culture and society where we work may

two manslaughter counts have been filed against a 
policeman whose fatal shooting of a black man ignited last weeks 
racial riots but a lawyer for one of the victims said the charges 
amount to a whitewash 
officer william lozano 29 was charged monday hours after the 
funeral for 23yearold clement lloyd who was shot to death on his 
motorcycle while being pursued by another officer for speeding 
lloyds passenger allan blanchard 24 died from injuries sustained 
when the motorcycle crashed in the overtown section 
the hispanic officer who has been suspended with pay since the 
shooting on the holiday for the rev martin luther king jr 
surrended monday at dade county jail and left 30 minutes later after 
posting 10000 bond said john hogan chief assistant dade county 
state attorney 
also monday a special city panel reviewing the killings 
complained it lacked sufficient investigatory powers and the us 
justice department said it sent two prosecutors to miami to 
investigate 
a government source in washington who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said a grand jury could be impaneled as early as this 
week to study possible federal charges against lozano 
lozano could face 60 years in prison and a 30000 fine if 
convicted of the charges manslaughter with a firearm said state 
attorney janet reno 
she said a thorough investigation found that murder charges were 
unwarranted 
based on the evidence and applicable florida law manslaughter 
is the correct charge she said 
but ellis rubin an attorney for blanchards family said his 
clients were dismayed that lozano wasnt charged with seconddegree 
murder which indicates malice was present in the attack and carries 
a possible life prison sentence 
this practically amounts to a whitewash and were very 
disappointed rubin said were going to monitor this case very 
closely 
ms reno also was criticized by lozanos attorney roy black who 
said the officer acted in selfdefense and was being made a 
scapegoat for political reasons 
lozano was issuing a traffic ticket when he saw the motorcycle 
speeding toward him authorities said 
according to lozanos arrest warrant a witness told 
investigators lozano was standing in the lane opposite the 
motorcycle and stepped toward it before firing the witness eddie 
johnson claimed lozano did not try to get out of the way 
lloyd was shot once in the head the killing triggered three days 
of looting and violence in the predominantly black overtown and 
liberty city sections that left one man dead and 11 others wounded 
by gunfire fire officials estimated 1 million in damage from arson 
and looting 
while black leaders praised lozanos arrest they remained 
skeptical that the colombianborn officer would be convicted 
the community will feel the right action was taken said 
dewey w knight jr former deputy county manager but the 
community is apprehensive to see what will happen in the criminal 
justice system weve been this route before the question is 
whether justice will be done and done totally 
the special 11member city panel of police officers and civilians 
reviewing the shooting complained it lacked sufficient clout 
the limitations to subpoena powers give this panel really 
its just a sham said the rev richard barry the panels 
chairman after city attorney jorge fernandez told them witnesses 
they subpoena are not legally obligated to talk to them 
the board is to issue a preliminary report to the city commission 
thursday members said they want to look more broadly at underlying 
social problems in the black community 
only hours before lozanos arrest about 150 relatives and 
friends of lloyd gathered for his funeral at the small bahman avenue 
church of god in opalocka 
lloyds mother and other family members most immigrants from the 
virgin islands wept and cried out as mourners sang rock of ages 
as martin luther king said we live together as rational human 
beings or die together as fools not only in miami but all over 
america said the rev morris lloyd lloyds uncle until 
something is done to correct our injustices i believe a lot more 
lives are going to be lost

heavy shelling from inside cambodia 
forced about 5000 cambodian refugees to evacuate a khmer rougerun 
camp to areas deeper into thailand a thai official said today 
the refugees fleeing the bombardment mostly women and children 
retreated thursday and friday about onethird of a mile from their 
camp in thailands eastern trat province said the official who 
requested anonymity 
the borai camp is about 2 miles from the cambodian border 
the official gave no report of casualties from the bombardment 
which ended saturday 
gunners fired 30 mortar and artillery rounds in the attacks the 
official said the shelling is believed to have come from vietnamese 
forces or those of cambodias vietnameseinstalled government 
the refugees will return to the camp they fled when authorities 
have determined the camp is again safe to reenter and live the 
official said in a telephone interview 
military officials told a news conference monday that 170 
artillery rounds crashed into the area near the camp during the 
month that ended monday but said fighting along the border was less 
intense compared to previous months 
thai military officers previously said vietnam has withdrawn some 
troops 19 miles from the border area to ease tensions on monday 
however a military spokesman lt gen naruedol dejpradiyuth 
denied such a report saying vietnamese troops are now deployed 
along the entire border 
sustained shelling along the border in november forced about 
5000 cambodians back to a unaided camp from which they had been 
forcibly moved by communist khmer rouge guerrillas who apparently 
tried to populate areas just inside cambodia 
the khmer rouge which ruled from 1975 until vietnam invaded in 
late 1978 is the largest guerrilla group fighting the vietnamese in 
cambodia during its rule it is estimated that about 2 million of 
cambodias 8 million people died from khmer rouge executions famine 
and civil unrest

a man with a history of mental problems 
wounded two coworkers at a car dealership when he opened fire with 
an ak47 assault rifle on customers and employees before killing 
himself police said 
the body of willie howard womack jr 26 of virginia beach was 
found monday in the office of a service garage at kimnach ford near 
his body was the rifle and a derringer said police cpl robert p 
haynes 
heavily armed police had surrounded the garage and tried to 
contact womack for more than six hours before they lobbed tear gas 
canisters into the building and went inside 
womacks sister angela had tried to contact her brother over an 
intercom after police efforts to reach him by telephone and bullhorn 
failed but he apparently had been dead during what police thought 
was a standoff said haynes 
womack who cleaned cars and ran errands at the dealership had 
been at work for a while before the shooting broke out haynes said 
one of his coworkers said he came into work as happy as 
ever he said police disclosed no motive for the shootings 
he said everybody at work had been picking on him lately 
said womacks mother nancy condrey she said her son had some 
previous mental problems had sought professional help and been on

riddled with bullets 
dealership owner peggy kimnach said womack had worked there for 
five years and was a good employee 
a mechanic wayne gravitt described womack as quiet nobody 
really knows him he said 
we was very flaky but we never thought he was dangerous in 
fact we felt kind of sorry for him said leo shelor another 
mechanic 
donna morris 26 of virginia beach had left her car for 
servicing and was waiting outside for a taxi when the shooting began 
it sounded like firecrackers she said all of a sudden the 
service doors opened and everybody just came piling out 
a female employee told her to run because somebody had gone 
berserk in there with a gun 
mondays shooting was the nations second in a week involving an 
ak47 on jan 17 24yearold patrick edward purdy fired more than

thirty rescuers today searched a gold mine in 
southern peru for survivors of a fire and cavein that killed three 
miners and trapped up to 300 for more than three days officials 
said 
police lt juan robles said noxious gas and heavy smoke was 
hampering efforts to find the miners who he feared had succumbed to 
the gases 
the miners had been trapped in the hillside mine since a fire 
broke out saturday and the collapse monday morning further 
complicated rescue efforts 
robles said the 150 to 300 miners were trapped at the 
privatelyowned sol de oro gold mine near nazca on the pacific 
coast 230 miles south of lima 
we believe that there are miners trapped in the second third 
and fourth levels of the fivelevel mine he said 
limas civil defense office said official spokesmen were 
unavailable and that it had no information on the cavein 
robles said in a telephone interview from nazca that a 30man 
team was conducting rescue operations and had recovered three bodies 
he said the mine tunnels gave way after a fire sparked by gas 
lamps destroyed supporting beams on the mines second level 
the fire began on the first and second levels friday but was 
controlled by miners said robles it flared again on saturday 
preventing the miners from escaping 
the official said more than 900 miners work at the mine but many 
have the weekend off the exact number in the mine at the time of 
collapse was not known 
robles said a portion of the mine was taken over by workers a 
year ago under a law permitting workers in small mining operations 
to own shares of private mines 
mining is perus most important industry and accounts for more 
than half of its foreign exchange gold is the nations fifth 
leading mineral behind copper silver lead and zinc

rival shiite moslem militias battled anew 
in south lebanon today while their leaders met with syrian and 
iranian officials in damascus to seek an end to the bloodshed 
police said four people were killed and 14 wounded in the 
fighting between the syrianbacked amal militia and the proiranian 
hezbollah or party of god 
that raised the casualty toll since the latest spasm of violence 
erupted dec 31 to at least 172 killed and 332 wounded 
the fighting began with artillery exchanges late monday 
shattering a fourday ceasefire it centered on hezbollahs 
stronghold on the western edge of israels selfdesignated 
security zone 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said both sides launched attacks against each others 
positions but neither gained any territory 
the fighting died down into intermittent mortar exchanges around 
daybreak 
amal said in a statement that hezbollah fighters started the 
fighting by attacking its positions in the hamlets of kfar filla and 
jarjoua the towns are west and southwest of the triangularshaped 
mountain enclave controlled by the iranianbacked militia 
the hezbollah attacks were repulsed the amal statement said 
it gave no other details 
hezbollah accused amal of attacking its fighters in the villages 
of jbaa and ein bouswar in an attempt to sabotage efforts by iran 
and syria to end the ninemonth confrontation between their unruly 
lebanese surrogates 
by police count more than 500 people have been killed and 1500 
wounded since april in battles between the two factions for control 
of lebanons 1 million shiites the countrys largest sect 
a hezbollah communique said the amal assaults were crushed and 
the attackers pushed back 
the statement warned amal against maintaining a hostile 
attitude and blocking efforts to achieve a comprehensive political 
settlement 
in the syrian capital syrian and iranian envoys worked today on 
achieving a peace formula acceptable to their proxies 
syrias foreign minister farouk sharaa and his iranian 
counterpart ali akbar velayati held a series of meetings monday 
with amal leader nabih berri and hezbollah representatives sheik 
ibrahim amin and hussein musavi 
berri told reporters amal will not agree to a settlement until 
hezbollah hands over the assassins of three amal commanders 
amal has accused hezbollah of killing daoud daoud its leader in 
south lebanon and two senior lieutenants in a street ambush in 
south beirut on sept 22 hezbollah denies involvement 
the iranianbacked fundamentalists advocate the creation of an 
iranianstyle islamic republic in lebanon the more secular and 
nationalist amal seeks a government in lebanon in which moslems 
would have an equal share of power with the once dominant christians 
the shiite battles have strained the relations between iran and 
syria tehrans main arab ally in the 8yearold persian gulf war 
with iraq that an aug 20 ceasefire brought to a halt

some residents of the earthquakestricken 
soviet republic of tadzhikistan may owe their lives to use of 
relatively lightweight concrete roofing used in the region a 
scientist said 
this is something tadzhikistan engineers took pride in 
lighter weight roofs of thin corrugated concrete and their 
encouragement of the use of this kind of building practice brian 
tucker californias acting state geologist said monday tucker has 
made extensive studies in the region 
early reports from the soviet news agency tass indicated about 
1000 people died because of the quake in the central asian republic 
monday at least 600 of them in the farming settlement of sharora 
one of at least three villages buried by a 50foothigh slide of 
dirt and mud 
because the landslide appears to be the biggest killer in the 
quake it seems that the majority of people would have died 
regardless of the type of roof they had over their head tucker 
said 
but of the people who werent buried in mud probably fewer 
died due to the collapse of thick ceilings than would have without 
the current practice of lightweight roofs tucker speculated by 
phone from washington where he was attending a conference 
tucker said the improved building practices stemmed from a large 
earthquake in 1949 which killed roughly 20000 people and was 
centered east of dushanbe tadzhikistans capital mondays tremor 
was centered 20 to 30 miles southwest of dushanbe 
like mondays quake which measured a moderate 54 on the richter 
scale the 1949 jolt triggered a huge landslide tucker said adding 
that it buried the town of khait roughly 50 miles east of dushanbe 
the quake 40 years ago prompted the soviet academy of sciences to 
establish a permanent research expedition in the town of garm the 
seismologists and engineers gained better understanding of seismic 
risks started quake prediction efforts and improved building 
practices tucker said 
one of the little things they could do for these rural 
communities was to make these thin corrugated cement roofs instead 
of the thick mud and rock roofs traditionally used atop onestory 
adobe homes he said 
tucker said because such roofs are common now the danger of 
death from building collapse during tadzhikistan quakes is much 
less now than it used to be 
tucker visited garm more than a dozen times between 1975 and 1983 
as part of a ussoviet exchange program he studied how shaking 
was much more intense on loose soils than on solid rock 
this is important because most dwellings are on sedimentfilled 
valleys he said all buildings are built there on loose soil 
the villages are vulnerable to landslides because they are just 
nestled in narrow valleys in the rugged pamir and tien shan 
mountain ranges he added 
tucker said the mountains were uplifted by the collision of india 
northward into china and central asia the collision produced a zone 
of seismic activity that stretches from tadzhikistan on the west to 
burma on the east he said 
tucker said dushanbe with some 460000 residents has 
multistory buildings mostly made of concrete slabs loosely hooked 
together he speculated they apparently escaped serious damage 
because of the citys distance from the quakes epicenter

this central texas town has been without a 
mayor since july and city council has decided it can stay that way 
for a while 
council members were forced to decide monday night after the man 
who was elected mayor saturday announced he wouldnt take the job 
glenn marshall who won on a writein vote didnt run for the 
post and said afterward that hed rather be on the city council than 
be mayor the mayor does not vote on city matters except to break 
ties 
the council set out new policies in june of last year and the 
mayor really doesnt have a lot of power now in the city except as 
just a figurehead said the city secrtary mary scott 
marshall was elected mayor when 41 of the 66 voters in the 
special election wrote his name on the ballot which contained no 
candidates for mayor the rest of the votes were scattered among 
nine other noncandidates 
marshall had been acting mayor since jm blakley resigned after 
serving for only two months 
an election was called to fill the vacancy but no one filed for 
the position marshall said any potential candidates probably shied 
away from running because of too much regulation state and 
federal down the road 
the next mayoral election in hico which is about 65 miles 
southwest of fort worth will be in may

gov george deukmejian and 2000 mourners 
stood silently as every 60 seconds the name of a victim of the 
stockton schoolyard slayings was read and a tiny bell rung 
the five minutes of silence monday starting at the exact minute 
in the day when a man opened fire with an ak47 assault rifle six 
days earlier at the cleveland elementary school concluded a 
twohour multicultural memorial to the refugee children 
five minutes for five children may they rest in peace and 
may god bless their families and friends said vuduc vuong of the 
center for southeast asian resettlement 
twentynine other children and a teacher were wounded as 
24yearold patrick edward purdy fired more than 100 rounds before 
killing himself 
the mood in the cavernous stockton civic center was somber but 
tears were few mourners wore black and white ribbons described as 
traditional cambodian symbols of mourning 
funeral chanting of a dozen orangerobed buddhist monks 
alternated with the christian hymns of a community chorus 
two of the slain children oeun lim 6 and rathanar or 9 were 
buddhists two others sokhim an 6 and ram chun 6 were baptists 
and thuy tran 6 the only vietnamese child among the victims was a 
roman catholic 
the ceremony began with funeral services for all but tran who 
was buried saturday 
speaking from behind the closed flowerdraped caskets of four of 
the children and under flags of the precommunist cambodian and 
vietnamese governments deukmejian noted the suffering and fear in 
the wartorn countries which the families of the young victims had 
fled 
he assured them that last weeks shooting last week was an 
aberration 
this state is filled with people of good will and brotherly 
love who cherish our diversity he said the overwhelming

rescuers probed with bulldozers and shovels today 
for survivors in the soggy mass of dirt and rock an earthquake sent 
crashing into three central asian mountain villages but expected 
only to find bodies 
the official tass news agency estimated 1000 people were killed 
in slides loosened by the tremor as it struck a rich agricultural 
region of the soviet republic of tadzhikistan before dawn monday 
there is little hope of finding survivors because of the 
flood of dirt and mud erkin kasimov a spokesman for the 
republics foreign ministry said today but while there is any 
hope the rescuers will keep working 
official reports said more than 100 people were hospitalized in 
the tadzhik capital of dushanbe 20 miles from where the soviet 
unions second devastating earthquake in two months had caused the 
most destruction 
vitaly zhukov deputy head of the republics official news 
agency said 11 people died during the night in dushanbe hospitals 
the communist party newspaper pravda blamed the conditions for 
mudslides on heavy snows followed by a thaw in hills overlooking the 
stricken villages of sharora okulibolo and okulipoyen 
the thaw moistened the earthen walls of canals that stretched 
down to the villages and when the quake hit the rich earth loosened 
and pravda said it moved in a huge mass onto the villages 
about 1 to 1 miles 
there is a danger of new mudslides in similar places in the 
event of a new natural blow the paper said 
pravda said previous experience had shown that the soviet union 
is careless in construction of buildings especially in rural areas 
however it did not specifically blame poor construction for any of 
the deaths in the area about 1800 miles southeast of moscow 
poorly constructed apartment buildings have been blamed for many 
of the estimated 25000 deaths in the earthquake that struck 
northwestern armenia dec 7 that quake registered 69 on the 
richter scale 
the us geological survey said mondays quake measured 54 on 
the scale 
rescue workers labored today under sunny skies in 50degree 
temperatures in the three adjacent villages digging with shovels 
bulldozers cranes and earthmovers kasimov said 
he said the quake and mudslide also damaged farms homes 
schools stores and administrative buildings outside the three 
villages 
zhukov said many of the surviving women and children had been 
evacuated but some remained behind in hopes of finding relatives 
rescue workers put up round reinforced tents and built small 
wooden huts for survivors and worked to restore communications and 
electricity to the area he said food and fuel were also sent to 
the scene tass said 
zainiddin nasreddinov editor in chief of the tadzhik news 
agency estimated that about 600 people were killed in sharora 
almost the entire population 
the 40second tremor was centered 20 to 30 miles southwest of 
dushanbe a city of more than 460000 people tass said the area is 
in the fertile gissar district a vineyard and livestockraising 
center 
the earthquake unhinged a wall of loess at least five miles wide 
that buried okulibolo and much of sharora said kasimov officials 
said most of the victims were asleep at the time 
residents of okulipoyen apparently roused in time fled in 
panic before the slide could reach their homes kasimov said from 
dushanbe 
in okulibolo and okulipoyen everything is destroyed all 
the homes the schools the hospitals and clinics the stores 
nasreddinov said 
okulibolo is a heap of rubble and the chairman of a local 
economic cooperative hairrulo yuldashev said the households of 70 
peasant families were completely demolished and buried by the 
landslide tass said 
the tv news program vremya showed aerial footage of sharora 
with white roofs of buried homes peeking through the dirt like 
seashells scattered on a beach 
the kremlin leadership sent condolences and promised aid 
according to nasreddinov president mikhail s gorbachev telephoned 
tadzhikistan officials to promise moscows help

quincy residents wont smell a thing but officials 
in the suburb say they still will fight a proposal to build one of 
the countrys biggest sewage sludge processing plants 
a recommendation to build the plant at the defunct fore river 
shipyard was announced monday by massachusetts water resources 
authority head paul levy who said the process which turns waste 
into compost instead of burning it wouldnt give off an odor 
i dont propose to build anything unless i would feel 
comfortable living next door to it levy said 
but quincy officials on monday conferred on ways to fight the 
proposal and the federal environmental protection agency planned to 
ask a federal judge to require the authority to build a backup 
sludge incinerator said paul keough deputy epa regional 
administrator 
according to levy the processing plant would be one of the 
nations largest comparable in size to plants in akron ohio and 
los angeles 
the full water resources authoritys board is expected to approve 
levys recommendation feb 1 
cost and convenience were the chief reasons for choosing the 
shipyard levy said the authority already owns the property unlike 
the two other proposed sites spectacle island in boston harbor and 
a 90acre site in stoughton another suburb south of boston 
the shipyard already has been scheduled for a temporary sludge 
treatment plant beginning in 1991 the permanent plant is scheduled 
for completion in 1995 
the 193 million estimated cost of building and operating a 
sludge plant over 25 years compares to 208 million for the 
stoughton site and 258 million for spectacle island 
quincy city councilor michael cheney has already said he plans to 
urge the city to sue to battle the proposal the chief concerns 
among officials in quincy and neighboring weymouth are excess 
traffic and odor 
state rep robert cerasoli whose district includes the shipyard 
blamed quincy mayor francis x mccauley for agreeing to allow the 
authority to use the shipyard as a temporary sludge treatment site 
i didnt think that after five years theyd abandon the interim 
plant cerasoli said

japans senior economic planner resigned today the 
third cabinet member to step down in less than two months in 
connection with a stocktrading scandal that has shaken public 
confidence in the government 
the resignation of ken harada was expected to put heavy pressure 
on several other cabinet members including prime minister noboru 
takeshita who have acknowledged links to the company at the center 
of the storm 
harada had led a parliamentary committee investigating the 
scandal until he became head of japans economic planning agency in 
a dec 27 cabinet shuffle 
in a televised news conference following his resignation harada 
acknowledged reports he had received regular political donations 
from recruit co but denied any wrongdoing and said the company had 
absolutely not asked for any favors in return 
the national newspaper asahi shimbun reported today that harada 
had received 80 a month from recruit for 14 years in addition a 
recruit subsidiary donated about 8000 at a harada fundraising 
party in august it said 
in the stock scandal recruit an information conglomerate made 
available hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a subsidiary 
recruitcosmos to dozens of prominent people who made large profits 
after the stocks were listed for public trading and rose quickly in 
value 
neither the donations nor the stock transactions were illegal of 
themselves but questions of bribery ethics and undue business 
influence on politicians were raised 
only three days after takeshita formed his new cabinet in 
december justice minister takashi hasegawa stepped down after it 
was disclosed that he also had received regular donations from 
recruit 
a member of the previous cabinet finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa stepped down in early december in connection with the 
scandal 
miyazawa resigned after having repeatedly changed his explanation 
of a close aides purchase of the unlisted stock shares 
takeshita has acknowledged that an aide and a relative profited 
from the sale of recruitcosmos shares news reports have said 
recruits former chairman hiromasa ezoe also gave takeshitas 
political support group 38000 in 1987 and 1988 
kyodo news service reported that chief cabinet secretary keizo 
obuchi has received 160 a month from recruit and agriculture 
minister tsutomu hata has acknowledged that recruit bought tickets 
for a fundraising party in 1986 at an undisclosed price

five hours before his execution today ted 
bundy called to tell his mother goodbye and sounded wonderful 
very much at peace with himself she said 
he kept saying how sorry he was that there was another part 
of me that people didnt know louise bundy said 
for unexplained reasons bundy was allowed two 10minute calls 
rather than the one expected by mrs bundy the morning news tribune 
of tacoma reported 
at the conclusion of the second call mrs bundy told the 
confessed serial killer youll always be my precious son 
when the first call came shortly before 11 pm pst bundys 
adoptive father john bundy turned to his wife and said quietly 
you do the talking 
after the initial hellos she said we just want you to know 
how much we love you and always will 
her voice shook with emotion when he spoke she rapidly wrote 
down the messages he asked her to give friends and loved ones 
he sounds wonderful his mother said after the first call 
he sounds very much at peace with himself 
he said im so sorry ive given you all such grief but a 
part of me was hidden all the time and then he said but the ted 
bundy you knew also existed 
in the second call she told him were all praying for you 
later she told the friends in her living room he said gods 
spirit was with him 
the mood at the bundy home was grieving but subdued mrs bundy 
raised her voice only when asked about the death penalty 
i think its barbaric she said what good does it do its 
legalized murder is all its not a deterrent theyve been killing 
people for thousands of years in executions and what good has it 
done 
mrs bundy planned to be at a friends home with family members 
and her minister when the execution was carried out this morning 
on monday she said she was upset her son hadnt told her about 
the killings before confessing to law enforcement officials 
its a terrible thing mrs bundy said he wasnt raised 
that way he was raised in a good loving caring family we still 
love and care for him but we want to know what caused this 
when asked whether her son is mentally ill mrs bundy said i 
think he must be he must be how could anybody not be and commit 
those crimes 
i would have liked to have known it from him ahead of time 
yes it would have still hurt very badly but getting it second hand 
was pretty devastating 
mrs bundy said she never had any indication that her son hated 
women but believed he was jilted by a woman he loved in 1972 or 
1973 perhaps triggering hatred that led to the killings

many residents of this small north florida 
town expressed hope that ted bundys execution today would restore 
their community spirit and belief in the american judicial system 
bundy died in the electric chair for the 1978 rape and murder of 
lake city schoolgirl kimberly leach after his trials and subsequent 
appeals dragged through the judicial system for years 
there is no doubt theres been a tremendous erosion of public 
confidence in the system because of ted bundy said jerry blair 
the state attorney who prosecuted bundy for the murder of the 
12yearold girl 
its sort of like the super bowl mayor gerald witt said 
before the execution were just waiting for it to happen 
itll give everybody a feeling of relief and make everybody 
smile to know hes finally been electrocuted hes destroyed so 
many lives it seems like hes just a living devil 
the execution will be celebrated tonight with a barbecue at the 
naked lady tavern north of town the owners advertised the 
celebration with a sign that reads were cooking too 
a neighboring business weggys package store on highway 441 
displayed what has become a common slogan in florida on its outdoor 
sign buckle up bundy its the law 
although bundy has confessed to the murders of other young women 
in recent days its kimberlys murder that turned this small 
crossroads community of fewer than 10000 people into a town without 
pity 
state trooper ken robinson who found kimberlys body in an 
abandoned pig sty planned to witness the execution as did blair 
well all be better off when this is history robinson said 
retired school superintendent silas pittman like many residents 
here said he hoped bundys execution would help them again become a 
town capable of forgiveness and compassion 
theres no question about it itll be a therapeutic act 
said blair 
a lot of people say the law of the land should be carried 
out said the rev edwin f montgomery pastor of the first 
presbyterian church and an opponent of the death penalty its 
almost like something is unfinished 
but montgomery said he believes most people would have put the 
tragedy behind them long ago had bundy been sentenced to a life in 
prison 
many people havent been able to get past the anger in the 
grief process he said we never got resolution because were 
still in the anger stage

residents expressed resentment about their 
town being known as execution city as journalists overran the 
town to cover todays electrocution of confessed serial killer ted 
bundy 
more than 100 journalists accompanied by satellite dishes vans 
and even mobile homes began setting up early monday at the former 
cow pasture across from the state prison building where bundy was 
set to become the 20th convict to be executed since florida resumed 
executions nearly 10 years ago 
this is the most ive seen said bob macmaster a state 
corrections department spokesman the media has really overflowed 
the small media area we had set aside 
more journalists were arriving by the dozens including some from 
western states where bundy is linked to as many as three dozen 
female victims 
bundy has been the boogeyman of the northwest for 15 years 
said mary mapes a producer for kirotv in seattle he really 
inspires fear and fascination 
jacksonville graphic artist george johnson parked just outside 
the entrance to the florida state prison said he had sold six dozen 
tshirts that depicted bundy in the electric chair with the slogan 
burn bundy burn 
johnson said most of his sales at 10 a shirt were to 
journalists and prison employees 
theyre ready to see him burn i think hes an animal said 
johnson johnson said he lived near salt lake city in the mid1970s 
when the bodies of suspected bundy victims there were found 
a banner on johnsons car advertised tuesday is fryday 
people in this town of some 5000 people have grown resentful of 
their portrayal by outoftown reporters while the five state 
prisons that lie within 20 miles are the major employers in the 
area residents point out they are 11 miles from the prison and 
shouldnt be known as home of the electric chair 
i feel the people of this community have the attitude of the 
state resident lila yawn said i dont think theyre 
bloodthirsty i think were just like any other normal american 
town 
todays execution came as this city is recovering from a drug 
scandal and is worried about state plans for a jacksonvilletotampa 
turnpike some businesspersons say the turnpike could either boost 
the city or kill it depending on how close it comes to the town 
meanwhile at 7 am as bundy was being executed the polls were 
opening for the special election of a new police chief replacing 
one who was charged with grand theft last year a year earlier saw 
nearly three dozen federal drugrelated cases involving police 
officers the former county attorney and school officials

the us embassy announced today it has 
advised americans who are private citizens to leave afghanistan 
jon d glassman charge daffaires at the american embassy said 
the situation was reaching a critical point and he urged 
americans to get out while commercial air service still is operating 
only the soviet airline aeroflot using military planes and the 
afghan airline ariana are still operating out of kabuls airport 
ariana flights are unpredictable sometimes delayed or canceled 
until soviet shipments of aviation fuel arrive 
the warning in a letter sent to us nationals followed a 
similar warning by the british embassy last week to britons and 
nationals of six other countries for which it has diplomatic 
responsibility including canada australia and ireland 
theyve finally gotten through to us said richard penner a 
canadian who heads the international aid mission a multinational 
charitable organization of missionaries he said most of the group 
decided to leave but that he was going to stay 
penner said the group would be down to 10 by feb 11 compared 
with 52 now and 85 during the summer 
except for the 11 us citizens working at the embassy most of 
the americans in afghanistan belong to the missionary organization 
other private citizens in afghanistan include red cross workers 
officials of un aid agencies and a dwindling group of soviet 
civilian advisers 
concern about the situation in afghanistan has risen as the feb 
15 deadline for the soviet armys withdrawal approaches 
the red army intervened in afghanistans civil war in december 
1979 backing government troops in their fight with moslem 
guerrillas half their estimated 100000 soldiers were out of the 
country by aug 15 and the remainder are to be out by feb 15 
the soviets announced late last year they had suspended the 
withdrawal because of continuing us and pakistani aid to the 
guerrillas and they have not announced a resumption of the pullout 
despite evidence its in full swing 
western diplomats said today heavy convoy and air traffic around 
kabul indicates the final soviet withdrawal from afghanistan is 
proceeding 
on monday afternoon a 70vehicle military convoy including six 
tanks armored personnel carriers and troop trucks moving out from 
kabul and headed north toward the soviet border on the salang 
highway 
in addition afghan soldiers have taken over some guard posts 
around kabul from the soviet troops and hundreds of soviet soldiers 
have been seen boarding transport planes at kabuls airport 
western analysts believe the soviets want to cover up the 
withdrawal for both security and political reasons these include 
trying to maintain political leverage to persuade rebel leaders to 
resume negotiations for a coalition government that would include 
the marxists 
diplomats in pakistan reported intense fighting between communist 
forces and rebels in northern kunduz province and in nangarhar and 
kandahar provinces to the east 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed a 
rebel report monday of heavy fighting around the provincial capital 
of kunduz 36 miles south of the soviet border 
they were unable to confirm rebel claims that guerrillas had shot 
down three planes 
rebel and diplomatic sources also reported battles around the 
eastern city of jalababad capital of nangarhar province bordering 
pakistan

a convicted multiple murderer faces a death 
sentence for the second time in the slaying of a teenager becoming 
the first defendant to undergo a second capital punishment trial 
under new jersey law 
a monmouth county jury sentenced richard biegenwald 48 to death 
monday for the slaying of anna olesiewicz 19 more than five years 
ago 
the jury returned the death sentence after six hours of 
deliberations the state supreme court had let stand the murder 
conviction but overturned biegenwalds first death sentence because 
of trial errors and ordered him resentenced by a new jury 
new jersey law requires one trial to determine guilt or innocence 
and a second to determine sentence biegenwald is the first to go 
through a second death penalty trial under new jerseys 7yearold 
capital punishment law 
superior court judge patrick mcgann ordered biegenwald executed 
by lethal injection on march 15 however that date will be 
postponed because the state supreme court automatically reviews all 
death sentences 
in addition to his two murder convictions biegenwald pleaded 
guilty to the murders of two young women in the monmouthocean area 
during the early 1980s prosecutors also suspect biegenwald in a 
fifth slaying 
a defense attorney urged the jury to spare biegenwalds life 
saying he would be valuable for studying sociopathic behavior 
but assistant monmouth county prosecutor james fagen 
characterized biegenwald as evil and a coldblooded murderer 
biegenwald declined an opportunity to make his own plea to the 
jury 
fagen said biegenwald was sentenced to life for a murder 
conviction in 1959 but murdered again when released on parole 
did that rehabilitate him no fagen said if it was 
punishment did he learn from it no for him there is only one 
punishment 
defense attorney louis diamond argued that biegenwalds beatings 
as a child and the harsh treatment he received in psychiatric 
hospitals including electroshock therapy taught him that life is 
meaningless death is meaningless 
he also said biegenwald may have had a motive for killing ms 
olesiewicz saying that the two had smoked marijuana together an 
act that would have jeopordized his parole status after his release 
from prison for the 1959 murder 
under state law a jury is permitted to return a death sentence 
if it finds a murder was committed without a reason

appeals has been called a suspect in as many as 36 deaths in 
addition to the crime for which he was executed he was under a 
death sentence for the murders of two florida state university 
sorority sisters 
around 530 am the final preparations began with a prison 
official shaving bundys head and right leg where the electrodes 
were later placed 
when bundy entered the chamber at 701 am wearing a light blue 
shirt and dark blue pants he looked frightened but walked directly 
to the electric chair after being seated he nodded to his attorney 
and minister and mouthed words to them 
fortytwo people witnessed the execution from behind a plexiglass 
partition they included 12 official witnesses among them a state 
representative and three state attorneys 12 reporters and 18 other 
people mostly corrections officials 
more than 100 people supporting the execution and about two dozen 
against milled around outside the florida state prison at 7 am a 
small group of death penalty supporters lit sparklers and 
firecrackers and cheered while opponents silently held candles and 
then held a memorial service 
within a half hour of the execution a hearse carried bundys 
body out of the prison to gainesville for an autopsy

abandoned pigsty he also was sentenced to death for killing the two 
florida state students in tallahassee in 1978 
residents of lake city hoped bundys execution would help the 
community put the gruesome case behind them 
its sort of like the super bowl gerald witt mayor of the 
northern florida town said monday of the execution itll give 
everybody a feeling of relief and make everybody smile to know 
hes finally been electrocuted 
hes destroyed so many lives it seems like hes just a 
living devil 
bundy who grew up in tacoma was linked to three dozen killings 
of young women as the execution approached he met with 
investigators from western states and admitted killing eight women 
each in washington and utah and two each in colorado and idaho 
authorities said 
i think he was born to kill said bob keppel of washingtons 
state attorney generals office who interviewed bundy during the 
weekend 
i dont know if it was a bad seed or what but boy he was 
just totally consumed with murder all the time he had to be 
bundy was the subject of five books and a television miniseries 
the deliberate stranger a federal judge once called him the 
most competent serial killer in the country at this time a 
diabolical genius 
three psychiatrists appointed by martinez waited at the prison 
monday in case bundys attorneys raised the claim that he was 
mentally incompetent to be executed 
but martinez added that the execution would go forward justice 
ought to fit the crime and in this case its clear that when he 
eliminated not only kimberly leach but all the others that he chose 
to have his life forfeited about 100 phone calls and dozens of 
letters and telegrams have been received at the governors office in 
recent days with the vast majority supporting execution said brian 
ballard director of operations 
the execution also inspired bizzare humor from radio stations 
with a jacksonville station wqik urging listeners to turn off 
unnecessary appliances between 645 and 7 am to ensure plenty of 
juice for the electric chair at the nearby prison 
bundy who dropped out of law school after a year is believed to 
have stalked young women near college campuses shopping centers and 
parks in the west and northwest targeting those with long dark 
hair parted in the middle 
prosecutors said he often lured victims into his car by posing as 
police officer or making false requests for aid 
one of the women he admitted killing was caryn campbell 23 of 
dearborn mich who was killed by a blow to the head while 
vacationing in colorado in 1975 
you never really forgive someone for something like that you 
just try to put it behind you her father robert campbell said 
monday its not important to me now the thing id like to have 
back i cant have

an elderly couple whose daylong fishing 
trip turned into a nightmare when a storm blew their boat out to sea 
survived on ocean water and a days worth of food before they were 
rescued five days later 
the couples boat washed up onto an isolated island three days 
after it went adrift but the two didnt know they were just 500 
yards from a caretakers cottage and went without food for two nights 
until their rescue monday 
thomas pettigrew 81 said the sight of a marine helicopter 
hovering over the island about 45 miles south of charleston was 
worth all the tea in china 
the charleston resident and his 80yearold wife katie were 
listed in good condition today at beaufort memorial hospital where 
they were being treated for dehydration and exposure 
considering the fact that they have had no food for four days 
and significant exposure i think theyre doing great said dr 
lester haddad director of the hospitals emergency room 
the pettigrews left charleston on thursday in their 18foot 
fiberglass boat but they were blown out to sea and tossed around in 
12foot waves for three days before their craft washed up on st 
phillips island late saturday 
it wasnt until monday that a helicopter from the marine corps 
air station in beaufort spotted them while on a training mission 
the coast guard said 
a storm system that moved through the area over the weekend 
brought winds of 25 to 45 mph and temperatures as low as 35 degrees 
early sunday officials said 
the coast guard searched offshore waters friday after the couple 
was reported overdue but the effort which included airplanes and a 
110foot cutter was suspended late sunday 
pettigrew said he never doubted that he and his wife of 44 years 
would be rescued 
i didnt give up my hopes he said i wasnt afraid of 
anything no more once i got on that island i knew i was on dry 
land i was hoping i would get something to eat 
but it wasnt until he and his wife were rescued that they were 
fed during the couples two nights on the island they never 
realized they were about 500 yards from a caretakers cottage said 
lt quain kahler of the charleston coast guard base

16th century painting by raphael in the vatican museum today by 
setting ablaze a flammable liquid he tossed at the painting vatican 
officials said 
museum guards restrained the man quickly extinguished the flames 
and prevented the work from being damaged said vatican spokesman 
joaquin navarro 
the italian news agency ansa said police identified the man as 
thomas lange a 31yearold west german from berlin who had been 
living in italy about a year earlier navarro said the man spoke 
only english 
the incident occurred in the vatican picture gallery which 
contains some of raphaels most famous works navarro said the mans 
target was the madonna of foligno painted from 1512 to 1513 
navarro said the man who had been noticed by guards in the 
museum in previous days struggled up from his wheelchair took out 
a thermos and tossed a liquid toward the painting 
the liquid landed on the floor and wall beneath the painting and 
the man then tossed a lighted match to set it ablaze navarro said 
he said the flames did not reach the painting 
navarro described the man as showing signs of being 
handicapped also mentally 
museum officials took down the work to check for possible smoke 
damage it was to be back on display wednesday 
navarro said the man was also carrying two spray bombs of the 
type used for personal defense and another bottle of an unidentified 
liquid

madonna with child seated on clouds above a sphere surrounded by 
cherubs beneath are saints john the baptist francis and jerome in

statue broke off the madonnas left arm and veil and dented the 
left side of the face

two women who claim famed divorce lawyer 
marvin mitchelson sexually assaulted them were awarded 56000 for 
medical and psychiatric care despite the refusal of authorities to 
prosecute the cases 
the state board of control a threemember crime victims 
compensation panel concluded monday that kristin barrettwhitney 
and patricia french were telling the truth about the alleged 
assaults 
ms barrettwhitney was awarded 46000 and ms french 10000 
the money comes from fines paid by criminals 
mitchelson who gained national attention for his handling of 
divorce and palimony cases involving celebrities has 
steadfastly denied the allegations he has called the women both 
former clients professional extortionists 
mitchelson could not be reached for comment on the award a 
message left with his answering service before business hours today 
was not immediately returned 
the alleged assaults which were said to have occurred in 1981 
and 1985 were the subject of a segment on cbstvs 60 minutes 
last year 
the county district attorneys office after a lengthy 
investigation decided early last year there was insufficient 
evidence to prosecute the cases the state attorney generals office 
also reviewed the cases but declined to prosecute 
ms barrettwhitneys psychiatrist dr gary shepherd called the 
panels decision fascinating 
the district attorney wont prosecute but the state will pay 
money because they say a crime occurred he said 
austin eaton executive officer of the board of control said the 
boards standard of proof is less stringent than that required in a 
criminal prosecution 
a preponderance of evidence is all that is required by the board 
rather than the beyondareasonabledoubt standard followed by 
prosecutors eaton said 
the board heard about 20 minutes of testimony from the women a 
psychiatrist and a police detective who investigated their claims in 
1986 
the los angeles police detective robert kestler testified that 
he believed the women were telling the truth 
mitchelson was not invited by the board to testify before it 
both women praised the boards decision 
ive fought long and hard for this ms barrettwhitney said 
she also vowed to continue to push for mitchelsons prosecution

a steady stream of people filed by the 
open casket of salvador dali today to pay their last respects to the 
surrealist painter who brought so much attention to his small 
hometown 
dali his signature handlebar mustache neatly trimmed and long 
wisps of hair framing his face was laid out in an open casket in 
his galatea tower residence dressed in an offwhite silk tunic 
two 16yearold boys in a line of 250 people waiting outside 
admitted they knew the once outspoken dali only as a famous old 
recluse 
but they said they know his art from visits to the 
theatermuseum where dali will be buried beneath the collection of 
his works that draws 350000 people a year to figueras near the 
french border in northeastern spain 
its great that he is getting so much attention said one of 
the teenagers xavier diaz but when they start giving him titles 
when hes dead thats pretty ridiculous 
dali has been showered with honors including a posthumous medal 
from the catalonian capital of barcelona mayor mariano lorca of 
figueras dalis hometown said the medal was placed on dalis chest 
for a short time before his body was embalmed monday 
figueras owes him everything said townsman carlos arche 40 
im here to say my last goodbye thats all 
several older visitors sobbed as they left the building 
white lace cloths draped with ribbons of black crepe hung from 
balconies around the center of the town of 33000 town authorities 
have declared three days of mourning 
dalis body will lie in state until the funeral service wednesday 
in the 14th century gothic parish church of sant pere where the 
painter was baptized into the roman catholic church 84 years ago 
he is to be buried beneath the geodesic dome of the adjacent 
theatermuseum dali a converted municipal theater where he held his 
first exhibition in 1918 when he was 14 years old 
the artist died monday in figueras hospital where he had been 
admitted jan 18 because of severe heart trouble aggravated by 
pneumonia 
according to the spanish weekly panorama dalis fortune is worth 
nearly 88 million and includes works in the theatermuseum others 
belonging to the galadali foundation that runs it his private 
collection and real estate 
under spanish law dalis will cannot be read until at least 15 
days after his death 
the will reportedly divides his estate among the governments of 
figueras catalonia and spain it has not been revealed which if 
any of dalis circle of collaborators will act as executor 
dalis only close living relative his sister ana maria refused 
to visit her dying brother the barcelona daily la vanguardia 
reported today dali severed all contact with his family years ago 
dali was a founder of the surrealist movement in the early 1930s 
and he was the last of an outstanding generation of spanish painters 
that included pablo picasso and joan miro 
a fervent catalan he returned to his native region in 1948 after 
living in madrid paris and several us cities 
an inscription beneath a statue outside the theatermuseum quotes 
catalan philosopher francesc pujols catalan thought will always

jurors in the childkilling case against joel 
steinberg weighed homicide charges against him and two alternate 
jurors who were dismissed said they would have voted for conviction 
however the alternates expressed mixed feelings about the 
prosecutions star witness steinbergs former livein companion 
hedda nussbaum whose testimony will likely determine the verdict 
the jury received the case monday and deliberated for about nine 
hours without reaching a verdict deliberations resumed this morning 
of the five alternate jurors released by judge harold rothwax 
some told reporters they believed ms nussbaum testified truthfully 
others werent sure and some thought she was covering up 
dr samuel klagsbrun ms nussbaums psychiatrist said monday 
his patient will interpret any verdict except murder as they 
didnt believe me 
if the jury shows any doubt she feels people will feel she is 
responsible or somehow she participated in the crime and that is a 
hurt that she finds almost unbearable he said 
steinberg is charged in the death of 6yearold lisa steinberg 
the girl he obtained at birth from an unwed long island teenager 
and raised but never legally adopted 
lisa was removed comatose from steinbergs greenwich village 
apartment on nov 2 1987 and taken to a hospital where she died of 
a brain injury three days later 
the case drew nationwide attention to the problem of child and 
spousal abuse especially to the responsibility of teachers 
neighbors and other adults who may suspect someone is a victim of 
abuse 
ms nussbaum 46 testified for the prosecution that steinberg 
told her in bed after they freebased cocaine and while lisa lay 
comatose on their bathroom floor that he had knocked lisa down 
and she didnt want to get up 
steinbergs lawyers charge that ms nussbaum beat the child to 
death in a jealous rage while prosecutors say ms nussbaum was too 
incapacitated from being abused by steinberg to have been able to 
inflict a fatal beating 
if jurors decide steinberg bears guilt in the childs death they 
must decide among four possible homicide counts murder first or 
seconddegree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide 
one alternate juror who was dismissed monday after she became ill 
told reporters she would have voted to convict steinberg of murder 
the juror sharon rupert 50 was excused shortly before rothwax 
completed his final instructions to the jury the other alternate 
jurors were released shortly before the 12 regular jurors retired 
for the night 
i believed hedda said ms rupert i almost cried when she 
left the witness stand 
alternate millie sandoval 31 when asked if she believed ms 
nussbaums testimony said its hard to say i just feel that she 
was just as much to blame i dont think she should get away with 
everything 
she refused to comment on whether she thought steinberg should be 
convicted but when asked if she believed steinberg did it ms 
sandoval said i believe it could have been both of them 
edna massick 34 said i think hedda was telling the partial 
truth i cant say i feel she was telling the complete truth i 
think she was covering for joel she is a very sick woman 
asked if she thought steinberg should be convicted ms massick 
said definitely i think he should have been convicted im not 
sure of what

despite pleas for leniency six former ku 
klux klansmen were ordered to spend time in prison for helping to 
disrupt a black protest march in decatur almost 10 years ago 
the lengthy case ended monday when the six were sentenced and 
fined by us district judge james h hancock after they told him 
they had severed their klan connections and were sorry for what they 
had done 
the 1979 clash came as blacks protested the arrest of a black 
decatur man tommy lee hines who was charged with raping three 
white women in 1978 
hines was convicted of one of the rapes and sent to prison the 
alabama court of criminal appeals later ruled that he was mentally 
incompetent and he was moved to a mental hospital in tuscaloosa 
the protest march ended in a gunfight and brawl with klansmen 
with several marchers and policemen injured 
attorneys for the six had sought probation or community service 
instead of prison terms 
three other exklansmen also charged in the clash were sentenced 
previously one on his guilty plea and two on their convictions 
hancock gave the stiffest penalties to ray w steele of decatur 
and william d riccio of birmingham who pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanor charges of violating the marchers civil rights by 
conspiring to disrupt the march and to two felony charges of 
conspiring to obstruct an fbi investigation

concurrently and each was fined 1000

sentenced to three months and fined 500 and terry j tucker of 
cullman was sentenced to two months and fined 400 
i made a mistake white said i have to pay the price 
itll never happen again

time i butted my head against the wall and got wore down i will 
not let this court down if given the opportunity to prove i am a 
changed person

prince charles came to lockerbie today 
to comfort the bereaved and mend fences with townspeople aggrieved 
by the royal familys behavior after the crash of pan am flight 103 
the visit by the heir to the british throne was seen as a tacit 
admission by the royal family that it bungled its response to the 
dec 21 tragedy first through an inept remark by charles younger 
brother prince andrew and then by staying away from a memorial 
service for the victims 
charles who arrived by train for a 90minute visit that 
stretched to 2 hours got a friendly welcome and several residents 
said they felt mollified by his trip 
all 259 people aboard the new yorkbound boeing 747 were killed 
along with 11 residents of this rural town when a bomb blew up the 
jet 
andrew who visited the day after the crash got into trouble 
when he appeared to voice more concern for the americans on the 
plane than the britons on the ground 
its very sad for the town but my deepest feelings go out to 
the people the families of those americans who died in the crash 
he told reporters 
media reaction was scathing when the royals stayed away from a 
memorial service jan 4 in lockerbie attended by relatives of the 
families pan am staff and prime minister margaret thatcher 
the royals sent local representatives and buckingham palace said 
it was not customary for queen elizabeth ii to attend such events 
but the palace then announced the queens husband prince philip 
would attend the funeral of emperor hirohito of japan 
thousands of british war prisoners died at the hands of the 
japanese during world war ii and many britons regarded hirohito as 
a war criminal 
the fact that a member of the royal family is going to japan to 
the funeral of a man who caused so much suffering when they could 
not come to a memorial service in their own country must have some 
effect locally said robert jardine vice chairman of the 
lockerbie and district community council 
charles met with bereaved families inspected the crater caused 
by the falling wreckage toured damaged homes and laid a wreath 
outside the town hall 
he also met with rescue officials shook hands with townspeople 
and stopped for a quick drink and friendly banter at a local pub 
i think its helped out said anne mcphail a lockerbie 
resident i wondered about it myself i thought it was a bit late 
in the day but now i feel better about it 
said store manager robert devlin it says a lot for him that he 
had the courage to come it is a great honor 
trucker niven milligan said i am pleased that the prince has 
come to make amends for his brother 
the physical impact of the crash is still evident southbound 
lanes remain closed on the main highway alongside the crater nearby 
are the burnedout shells of houses 
the government has announced a grant of about 126 million to 
pay for the search and rescue operations police investigation and 
counseling for the bereaved

the news came on the same day east german leader erich honecker 
announced his country will reduce its armed forces by 10000 troops 
and trim defense spending 10 percent by the end of 1990 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev announced in december he would 
slash his countrys armed forces by a halfmillion men including

even more reductions in the east blocs conventional forces 
there is a great asymmetry in natowarsaw pact conventional 
forces and anything that reduces this imbalance is useful said

at reduced level is achieved 
this is the purpose of the talks about to begin in vienna

ted bundys last hours provoked a final outpouring of anger and 
hatred against the serial killer along with puzzlement over what 
turned a man of apparent charm and intelligence into what one 
official called a living devil 
across florida and the west families of bundys victims and law 
enforcement officials who have spent years on his trail expressed 
relief over his execution 
good sighed vivian rancourt mother of bundy victim susan 
rancourt when reached at her laconner wash home shortly after 
bundys execution in starke fla the only thing i can say is 
thank god its finally over 
the father of another victim declined to comment this morning 
its too soon to really digest this said donald blackburn of 
spokane wash whose 23yearold daughter janice ott disappeared 
in july 1974 bundy has confessed to her murder 
i view him pretty much as a cancer that has to be 
removed blackburn said earlier 
its hard to feel sympathy for a guy responsible for the deaths 
of several dozen young women said florida state attorney jerry 
blair who was one of three state attorneys to witness the execution 
mrs rancourt said she lay awake in bed this morning waiting for 
word about the fate of the man who killed her daughter 
its been a tough week she said in a slow quiet voice 
im hoping that this will never be allowed to happen again this 
terrible wait we wont have to hear any more stories of how he 
played the system or his escapades 
although about two dozen foes of capital punishment held a vigil 
outside the florida state prison near starke their objections 
focused on the morality of the death penalty not on any possibility 
of bundys innocence 
and in contrast to some past florida executions such as that of 
willie jasper darden in march those supporting bundys execution 
were far more vocal than those who were opposed 
calls and letters are very very favorable toward executing 
this man as quickly as possible said brian ballard director of 
operations for florida gov bob martinez ive heard of a few 
against capital punishment but we have not gotten one saying ted 
bundy is innocent 
one relative of a suspected bundy victim who opposes capital 
punishment said his execution wouldnt make a difference 
killing ted bundy wont make me feel better and it wont 
bring back shelley said roberta robertson whose daughter 
shelley robertson was last seen june 30 1975 the nude body of the 
24yearold woman was found that august in a mine at the foot of 
berthoud pass colo 
a lot of people seem to want it out of vengeance but it gives 
people a false sense of security and its terribly expensive 
said robertson of arvada colo 
the father of one victim expressed ambivalence about bundys 
execution 
its not important to me now said robert campbell of 
dearborn mich the thing id like to have back i cant have 
bundy confessed sunday to killing campbells daughter 
23yearold caryn campbell in colorado in 1975 
other bereaved families those whose loved ones names were not 
mentioned in any of bundys confessions feared that the secret of 
their daughters and sisters deaths would die with the killer 
mr bundy wrote william taylor of san diego whose sister 
disappeared 21 years ago if you could shed one ray of light on 
this tragedy my familys prayers would go with you to eternity 
taylor also wrote martinez asking that bundy be spared at least 
temporarily so that authorities could study him for clues to the 
makeup of serial killers 
bundys mother louise bundy of tacoma wash also groped for 
clues monday night expressing anguish and confusion over her sons 
killing sprees 
its a terrible thing said mrs bundy who planned to spend 
this morning with her family and minister he wasnt raised that 
way he was raised in a good loving caring family we still love 
and care for him but we want to know what caused this 
asked if her son was mentally ill she said i think he must 
be he must be how could anybody not be and commit those crimes 
in lake city fla where bundy abducted 12yearold kimberly 
leach in 1978 mayor gerald witt said the killers execution would 
give everybody a feeling of relief and make everybody smile 
hes destroyed so many lives said witt it seems like hes 
just a living devil 
the parents of the lake city girl whose kidnapping rape and 
murder led bundy to the electric chair kept their thoughts about 
the execution to themselves but state trooper ken robinson who 
found her body in 1978 in an abandoned hog shed said he believed 
the leaches would be relieved 
it has hung over them all this time said robinson who 
witnessed the execution well all be better off when this is 
history 
there was no remorse about watching him he added i 
thought back and i felt like justice has been done but i wonder if 
he really went through as much suffering as kimberly did

a chronic shortage of contraceptives contributes to 
the soviet unions estimated 65 million abortions a year a number 
about equal to annual births the highestranking woman in the 
kremlin says 
our complaints from women are completely wellfounded 
concerning the number of abortions compared to the use of 
contraceptives deputy premier alexandra biryukova told a news 
conference on monday 
it is not normal when the number of abortions is about equal to 
the number of births she said 
in her comments the nonvoting member of the ruling communist 
party politburo addressed an issue that until recently would not be 
discussed by the official soviet media much less by a senior 
official 
but in the past two years as society has begun to discuss openly 
many of the social problems it kept hidden for decades women have 
protested the lack of contraceptives and sex education and the 
humiliation they say they face when they seek an abortion 
abortion is used instead of contraceptives as the main means of 
birth control in the soviet union and western experts estimate the 
average soviet woman has nine abortions 
the health ministry newspaper meditsinskaya gazeta commenting on 
a critical shortage of condoms said some couples were so desperate 
they had turned to using childrens balloons 
the first thing we have to do is increase production of 
contraceptives mrs biryukova said we have to improve 
conditions in hospitals 
the latest salvo against the medical profession came in an 
article published in the weekend edition of the newspaper moscow 
news 
yekaterina nikolayeva wrote about standing in line at the door of 
a hospital operating room one recent morning waiting for her 
abortion 
what are you waiting for come on dont stare she quoted 
the doctor as saying taking off a pair of bloodstained rubber 
gloves as she entered 
my hands started to shake i felt scared hurt and on the verge 
of tears she continued hurry up you im sick and tired of 
your stupidity the doctor spurred me on 
after the abortion the doctors left for the day without checking 
on her and she finally left on her own in a nightgown and robe she 
said 
mrs biryukova said 600 to 700 women die every year as the result 
of abortions in the russian republic the largest of the soviet 
unions 15 republics 
she said 90 percent of all first pregnancies end in abortion and 
that 65 million abortions are performed annually in the soviet 
union 
she did note cite a source for the figures but if they are 
accurate they would indicate there are about 900000 more abortions 
a year in the soviet union than live births a soviet statistical 
reference says there were 56 million births in 1986 
mrs biryukova said she had read the moscow news article and had 
asked health minister yevgeny chazov and moscow officials to 
investigate the complaints 
she said the leadership was committed to improving health care 
and had allocated an extra 128 billion during the current 
fiveyear economic plan 
moscow news also asked vladimir alexeyev head of the mother and 
child care department of the health ministry about ms nikolayevas 
complaints it quoted alexeyev as saying many kinds of 
contraceptives are available but that the level of sex education is 
so low that women dont know about them 
the ministry tried to organize educational radio and television 
programs but the public was scandalized by them he said

the nation made no progress in reducing 
economic disparities between blacks and whites during the reagan 
years and blacks face increasing misery from poverty crime and 
drugs the national urban league reported today 
the report the state of black america 1989 is the 
organizations 14th annual assessment of the status and conditions 
of blacks in america 
the new bush administration will need a clear understanding of 
the large magnitude of the problem of economic disparities as a 
precondition to finding effective remedies david h swinton said 
in the reports summary of economic conditions 
no progress has been made in reducing the longstanding economic 
disparities faced by blacks during the reagan administration 
swinton dean of the business school at jackson state university in 
mississippi wrote in fact racial inequality in american life 
actually increased by many of the standard indicators 
at a news conference releasing the report john e jacob 
president of the national urban league said he was encouraged by 
president bushs selections of what he called a very centrist 
cabinet he called on bush to establish as a goal moving black 
americans toward economic parity with whites 
we call for a decadelong massive effort jacob said that 
effort would amount to a national investment in the future 
in a grim assessment of the outlook for black children in 
america marian wright edelman wrote that compared with 1980 black 
children are more likely to be born into poverty lack early 
prenatal care have a single mother have an unemployed parent and 
not go to college 
a black baby is three times as likely as a white baby to be born 
to a mother who has had no prenatal care and is more than twice as 
likely to die during the first year she said a black male teenager 
is six times as likely as a white male teenager to be a victim of 
homicide she said 
millions of black children today live in a desolate world where 
physical survival is a triumph where fear and hopelessness reign 
and where the future holds no promises and few opportunities said 
edelman president of the childrens defense fund 
in another section the report said the number of blacks enrolled 
in fouryear colleges has declined since 1980 while other minority 
groups showed increases 
the report said black families experienced sharp social and 
economic setbacks during the 1970s and 1980s after unprecedented 
gains during the 1960s 
it said the poverty rate for black families in 1987 was higher 
at 30 percent than the rate in 1969 28 percent the number of 
black families in poverty was up 700000 it said three times more 
blacks were unemployed in 1988 than in 1969 the report said 
the report cited increases in the proportion of femaleheaded 
black families over two decades and a shrinking in the size of the 
black middleclass since 1978 
increases in use of drugs drugrelated crime and gang violence 
have destabilized many black families and caused homicide rates 
among blacks to reach record levels according to a chapter written 
by robert b hill a consultant to the league 
the disproportionate surge in deaths among blacks has resulted 
in the first declines in black life expectancy since 1962 hill 
wrote 
he said life expectancy at birth rose among whites from 753 to 
754 years between 1984 and 1986 but for blacks the corresponding 
figures declined from 697 to 694 years 
the report also said black families have been 
disproportionately devastated by the declining stock of 
affordable housing 
blacks are overrepresented among the thousands of families and 
children living in welfare hotels and shelters for the homeless 
he said

six former us marines 
completed their 10day tour of vietnam today making one of their 
last stops at an orphanage where they were serenaded with 
traditional vietnamese songs 
the world belongs to the children a chorus of girls sang 
gene spanos a 39yearold police lieutenant was struck by the 
poverty and gave the orphanage 40 on behalf of the marines he also 
gave one of the boys a cap of the chicago bears football team 
william johnson 41 gave another boy a st christopher medal 
the marines were to leave ho chi minh city for bangkok thailand 
en route back to the united states where they will report their 
findings to government authorities 
they pronounced a success their goodwill visit in which they 
called attention to the dangers of unexploded shells and mines in 
central vietnam 
the exmarines had walked the battlefields and seen children 
trying to dig up shell casings buried in the red dirt of former us 
bases they heard reports of continuing casualties from the shells 
and mines 
five of the men are former members of the 11th marines an 
engineer battalion that planted 100000 land mines in the region to 
protect american bases more than 20 years ago 
the marines had returned on their own to determine whether the 
mines and unexploded shells had been removed they came as tourists 
but were given vip treatment staying at a government guest house in 
dongha 
in hanoi they met with nguyen can deputy director of the 
foreign ministrys north american department followed by dinner 
with the official 
the former marines presented their findings to can who said he 
would relay the information to the proper authorities 
robert dalton a 54yearold freelance writer from davidsonville 
md said can brought up the issue of establishing diplomatic 
relations with the united states 
vietnam badly wants diplomatic relations which likely would mean 
us economic aid and the lifting of an american trade embargo to 
this end it has been opening its doors wide to american visitors 
they talked about some things that shouldnt have been talked 
about in the meetings dalton said of the vietnamese but it 
worked out good because they accepted our findings 
spanos from rosemont ill and the trips organizer described 
it as a huge success 
weve accomplished a couple of things he said weve shown 
the vietnamese that in the north there is a problem in the central 
area and they appreciate it 
he added if they want vietnam veterans to come back here as 
tourists many of the marines that served up in those areas are 
going to want to go up in those areas and we want it to be safe 
for the former marines it was a journey into the past to renew 
their youth and to pause on the battlefields to unfurl the stars and 
stripes and honor their fallen comrades 
i think i lost about 20 pounds of emotional baggage i never 
knew i was carrying around said nate genna a 41yearold 
maintenance worker from boston 
frank noe a 40yearold firefighter from stoughton mass said 
we had a chance to do some good in this world not only that to 
come back to a place where we grew up where we became men

jesse jackson today endorsed mayor eugene sawyers 
bid for the citys democratic mayoral nomination saying sawyer 
has earned our support 
the endorsement came just hours after sawyers leading black 
challenger alderman timothy evans submitted 100000 petition 
signatures in a thirdparty bid 
evans move was an attempt to avoid a split in the black primary 
vote that would give an edge to the leading white democratic 
candidate richard m daley son of the citys longtime former mayor 
unless his petitions are challenged evans will bypass the citys 
feb 28 democratic mayoral primary and run under the banner of his 
own party which he dubbed the harold washington party in the april 
4 special election to fill the remaining two years of washingtons 
term 
washington the citys first black mayor died from a heart 
attack in november 1987 evans was washingtons floor leader in the 
city council but the aldermen selected sawyer who also is black 
to succeed washington until the special election could be held 
jackson said today that a primary victory by sawyer will show 
our strong resolve to go forward in unity with a multiracial 
coalition of workers determined to conquer the present odds 
as he filed his petitions evans pledged to reform the citys 
political scene especially what he called the remnants of the 
machine of late mayor richard j daley who died 12 years ago 
evans also announced a drive to sign up an estimated 150000 
unregistered black voters the drive if successful could benefit 
sawyer but evans handlers believe the mayor wont survive the 
primary 
we dont particularly care who it helps in the primary we want 
to make sure people are registered to vote evans spokeswoman 
sharon jenkinsbrown said if ancillary effects fall to sawyer 
more power to him 
over the weekend sawyer got endorsements from several 
influential black leaders including a former political foe 
alderman danny davis davis however said his endorsement is only

israeli soldiers shot and killed an arab youth 
in a predawn raid on a west bank village today and the military 
announced that security agents had arrested dozens of members of an 
underground army 
jerusalems mayor teddy kollek who for 23 years has championed 
unity in this mixed arab and jewish city announced he is running 
for a sixth term 
this is a united city and will remain a united city with equal 
rights to arabs said the 77yearold mayor who faces opposition 
on the city council from ultraorthodox and rightwing elements that 
control almost half the 31 seats 
the raid on habla adhered to the army policy of disrupting 
nationalistic activities on days of general strikes called by 
leaders of the 13month palestinian uprising 
todays strike called to protest harsh new army tactics for 
quelling the revolt closed down shops in the west bank and arab 
east jerusalem and paralyzed commerce in the gaza strip where the 
army confined at least 200000 arabs to their homes 
the shin bet security service arrested dozens of arabs suspected 
of belonging to the palestinian popular army the military 
command announced today officials said the group was led by yasser 
arafats mainstream fatah branch of the plo 
israel radio said the main suspect apprehended abdel fatah 
hassan of the west bank town of nablus received weapons and money 
from fatah and trained dozens of youths for attacks against israelis 
as part of the uprising against israels 21year occupation of the 
west bank and gaza 
the radio did not mention what type or quantity of weapons were 
seized and a military spokesman said he was unable to provide 
details 
hassan also possessed special badges for his squads which were 
due to train hundreds of others in the west bank the report 
said no further details were released including when the arrests 
were made 
it was not immediately clear how seriously the wave of arrests 
had debilitated the group palestine liberation organization 
statements have said such a group was being formed under the 
auspices of force17 a fatah unit and had thousands of members in 
the occupied territories 
the organization issued its first leaflet last week describing 
itself as an inseparable unit of other military palestinian forces 
in the diaspora under arafats leadership 
palestinian observers have said the organization was formed in an 
apparent attempt to unite loosely organized groups of youths who 
enforce strikes and attack collaborators 
before the shin bet crackdown there was little indication 
organized or armed units existed in the occupied lands 
the soldiers who raided habla which is near qalqilya 
encountered a squad of masked arabs and killed one of them after the 
arabs ignored orders to halt military officials said 
another palestinian was wounded and four managed to escape 
the dead youth was identified by his family as issam hashem 
elmarabi 19 arab reports earlier had said the victim was 
17yearold khaled mardawi but he later was reported recovering 
from a wound in his left leg at an israeli hospital in the city of 
kfar saba 
the death raised to 368 the number of palestinians killed since 
the rebellion began dec 8 1987 fifteen israelis have also been 
killed 
the plolinked unified national leadership of the uprising called 
todays strike to protest the policy announced by the military last 
week of demolishing homes of stonethrowers and arabs convicted of 
violent acts against israel 
in an underground leaflet distributed monday the leadership also 
decried a new army policy that allows officers and specially trained 
troops to shoot plastictipped bullets at fleeing stonethrowers and 
arabs who set up barricades 
previous regulations gave officers permission to fire the bullets 
only in lifethreatening situations or to incapacitate leaders of 
demonstrations 
at least 47 arabs have been killed and 288 wounded by the 
plastictipped bullets said chief army spokesman brig gen ephraim 
lapid 
speaking on israel televisions arabiclanguage service prime 
minister yitzhak shamir defended the orders 
nobody is happy about the fact that there are wounded he 
said but a war has been forced on us its not only a war against 
israels presence in certain areas of the country its a war 
against our existence

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
bowed to budget concerns today and recommended the namibia 
peacekeeping force be cut to 4650 troops 
it is expected to be the united nations costliest mission 
black african nations and nonaligned countries have argued for 
weeks with the united states soviet union britain france and 
china over the size and cost of the force 
it will oversee namibias transition from south african rule to 
independence which is to begin april 1 
the organization of african unity and nonaligned countries 
insisted that at least 7500 troops be dispatched as provided for 
in the original 1978 un security council plan for the territory 
but the united states and the other permanent members of the 
security council which together pay 58 percent of peacekeeping 
costs objected to the estimated 700 million cost of sending that 
many troops 
the united states proposed sending about 3200 peacekeepers to 
the territory which has also been known as southwest africa 
in his recommendations to the security council released today 
perez de cuellar kept the upper limit of the peacekeeping contingent 
at 7500 but said only 4650 would be dispatched at a cost of about 
416 million the remaining troops will be held in readiness in 
their home countries in case they are needed he said 
all un peacekeeping operations in 1988 cost about 375 million 
the most expensive was the 196064 congo peacekeeping mission which 
cost more than 400 million at much higher dollar rates and 
involved 19828 soldiers 
the security council must vote on perez de cuellars 
recommendations and is expected to approve them 
elections for a namibian assembly are to be held in november the 
assembly will draft a constitution and organize a blackmajority 
ruled government ending south africas 74year rule over namibia 
a force of 500 police drawn from un member nations will be sent 
to supervise the namibian police who will still be responsible for 
law and order during the transition to independence

more than half the seagulls of ioannina 
lake in northwestern greece have died and are washing ashore by the 
hundreds the greek ornithological society said tuesday 
a spokesman for the society said pesticides used by farmers 
probably are to blame 
about 500 dead seagulls had been found and 500 more were expected 
to wash up said the spokesman martin gaethlich the seagull 
population of the lake is estimated at between 1500 and 2000 
the ioannina veterinary laboratory said the dead birds showed no 
sign of disease and poisoning was being investigated 
gaethlich said other species of birds feeding from the lake 
including crows remained healthy 
ioannina lake about seven miles long and two miles wide is one 
of the most beautiful natural sites in greece 
pesticides are the only remaining possibility farmers use them 
along with herbicides right after plowing and seagulls follow the 
tractors to feed from the ground gaethlich said 
farmers started plowing early because of warm weather but a lack 
of rainfall didnt help the toxic substances dissolve he said

arianespace europes commerical space transport 
company plans to order 50 ariane4 launch vehicles worth about 3 
billion from its industrial partners next month it was announced 
tuesday 
the ariane4 rockets will be used to put satellites into orbit 
between 1991 and 1999 
frances stateowned aerospatiale sa is one of the major partners 
in the ariane4 project with a 204 percent share other major 
partners include statecontrolled societe europeenne de propulsion 
and matra sa with shares of 211 percent and 87 percent

netherlands and construcciones aeronauticas sa of spain 
arianespace officials estimate that by ordering 50 rockets at 
once the consortium will be able to reduce its prices by 20 percent 
the cost of an araine4 launch would be reduced to between 90 
million and 100 million making the vehicle competitive with other 
launchers operating in the 1990s said arianespace chairman

the ariane4 which can put a 42ton payload into orbit made 
its first flight at the end of last year 
dallest said 1988 had been a good year for arianespace with net 
income of about 17 million on revenue of 612 million 
he said the consortium is consolidating its 50 percent share of 
the world satellite launch market and said arianespaces schedule 
for this year includes contracts for nine launches most of which 
will be ariane4s 
dallest expressed concern about the entry of the chinese into 
the world market with their long march rockets the chinese began 
offering to put satellites in orbit for between 20 million and 25 
million he said but they have now agreed to make their prices more 
realistic

alexei petrov gave his stamps to a hereford businessman attending

impossible from here petrov wrote in the letter delivered to the 
cathedral by businessman john bone 
as a way out of the predicament i remembered my small stamp 
collection which incidentally is connected with maps 
i thought it might raise a couple of pounds at a jumble 
rummage sale and thus help you in your almost impossible task of 
raising more than 7 million pounds 124 million the sum the 
cathedral says it needs he wrote let it be my humble christian 
and christmas gift to the church of england for saving mappa mundi

this is an unexpected and wonderful gesture the bishop said 
i have written a letter of thanks to mr petrov and sent him a 
copy of the mappa mundi 
the cathedral decided last fall to sell the mappa mundi unless it 
raised money to pay off debts and make repairs 
the map one of europes greatest medieval treasures is due to 
be sold at sothebys auction house in june

emanuel ungaro on tuesday presented a sumptuous 
collection for spring and summer softening his structured look in 
defiance of the sweet and pretty trend dominating french haute 
couture 
ungaro all but ignored pleats and wide breezy pants and 
minimized the draping he has used lavishly in earlier shows 
midway through frances high fashion week he showed welldefined 
lines bold colors and lots of glitter 
ungaro also had a bold approach to the flowers that have sprung 
up everywhere for spring and summer 
mixing colors generously he played dramatic floral prints on 
jackets and tops against small flower prints on the dresses or pants 
underneath in one outfit a black checked jacket was paired with a 
floralprint dress 
soft notes included petticoats under flouncy skirts and cinched 
waists and lots of silky fabric 
there were a few examples of what is becoming the classic soft 
look for summer including a gauzy white floorlength dress with 
halter top and draped bodice set off with a gold medallion and gold 
lame at the midriff 
jackets long or short but all with tightly cinched waists often 
were ruffled at the shouldertop for a sweptup wing effect 
reminiscent of royalty the softness came when the jacket was 
removed to reveal a pretty strapless flowery dress 
ungaro used gold and silver extensively in brocade or weaved 
into the fabric 
pants were soft and most were tailored with thin legs and worn 
under jackets or in pants suits 
hemlines were above the knee but jacket lengths varied from just 
below the waist to dress length and beyond 
pierre cardin showing monday solved the problem of hemlines 
with soaring splits sometimes in the front and back in what has 
been dubbed the longshort in variations of the look he 
covered minis with long flowing wraps or tight sheaths with 
cloaklike jackets 
balmain excelled in suits and nina ricci turned out beautiful 
summer evening dresses christian dior went to the sari to achieve 
the draped look so prevalent this week 
cardin also refused to abandon the structured shoulder for day 
wear replacing pads in suit jackets with little front tucks 
sometimes bowed that tend to square off and extend the shoulder 
without exaggerated padding 
jeanlouis scherrer seemed to luxuriate in pants and pleats 
showing pants suits for day and evening often dressed up with lace 
or embroidery

prince charles bringing condolences 
five weeks after the crash of pan am flight 103 gave an extra hour 
tuesday to a town that felt snubbed by the royal family in its time 
of grief 
the heir to the throne listened and talked to relatives of the 11 
people killed in lockerbie dec 21 and laid an elaborate floral 
tribute at the town hall he charmed children and paused for a 
whiskey before leaving more than an hour behind schedule but with 
new admirers 
it says a lot for him that he had the courage to come it is a 
great honor said store manager robert devlin 
i thought it was a bit late in the day for charles visit 
said anne mcphail whose neighbors houses are in ruins but now i 
feel better about it you see we all make mistakes you can always 
rectify them cant you 
charles visited the crater gouged by the falling boeing 747 in 
the sherwood crescent neighborhood where all of lockerbies victims 
lived 
the bomb that brought down flight 103 also killed all 259 aboard 
searchers found 242 bodies of which all but two have been identified 
charles visit with the families scheduled to last 20 minutes 
stretched longer than an hour as he met with them in groups of 10 or 
fewer guided by the towns three clergymen 
it was a very worthwhile visit and i think everyone is much 
the better for it said the rev james annand the local church of 
scotland minister 
it shows the value of having a monarchy he said 
the monarchy however had appeared to stumble over lockerbie 
charles brother prince andrew the duke of york had come to 
lockerbie the day after the crash but offended some with remarks 
that seemed to show him more concerned about the american bereaved 
than those of lockerbie 
i am pleased that the prince has come to make amends for his 
brother trucker niven milligan said as charles toured lockerbie 
on jan 4 when the royals stayed away from a memorial service in 
lockerbie attended by relatives of the families pan am staff and 
prime minister margaret thatcher the press was scathing 
the royals sent local representatives and buckingham palace said 
it was not customary for queen elizabeth ii to attend such events in 
person but then to the anger of some lockerbie residents the 
palace announced that the queens husband prince philip would fly 
to japan for the funeral of emperor hirohito 
charles visit appeared to soothe feelings in the scottish market 
town he was cheered as his limousine pulled up in front of town 
hall 
he strolled to the police barricade to chat with onlookers 
including pupils from lockerbie primary school who had noisily but 
patiently waited in a cold wind for his arrival 
the princes path back to the rail station and his train passed 
the black bull pub where landlady joan jamieson invited him in 
charles 40 vaulted over a barricade and accepted a free glass 
of malt whiskey 
mrs jamieson asked if she could now formally declare her pub to 
be patronized by royalty 
that will take three years of good service charles said 
but im willing to try it 
the visit in my own feeling was timed to perfection said 
the rev alan neal the local anglican priest people are now 
beginning to think a little bit ahead

the future of one of the last tracts of 
virgin forest in appalachia is at stake in a lawsuit in which a 
former owner argues the state should give the land back because it 
isnt taking proper care of the historic relic 
the oldest trees in the 550acre lilley cornett woods 15 miles 
west of whitesburg in rugged eastern kentucky predate the pilgrims 
landing in 1620 
its the last remnant of any size thats preserved in kentucky 
of the presettlement forest said william h martin an eastern 
kentucky university official who oversees the site including 252 
acres of oak walnut chestnut and hickory that have never been 
logged or used for grazing 
thats it martin said were talking about 252 acres out 
of 25 million originally in kentucky 
martin and the university are among the officials and state 
agencies who are defendants in a lawsuit filed last year by a son of 
lilley cornett the man for whom the woods are named the lawsuit 
seeks to return ownership of the property to the son dock cornett 
the elder cornett bought the land in 1918 and protected the woods 
from outside encroachment for several decades he willed the small 
forest to his sons who sold it to the state for 270000 in 1968 on 
the condition that it be preserved as a living museum 
dock cornett 68 contends the state has failed to live up to 
that obligation 
he said the state and eku have built a dam cut timber torn down 
historic log structures dating from the 1800s and erected research 
stations all in violation of restrictions in the 1968 deed the 
university took over administration of the forest in 1977 
a letcher circuit court judge is expected to rule next month on 
whether the lawsuit should be dismissed on grounds of governmental 
immunity if the case is allowed to proceed cornetts lawyer said a 
trial could take place before the end of the year 
dock cornett retained the right to live in a home at an edge of 
the woods and to move about the property without restriction he 
keeps binoculars handy to observe the activities of the university 
caretaker mike brotzge 
getting the truth out is all i want said cornett a retired 
teacher who was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of terroristic 
threatening stemming from an altercation with brotzge in 1987 
martin said suggestions that eku was damaging the forest were 
absurd he said the dam the university built along a stream 
holds back a small amount of water for hydrology studies and 
experiments at the research buildings focus on acid rain and plant 
species 
cornett and his lawyer coy holstein of whitesburg said that in 
addition to the serious accusations they have leveled against the 
state and the university they also are concerned that eku officials 
place too little emphasis on providing tours for visitors 
martin who declined to discuss specific allegations in the 
lawsuit said only about 1000 people visited the remote site in 
1988 he said he thought no more than 3000 visitors should be 
allowed into the area annually and views the area primarily as a 
research station 
visitors must make appointments to tour the woods when visitors 
arrived unannounced recently brotzge was working on a truck and 
said he was too busy to provide a tour 
if cornett won the lawsuit he would offer the land to other 
state agencies or private conservation groups holstein said if eku 
is allowed to keep the site the lawyer said he believes the outlook 
for the forest would be grim

the us embassy said tuesday it had 
warned americans to get out of afghanistan most of them along with 
other western private citizens announced plans to leave 
some diplomatic sources predicted president najib will declare 
martial law as the last soviet military forces withdraw and leave 
his army to fight alone against a moslem insurgency that began after 
a communist coup 11 years ago 
other than those in embassies most westerners are with the 
international aid mission a charitable organization that has 
operated in afghanistan for many years among other things it runs 
an eye hospital in kabul 
theyve finally gotten through to us said richard penner a 
canadian who directs the mission 
penner said 10 people would stay including himself but the 
other 42 would be gone by feb 11 four days before the soviet 
withdrawal deadline the mission had 85 people in afghanistan last 
summer 
the dozen americans in afghanistan other than 11 at the embassy 
work for the mission 
nearly all dependents of foreigners already have left 
predictions of martial law accompanied growing evidence despite 
repeated soviet denials that the red army is pulling out of kabul 
ahead of the deadline set in a unmediated withdrawal agreement 
a 70vehicle military convoy left kabul on monday heading north 
on the salang highway that connects the capital with the soviet 
border 250 miles away it included six tanks armored personnel 
carriers and trucks loaded with soldiers 
it was the first northern movement of soviet troops observed this 
week western diplomats said convoys of up to 100 vehicles each were 
seen moving up the highway four days last week 
afghan soldiers have replaced soviet personnel at some guard 
posts on kabuls perimeter and hundreds of red army soldiers with 
full gear have been seen boarding ilyushin76 transport planes at 
the airport 
members of the interior ministry militia a force of 30000 
considered to be among the governments best were placed at 
checkpoints in downtown kabul a few days ago 
western diplomats in islamabad pakistan said tuesday the heavy 
convoy and air traffic indicated the final soviet withdrawal was in 
progress the sources also reported intense fighting between 
government forces in kanduz a northern province and in nangarhar 
and kandahar provinces to the east 
they said the pace of departure indicated nearly all soviet 
forces would be out by the end of january one diplomat speaking 
privately like the others quoted afghans and east european 
diplomats as saying a paratroop battalion or other small force might 
remain until the feb 15 deadline 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 were in the country wen the witdrawal agreement 
was signed april 14 in geneva the pullout began may 15 and half 
were gone by aug 15 
jon d glassman charge daffaires at the us embassy said in a 
warning letter to americans that a critical point had come in 
the kabul area increased instablity was likely and they should 
leave while commercial flights remained available 
only the soviet airline aeroflot and ariana the afghan 
government airline still operate from kabul aeroflot uses military 
planes and ariana flights are unpredictable sometimes delayed or 
canceled for lack of aviation fuel 
britains embassy issued a similar warning last week to to its 
nationals and citizens of other countries for which it has 
diplomatic responsibility including canada australia and ireland 
other than the missionaries foreigners still in afghanistan 
include a few hundred diplomats a dwindling number of soviet 
civilian advisers employees of the international red cross and 
officials of un aid agencies and the un body monitoring the 
withdrawal agreement 
on saturday the west german embassy became the first to close 
spokesmen for others say they confer regularly about when or whether 
to do the same 
food shortages in kabul have been severe because of guerrilla 
attacks on supply convoys and the soviets began a flour airlift 
last weekend that brings in 400500 tons a day 
maj gen lev serebrov the soviet deputy commander in 
afghanistan insisted sunday the final withdrawal had yet to begin 
western analysts believe the kremlin wants to keep the pullout 
under wraps for security and political reasons including continued 
political pressure on guerrilla leaders to resume negotitons for a 
coalition government including communists 
leaders of the sevenparty guerrilla alliance based in pakistan 
have refused such a deal and broke off talks with the soviets about 
a political solution

soviet leader mikhail gorbachev edged 
president bush in a survey of opinions toward world leaders in 
republicandominated orange county but both ran behind british 
prime minister margaret thatcher and president reagan according to 
a poll released today 
the los angeles timessponsored survey of orange county residents 
also revealed that 45 percent think the cold war between the 
superpowers is coming to an end 
the results came in the county that gave bush and former 
president ronald reagan their largest margins of victory of any us 
county in the presidential elections of 1980 1984 and 1988 
asked do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of these 
world leaders positive ratings were as follows 79 percent for 
mrs thatcher 76 percent for reagan 70 percent for gorbachev 67 
percent for bush and 21 percent for israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
the poll which involved 600 adults in the county southeast of 
los angeles had a 4 percentage point margin of error the newspaper 
said 
the message is that orange county is more in the mainstream of 
american thinking than the perception said longtime reagan 
adviser stu spencer thinking on the cold war undoubtedly is 
changing due to ronald reagans policies 
the poll taken jan 1317 by mark baldassare amp associates of 
irvine also found that more orange county residents see japan and 
the third world as a threat to the united states than the soviet 
union and china 
thirtyone percent said the third world presented the greatest 
threat to the future of the united states just 17 percent said the 
soviet union presents the greatest threat while 6 percent felt 
china was the greatest threat 
on the issues of abortion aids education and pornography orange 
county residents again showed a softening of their perceived 
conservative tendencies 
sixty percent opposed a supreme court ban on abortions and 56 
percent opposed a ban on the rental of xrated films at video stores 
regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome 82 percent favored 
teaching youngsters in public schools about the use of condoms as a 
means of controlling the spread of the deadly aids virus

the citys top safety official said fire 
inspectors are backing away from a campaign to enforce a ban on 
candles in restaurants 
it would seem weve given this a higher priority than 
necessary public safety director glenn cannon said monday 
cannon said he and fire chief charles dickinson had been unaware 
that fire prevention inspectors were cracking down on the use of 
open flames the campaign met criticism and defiance from 
restaurateurs 
inspectors began in december visiting restaurants and warning 
operators they could be fined 1000 unless they stopped using 
candles oil lamps or other open flames without prior fire 
department approval 
fire capt robert friel said last week that the campaign began 
after inspectors noticed increased use of candles and flaming lamps 
in crowded restaurants 
the ordinance also covers churches and synagogues but friel said 
inspectors would not try to ban open flames in places of worship 
dickinson said the inspectors will continue to enforce the fire 
code they dont need to carry out plans to visit every restaurant 
in the city

twentyseven members of congress attended the 
tobacco industrys annual conference near palm springs calif 
earlier this month staying at a posh resort with a golf course 
tennis courts and a spa and receiving nice speaking fees 
one of those attending was congress speakingfees champion 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski the 
illinois democrat who also played in bob hopes golf tournament in 
palm springs made three speeches for 2000 each and two speeches 
at 7500 each while he was in the area an aide said 
soon however if a proposed deal goes through in return for a 
big pay raise senators and representatives would give up access to 
the hefty speaking fees that have helped attract many of them to 
thousands of functions each year 
its not clear how trip expenses would be handled however 
unless members of congress are forced to pay all their travel and 
lodging expenses conferences in places such as palm springs would 
seem to face no problem bringing in the people they want 
but some cities and groups could have trouble 
sen bob packwood rore summing up the situation bluntly said 
that without a speaking fee i would not fly to cleveland to speak 
to a trade group i didnt care about 
he said that if such fees known as honoraria are banned he 
would accept only engagements to get out a particular message or 
rally the troops on issues he cared about 
sen claiborne pell dri said he wouldnt speak as much 
without honoraria but would continue to address groups where he 
could drum up support for his legislative goals 
rep doug barnard jr dga said some of his colleagues say 
if its not a 2000 honorarium its not worth going to he 
hastened to add im not like that 
senators currently can keep honoraria amounting to 40 percent of 
salary in other words up to 35800 for rankandfile members 
more for leaders who receive extra pay a house limit of 30 percent 
of salary amounts to 26850 for the rankandfile honoraria 
include payment for speeches appearances and written articles 
lawmakers in both houses can retain up to 2000 per article or 
event with any fee exceeding that figure or any amount over the 
annual cap going to charity 
congressional leaders have said lawmakers would ban such fees in 
return for a 50 percent pay raise that would send rankandfile 
salaries zooming from 89500 to 135000 
unless both houses vote to stop it the pay increase recommended 
by former president reagan in his budget plan would become law in 
two weeks 
spokesmen for some interest groups say theyre are wondering if 
theyll still attract lawmakers for convention speeches plant tours 
and washington power lunches with lobbyists if they can no longer 
offer fees 
in the case of the palm springs gathering sen thomas a 
daschles office said the south dakota democrat earned a 2000 
honorarium at the tobacco conference the tobacco institute paid 
1392 in airfare for the senator and his wife and gave them three 
nights lodging 
tobacco institute spokesman walker merryman would not confirm the 
honoraria and expense costs of bringing 27 lawmakers to a resort 
near palm springs but said all of the congressional guests received 
the same financial considerations 
rostenkowski combined his palm springs trip with participation in 
the hope golf tournament where proceeds are given to charity the 
lawmaker reported receiving 245000 in honoraria in 1987 more than 
any other member of congress he gave 219156 to charity 
other examples of honoraria since the past congress adjourned 
daschle whose office said he earned 9000 in fees since the 
100th congress quit last oct 22 dashed to princeton nj and 
back in a squibb corp plane jan 17 to make a 2000 breakfast 
speech at company headquarters 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo picked up 8000 from three 
appearances including addresses at two universities 
senate republican whip alan k simpson of wyoming known for his 
wit as a speaker earned 11500 in fees since adjournment 
including 4000 for participating nov 1620 in a government 
conference in indian wells near palm springs 
sen j bennett johnston dla chairman of the senate energy 
committee was flown to puerto rico and back in an american cyanamid 
jet dec 1516 for speeches a plant tour and other activities the 
senator received a 1000 honorarium and took his wife along 
although the company said it did not pay any extra expenses for mrs 
johnston 
sen richard lugar rind an eagle scout earned 2000 from 
speaking to the boy scouts of america sen steve symms ridaho 
spoke to the western growers association for 2000 sen orrin g 
hatch rutah addressed a health care organization for 1500 and 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny gave an address for 2000 to 
the american society of composers authors and publishers 
if they want to change the rules of the game thats fine 
said mark gorman senior director for government affairs of the 
national restaurant association but i would be concerned if the 
result was that we would continue to issue invitations and get no 
response i suspect it would be more difficult 
michael koleda president of the council for alternative fuels 
the synthetic fuels lobby said unburdened by the need to earn 
additional income members will be free to be with those groups they 
like to be with 
so i suspect he added with a chuckle that we would do 
very well

a man reportedly contracted the aids virus by 
having oral sex with a woman the first report in medical literature 
of womantoman transmission of the virus in that fashion according 
to a doctor 
the case of the 60yearold new england man was reported in this 
weeks new england journal of medicine by two physicians from the 
lahey clinic medical center 
i hope the message gets through especially to younger people 
in high school and college who cling to the belief that theyre all 
right if they dont have intercourse said dr peter g spitzer 
one of the authors 
the man who got the virus reportedly has been married for 30 
years and has diabetes which caused nerve damage that made him 
impotent he told his doctors he had not had sex with his wife for 
years 
the doctors said the mans only sexual contact in recent years 
was with a prostitute with whom he engaged only in oral sex 
he said the woman used intravenous drugs in his presence this 
suggested the possibility that she contracted the virus from sharing 
hypodermic needles rather than from sexual activity the report said 
the two doctors from the lahey clinic in burlington did not seek 
out the prostitute because of state laws on the confidentiality of 
aids patients spitzer said 
ironically if she had syphilis state health authorities could 
trace her he said 
spitzer said it is most likely that the virus was transmitted to 
the man through her vaginal secretions researchers at massachusetts 
general hospital have found the aids virus in vaginal fluids 
but studies have shown that saliva can contain small amounts of 
the virus and it could have been transmitted through the 
prostitutes saliva 
spitzer and his coauthor dr neil j weiner wrote that 
public health education about safer sexual practices must not only 
advocate the use of barrier contraceptives such as condoms during 
vaginal and rectal intercourse but also caution against the 
exchange of bodily fluids during other sexual practices such as 
oral sex

a group of armed civilians 
surrendered this morning after holding off hundreds of tank and 
artillerybacked soldiers and police at an army base for a day the 
government news agency said 
shots rang out in the distance while president raul alfonsin 
toured the base later but authorities said the shots were not aimed 
at the president or his helicopter 
at least 25 people were killed in fighting after about 40 
commandos who the government said were leftist guerrillas broke 
through the bases main gate in a stolen truck monday authorities 
said 
the staterun telam news agency said 13 men and one woman left 
the base early this morning their hands in the air and one waving a 
white shirt as a flag of surrender 
it was unclear whether all 14 were involved in the takeover the 
two private news agencies diarios y noticias and noticias 
argentinas said some may have been hostages 
as the president toured the base soldiers and police exchanged 
sporadic gunfire with three men outside the compound one in a 
tower one in a building and the third in a car they later chased 
the gunmen but it was not immediately known if they caught them 
local news reports said some commandos had also sniped at police 
and troops monday from positions outside the la tablada base on the 
capitals western outskirts 
the red brick officers club in which the attackers holed up was 
virtually leveled by tank and mortar fire and the woman who walked 
out this morning was was wounded and had to be carried by two 
comrades telam reported 
soldiers took the 14 into custody and entered the bombedout 
officers club it said 
the battle was the most serious of its kind since an attack by 
the leftist peoples revolutionary party and an allied guerrilla 
group on an army arsenal in 1975 
five soldiers were killed and more than 30 soldiers and police 
officers wounded in mondays battle telam reported carlos becerra 
an aide to alfonsin said at least 20 commandos were killed 
the commandos either carried with them or stole groundtoground 
missiles and antitank guns military officials said in explaining 
they had held off government forces 
they did not identify themselves or state their motives but a 
woman who called diarios y noticias on monday said she belonged to 
the group and claimed it had acted to prevent a military coup 
it was to defend democracy and now theyre massacring us the 
agency quoted the woman who would not identify herself as saying 
please do something 
the popularly elected alfonsin government has coped with three 
military insurrections since april 1987 during which loyalist 
troops were extremely reluctant to fire on their rebellious 
colleagues 
the incidents ended with little or no bloodshed public sentiment 
has strongly backed alfonsin against rebels in the armed forces 
which ruled the country for nearly eight years until he took office 
in 1983 
during the military dictatorship at least 8900 argentine 
leftists were arrested by security forces and never seen again they 
are presumed executed 
the commandos had scattered rightwing pamphlets as they attacked 
the base but the government dismissed the notion they were anything 
but leftist extremists 
cesar jaroslavsky president of the governing radical civic 
unions bloc in the house of deputies said some commandos were 
members of the peoples revolutionary army which last battled 
soldiers a decade ago 
inside the base on monday the commandos were confined to the red 
brick officers club and several other buildings as soldiers blasted 
their positions with tank and mortar fire setting the buildings 
ablaze 
some had fled the base and hid out in nearby buildings sniping 
at police and soldiers local news agencies reported 
at 930 pm the armory exploded sending bright flames 100 
yards high into the darkness sporadic gunfire and an occasional 
mortar rounds continued inside the compound early today 
the pamphlets thrown out by the commandos they entered the base 
said long live rico and long live seineldin referring to 
the leaders of the three military insurrections 
cashiered lt col aldo rico and col mohamed ali seineldin both 
in military prison mounted their revolts to press for an end to the 
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the 
197683 military dictatorship

dismiss an aggravated kidnapping charge against the second of 10 men 
charged in the case 
the 20yearold woman said she did not want to testify in the 
trial of felipe chew 29 because the media attention had disrupted 
her life 
the woman had provided emotional testimony in a september trial 
that resulted in the conviction of orlando garza 24 on a sexual 
assault charge he was sentenced to 20 years in prison 
district judge gilberto hinojosa however denied her request and 
threatened to jail her for contempt of court if she refused to 
testify 
to a certain extent i sympathize with what youve been going 
through or what you say youve been going through but too much 
has happened for me to allow you to determine whether or not this 
case should proceed he said 
the judge said he could not allow the case to be dropped if the 
woman was not recanting her previous testimony before a grand jury 
that indicted chew she said she did not recant the accusations 
defense attorneys filed motions to dismiss the case after the 
woman said she did not want to testify but the judge denied the 
defense motion and called the jury into the courtroom 
in opening arguments today defense attorney jaime garza said the 
trial would include evidence of women who have an insatiable 
desire for sex women that just cant get enough even with multiple 
men 
on the stand the woman identified chew as one of the 20 or more 
men who kidnapped her and repeatedly raped her on march 26 
chew has been in the duval county jail since march 31 in lieu of 
bonds totaling 70000 
he was indicted along with nine other men last april after the 
mother of two reported she was attacked chew also faces a sexual 
assault charge in a later trial

john gotti reputed boss of the nations most 
powerful organizedcrime family was arrested on charges that he 
ordered the shooting of a union leader according to an indictment 
unsealed today 
one newspaper today said gotti ordered his associates to put a 
rocket in his pocket 
criminal court judge patricia williams ordered gotti held without 
bail at his arraignment monday but he was released today on 
100000 bond 
the grand jury indictment involves the may 7 1986 shooting of 
john f oconnor vice president and business manager of carpenters 
union local 608 
according to the indictment it was the specific goal and 
intention of the conspiracy to punish john f oconnor and thereby 
reaffirm the authority of the gambino crime family over all others 
who might challenge it 
oconnor now 49 was shot several times in the buttocks in what 
investigators said was retaliation for having ordered vandalism at a 
manhattan restaurant in february 1986 because the establishment was 
using nonunion carpenters 
he apparently was unaware the owners of the bankers and brokers 
restaurant were gottis friends the new york times reported today 
also arrested in connection with the shooting were two gotti 
associates angelo ruggiero and anthony guerrieri authorities said 
law enforcement officials described ruggiero 48 as a captain in 
the gambino crime family and guerrieri 60 as a soldier 
gotti the organizations 48yearold reputed leader was 
arrested monday evening while walking with his bodyguard on a street 
in little italy he was charged with firstdegree assault and 
conspiracy district attorney robert morgenthau said 
law enforcement officials said gotti offered no resistance 
john gotti is in jail ironically for a crime designed to 
consolidate his power said ronald goldstock director of the 
state organized crime task force appearing at a news conference 
today with morgenthau 
aides to morgenthau said that shortly before oconnor was 
wounded law enforcement officials overheard gotti on a 
courtapproved listening device talk about a planned execution of a 
union leader who was not identified 
the daily news quoted sources as saying that gotti told an 
associate oconnor had become overconfident and he wondered if 
he should bust him up the new york post said gotti could be 
heard ordering his henchmen to put a rocket in his pocket 
oconnor was not seriously hurt in the shooting 
the contract for killing oconnor allegedly was given to a member 
of the westies a gang that operated on manhattans west side 
authorities said 
at the arraignment monday gottis attorney bruce cutler 
objected when a prosecutor asked that gotti be denied bail cutler 
said gotti has not been convicted of a crime in 15 years and has 
made all prior required court appearances including his federal 
racketeering trial which ended in acquittal in march 1987 
but williams said she did not have the paperwork to document 
cutlers assertions and denied bail

the spiritual leader of a radical moslem group 
believed to hold nine americans hostage in lebanon has written to 
those pressing for the captives release that he wants to see an end 
to the human suffering recipients said tuesday 
a state department official who has seen the correspondence from 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah said the letters themselves are 
unusual but the content is not the official refused to be quoted 
by name 
fadlallah 53 is the spiritual guru of hezbollah an umbrella 
group of proiranian moslem shiites elements within the lebanese 
group actively employ terrorism and are thought to control the 
american hostages us officials say 
fadlallahs written statements in arabic came in response to 
letters sent to him by peggy say the sister of hostage terry 
anderson the journalists committee to free terry anderson the new 
yorkbased committee to protect journalists and ray barnett the 
head of friends in the west and ambassadors of aid two humanitarian 
groups in seattle wash 
anderson an associated press correspondent in beirut when he was 
kidnapped in march 1985 has been held longer than any of the other 
american hostages 
on tuesday the wives of three american professors at beirut 
university college seized two years ago appealed for the release 
of their husbands as they began their third year in captivity the 
three men are alann steen of boston robert polhill of new york and 
jesse turner of boise idaho 
the responses fadlallah gave to the letterwriters were similar 
in tone and content but were not identical 
we are always sorry for the continuous human suffering which we 
have tried to solve and continue to try to solve to bring the 
situation to a happy ending fadlallah wrote mrs say who lives 
in cadiz ky 
to anne nelson executive director of the committee to protect 
journalists fadlallah said i have tried several times to 
intervene to find a solution of their situation but my efforts 
failed because they were complicated by factors at the international 
level 
the moslem leader told william foley a time magazine 
photographer in new york who works with the committee to free 
anderson that we emphasize our concern to maintain friendly 
relations with the american people 
fadlallah disavowed any responsibility for the kidnappings 
mrs say who has written fadlallah in the past but never before 
received a response said she interpreted the letter as meaning the 
shiite leader might be willing to be a point of contact in any 
negotiations to free the hostages she pointed out that fadlallah 
knows anderson who had interviewed him as a reporter 
the letters delivered through an intermediary were received 
last week 
the us official said that fadlallah has made many 
pronouncements about the hostages some of which have appeared to be 
contradictory moreover he said that officials are not quite sure 
how much influence fadlallah has personally over the kidnappers 
the united states has a policy of not negotiating with those 
holding hostages although officials will talk about the welfare of 
the captives 
there is no direct contact between us and the iranians and 
between us and fadlallah the official said 
in a newspaper interview published in october fadlallah was 
quoted as saying the fate of the hostages would have to wait for 
the outcome of the american presidential election he said then 
that iran preferred to deal with republicans 
president bush has said he foresees the day of better relations 
with iran which could lead to the release of the hostages i 
dont start off with the view that we always have to be at 
loggerheads he said recently 
still bush has said he thinks it would be wrong to assume that 
iran controls a key to all these hostages 
irans prime minister hussein musavi said last week the hostage 
issue was an internal question of lebanon and what his country 
can do is limited because it is a question of territory 
the other hostages are thomas sutherland a dean at the american 
university of beirut joseph james cicippio acting comptroller of 
the university frank herbert reed director of the lebanon 
international school in beirut edward austin tracy an author and 
marine lt col william r higgins head of an observer group 
attached to the un interim force in lebanon

congressional leaders awaiting testimony this 
week by president bushs nominee for secretary of defense say the 
legislative agenda involving defense policy is likely to center on 
military strategy after eight years of the largest peacetime 
buildup 
senate armed services committee confirmation hearings start 
wednesday on former sen john g tower rtexas bushs choice to 
head the defense department 
the 63yearold tower whose 24 years as a senator included a 
stint a chairman of the committee is expected to win approval from 
his former colleagues despite concerns about his personal life and 
work as a defense consultant 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman has said that tower 
is likely to win senate confirmation 
among issues the committee is expected to raise with tower are 
the pentagon budget defense policy and bushs appointments to 
civilian posts within the department 
meantime matching resources such as strategic weapons and 
conventional forces to the type of military commitment the bush 
administration envisions will be the subject for a series of 
congressional hearings during this legislative session 
after two terms under ronald reagan in which the administration 
allocated 213 trillion to the defense department a figure that 
does not include department of energy spending on nuclear warheads 
congress is expected to take a careful look at strategy and the cost 
of resources in light of the budget deficit situation 
in his final budget reagan requested 3152 billion in budget 
authority a 2 percent increase after inflation for defense in 
fiscal 1990 the 12 months opening oct 1 
i think theyre whistling dixie if they think theyll get a 2 
to 3 percent increase in spending said rep sonny montgomery 
dmiss a member of the house armed services committee theyll 
be fortunate if they get the inflation factor 
bush according to testimony last week from office of management 
and budget nominee richard darman is expected to reduce reagans 
request by an unspecified amount congress will likely wait for 
bushs changes before acting on the budget 
during last years presidential campaign nunn and sen john 
warner of virginia the ranking republican on the armed services 
committee sent a letter to bush and michael dukakis the democratic 
nominee stressing the importance of qualified people 
strong defense leadership will be needed during the next four 
years to resolve serious strategy budget force structure 
manpower alliance and arms control problems and issues nunn and 
warner said in the letter dated oct 28 1988 
central to meeting those challenges is the appointment of the 
highest quality and experienced defense management team they 
wrote 
also during this congressional session hearings will be held on 
the plan to close 86 military bases and partly close five more a 
recommendation by a special federal commission that has since been 
accepted by reagans defense secretary frank carlucci 
despite some opposition the chances of congress passing a 
resolution of disapproval against the plan or overriding a 
presidential veto remain slim say congressional aides who believe 
the battle over the bases will be fought in appropriating the funds 
to close the facilities 
debate will also resume over spending for star wars research and 
development moving the new b2 stealth bomber into production and 
funding for the truckmobile singlewarhead midgetman missile and 
the railmobile version of the mx intercontinental ballistic missile

immigration authorities on tuesday detained four 
members of the new yorkbased guardian angels including founder 
curtis sliwa for seven hours on their arrival at londons gatwick 
airport 
the organization plans to train more than 20 volunteers to 
counter crime on the underground londons subway system in the way 
it does on the new york city subway 
the home office said the four men would be allowed to stay in 
britain for six months provided they kept within the law 
sliwa said he did not object to being interrogated 
im not bitter he told reporters i would hope they would 
put many other people through the screening procedure drug 
dealers criminal types 
there is plenty of interest locally in the angels he said 
were here to complete a mission 
a home office spokesman requesting anonymity said the 
authorities wanted to establish that the men met the requirements 
of the immigration rules and we are now so satisfied 
foreign visitors need to satisfy immigration officers that they 
do not intend to overstay their visit can maintain themselves 
financially without taking a job and can afford a journey home 
home secretary douglas hurd who is responsible for police and 
immigration affairs and londons police chief sir peter imbert 
made it clear they regarded the angels as unnecessary 
we have police and special constables unpaid volunteers and 
we have neighborhood watch schemes which are admirable he said 
referring to loosely organized groups of residents who report 
anything suspicious 
we have all kinds of ways in which the active citizen can help 
the police to prevent crime and detect crime let us build on those 
rather than go in for adventurous departures hurd said 
imbert said the angels had nothing to teach britain about 
fighting crime 
i must say that the first question i did ask myself and 
perhaps its an unfair question is that when one sees the state of 
crime where they are coming from and then the state of crime here i 
ask what it is they can teach us here imbert said 
during a visit to britain in september sliwa was stabbed in the 
face in a dispute in a london club with four men who said they did 
not want vigilantes interfering with their criminal activities 
dave edmonds the angels london coordinator said he hoped to 
begin patrols on crimeplagued sections of the subway in march 
last month muggers killed a turkish student who resisted them on 
the london subway and a british man had to have a kidney removed 
after being knifed in the back on a subway train several women 
recently have been raped on subway trains and in outlying stations 
in the first eight months of 1988 there were 914 reported 
robberies on the subway up by 83 percent on the same period of 
1987 and assaults on passengers rose 28 percent to 512 
the 248station subway network carries almost 700 million 
passengers a year

the first of 250 heroin addicts expected to 
participate in bostons mobile drug treatment program stepped aboard 
a 32foot van tuesday to receive their first doses of methadone 
three city employees boarded the unmarked recreational vehicle at 
dawn and set out for a state hospital in the citys jamaica plain 
section the first of two stops 
what the van will do is allow necessary treatment to be 
delivered so addicts will have a greater access to the programs 
said sarah gant a city health policy analyst she said the new 
service would make it easier for heroin addicts to get treatment on 
their way to work or school 
candidates are screened and tested before being admitted to the 
statefunded treatment one of only two such programs nationwide 
said tom scott the addiction services acting administrative 
director 
the nations first mobile methadone program got under way in 
brockton last month after gaining federal approval it also has been 
serving taunton and plymouth 
methadone a synthetic opiate that satisfies the bodys craving 
but does not produce a heroin high is dispensed to addicts in 
medically controlled liquid doses 
city health officials decided to use a van after gov michael 
dukakis said he wouldnt approve a bill allowing them to distribute 
sterile hypodermic needles to drug addicts as a way to stop the 
spread of aids intravenous drug use specifically the sharing of 
dirty needles is one way the deadly virus is transmitted 
the city is leasing the van for 700 a month paid for out of 
400000 the state allocated to boston to expand its methadone 
programs 
medical monitoring and psychological and vocational counseling 
are also part of the program scott said 
ms gant said all participants would be stabilized by officials 
at boston city hospital before being admitted to the program and 
that those patronizing the van will be subjected to random urine 
tests to ensure they are not using illegal drugs 
about 250 people currently receive methadone from a city program 
set up in a trailer outside boston city hospital eventually the 
van is expected to assist an additional 110 people scott said

the economic gap between blacks and whites 
widened during the reagan years the national urban league said 
tuesday while finding encouraging signs that president bush may take 
steps to improve conditions for black america 
i expect the bush white house to be a very different place from 
the reagan white house john e jacob the president of the 
national urban league said 
i am hopeful that he will implement policies that close the 
tragic gap that puts african americans on a separate and unequal 
track from white americans he said 
the urban league releasing its annual assessment of the status 
and conditions of blacks in america cited statistics that it said 
show that racial inequality is growing and that blacks face 
increasing misery from poverty crime and drugs 
jacob said blacks were the only major ethnic group whose 
unemployment rate rose during the 1980s he said housing segregation 
increased and black life expectancy at birth began to decline 
blacks did not share the prosperity and got more than their 
share of the misery during the 1980s jacob said at a news 
conference at which he released the study 
the report the state of black america 1989 is the 14th 
annual assessment of black america by the league a 78yearold 
organization that conducts research and is an advocate for 
minorities 
in a summary of economic conditions david h swinton dean of 
the business school at jackson state university in mississippi 
wrote that no progress was made during the reagan administration to 
reduce economic disparities faced by blacks 
in fact racial inequality in american life actually increased 
by many of the standard indicators he wrote 
jacob said that some blacks benefited from the economic growth 
during the reagan administration but he said that was confined to 
those who were the most educated and best trained 
he said bushs cabinet appointments have been wise and there 
are people at key departments with whom we can work he called on 
bush to adopt as a goal achieving economic parity between whites and 
blacks by the year 2000 
the report contains a grim assessment of the outlook for black 
children in america marian wright edelman wrote that compared with 
1980 black children are more likely to be born into poverty lack 
early prenatal care have a single mother have an unemployed parent 
and not go to college 
a black baby is three times as likely as a white baby to be born 
to a mother who has had no prenatal care and is more than twice as 
likely to die during the first year she said a black male teenager 
is six times as likely as a white male teenager to be the victim of 
a homicide she said 
millions of black children today live in a desolate world where 
physical survival is a triumph where fear and hopelessness reign 
and where the future holds no promises and few opportunities said 
edelman president of the childrens defense fund 
in another section the report said the number of blacks enrolled 
in fouryear colleges has declined since 1980 while other minority 
groups have shown increases 
the report said per capita income for blacks slipped when 
compared to per capita income for whites the percentage of blacks 
with household incomes below the poverty level grew and 45 percent 
of black children younger than 18 live in poverty it said 
the new administration will face the harsh reality that racial 
inequality persists and is not attenuating swinton wrote 
new policies must be put in place by the new administration if 
progress towards racial parity in economic life is to resume and to 
be maintained 
the report said that black families have been 
disproportionately devastated by the declining stock of 
affordable housing and that blacks are overrepresented by the 
thousands of families and children living in welfare hotels and 
shelters for the homeless

treasury secretary nicholas f brady suggested 
on tuesday that unless the investment community stems the tide of 
debtfinanced corporate takeovers the government will step in 
it is the finest tradition of our democratic system that 
government look first to the people themselves for solutions and 
only act but do act when it is clear the people cannot solve the 
problem themselves he said 
brady told the senate finance committee the new bush 
administration favors eliminating or reducing taxes on corporate 
dividends as a way to reduce leveraged buyouts or lbos 
he acknowledged that the federal budget deficit likely precludes 
that 
however his testimony was the clearest indication yet that the 
new administration views the multibilliondollar debtfinanced 
takeovers as a possible threat to the us economy and is willing to 
take action to stem them 
i have a feeling that we are headed in the wrong direction when 
so much of our young talent and the nations financial resources are 
aimed at financial engineering while the rest of the world is laying 
the foundation for the future he said 
brady said he would prefer that the gladiators in the arena 
the investment bankers corporate and insurance executives and 
pension fund managers who issue and trade in highinterest 
highrisk junk bonds come up with evidence that the resulting debt 
burdens are not harmful or else that they suggest proposals for 
addressing them 
while companies acquired through leveraged buyouts often lack the 
cash flows to pay interest on the junk bonds that financed the 
deals the bankers underwiters and fund managers in the 
transactions make millions of dollars in fees brady complained 
sadly these same parties may have relatively little if any 
investment in the longterm success of the new enterprise he 
said given this arrangement it may very well be that the net 
effect of lbos is a snipe hunt where the new longterm investors 
flashight in hand are left holding the bag 
quite a different view was expressed earlier tuesday by 
securities and exchange commission chairman david ruder who is 
scheduled to testify wednesday before the senate panel 
ruder said on cbs this morning that the leveraged buyouts are 
increasing ownership of companies by the managers who run them and 
will make us a more productive economy 
after these buyouts the managers of the divisions typically 
will be allowed to run the divisions without having to be overseen 
by top management of the large conglomerate and they may be very 
much more efficient in their management when theyre on their own 
ruder said 
president bush two weeks ago before he took office ruled out 
direct government action to curtail the tide of takeovers but left 
open the possibility of changing the way the tax laws treat 
dividends and the deductibility of interest payments on junk bonds 
there are things you can do in the tax laws he said if 
there are abuses of our tax laws the whole tax law will be 
reviewed to see how they can be eliminated 
brady said any package of tax law changes seeking to discourage 
debt financing of takeovers or of defenses against them by 
limiting the deductibility of interest on junk bonds should be 
coupled with some tax relief on company dividends 
taxing the interest that companies pay on junk bonds alone he 
said would simply increase the cost of capital for american 
acquirers by effectively raising their interest rates on an 
aftertax basis 
since that would not affect the borrowing costs of foreign 
corporations he said us companies would be at a competitive 
disadvantage moreover he said junk bond issuers would likely find 
new mechanisms to avoid taxes on the interest they pay 
the long history of attempts to define problems out of 
existence has proved that the definees are more adept than the 
definers brady said just as new regulations are written 
efforts are under way to render them irrelevant 
fears about the vulnerability of highly leveraged companies were 
heightened last september when revco ds inc the clevelandbased 
drug store chain entered chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings after 
defaulting on 700 million in bonds following a 14 billion buyout 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the finance committees chairman 
said the revco buyout raises concerns about what would happen to 
other companies in the event of an economic downturn 
no one can predict what will happen or when bentsen said 
but we know what did happen even in good times after one lbo 
transaction 
i think theres an appetite here to do something rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting ways and means 
panel told reporters last weekyou get their attention when you 
tickle the tax code

white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said today it can be assumed that health and human services 
secretarydesignate louis sullivan would implement president bushs 
abortion policies if confirmed by the senate 
dr sullivan has repeatedly said that his views are 
consistent with the presidents fitzwater said 
the spokesman was asked to comment on a published report which 
said sullivan had been privately saying he does not want to see a 
reversal of the supreme court decision legalizing abortion bush 
wants it reversed 
sullivan opposes public funding for abortions but he does not 
want to overturn a womans right to make a choice an unidentified 
senior republican lawmaker told the new york times 
sullivan nearly lost his cabinet nomination last month when he 
told an interviewer he personally favored a womans right to an 
abortion he later issued a statement that echoed bushs opposition 
to abortion except in cases of rape incest or if the pregnancy 
endangers the mothers life 
during his white house briefing today fitzwater said sullivan 
never had indicated to bush any disagreement with bushs position on 
the abortion question 
dr sullivan is committed to the presidents positions the 
spokesman said it can be assumed that he will implement 
administration policy and the presidents views 
if dr sullivan has other recommendations and views well be 
glad to listen to them the spokesman said but the presidents 
position on this matter is the one that will guide our decisions in 
the administration 
in connection with demonstrations marking the 16th anniversary of 
the roe vs wade decision police on monday arrested 153 people 
that came in one of the operation rescue protests outside a 
clinic in the city 
the march for life event attracted some 67000 people it 
received a boost from bush who told the antiabortionists by way of 
a telephone loudspeaker in a park near the white house that the 
decision was wrong and should be overturned 
vice president dan quayle met with nellie gray the leader of the 
march for life and other antiabortion leaders i couldnt think 
of a more appropriate group to be meeting with he said 
district of columbia police made the arrests outside the 
hillcrest womens center in northwest washington and charged them 
with blocking access to the building or crossing police lines said 
police spokesman sgt joe gentile 
police said doors at the clinic were locked for about two and a 
half hours because of the protest 
in glen burnie md the gynecare center closed after about 300 
demonstrators gathered at the clinic entrance and refused to move 
but no arrests were made said sgt joe bisesi of the anne arundel 
county police 
well stay as long as we have to said demonstrator kathy 
kelly before the closing we hope to keep this place safe for the 
day which means no killing of babies and no exploitation of women 
both protests were organized by a group in suburban gaithersburg 
md known as rachels rescue which is part of a national effort 
by abortion foes to use tactics of the 1960s civil rights movement 
to stop women from having abortions

the pentagon has improved its ability to fly 
troops and gear to europe in the event of war but still lacks 
transport ships the head of the new military transportation command 
said tuesday 
we are much better off now in terms of management and equipment 
than we were before a disastrous transport exercise in 1978 said 
air force gen duane h cassidy head of the us transportation 
command at scott air force base in illinois 
if warsaw pact troop reductions lead to the withdrawal of some 
us forces from europe those transporation needs may multiply he 
said meeting that requirement is among the problems facing john g 
tower president bushs nominee for secretary of defense 
senate armed services committee confirmation hearings on tower 
begin wednesday 
officials say the united states keeps about 320000 troops in 
europe and the plans of the north atlantic treaty organization call 
for a massive movement of forces in wartime if nato conventional 
forces are unable to halt a sovietled advance across europe nato 
would resort to nuclear weapons officials say 
cassidy told reporters tuesday that since the 1978 exercise 
called nifty nugget the military has modernized its fleet of c5 
and c141 cargo airplanes and is adding a new c17 cargo plane 
additionally the military and most us civilian carriers and 
charter commercial aircraft have agreed to transport troops to 
maneuvers in europe the middle east and asia he said 
the pentagon also has placed supplies in areas where they might 
be needed in wartime 
in 1987 under pressure from congress the pentagon created the 
command placing air force navy and army transporation units under 
cassidy 
in an exercise scheduled later this year he said the pentagon 
plans to demonstrate it can handle 46 million to 48 million ton 
miles per day the unit used to measure transporation capacity by 
1998 he expects capacity to rise to 66 million ton miles a day 
to meet its goals the command should be able to move between 75 
million and 125 million ton miles per day he said 
if we had 125 million ton miles i could make the military 
commanders in chief around the world some guarantees that i cant 
make them today cassidy told reporters 
a weaknesses in us military transport is the american merchant 
marine which has shrunk over the years 
us owned and operated cargo ships carry only 4 percent of 
americas martime commerce said cassidy 
our industry is not playing on a level field he said 
arguing that other governments are building subsidizing and 
operating merchant marines that are gaining an increasing share of 
the world shipping trade 
cassidy called on congress the administration and private 
industry to work to raise the volume of shipping carried on american 
vessels to 9 percent if that is done he said ill have enough 
ships to do the job

to the theatermuseum where dalis tomb has been dug in the floor

the last of an outstanding generation of spanish painters that 
included pablo picasso and joan miro 
he returned to his native region in 1948 after living in madrid 
paris and several us cities 
in later years he was known as much for his outrageous 
personality and theatrical interviews as for his paintings 
dali sank into seclusion and depression when his wife manager 
and longtime muse gala died in 1982 
he had a history of heart problems and had been confined to a 
wheelchair and fed through gastronasal tubes since he was badly 
burned in a 1984 fire

the united states is invoking a 1914 treaty in 
an effort to resolve a dispute with chile over the 1976 carbomb 
death of a former top aide to president salvador allende the state 
department said tuesday 
us officials have long maintained that three chilean secret 
police agents were responsible for the washington incident which 
claimed the lives of former chilean foreign minister orlando 
letelier and an american associate ronni moffitt 
the chilean government however has refused us requests for 
the extradition of the three and the issue has been a point of 
contention between the two governments for years 
letelier an outspoken critic of the government of president 
augusto pinochet also served as chiles ambassador to washington 
under allende and as defense minister 
he and ms moffitt were killed when a bomb placed under the car 
in which they were riding exploded in the embassy row section of 
washington on sept 21 1976 
state department spokesman charles redman said us officials 
presented chile with a diplomatic note on jan 12 invoking the world 
war i era treaty which is designed to help end disputes that cannot 
be resolved by diplomatic methods 
he said the united states is asking that an international 
commission established under the treaty investigate and report on 
the facts surrounding the incident including the involvement of 
chilean government officials and to investigate and report upon 
subsequent investigations by the government of chile into the 
matter 
we believe that this treaty process provides an excellent and 
neutral means for pursuing justice in the case and resolving the 
differences between the us and chile that relate to the case 
redman said 
the us government will therefore render all possible 
assistance to the commission in carrying out its responsibilities 
and we expect and trust that the government of chile will do the 
same 
asked whether he expected that chile will go along with the us 
approach redman said chile is obliged to do so under the treaty 
the president of the fivemember panel is madame suzanne bastid 
of france two other members picked by the united states are 
william mulligan of new york and sir john freeland of great britain 
the other members selected by chile are edmundo vargas of chile 
and judge manfred lochs of poland 
in 1978 the united states requested the extradition from chile 
of michael townley a us citizen and an employee of the chilean 
intelligence service he had been implicated in the murders 
chile complied and townley was convicted and sentenced in a us 
court

the united states on tuesday criticized soviet 
bombing raids inside afghanistan accusing the soviets of a clear 
violation of understandings reached on its troop pullout 
this pattern of daily bombardment is unacceptable said state 
department spokesman charles redman this is a clear violation of 
soviet assurances to us not to engage in offensive operations during 
the withdrawal 
speaking only three weeks prior to the midfebruary deadline for 
the soviet troop pullout redman said the us government still 
expects the soviet union to be out by february 15th 
redman noted that while the afghan rebels known as the 
mujahedeen have been exercising restraint in permitting an 
unhampered soviet withdrawal the soviets have not 
we believe that similar restraint would be appropriate on the 
part of the soviet union redman said 
while the guerrillas have halted attacks against the departing 
soviets they have directed their pressure against the sovietbacked 
marxist government of president najib 
the spokesman described the soviet raids as a practice of heavy 
bombardment of afghanistan on a daily basis in addition to 
bombing runs conducted from bases in afghanistan numerous 
sorties are being conducted each day from bases inside the soviet 
union redman said 
the targeted areas appear to include cities where no soviet 
forces are present the spokesman said 
redman who has voiced similar criticism over the past several 
months called the attacks very heavy bombardment aimed at the 
afghan people in the form of the mujahedeen it just is counter 
to what the soviets have assured us that they would do 
the united states is a guarantor of the unmediated agreement 
signed last april under which the soviet union is to remove all of 
its military forces by feb 15 
the moslem guerrillas now backed by pakistan and the united 
states began fighting after a procommunist coup in april 1978 
the soviets entered the neighboring nation in december 1979 to 
help the government battle the anticommunist rebels its troops 
were estimated to number 115000 when the withdrawal began may 15 
on sunday soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze ended a 
threeday visit to afghanistan after pledging arms supplies to 
najibs government when the remaining soviet soldiers depart 
shevardnadze said the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled and 
that he believed najibs government will cope with the insurgents on 
its own

japans economic planning agency chief resigned 
tuesday becoming the third cabinet minister in less than two months 
to fall victim to a major stocktrading scandal 
ken harada stepped down after news reports said he had received 
regular political donations from recruit co the company at the 
center of the stock scandal 
haradas resignation was a serious blow to prime minister noboru 
takeshita who had reshuffled his cabinet on dec 27 with a pledge 
to restore public trust in political ethics 
the japan socialist party the largest opposition group quickly 
called for takeshita and the rest of the cabinet to resign 
opposition criticism of the administration also was expected to 
delay parliamentary debate in coming weeks over the fiscal 1989 
budget 
harada 69 had chaired a special parliamentary committee 
examining the stocktrading scandal until he was made the countrys 
chief economic planner in the cabinet reshuffle 
harada submitted his resignation shortly after the cabinet met to 
approve the budget takeshita named koichiro aino 60 a sixterm 
member of parliament and former vice foreign minister to succeed 
him 
harada is the second member of the new cabinet to resign because 
of links to the stock scandal a member of the previous cabinet 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa also stepped down in early 
december 
the nationally circulated newspaper asahi shimbun reported 
tuesday that harada had received about 80 a month from recruit for 
14 years it said a recruit subsidiary also had donated about 8000 
to a harada fundraising party in august 
in a televised news conference following his resignation harada 
acknowledged the donations but denied any wrongdoing and said the 
company had absolutely not asked for any favors in return 
the recruit scandal has rocked japanese politics in the past half 
year with at least 16 top politicians acknowledging that they or 
their aides benefited after being offered cheaply priced unlisted 
shares in a recruit subsidiary that rocketed in value soon after 
public trading began 
the shares reportedly were offered to more than 100 prominent 
people including politicians businessmen and media officials 
neither the donations nor the stock transactions were illegal in 
themselves but questions of possible bribery ethics and political 
fundraising practices have been raised 
only three days after takeshita formed his new cabinet in 
december justice minister takashi hasegawa stepped down after it 
was disclosed that he had received regular donations from recruit 
earlier in the month miyazawa resigned after having repeatedly 
changed his explanation of a close aides purchase of the unlisted 
shares 
hisashi shinto the chairman of japans largest company nippon 
telegraph and telephone also stepped down in december after it was 
disclosed that recruit stock profits had been deposited in his 
personal bank account 
haradas resignation was expected to put heavy pressure on 
several other cabinet members including takeshita himself who have 
links to recruit 
takeshita has acknowledged that an aide and a relative profited 
from the sale of the recruit subsidiarys shares news reports have 
said recruits former chairman also donated about 38000 to a 
takeshita political support group in 1987 and 1988 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi also reportedly received 
about 160 a month from recruit and agriculture minister tsutomu 
hata has acknowledged that recruit bought tickets for a fundraising 
party in 1986 at an undisclosed price 
obuchi who serves as chief government spokesman said the 
cabinet would launch a thorough investigation into ties between 
recruit and cabinet members 
in an editorial in its wednesday editions the asahi shimbun 
criticized takeshitas liberal democratic party for what the 
newspaper called its lack of enthusiasm for establishing a code of 
ethics for politicians and its lack of clear ideas about the proper 
handling of political funds 
it added the cabinet shuffle of late last year ought to have 
been aimed at restoring the nations trust in politics which was 
sorely wounded by the scandal thus the nation expected the prime 
minister to check thoroughly whether candidates for cabinet 
appointments had any relations with recruit 
as was the case with former justice minister hasegawa however 
we must say that the prime ministers character check was too 
casual the newspaper said 
of course we are not saying that all political donations by 
companies are wrong it added we merely urge that the kinds of 
funds propping up political activities be fully disclosed

thirtyfive house members wrote speaker jim 
wright on tuesday to demand a vote on a proposed 50 percent 
congressional pay raise out of respect for the american taxpayer 
the raise would become effective automatically feb 8 unless the 
house and senate defeated it in separate votes 
the letter written by rep robert c smith rnh was signed 
by 30 republicans and five democrats 
wright a democrat from texas has been noncommittal about a 
vote and his office had no immediate comment on the letter 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine has promised 
a vote on the pay plan 
the plan would give rankandfile lawmakers 135000 a year 
instead of 89500 allow the speaker to earn 175000 instead of 
115000 and pay 155000 to the president pro tempore of the 
senate and the house and senate majority and minority leaders of 
both each house all of whom now earn 99500 
the prospect of an increase in congressional salaries has 
prompted a broad range of comments but there is one theme that is 
constant the letter said the american people are firm in their 
conviction that regardless of the legislative form there must be a 
vote on this enormous pay raise 
the letter said that avoiding this issue is not the answer 
and added the vote should be scheduled out of respect for the 
american taxpayer 
former president reagan recommended in his budget message that 
congress top federal political appointees and judges receive 50 
percent pay raises 
a vote would most likely come on a resolution of disapproval 
which could be written to strike down only the congressional portion 
one scenario is that congress could defeat the pay raise and then 
pass legislation through normal procedures to set salaries at any 
amount 
signing the letter were 
democrats mike synar oklahoma gv sonny montgomery 
mississippi wj billy tauzin louisiana timothy j penny 
minnesota and peter a defazio oregon

the wives of three kidnapped american 
professors appealed to their moslem captors to release the men who 
on tuesday began their third year in captivity 
they also urged the administration of president bush to do all it 
could to obtain the release of their husbands seized jan 24 1987 
from the campus of the americanaffiliated beirut university 
college where they taught 
we appeal to you kidnappers again to release our loved 
ones said virginia rose steen wife of journalism professor alann 
steen of boston two years have passed since we saw our husbands 
abducted from this campus 
the women held a news conference on the campus to mark the second 
anniversary of the kidnappings 
jesse turner a mathematics professor from boise idaho and 
robert polhill a business professor from new york city were 
abducted with steen by unidentified gunmen posing as lebanese police 
mithileshwar singh an indian citizen and us resident who was a 
visiting professor of finance at the college also was seized that 
day but since has been freed 
fifteen foreigners including nine americans are held hostage in 
lebanon the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
mrs steen said the women had not yet made contact with the bush 
administration but hoped the new people with fresh ideas would 
do everything they possibly can to end this for all the hostages 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine believed made up 
of moslem extremists claimed responsibility for the kidnappings 
the group initially demanded that israel free 400 arab prisoners 
in return for the educators israel has refused to consider the 
demand and washington said it would not pressure the jewish state to 
change its position 
the kidnappers in a statement in september appeared to soften 
their demand by hinting they would consider freeing the men if the 
united states backed a palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
let us end this horror now and make a positive step out of it 
let them love breath and walk as you do mrs steen said 
polhills wife feryal said please release them and allow 
them to help you they will tell the world of your grievences and 
will help you continue achieve your aims 
badr turner said of her husband i wish he would return home 
soon along with his colleagues 
turners 19monthold daughter joanne who was born during his 
captivity sat in her mothers lap and waved to television cameras 
saying hello daddy 
mrs steen said there had been no word from the kidnapped 
professors since oct 3 when singh was released at the time the 
kidnappers released pictures showing the others saying goodbye to 
singh

us and soviet complaints about costs 
forced un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on tuesday to 
recommend that the united nations slash its peacekeeping force for 
namibia to 4650 troops 
it will be the first un attempt to guide a colony to 
independence and the world bodys biggest and most expensive 
peacekeeping mission since the 196064 belgian congo crisis 
perez de cuellar estimated it will cost 416 million to deploy 
the peacekeepers with about 800 election supervisors an 
undetermined number of civilian administrators and an augmented 
force of 500 police supervisors 
black african and nonaligned nations for weeks have argued for 
at least 7500 troops as indicated in a 1978 security council plan 
for the independence of southwest africa better known as namibia 
that would have cost 700 million un officials said 
but the soviet union and china abandoned their usual third world 
allies and agreed with the other permanent security council members 
the united states britain and france that costs should be cut 
each of the five permanent members has the power to veto any 
security council resolution so perez de cuellars report reflected 
their wishes his recommendations must go to the security council 
which is expected to approve 
he suggested the security council keep the upper limit of the 
peacekeeping contingent at 7500 but dispatch only 4650 remaining 
troops would be on standby in their home countries he said 
he authorized 500 police supervisors from un member nations to 
oversee the south africantrained namibian police who will remain 
in charge of law and order during the transition to independence 
more police supervisors were needed because the police force has 
nearly trebled in the past decade to a strength of 8300 the 
secretarygeneral said 
at 416 million for one year the namibian mission will be more 
expensive than the 375 million total cost of all other assessed 
peacekeeping operations in 1988 
the congo peacekeeping mission cost 400 million from 196064 at 
much higher dollar rates and involved 19828 soldiers at peak 
strength 
south africa has administered namibia since it captured the 
mineralrich colony from germany in world war namibias 
independence comes through usbrokered peace accords signed dec 
22 by angola cuba and south africa

rain helped conditions in parts of texas but dry soils continued 
to hurt winter grains in many areas the report said greenbug 
damage was apparent in many fields too 
snow cover was needed in most of the northern plains the 
report said snow cover was adequate in north dakota and portions 
of south dakota montanas winter wheat was mostly fair to good 
with only light wind damage

police on tuesday charged a man with 
brokering the sale of kidneys for use in transplants at an exclusive 
london hospital a public prosecutor said 
retired military officer tunc ay kunter has confessed to acting 
as a middleman for four such operations but insists he acted for 
humanitarian reasons according to the prosecutor sait erel 
the arrest follows one mans charges that one of his kidneys was 
removed without his knowledge or consent at londons private 
wellington humana hospital erel said 
turks have been angered by reports that turkish peasants were 
selling their kidneys to wealthy recipients at the london hospital 
turkish law allows donations of human organs but forbids their 
sale sellers and organizers convicted in a kidney transaction could 
be jailed for up to four years erel said 
national television broadcast the charges sunday that featured a 
couple who said they each sold a kidney through a middleman to 
recipients at a hospital 
one kidney was sold for the equivalent of 5600 and the other 
for 3200 the unidentified man and woman said on the program they 
did not identify the hospital or middleman 
erel said kunter 55 was picked up at his house monday night and 
was charged tuesday after investiagors found evidence indicating 
kunter made money out of kidney transactions kunter said he 
arranged them for humanitarian reasons and no money was involved 
it is not easy to believe that he has done them just for 
humanitarian reasons erel said of kunters defense he has been 
involved in a long process of taking them organ donors to clinics 
having their passports issued and taking them to london for 
nothing 
legal proceedings started after one man ahmet koc from 
dogubeyazit township in eastern turkey claimed in a jan 10 letter 
that kunter tricked him to go to the wellington humana hospital 
where one of his kidneys was removed without his consent 
according to erel koc claimed kunter took him to the hospital 
for what was described as a checkup linked to a job offer after the 
kidney was removed koc said he was paid 4637 by kunters brother 
in london ata nur 
erel said he could not start legal proceedings in other kidney 
sales allegedly involving kunter unless the donors applied to his 
office 
wellington humana hospital has said it has no evidence that turks 
were paid money to donate kidneys 
however it said it was reviewing its organ transplant procedures 
following the british governments announcement of an investigation 
into the case

manslaughter charges against the officer accused of 
killing a motorcyclist touching off last weeks racial violence 
will not calm the black community leaders and residents said 
tuesday 
meanwhile defenders of officer william lozano criticized the 
charges saying they were rushed without judicial review because of 
racial tensions 
lozano 29 was free on 10000 bond after turning himself in 
monday at the dade county jail to face two counts of manslaughter in 
the deaths of clement lloyd 23 and allan blanchard 24 
police said lozano shot lloyd in the head killing him and 
causing the motorcycle to crash into a car fatally injuring 
blanchard his passenger a parallel federal civil rights 
investigation into the killings was continuing tuesday us 
attorney dexter lehtinen said but had not reached any conclusions 
the state manslaughter charges did not sit well with many in 
overtown which erupted into three days of riots after the jan 16 
killing 
theyve only done that to keep the community quiet said 
lloyds father lee lloyd but i dont think they are going to keep 
the community quiet thats not enough 
michael wright who manages an overtown laundry said he was 
bitter about the charges and the bail 
as long as they shoot us they get manslaughter said wright 
if we shoot one of them its firstdegree murder or if we shoot 
a cuban or a white its firstdegree murder 
miamis lone black city commissioner miller dawkins did not 
criticize the charges against lozano but said they would not help 
to calm overtown 
i dont think its going to do anything until there is a trust 
a bonding in the community the commissioner said 
miami police spokesman ray lang said that although bitterness 
existed there was no violence in the city following lozanos arrest 
and release 
lozanos defenders however said that the charges were a 
political ploy and violated longestablished rules set up precisely 
to prevent police officers from being rushed to judgment because of 
community reaction 
there was no judicial review there was no review by a grand 
jury said lozanos attorney roy black they decided to just go 
ahead and arrest him and force him to post bail without any review 
of the charges 
dick kinne head of the 1000member fraternal order of police 
said he was surprised by the speed of the investigation 
i got a perception that this came a little faster than normal 
because of the communitys actions over the past week kinne said 
his organization planned to meet and decide if it will provide 
financial support for the 29yearold officers support 
dade county state attorney janet reno defended the manslaughter 
counts and the investigation an internal rule in renos office 
calls for cases involving charges against police officers be brought 
before an inquest if questions persist 
if there is a question mark we take it to an inquest in this 
instance investigators from both the miami police department and 
state attorneys office thought the charges should be filed and 
manslaughter was the appropriate charge she said 
she also said her office could not determine the killing was 
premeditated as she would have to do in firstdegree murder nor 
could prosecutors show lozano had committed an act evincing a 
depraved mind as seconddegree murder charges would require 
some black leaders endorsed the charges saying ms reno had done 
all she could under the law 
it is not as glamorous as charges of some degree of murder but 
the fact is the penalties are similar enough said george knox a 
former city attorney 
maximum penalty for manslaughter with a firearm is 30 years in 
prison seconddegree murder can bring a life sentence

legislation to penalize nations that use 
chemical weapons and private companies that help produce them will 
be introduced this week republican and democratic senators said 
tuesday 
the proposed action was announced at a hearing in which senators 
cited reports that the west german government had looked the other 
way while german industries helped middle east nations obtain 
chemical warfare capability a us official said west germany is 
now addressing the situation 
senators also were told that the soviet union is stockpiling 
biological weapons in violation of a 1972 agreement banning them 
worldwide 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said he will soon introduce a bill to require 
us diplomatic and economic sanctions against any nation using 
chemical or biological weapons he said the legislation will ask 
other nations to do likewise 
sen jesse helms rnc said he will sponsor companion 
legislation to invoke sanctions against companies of any nationality 
which supply chemical warfare equipment and technology to third 
world nations 
i have every reason to believe that in the end the congress 
and the administration will see the wisdom of both approaches 
helms said 
helms and other members of the foreign relations committee 
complained about reports that west german officials ignored the 
situation while german chemical firms helped libya build a chemical 
plant that has been alleged to be capable of producing poison gas 
william f burns the retired army major general who heads the 
arms control and disarmament agency testified that about 20 nations 
have the capacity to produce chemical weapons he said about five or 
six are known to have used or stockpiled them 
responding to questions burns listed iran iraq libya syria 
and north korea as poison gas stockpilers he said iraq iran and 
libya are reported to have used chemical weapons 
burns also said the united states believes the soviet union is 
maintaining stocks of biological weapons in violation of the 1972 
international agreement outlawing the manufacture and possession of 
lethal biological agents 
we believe the soviet union does have a stock of biological 
weapons and obviously they must have some capacity to produce 
them burns said 
helms asked how in that case the soviets can be trusted to 
adhere to a new international agreement soon to be negotiated 
banning the manufacture stockpiling and use of poison gas and other 
chemical weapons 
burns replied that the 1972 agreement had no provisions for 
monitoring and verifying compliance while any new pact will have 
verification provisions 
he acknowleged however that verification will be difficult and 
that perfect monitoring probably cannot be achieved 
helms complained that west german companies were helping third 
world countries especially in the middle east obtain chemical 
weapons capability 
he also said a west german firm is helping libya obtain the 
ability to refuel warplanes in midflight extending their range and 
giving them the ability to strike israel 
the problem is extremely grim helms said with the 
critical assistance of western industrial firms the four most 
radical regimes in the world are acquiring weapons of mass 
destruction 
burns who said he had discussed the situation with officials of 
the west german embassy said the attitude of the bonn government 
has changed significantly 
i believe the west german government is addressing the 
problem burns said he predicted the west german government would 
erect a much stronger system of export controls

american flag he said his name was richard and that he worked in

reprisals at work 
nearby a man wearing a ronald reagan mask and a tshirt that

jackson said a lot of people want to have a good time to get it 
past them its been real heavy on a lot of people especially on 
communities in florida

sisters at florida state university 11 years ago sang a song titled 
on top of old sparky at 7 am they ignited sparklers and

police said tuesday there was some hope 
that former prime minister paul vanden boeynants abducted 10 days 
ago was still alive after a newspaper received his id card and a 
handwritten letter from him 
we now have some hope to find mr vanden boeynants and to find 
him alive said prosecutor andre rutten he addedd however that 
hope is still limited 
the socialist revolutionary brigade sent vanden boeynants 
identity card and a letter investigators said was handwritten by him 
to the brussels daily le soir as proof it was holding the 
69yearold christian democrat the group said in an accompanying 
note that he is still alive 
investigators spent most of tuesday analyzing the documents 
vanden boeynants disappeared jan 14 after he parked his car near 
his home in a plush brussels neighborhood his hearing aid pipe and 
a shoe were found nearby and the brigade claimed responsibility 
hours later 
the group said tuesday he will appear free before the people 
if its demand for the equivalent of about 790000 in ransom were 
met 
the brigade has said vanden boeynants business and political 
associates must pay the ransom with twothirds of the money going 
to the poor and the rest to the group 
rutten said he did not know whether vanden boeynants family 
wanted to negotiate with the abductors but that investigators would 
not interfere we are living in a free country he said 
last week a man claiming to belong to the brigade called the 
investigators crisis center and said vanden boeynants would be 
returned in little pieces 
the brigade has said it would put vanden boeynants before a 
peoples tribunal for what it called corruption and demagoguery 
he is alive and will confess said tuesdays note from the group 
the handwritten letter said he would make a statement to the 
press shortly after my release saying i had to take the initiative 
to give a large amount of aid to relief groups for the poorest 
regardless of their politics language or religious beliefs 
most of the letter was illegible and one page was missing rutten 
said 
vanden boeynants political career spanned 40 years and included 
two terms as prime minister from 196668 and from late 1978 until 
early 1979 he also served as defense minister for seven years in 
the 1970s 
but he was disgraced by a tax fraud conviction in 1986 the 
charges stemmed from his work as head of a meatpacking business 
vanden boeynants received a threeyear suspended sentence and was 
fined the equivalent of 16850 
he campaigned for the job of brussels mayor last year but 
withdrew after prime minister wilfried martens told vanden boeynants 
his tax fraud conviction had tainted him too much

in the end ted bundys lowkey remorseful 
departure tuesday was as puzzling as the sharp contradiction of his 
outgoing personality and his murderous troubled depths 
after he was executed in floridas electric chair bundys 
steelblue eyes stared straight ahead with scores of questions 
remaining unanswered about his motives and unsolved cases even 
after his lastminute confessions to 20 murders 
bundy a 42yearold law school dropout had defied the state of 
florida for 11 years exuding wit and charm as he maneuvered his way 
through the legal system 
but when the state finally cornered him in the death chamber for 
the murder of 12yearold kimberly leach a frightened bundy went to 
his death quietly 
bundy paused when he entered the freshly painted gray death 
chamber soon after 7 am est and appeared startled his eyes 
betraying fear 
his head and right leg were shaved for the electrodes and each 
wrist was manacled to a guard he walked over and was seated in the 
massive oaken electric chair built by inmates in 1923 
while thick leather straps were tightened around his legs arms 
waist and chest by four prison officials bundy looked around the 
room and mouthed some words to attorney james coleman and the rev 
fred lawrence a methodist minister from gainesville 
lawrence had spent the night outside bundys cell part of the 
time they spent in prayer said bob macmaster prison spokesman 
coleman and lawrence were seated on the front row separated only 
by a window from bundy about three feet away 
fortytwo people witnessed the execution they included 12 
official witnesses among them a state representative and three 
state attorneys 12 reporters and 18 others mostly corrections 
officials 
when florida state prison superintendent tom barton asked bundy 
if he had anything to say the inmates voice broke slightly as he 
spoke looking at coleman and lawrence 
jim and fred id like you to give my love to my family and 
friends he said 
bundys eyes widened when the chin strap was tightened he closed 
his eyes tightly for several seconds then opened them looking 
straight ahead 
a black leather hood was lowered in front of his face and prison 
officials attached a metal electrode to the top of bundys shaved 
head 
barton walked to a telephone on the back wall of the death 
chamber and spoke briefly with gov bob martinez in tallahassee 
then he walked a couple of steps toward the blackhooded 
executioner partially visible through a slit behind a partition 
and nodded 
the executioner an anonymous individual paid 150 in cash 
pressed a button at 706 am sending 2000 volts at 14 amps surging 
through bundys body 
bundy pressed backwards into the chair unlike the violent 
jerking motion of inmates in many executions his fists clenched 
the power was on for about a minute half the time normally 
allowed to execute an inmate 
a paramedic checked bundys pulse at his wrist for four minutes 
before unbuckling the strap and unbuttoning the inmates shirt to 
listen to the final beats of bundys heart 
dr frank kilgo chief physician at florida state prison lifted 
the mask from bundys face and shined a light into the cool eyes 
that were staring straight ahead 
hes dead he said at 716 am 
prison lt don davis told reporters and the official witnesses 
the sentence of the state of florida vs theodore bundy has been 
carried out 
when a white hearse carrying bundys body left the prison death 
penalty supporters cheered and quickly dispersed

a mother faces a murder charge in the 
malnutrition death of her 2yearold blind deaf and retarded child 
who was found dead on the same day a judge had put her in the 
custody of the state 
bessie m clayton 23 of oxford was charged monday in the death 
last week of anginetta clayton she turned herself in monday and was 
being held at the lafayette county jail in lieu of 50000 bond 
her lawyer james minor of oxford said clayton would fight the 
charge but declined to discuss the case 
officials said the girl weighed less than 10 pounds the average 
weight for a 30monthold girl is 30 pounds according to medical 
officials 
alvin chambliss an oxford attorney who appeared at ms claytons 
bond hearing monday contended the claytons were an impoverished 
family cut off from public medical housing and food assistance 
there are a lot of people to blame chambliss said the 
system broke down to blame the mother is a travesty 
linda clayton the womans sister said the child had been sick 
since birth had trouble eating and was unable to keep food down 
she said the child had been fed on jan 17 the day she died but 
didnt have proper medication 
the girl lived with 13 other people in a mobile home owned by 
linda clayton 
youth court referee william t sloan had given custody of bessie 
claytons five children to the state department of public welfare on 
jan 17 and left physical custody with the mother said lafayette 
county attorney ed roberts 
in most cases legal custody means the children remain at home and 
welfare officers monitor their condition 
during the custody hearing linda clayton came to the justice

the prospect that a washington attorney who 
played a prominent role in jesse jacksons campaign will be the next 
democratic party chairman drew talk of secession tuesday from an 
alabama party leader 
john baker said the election of ronald brown as national party 
chairman would not be a sign the democratic party is getting 
better 
a supporter of former rep jim jones of oklahoma for the party 
chairmanship baker said browns election would be a victory for the 
liberal wing of the party 
you cant secede from the national party though frankly i 
would he said wed maintain our official formal affiliation in 
name only 
im not sure thats what we need right now said james 
ruvolo the ohio democratic party chairman and a supporter of 
michigan chairman richard wiener for the national post 
ron brown will bring the party together said his campaign 
manager carl wagner his bottom line is to enlarge the party to 
build national and regional majorities to elect and reelect 
democrats at every level 
mr bakers remarks not only surprise me but they make me very 
sad said pat eddington a democratic national committee member 
from alabama 
mrs eddington said she is neutral in the contest for the 
chairmanship and added i have known ron brown for most of the 11 
years i have served on the national committee and i have found him 
always to be a team player who has paid his dues to the party he is 
also a very articulate and honorable person 
seeking the chairmanship along with brown jones and wiener was 
former rep james stanton of ohio former rep michael barnes of 
maryland dropped out of the race monday and endorsed brown 
wagner said ron has made it clear again and again that he will 
win with solid support across the country 
he said that brown already was receiving more support from 
southerners than paul g kirk jr got four years ago when he ran for 
party chairman 
kirk won the post despite nearly total opposition from southern 
party leaders who objected to his ties to sen edward m kennedy 
dmass 
but kirk succeeded in winning over the southerners who were in 
the forefront of an unsuccessful effort to convince him to serve a 
second fouryear term 
the other three candidates conceded that brown is the 
frontrunner in the contest that will be decided by a vote of the 
national committee at a meeting in washington on feb 10 
if elected brown would become the first black named chairman of 
either major national party 
brown was staff director of the senate judiciary committee under 
kennedys chairmanship he served as jacksons convention manager 
and was widely credited with playing a key role in helping close the 
convention with a show of unity between jackson who lost a bid for 
the presidential nomination and michael dukakis the nominee

texas is butting into a transatlantic dispute 
over hormonetreated beef by offering to provide the european 
economic community with chemicalfree beef from the lone star state 
however it was not clear tuesday whether the united states 
which retaliated against a number of eec products after the eec 
banned imports of us hormonetreated meat would allow texas to 
provide the beef 
the us department of agriculture apparently has adopted a wait 
and see attitude toward texas agriculture commissioner jim 
hightowers offer to find a supply of hormonefree beef in texas and 
develop a certification procedure that would satisfy the eec of the 
meats purity 
but lester crawford administrator of usdas food safety and 
inspection service said there could be a catch for texas the state 
cant legally label meat for export as hormonefree because a meat 
label must be truthful and verifiable yet he said he knows of no 
test to verify whether cattle were fed growth hormones 
all beef and poultry must be federally inspected to go overseas 
he said 
tom kay administrator of the usdas foreign agricultural 
service said hes not sure whether the federal government could 
stop the eec from making a deal with texas 
its a matter of texas being able to get the certification the 
european community wants versus whatever certification the us can 
give kay said 
ella krucoff spokeswoman for sir roy denman head of eec 
delegation in washington said she knew of no federal law that would 
bar the shipments 
texas solicited us and we are responding she saidwere 
trying to respond favorably to maintain the trade we havent got a 
legal opinion thats up to the us authorities 
texas got little support from the american farm bureau 
federation the federation contended the proposal weakens the us 
position in dealing with the entire issue of trade restraints with 
europe said paul drazek an international trade specialist for the 
countrys largest farm group 
europe contends the hormones used to fatten growing cattle are 
a health threat which the united states disputes after europe 
banned the beef imports affecting about 100 million in beef and 
beef byproducts the united states retaliated by setting about 100 
million worth of higher tariffs on a variety of products from the 
common market

mountain villagers in endless funeral 
processions tuesday buried their dead from the tadzhikistan 
earthquake that killed up to 1000 and rescuers slogged through 
muddy rubble in a desperate search for survivors 
new warnings were issued for more possible landslides caused by 
thawing snow in the central asian republic 1800 miles south of 
moscow that was hit by mondays predawn earthquake 
in northwestern armenia which was devastated by a dec 7 quake 
that killed 25000 people a powerful aftershock was reported 
tuesday an armenian official said the population had been warned 
and no casualties were reported 
rescuers reportedly found one survivor from the tadzhikistan 
quake although an official spokesman denied it 
a 40second tremor which us seismologists registered as 54 on 
the richter scale hit before dawn monday it loosened layers of mud 
that cascaded onto mountain villages in a rural area about 20 miles 
southwest of the republics capital of dushanbe 
workers using shovels and bulldozers continued digging for 
survivors tass said but a local official said the efforts might be 
in vain 
there is little hope because of the flood of dirt and mud 
erkin kasymov a spokesman for the foreign ministry of tadzhikistan 
said by telephone but while there is any hope the rescuers will 
keep digging 
in one village sharora more than 100 bodies have been hauled 
from the mud and wreckage tass said it said rescuers found only 
one survivor sergei muratov 27 
muratov reported to be in grave condition was rushed to a 
hospital where surgeons are fighting for his life tass said 
however vitaly zhukov of the republics official news agency and 
chief of a press information center set up in the wake of the 
tragedy told the associated press no survivors were found during 
excavations tuesday 
zainiddin nasreddinov editorinchief of the news agency 
estimated that about 600 people or about sharoras entire 
population had been killed in the village 
tass on monday estimated that 1000 people had been killed and 
official reports said more than 100 people were hospitalized in 
dushanbe 
the predominantly moslem villagers buried their dead and the 
funeral processions seem endless the tass news agency said 
zhukov said 11 people died overnight in hospitals late tuesday 
amid reports that casualties might not be as high as initially 
reported he said the preliminary estimate remained at 1000 dead 
he added however that it was still too early to determine how 
many people had been buried in the slide 
sharora and three other villages located at the quakes epicenter 
okulibolo okulipoyen and khisor are now wreathed in the smoke 
of bonfires and field kitchens tass said 
zhukov said the republic will need about 400 prefabricated houses 
for survivors in the stricken villages he told the ap however 
that although several neighboring republics and rescue teams from 
armenia had offered assistance local authorities had not yet 
determined just what help would be needed 
tass said the soviet red cross sent a planeload of relief 
supplies to the region and that the armenian red cross announced it 
would send a rescue team to tadzhikistan the plane carried four 
tons of tents clothing blankets household goods and medical 
supplies the news agency said 
the television news program vremya said a special bank 
account had been set up in moscow to accept voluntary contributions 
to aid quake victims 
the communist party daily newspaper pravda blamed heavy snows 
followed by a thaw for saturating the babatag hills overlooking the 
villages of sharora okulibolo and okulipoyen and said much of 
the mud was carried to the villages by an earthen canal 
pravda said the soil in the canals walls was saturated with 
moisture and that when the quake hit it moved in a huge mass 
onto the villages 
there is a danger of new mudslides in similar places in the 
event of a new natural blow the communist party paper said 
ruben karagyosyan a spokesman for the official politburo 
commission created to direct the relief effort for the armenian 
earthquake said 10 aftershocks had been registered monday night and 
tuesday morning including one the same magnitude as tadzhikistans 
quake 
tass said the epicenter of the aftershock which occurred at 530 
am moscow time 930 pm est monday was northwest of kirovakan 
one of the armenian cities heavily damaged by the dec 7 quake 
our scientists had already warned the government and the 
population over television and through the press that aftershocks in 
the zone of the quake were predicted karagyosyan said in a 
telephone interview from yerevan armenias capital 
residents of the quake zone had been warned not to congregate in 
kindergartens schools and other buildings he said so there were 
no serious consequences he said no deaths or injuries had been 
reported 
powerful aftershocks were registered in armenia on dec 31 and 
jan 4 karagyosyan said

mayor teddy kollek announced tuesday he will run 
for a sixth term in increasingly tense jerusalem the arab and 
jewish city where he has championed unity for 23 years 
one day i hope arabs will also participate in elections 
kollek says this is a united city and will remain a united city 
with equal rights to arabs 
as part of his campaign platform for the feb 28 election kollek 
promises to continue providing equal services to jewish and arab 
parts of the city 
the 77yearold mayor has faced increasing urban tension in the 
past year as palestinian riots erupted in arab east jerusalem 
palestinians in east jerusalem generally have not run for the 
council and most do not exercise their right to vote the number 
voting this year is expected to drop even further because of the 
uprising against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip now in its 13th month 
jerusalem police have clamped curfews on arab neighborhoods on at 
least three separate occasions during the past year and there have 
been numerous rock and firebomb attacks on israelis 
police however have refrained from using live ammunition during 
protests and there has been only one arab death in east jerusalem 
compared with 367 in the west bank and gaza 
kollek on tuesday denied he initiated a recent proposal to move 
arab polling booths to west jerusalem in an attempt to attract 
moderate palestinians who wish to vote away from the eyes of 
militant neighbors who oppose participation the proposal has been 
scrapped 
the popular mayor is virtually guaranteed to win another 
fiveyear term in office but he faces an uphill battle to hold on 
to his narrow majority in the 31member city council where 
ultraorthodox and rightwing elements control almost half the seats

democratic senators joined a conservative 
republican tuesday in introducing a revised 25 billion childcare 
package aimed at satisfying president bush and the gop lawmakers who 
blocked an earlier version 
on behalf of americas children we senators have extended a 
political olive branch said sen christopher j dodd dconn 
chief sponsor of the measure he predicted the bill would serve as 
the basis for an eventual compromise that could win congressional 
passage and be signed by the new president 
sen orrin hatch rutah said we still have some differing 
views but we agree that it is time to address the growing concern 
of millions of american families over the lack of affordable 
quality child care 
i am not cosponsoring this bill because i think it is a 
perfect solution hatch said rather it signals the 
continuation of the discussions we began last fall 
he said differences remain over financing and establishing 
childcare standards 
the legislation is based on last years act for better child care 
services which was designed to help lowincome americans pay for 
child care to expand the supply of child care and to assure minimum 
standards of health safety and staff training at childcare centers 
following months of negotiations between hatch and democratic 
senators led by dodd the lawmakers added new provisions that would 
give states more of the money to improve the quality and 
availability of child care the amount of aid going directly to 
families decreases from 75 percent to 70 percent 
the revised bill also would make grandparents aunts and uncles 
eligible for reimbursement provide grants and loans to family 
daycare and nonprofit providers to establish and expand programs 
create a statebased revolving loan fund for new family providers 
and increase participation by state and local officials employers 
and religious groups on an advisory committee that will recommend 
minimum standards 
were willing to compromise because its in americas best 
interests said sen barbara mikulski dmd who described 
likened the lengthy negotiations to being in a bunker 
dodd who was bitterly disappointed last october when republicans 
held up the childcare legislation said negotiations since last 
years defeat had produced a remarkable degree of onsensus 
he also expressed optimism over the change at the white house 
calling the bush administrations attitudes on child care 180 
degrees different from the reagan administrations 
dodd said we have a new president who wants a kinder and 
gentler nation and is willing to invest the money to make it happen 
we have a new leadership in the senate which is committed to 
enacting a childcare bill this year and right here in the labor 
committee we have an opportunity for the kind of bipartisan 
cooperation which comes along rarely in a politicians career 
during the presidential campaign democrat michael dukakis backed 
the democratic bill while bush proposed tax credits for families 
which could be used either to pay for outside child care or to 
enable a mother to stay home instead of working 
dodd speaking at a news conference with hatch said he will back 
the utah republicans legislation for a tax credit but the democrat 
said such a plan was only part of the solution 
it would not help this nation with our real challenge in the 
child care arena to build a diverse system of childcare providers 
with predictable standards of health and safety dodd said

george bush interrupted his second full working 
day at the white house tuesday to take his first presidential jog 
running for 23 minutes on the grounds of a nearby army base 
it took a motorcade of 15 cars to get the president from the 
white house to fort mcnair a distance of about two miles at bushs 
request the motorcade did something presidential motorcades almost 
never do it stopped at red traffic lights along the way 
bruce zanca an aide to bush said the president was merely 
following a practice he established as vice president mr bushs 
preference as vice president was to stop at lights keep things as 
normal as possible zanca said 
as vice president bush jogged for 20 minutes every second or 
third day but he usually did so on the sprawling grounds of the 
vice presidential residence at the us naval observatory 
there is not nearly as much room at the white house compound 
the president ran in bright orange jogging pants and a gray 
longsleeved top with the temperature in the high 50s unusually 
balmy for january in washington bush was perspiring lightly as he 
finished his run 
when a reporter suggested he was taking it fairly slowly the 
president responded wouldnt know it from watching the speed of 
this thing it was an apparent reference to his limousine which 
was being driven slightly ahead of him as he neared the end of his 
jog

defense minister yitzhak rabin on tuesday was 
considering new measures to stop the palestinian uprising including 
blocking palestinians suspected of taking part in riots from 
entering israel 
israeli soldiers shot and killed a palestinian teenager in a 
predawn raid on a west bank village and at least 18 palestinians 
were shot in clashes with troops 
several israeli newspapers reported that a secret army report 
said the 13month rebellion in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip would go on all year and that the violence could 
intensify 
the assessment reportedly compiled by senior officers said the 
revolt could not be halted by military means because troops already 
were doing all they could without resorting to unacceptable levels 
of violence 
israel radio reported that rabin was considering a policy to 
block suspected rioters from entering israel but said he had not 
decided whether to adopt it 
work in israel is the main source of income for an estimated 
100000 people in the west bank and gaza strip 
rabins policies for ending the uprising came under renewed 
criticism tuesday in a letter two dailies printed from an 
unidentified reserve soldier who said service in the occupied lands 
was a nightmare 
im helpless against my feelings and wonder if thats what i 
was raised for by my parents survivors of the terrible holocaust 
said the letter 
last week soldiers complained to prime minister yitzhak shamir 
that they were forced to beat palestinians to keep order 
the united nations relief and works agency which oversees 
palestinian refugees issued a statement expressing concern over the 
continuing toll of casualties and the indefinite closure of all 
1200 west bank schools 
israel radio quoted rabin as saying the school closures ordered 
friday were helping reduce casualties because classrooms served as 
hotbeds for protests 
at least 18 palestinians were reported shot in clashes that 
erupted during a general strike called by the plobacked leadership 
of the uprising to protest the militarys policies in the occupied 
territories 
in the gaza strip arab hospital officials said 16 people were 
wounded in clashes despite an army curfew ordering 200000 
palestinians to stay home the wounded included a 12yearold boy 
said to be in serious condition with a bullet wound to the head 
in the west bank a teenager was reported shot in the head in a 
clash with soldier at refugee camp no 1 near nablus 
soldiers raiding the west bank village of habla were met by a 
squad of masked arabs and killed one of them in pursuit military 
officials said another palestinian was wounded and four managed to 
escape the officials said 
the army confirmed the habla incident and said one palestinian 
was wounded in the west bank officials said they were checking the 
other reports 
the family identified the dead youth as issam hashem elmarabi 
19 and said he had been shot several times in the head and chest 
the death raised to 368 the number of palestinians killed since 
the rebellion against israels 21year occupation began in december 
1987 fifteen israelis also have died 
in the west bank settlement of ginot shomron a firebomb was 
thrown at an israeli car but it exploded on the street and caused 
no damage israel radio reported 
shin bet security agents meanwhile arrested dozens of arabs 
suspected of belonging to the socalled palestinian popular army 
the military command said 
israel radio said the group was led by arafats mainstream plo 
faction fatah and supplied weapons for attacks on israeli soldiers 
and civilians 
the radio did not mention the type or quantity of weapons 
involved and an army spokesman said he was unable to provide 
details 
palestinians have maintained the army exists mainly on paper 
and has no guns several marches by youths calling themselves such 
an army have been held recently in west bank villages with some 
marchers carrying sticks axes and knives

president bush on tuesday asked the head of the 
office of government ethics to brief all senior administration 
officials on ethical and conflictofinterest standards required of 
them the white house said 
bush who has pledged to make government ethics a high priority 
in his administration accepted oge director frank nebekers offer 
of nov 9 that nebeker arrange for personal briefings of senior 
officials and white house staff members to let them know the 
guidelines on such matters as outside income white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
the idea of such briefings was one that bush proposed during his 
campaign 
bush who has charged his legal counsel boyden gray with 
coordinating the ethics policy has scheduled an activity on the 
ethics issue each day this week fitzwater acknowledged that 
tuesdays meeting wtih nebeker which lasted just 10 minutes was 
symbolic and intended to keep the spotlight on the ethics issue 
on wednesday bush was to officially name members of an advisory 
commission on ethics fitzwater said the advisory commission was to 
be created by executive order and chaired by griffin bell the 
former attorney general in the carter administration and malcolm 
wilkey a senior judge on the us court of appeals in washington 
white house officials have said 
on thursday the president will meet with senior executive 
employees to emphasize the ethics provisions of the law and their 
responsibilities and what he expects of them 
he made a similar speech on monday to white house appointees and 
to his cabinet saying he wanted to avoid even the appearance of 
impropriety 
on friday fitzwater said bush will talk to the inspectors 
general of the government departments to emphasize their role in the 
ethics area and stress how much importance he is placing on the 
matter 
the reagan administration was tarnished with allegations of a 
sleaze factor because of the many officials who were accused of 
wrongdoing and unethical conduct bush repeatedly has attempted to 
stress that he wants an administraiton that will avoid that kind of

four major veterans organizations saying 
service to veterans is at an alltime low called tuesday for 
substantial new spending for the department of veterans affairs 
in a detailed proposal the groups said the final reagan 
administration budget proposal of 286 billion for the department 
should be increased by 35 billion with half that amount going to 
the veterans medical system 
the independent budget proposal for veterans programs was 
released by the veterans of foreign wars the disabled american 
veterans the paralyzed veterans of america and the american 
veterans of world war ii korea and vietnam known as amvets 
they contend the budget for veterans programs for the current 
fiscal year is insufficient to continue operating veterans hospitals 
and other programs at current levels they said former president 
reagans budget proposal for fiscal 1990 falls even shorter and 
would force the elimination of va hospital and nursing beds a 
reduction in medical services and a loss of 5000 jobs 
by any standard service to veterans is at an alltime low 
the document said 
the bush administration has not yet issued its version of a 1990 
budget proposal 
the department formerly known as the veterans administration 
operates the nations largest system of hospitals and other medical 
facilities 
the document reflects frustration among advocates for veterans 
with overall federal budget constraints that have limited 
appropriations for the va and brought reductions in va medical 
services 
the veterans groups have directed much of their criticism at the 
white houses office of management and budget and the new 
independent budget proposal continues that in a prologue the 
groups said their document connotes a final loss of confidence in 
ombs intention or ability to address veterans issues objectively 
or to support the moral and legal obligations that this nation has 
accorded the men and women who have served our country

guttman said it was still being determined what individuals quayle 
would meet during his brief el salvador stop 
he is to arrive in and leave the central american nation on feb

other officials as appropriate

catholic priests in milwaukee feel they deserve 
better pay and are studying a proposal that would give them 
substantially higher salaries 
the archdiocesan council of priests adopted the recommendation to 
set a salary range of 25000 to 40000 monday and parish councils 
throughout the milwaukee catholic archdiocese will be asked their 
opinion 
the councils recommendation was designed to put the salary for 
priests on a par with those of protestant clergy military chaplains 
and lay administrators 
the plan to achieve parity in pay would be the first among 
dioceses in the country said father alan jurkus moderator of the 
council of priests although the issue has been the source of 
considerable discussion among priests for some time 
diocesan priests are now paid 6096 to 12480 a year in 
addition to allowances each priest gets 209 a month car allowance 
and each parish counsel negotiates how much money will be allowed 
for food parishes provide housing and some provide cooking and 
cleaning services 
the new proposal would end those allowances 
if approved by the parish councils and archbishop rembert 
weakland the proposal would take effect july 1 1990 at the 
earliest 
as an interim measure a proposal to increase priests salaries 
by 200 a month was approved by the council monday and was sent to 
weakland for a decision 
weakland said the impact on the diocese and parishes of the 
200amonth increase would have to be studied but that he would 
probably favor the move 
the proposal for higher salaries and the change in living 
expenses needs more study weakland said 
im in sympathy with it he said its much more equitable 
to get a flat salary rather than having to bargain for it 
some newly ordained priests carry debts of their education 
weakland added for older priests its the security of the 
future 
the national federation of priests councils did a comparative 
study in the fall of 1983 on compensation for diocesan priests 
around the country and will begin a new survey next month of the 
180 dioceses that responded to the 1983 questionnaire milwaukee 
priests ranked secondhighest in compensation

episcopal officials tuesday approved the election 
of the first woman bishop in the 2000year tradition of apostolic 
succession a line of bishops dating to christ and his apostles 
the approval of the election of episcopal bishopelect barbara 
harris brought a woman into that long line maintained by 
anglicanism including the us episcopal church and roman 
catholicism and eastern orthodoxy both the catholic church and 
eastern orthodox churches bar women from the clergy 
her elevation as a suffragen or assistant bishop in the 
denominations boston diocese sharply upset many conservatives 
throughout the episcopal church but was hailed as progress by many 
others 
her consecration will be both a momentous and solemn occasion 
and a time of great joy and celebration said the denominations 
top officer presiding bishop edmond l browning 
his statement came after a majority of 60 of the churchs 118 
us bishops gave their consent for her elevation following 
previous approval by a majority of the diocesan standing committees 
the 60th vote was received by mail tuesday afternoon said the 
rev james solheim spokesman for the boston diocese the approval 
process which began about three weeks ago after confirmation from a 
majority of standing committees around the country moved slower 
than expected solheim said 
harris has declined to discuss her election until after it is 
formally approved she has an unlisted telephone number of because 
of several threatening calls she received after the election 
harris had been elected sept 24 by a massachusetts diocesan 
convention 
the election of harris 58 a divorced former public relations 
executive reverberated throughout world anglicanism 
browning in a statement from his office in new york said most 
of the churchwide consideration of harris had been in a spirit of 
prayerful discussion and sensitivity but he said there also 
were some angry words some meanspirited words and some 
threatening words 
i have found this both inappropriate to the process and 
diminishing to the sense of how we should conduct ourselves he 
said 
the denomination approved women priests and bishops in 1976 
since then about 1200 women have been ordained as priests in the 
episcopal church 
critics said harris was too liberal in her political views 
others criticized her lack of college degree or seminary training 
while church conservatives said that under no circumstances would 
they support any woman for bishop 
supporters said harris was qualified for the job and her election 
would broaden the scope of the churchs outreach 
harris who is black was ordained a priest in philadelphia in 
1980 after studying theology through correspondence courses and with 
tutors in addition to her parish work she recently headed the 
episcopal church publishing co 
her election was termed as contributing to a final crisis for 
the church in a pastoral letter from seven bishops of the 
evangelical and catholic mission an episcopal group that opposes 
female priests and bishops 
a compromise on the issue of female bishops was worked out in 
july when the episcopal churchs governing convention in detroit 
approved a measure allowing any congregation rejecting a woman 
bishop to petition for a male episcopal visitor bishop to 
administer confirmations 
but the woman bishop still would make periodic visits to such a 
congregation as required by church law 
harris consecration ceremony is planned for feb 11

nofault auto insurance would save motorists 
37 billion nationwide perhaps hundreds of dollars per family in 
some states a new consumer group estimated tuesday in announcing a 
campaign to convert all states to nofault 
something must be done to break the 20year cycle of madness 
that has produced constant auto insurance crises said virginia 
knauer leader of the organization new start 
ms knauer served presidents nixon ford and reagan as special 
assistant for consumer affairs 
the group said it was still working on estimates for separate 
states and could not say how much individual drivers would save it 
said its estimate of nationwide savings was based on 1987 data from 
the states 
something close to true nofault auto insurance first proposed 
in a 1965 book by robert keaton and jeffrey oconnell has been 
adopted only in michigan new york and florida the group said 
eleven other states have variants which ms knauer called phony 
nofault and 12 more use elements of nofault plans in 
traditional insurance law 
skyrocketing premiums have become politically controversial in 
several states california voters last fall passed a referendum 
requiring companies to reduce premiums 20 percent 
nationwide auto insurance premiums increased 60 percent from 
1982 to 1987 while the consumer price index was increasing 17 
percent the group said 
under traditional insurance people involved in accidents often 
file lawsuits to determine who was at fault and whose insurance 
company must pay 
critics say this overcompensates the slightly injured 
undercompensates the gravely hurt clogs the courts with lawsuits 
that take years to reach verdicts and according to a 1985 
transportation department study returns to victims only half of 
premium payments the rest goes to lawyers and to people who 
administer the system 
new start said studies showed michigan victims get 73 cents of 
every premium dollar and new york victims get 60 cents 
bill wagner of tampa fla president of the association of 
american trial lawyers said of the new group and its contentions 
if this entity could come up with a way to ensure fair treatment 
to injured people by depriving them of their right to court id be 
for it 
under nofault victims rapidly see the economic power of the 
insurance companies used to deprive them of all their rights he 
said 
in a nofault system victims file claims against their own 
companies and are compensated by them regardless of who is at fault 
all 14 nofault states restrict the right to sue 
michigan new york and florida limit lawsuits to people who have 
suffered serious and permanent injury this restriction greatly 
reduces the number of suits the group said 
the other 11 states set a dollar threshold ranging up to 6000 
people who suffer losses greater than that may sue 
the states colorado 500 connecticut 400 georgia 500 hawaii 
6000 kansas 2000 kentucky 1000 massachusetts 500 
minnesota 4000 new jersey 1700 north dakota 2500 and utah 
3000 
monetary thresholds have proven ineffective because they 
encourage abuses excessive medical treatment inflated bills and 
in some cases outright fraud to reach the required dollar 
amount new start said 
ms knauer said she would invite heads of insurance companies to 
meet with her next month before she begins a crosscountry tour to 
drum up support 
i think the experience of the past 20 years suggests that 
little can be accomplished which benefits the consumer by drawing a 
line and standing there shouting across the divide at insurance 
companies she said they clearly are part of the problem but 
if we are to get anywhere they equally clearly must be part of the 
solution 
james l brown director of the center for consumer affairs at 
the university of wisconsin and one of the two founders of new start 
with the rev robert j mcewen professor of economics at boston 
college said no insurance industry funds had gone into organizing 
the new group

authorities on tuesday released the last of three 
african students arrested after a dec 24 campus brawl that 
triggered antiafrican protests in several cities 
the action comes one day before mali president moussa traore who 
also is executive president of the organization of african unity 
arrives in china for a state visit the oau had criticized chinas 
handling of the racially tinged fight and later protests 
alex dosoo of ghana said in a telephone interview from the 
eastern city of nanking that he was released tuesday from a guest 
house where he was held in a guarded room for the last 11 days of 
his 25day captivity the first two weeks he spent in jail 
dosoo said authorities still maintain he seriously injured a 
chinese man in the dec 24 fight at nankings hehai university he 
denies the charge 
he said police told him he was being freed because i have been 
of good conduct and mostly in the interests of relations between 
african countries and china 
dosoo a secondyear engineering student said he was told he can 
continue his studies but that he wants to return home 
ghana had protested dosoos arrest and said it might pull out its 
26 students in china officials at its embassy in beijing could not 
immediately be reached tuesday night for comment on dosoos release 
alpha robinson of gambia and dossoumou boni lodovic of benin were 
held in disciplinary detention for two weeks on charges of trying 
to stir up trouble during the fight china initially ordered them 
to leave china but later reversed itself robinson left and 
officials have been trying to persuade lodovic to stay 
the reversal of the expulsions and dosoos release appeared 
intended to soothe any ill will with african countries whom china 
long has courted in pursuit of third world solidarity 
many african embassies also have seemed unwilling to criticize 
china openly over the events even while privately complaining about 
chinas handling of them 
traores visit his third to china since 1973 was planned before 
the nanking clash 
according to chinese officials the dec 24 fight began when 
african students at the hehai campus gate refused to register 
chinese girlfriends they were bringing to a school dance china says 
the africans attacked school guards and chinese students and that 
11 chinese and two africans were hurt 
however african students say chinese students attacked the 
africans first 
dosoo said chinese hit him with umbrellas and he kicked one in 
selfdefense he said after fleeing the area that he and a friend 
were attacked by more than two dozen chinese and that one hit him 
in the head causing a wound that required stitches 
hundreds of chinese students stoned the africans dormitories 
throughout the week thousands of chinese marched through nanking 
shouting kill the black devils 
smaller confrontations involving alleged racism against african 
students occurred in beijing and two other cities and nearly 500 
africans at one beijing school have been boycotting classes since 
jan 4 in protest 
eric akumiah of ghana president of the nanking branch of the 
general union of african students in china said about half of the 
approximately 140 africans studying in the city have returned to 
classes in the past two weeks at their embassies orders 
he said only about 40 remain determined to leave china including 
himself 
the chinese are trying to just cover it up be cool that 
is not the ultimate solution he said today its nanking maybe 
it will calm down but it will come up again soon 
the problem is the chinese are unwilling to accept that there 
is any trace of racism in china and if you dont identify your 
problem you cant solve it 
about 1500 africans are studying in china many on scholarships 
from chinese government many report taunting from chinese about 
their dark skin several smaller clashes have occurred between 
african and chinese students in recent years but chinese officials 
deny any racial element 
akumiah said the union had planned to send a student delegation 
to meet traore but authorities were not allowing african students to 
board trains without passes from their schools

the uss john f kennedy the aircraft carrier 
involved in a confrontation with libyan jets earlier this month has 
left the mediterranean sea and is steaming home the pentagon said 
tuesday 
the kennedy has been replaced by a battle group led by the 
carrier uss theodore roosevelt added fred hoffman a pentagon 
spokesman 
the roosevelt is there and the kennedy is out hoffman said 
at a briefing 
navy officials said the kennedy is expected to arrive home at 
norfolk va feb 2 
the departure of the kennedy and its battle group means the 
united states no longer has two aircraft carriers in the region the 
presence of two carriers earlier this month fueled speculation the 
united states might be contemplating a bombing raid on a suspected 
chemical weapons plant inside libya 
navy and pentagon officials insisted all along however the two 
carriers were simply in the midst of a routine overlap as one 
relieved the other 
on jan 4 two f14 tomcat jet fighters from the kennedy shot 
down two libyan mig23 fighters after being approached in a 
hostile manner while on a routine patrol protecting the carrier

the us government on tuesday hailed east 
germanys proposed cuts in military spending and troop strength 
saying such moves could provide good momentum for upcoming 
negotiations on reducing conventional military forces in europe 
we welcome the announcement of the proposed cuts especially 
if they are implemented in such a way that both gdr german 
democratic republic and warsaw pact forces begin to become 
defensive in their structure and doctrine state department 
spokesman charles redman told reporters 
erich honnecker leader of the warsaw pact nation announced on 
monday that his country would reduce its armed forces by 10000 and 
cut military spending by 10 percent 
this follows soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs announcement 
last month before the united nations general assembly that he 
planned to slash soviet forces in eastern europe by 50000 men and 
5000 tanks 
the soviet and east german unilateral reductions if 
implemented could give good momentum to the new conventional 
talks redman said 
redman argued that honneckers announcement amounted to the 
acknowledgement of the existence of warsaw pact conventional 
superiority in europe 
saying the united states has often pressed for asymmetrical 
reductions to eliminate the eastbloc superiority in troops and 
tanks redman added that we thus doubly welcome the gdrs 
announcement as confirmation that our approach to conventional arms 
control in europe is the proper one 
the spokesman said the administration looks forward to beginning 
the conventional arms talks set to start in march in vienna

the soviet union has bought an additional 
635000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices virtually 
wiping out its current purchase authority the agriculture 
department said tuesday 
christopher e goldthwait acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said the wheat was part 
of 2 million tons authorized dec 23 under the export enhancement 
program or eep 
the wheat was bought under a longterm supply agreement 
goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment in february and march 
counting some wheat left over from previous arrangements the 
soviets have only 35200 tons still available under the program 
with the latest sales the soviets have bought about 165 million 
tons of us wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact the 
agreement expired last sept 30 but was later extended through dec 
31 1990 
the arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
last year us corn sales to the soviet union totaled slightly 
less than 52 million tons wheat sales in 198788 all subsidized 
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 635000 tons of 
wheat would be about 233 million bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than 4 per 
bushel according to recent usda market figures making the new sale 
worth an estimated 93 million 
besides the wheat for 198889 delivery under the pact the 
soviets have ordered 102 million tons of corn 450000 tons of 
soybeans and 1132500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of 
grain sorghum only the wheat is subsidized 
goldthwait said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy 
rate of 2305 per ton or about 63 cents per bushel he said the 
bonuses on the 635000 tons of wheat will be paid to seven 
companies cargill inc 75000 tons continental grain co

security remains tight at the sorority 
house where ted bundy killed two women 11 years ago but current 
residents were little troubled by his execution an adviser said 
tuesday 
they hope that they will be allowed to put this behind them 
kirk b cocke said 
security measures were evident as mrs cocke a former president 
of chi omega national as well as a former adviser to the florida 
state university chapter dealt with reporters tuesday after bundys 
morning execution 
once she stepped out of the house to talk with journalists she 
couldnt get back in without ringing the bell and she couldnt 
leave the door open without setting off a burglar alarm 
the current sorority sisters were in grammar school when margaret 
bowman 21 and lisa levy 20 were bludgeoned to death by bundy on 
jan 15 1978 two other students also were attacked but survived 
so they really dont know anything about it except of course 
theyre conscious of all the attention mrs cocke said 
bundy was executed for the february 1978 death of 12yearold 
kimberly leach of lake city his last victim but he also was 
sentenced to death in the sorority house killings 
i simply had breakfast with them this morning and talked to 
them and answered their questions mrs cocke said 
theyre taking this with a great deal of calmness and poise and 
dignity i think 
of bundys execution she said there was no feeling of 
jubilation on part of the girls it was more sadness and relief than 
anything 
she said she didnt believe the current sorority sisters think 
too much about bundys ramage 
there are memorials in the house for the two girls that were 
killed and every year theres an award given in memory of the two 
girls who were killed to the most outstanding chi omega she said 
but other than that they really dont think about it one way or 
the other 
however the last week since gov bob martinez signed bundys 
fourth death warrant jan 17 has been tense according to mrs 
cocke 
i think the attention it has created has made it worse on the 
girls she said adding that its difficult for them to answer the 
many questions about how they feel and what they think of the case 
mrs cocke who taught business management at florida state 
university at the time of the murders knew both of the victims and 
was one of the many adults who helped the sorority sisters after the 
attack 
it was a terribly traumatic time terribly traumatic of 
course it was about six weeks or two months before he was caught so 
that was a time of great tension but even then the girls took it 
with a great deal of dignity and grace and they faced death for the 
first time in their young lives

the united states and britain on tuesday asked 
for a 33nation meeting of transportation officials to plan 
antiterrorism measures following the bombing of pan am flight 103 
over scotland last month 
the meeting proposed for montreal next month would seek to 
improve international standards for handling passengers baggage and 
cargo to prevent sabotage said mimi weyforth dawson acting 
transportation secretary 
samuel skinner whose senate confirmation hearings as 
transportation secretary open wednesday would attend if confirmed 
dawson said 
she and british secretary of state for transportation paul 
channon made the joint request for a special session of the council 
of the international civil aviation organization to include 
transportation ministers or secretaries from the 33 countries that 
sit on the council the montrealbased organization has 160 member 
nations 
charles lafond spokesman for the icao which is a united nations 
agency said the council was in session currently and had an 
unlawful interference committee that was expected to take up 
issues surrounding flight 103 he said council officials had not 
received the usbritish request and no special meeting was yet 
scheduled 
investigators of the dec 21 explosion which killed all 259 
people aboard the pan american boeing 747 and 11 on the ground 
concluded the plane was destroyed in flight by an explosive device 
probably made of plastique 
authorities have identified a baggage container in the 747s 
forward cargo hold which they believe contained the bomb but they 
have not suggested how by whom or at what point the bomb was 
smuggled aboard the airliner 
the plane was on the londonnew york leg of a flight that 
originated in frankfurt the times of london reported last week that 
investigators think the luggage was first loaded in frankfurt and 
transferred tothe 747 at londons heathrow airport 
another british newspaper the sunday express reported jan 15 
that investigators were looking into the theory that the bomb went 
aboard the plane with a soldier involved in a diamond smuggling ring 
during the weekend syrias defense minister mustafa tlass 
alleged that israeli intelligence agents duped an american soldier 
into carrying the bomb in his luggage paying him 300000 and 
telling him it was diamonds to be smuggled into the united states 
israel which accuses palestinian elements of planting the bomb 
called the charge ridiculous and malicious 
a us transportation department announcement said dawson and 
channon called for the highlevel session to emphasize the 
worldwide nature of the terrorist threat and the need for greater 
international cooperation and improved security measures 
dawson said the meeting would consider how standard security 
measures might be expanded and applied uniformly in highrisk areas 
she also said it would explore ways of increasing research and 
development of explosive detection aircraft design and construction 
and security equipment 
the announcement said the international organization would look 
for ways to assist countries trying to improve aviation security 
measures and possibly survey airports upon request to see if they 
meet international safety standards

the private center for auto safety asked the 
government tuesday to order the recall of 19 million ford motor co 
pickup trucks alleging that the vehicles fuel system tends to 
catch fire 
the petition by an advocacy group often at odds with the 
automakers and their regulators asked the national highway traffic 
safety administration to broaden its probe of alleged fires in 
fords fseries pickup trucks with dual gas tanks 
the agency in december opened a lowlevel investigation of ford 
fseries pickups made from 1986 through 1988 the center asked that 
the investigation include pickups made as far back as 1983 and be 
raised to an engineering analysis a higher level than the present 
preliminary evaluation 
opening the lowestlevel investigation is woefully 
inadequate the petition said 
the center said it had received eight reports of fires involving 
fseries pickups 
a ford spokeswoman joyce stinson said at the companys 
dearborn mich headquarters that ford was cooperating with the 
investigation and if it were broadened we would continue to do 
so 
the government agency as a matter of policy refuses to comment 
on investigations in progress it responds to petitions within 120 
days of their filing 
the petition was the second filed by the center this week after 
months of little public activity 
the centers director clarence ditlow said the organization had 
deliberately held off from filing petitions until the new bush 
administration took office 
our experience here in washington is any time there is an 
election from just before the election to when the new 
administration comes in nothing gets done ditlow said

president bush pledged tuesday to submit 
detailed revisions to ronald reagans budget next month and 
suggested highlevel negotiations between the white house and 
congress to produce an early agreement 
the white house acknowledged bush had not kept his promise to 
send his team of budget negotiators to congress on the first day of 
his presidency likewise it appeared unlikely bush would follow 
through on his promise to personally lead the budget talks 
amid a glow of bipartisan good will on the fourth day of his 
presidency bush met at the white house with democratic and 
republican congressional leaders to seek cooperation on the budget 
and foreign policy 
generally there is a very hopeful sense that we are going to be 
able to find bipartisanship almost everywhere the speaker of the 
house rep jim wright dtexas said after two hours of talks with 
bush 
it was all sweetness and light said the house republican 
whip rep richard cheney of wyoming acknowledging that differences 
on the budget and other problems are inevitable eventually the 
honeymoons still on two more days three more days enjoy it 
while it lasts 
republicans and democrats alike said bush gave no clue about his 
budget priorities but said his proposals would include steps to 
deal with the nations savings and loan crisis 
bush will address a joint session of congress on feb 9 to reveal 
proposals for revising reagans 115 trillion budget for fiscal 
1990 
wright and other democratic leaders reserved judgment on bushs 
formula for budget talks wed like to wait until we see a budget 
until we see where the areas of agreement and disagreement would be 
before we consult wright said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration suggested that congress in a break with tradition 
try to speed up work on the budget by holding weekly meetings 
attended by top house and senate leaders as well as the chairmen of 
various committees with jurisdiction over the budget and taxwriting 
legislation 
fitzwater said darman and treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
would join the talks i dont think the president would be 
involved on a continuing basis but he probably could be involved at 
any point the spokesman said 
of the plan for weekly meetings the house republican leader 
rep robert michel of illinois told reporters 
it would be to our advantage to have the leadership meet in an 
informal sort of way from time to time moving the process along 
so that it doesnt get to lag and drag 
he said the goal would be to telescope the process and said 
wright had promised bush his budget would be on a fast track 
wright presented bush with a bottle of hot pepper sauce and a jar 
of pork rinds his favorite snack at the outset of the white 
house meeting we want to give a very warm welcome to the 
president wright joked 
emerging from the talks the congressional leaders gave bush high 
praise for making his first formal contact with congress a 
bipartisan one 
it was a cordial meeting there is a good atmosphere said 
the senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine 
bush promised the leaders he would submit a major rewrite of 
reagans budget not just minor modifications 
the president agreed to submit a full and concise budget by 
midfebruary wright said 
mitchell said i dont think we anticipate a complete budget 
proposal of the depth and detail that president reagan submitted 
but we do expect a budget proposal of sufficient detail to make 
clear what the presidents priorities are and how he plans to deal 
with the serious problems facing the country 
i hope the sweetness and light will last a long time said 
sen alan cranston dcalif the assistant senate majority leader 
its clear the president is a man interested in achieving 
honest accommodation whenever he could and go the extra 
distance to reach compromises with congress democratic majority 
sen alan dixon dill told reporters 
bush did talk about wanting to meet separately with congressional 
banking leaders to discuss the nations savings and loan crisis 
democrats said they still expected major arguments with the 
president particularly over central america and budget policy 
there have always been differences between congresses and 
presidents thats the nature of the system cranston said

mayor marion barry jr appeared tuesday for the 
second time before a federal grand jury investigating his ties to a 
drug suspect but his attorney stressed again that barry isnt a 
target of the probe 
during the time that the mayor was at the grand jury we were 
completely unafraid of anything concerning the ramada inn 
investigation or the virgin islands investigation said r kenneth 
mundy barrys attorney 
im stronger than ever before barry said after his 
twoandonehalf hour appearance when asked if he was a target of 
the investigation he responded absolutely not 
federal officials refused comment on barrys appearances but 
have said before they are trying to determine if the mayor thwarted 
a police drug probe in late december the grand jury is also 
examining the mayors role in a joint personnel project involving 
the city and virgin islands government 
police were called back from a dec 22 attempt to buy drugs from 
the suspect charles lewis after barry turned up in lewis room at 
a dowtown ramada inn barry has since acknowledged making several 
calls to police investigating the incident but said he was only 
trying to speed up their inquiry 
lewis also headed the 260000 joint personnel project for the 
virgin islands government but was fired from his post last april 
after virgin islands officials became concerned about cost overruns 
barry and other top city aids ran up hotel bills in the virgin 
islands of more than 37000 while working on the plan 
mundy said barry is unlikely to be called before the panel again 
but the mayor was served with a subpoeana that requested all of his 
telephone records schedules and daily diaries for december which 
covers the time period when lewis was in the washington area the 
grand jury is also seeking all phone messages dating back to sept 
15 
all the requested material will be turned over to the grand jury 
as soon as possible mundy said

the environmental protection agency proposed 
new restrictions tuesday on contaminants in sewage sludge 
when finally issued the restrictions will affect about onethird 
of the nations sewagetreatment plants 
this proposal will help lower the contaminant level of sludge 
and make it easier for local communities to market it 
successfully said acting epa administrator john moore 
sludge is the residue removed from sewage during wastewater 
treatment and normally contains organic material that can be sold as 
agricultural or homegarden fertilizer for as much as 60 a ton 
but according to the epa it also contains metals and toxic 
pollutants that must be controlled 
moore said the purpose of the proposed regulations which will 
set standards on the level of contamination covering 28 organic and 
metallic pollutants found in sludge is to reduce the level of 
contaminants in the waste byproduct 
among pollutants covered by the proposed rule are arsenic lead 
pcbs zinc mercury and benzene 
the epa said that the new rules establish maximum levels of the 
various pollutants that will be allowed in the sludge and still meet 
federal requirements 
it added that agency risk analysis indicates that improper 
disposal of contaminanted sludge could present health dangers 
including possibly cancer and hypertension in middleaged men 
the proposed rules apply to about 5300 treatment plants which 
account for about half of all the sewage sludge processed most of 
the remaining 10000 plants either are covered by other regulations 
because they use municipal solid waste landfills or present 
minimal or no threat to public health because of the way they 
are disposed 
the epa estimated the cost of the regulatory requirement at 157 
million a year most of it associated with the increased use of 
incinerators to deal with the pollutants 
the agency estimated that in the long run the additional 
precautions could prevent 5200 from being stricken by cancer or 
have other health problems

the presidents party on tuesday 
rejected a new offer by leftist guerrillas to participate in 
elections if voting is postponed for six months 
fidel chavez mena the christian democratic presidential 
candidate and a close adviser to president jose napoleon duarte 
said great efforts must be made on behalf of peace but that 
putting off elections beyond march 31 would be unconstitutional 
the constitution says elections must be held at least two months 
before a new government is due to take office duartes term ends 
june 1 
roberto viera minister of communications said the government 
will analyze the document point by point and present a detailed 
formal response 
the marxistled guerrillas in a document made public tuesday 
said they would take part if a presidential vote scheduled for march 
19 is postponed to sept 15 they set other conditions including 
confinement of the army to barracks on election day 
many have said that the only obstacle to peace in el salvador 
is that we demanded a share of power before elections said 
salvador samoyoa a member of the political commission of the 
farabundo marti liberation front guerrillas known as fmln 
now we have removed that obstacle samoyoa said tuesday at a 
mexico city news conference we have agreed to play the game on 
their field 
the guerrillas presented the proposal as a test of the other 
political parties desire for peace and of president bushs desire 
for political solutions in central america 
ana guadalupe martinez a member of the guerrillas general 
command said the proposal was made because of increasing violence 
and deteriorating economic social and political conditions 
the nation is headed for a social explosion she said when 
asked what the guerrilla reaction would be if the proposal failed 
ms martinez said the tendency towards violence is increasing 
and the fmln is not on the margins of that reality 
the guerrillas said tuesday they would throw their support behind 
guillermo ungo the candidate of the leftist democratic convergence 
alliance if te vote were switched to sept 15 we believe we can 
win if a fair election is held said ms martinez 
the groups 7000 guerrillas have been fighting the usbacked 
government and its 56000strong army for nine years but neither 
side has been able to gain a decisive advantage 
the rightwing republican nationalist alliance or arena which 
has been leading in polls for the presidential election noted that 
the guerrillas did not say they would stop fighting 
we are willing to talk what we cannot do is subordinate 
ourselves to a group of terrorist delinquents said sigifredo 
ochoa a top arena leader in the national assembly 
the christian democrats control the executive branch but arena 
trounced the centrist party in legislative and mayoral elections 
last year 
the arena presidential candidate alfredo cristiani led mena by 
more than 10 percentage points in a december poll with ungo running 
a distant third 
a diplomat in close contact with the army high command said the 
response from defense minister gen eugenio vides casanova to the 
guerrilla proposal was a flatout no 
a western diplomat the only way the armed forces could be 
persuaded to accept the proposal would be through strong pressure 
from the united states 
this is a proposal for the us congress as much as it is for 
the salvadorans the diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
washington has provided el salvador more than 3 billion in aid 
since 1980 more than it has given any other country in the western 
hemisphere 
another diplomat said the insurgents might be counting on 
rejection they could then portray themselves as a party truly 
interested in peace but obliged to continue fighting 
ruben zamora a leader of the democratic convergence called the 
proposal a test to see if salvadoran politicians really want peace 
or if they only want jobs on the public payroll 
the guerrillas conditions include a halt to repression of 
labor and peasant leaders revising the electoral code awarding a 
seat on the central elections council to the democratic convergence 
and noninterference by the united states 
in return the guerrillas said they would respect political 
activity halt assassinations of mayors observe a fiveday truce at 
election time and call for participation by their entire social 
base the guerrillas have boycotted previous elections as a 
farce

the pentagon bowed to congress tuesday and 
authorized the special operations command to develop its own budget 
and program proposals providing americas commando warriors some 
independence from the bureaucracies of the parent services 
the decision was made by william h taft iv currently the acting 
secretary of defense while secretarydesignate john tower awaits 
senate confirmation 
defense sources who insisted on anonymity said taft acted after 
tower made it clear he didnt want this becoming an issue at his 
confirmation hearing 
on the surface tuesdays move would appear to involve merely a 
change in internal bureaucratic procedures 
but defense sources and congressional leaders described the 
change as important tuesday explaining that for the first time the 
general in charge of special operations forces would have a direct 
line to the secretary of defense instead of having to funnel his 
budget requests through the navy air force and army 
im very happy and pleased that secretary taft has directed 
this said rep earl hutto dfla the chairman of the house 
armed services committees special operations panel adding he was 
informed of the move tuesday 
the armed services have not done right by special operations 
its been a low priority for them and theres no question there has 
been a lot of resistance over there inside the pentagon 
but we have to get the special operations forces the resources 
they need and the only way to do that is to give them budget 
authority 
the special operations command was ordered established by 
congress in legislation that was approved in october 1986 that bill 
specified the new command should receive its own budgeting 
authority but set no deadline 
the pentagon has subsequently come under fire the past two years 
for its slow pace in reorganizing the chainofcommand and setting 
up the new entity 
the reagan administration consistently argued it was making great 
strides in improving the readiness of the navys seals the armys 
rangers green berets and antiterrorist delta team and the air 
forces first special operations wing 
but congress remained unconvinced saying it still appeared the 
elite commando units were losing out in the internal pentagon 
battles for manpower and money and didnt have the training or 
equipment to work together 
tafts directive specifies the commanderinchief of the special 
operations command or cincsoc will be assigned programbudget 
development responsibilities for special operations forces 
i direct all officials to provide the us special operations 
command the resources support information and assistance required 
to perform the above tasks he added 
the special operations command headquartered at macdill air 
force base in florida is headed by army gen james j lindsay

aflcio president lane kirkland offered a quick 
no comment tuesday when asked if democrat michael dukakis waged 
the type of campaign necessary to win the presidential election and 
an equally quick no when asked if he would urge dukakis to run 
again 
no i wouldnt urge anyone thats his decision kirkland 
told a small group of reporters in his office i have no intention 
of promoting his candidacy four years ahead of time 
the initial question came after kirkland whose organization 
endorsed the massachusetts governor in the 1988 presidential race 
said he believed a good fighting candidate with a good fighting 
campaign could win the presidency regardless of party affiliation 
asked if dukakis met that criteria kirkland smiled and said no 
comment 
dukakis recently announced he would not seek a fourth term as 
governor he said the announcment had nothing to do with plans for 
another presidential campaign but others have speculated he is 
considering seeking a rematch with president bush in 1992

the savings and loan industrys largest trade 
group on tuesday recommended tapping the us treasury to close 
insolvent institutions while slashing the amount contributed by 
healthy sampls 
the proposal by the us league of savings institutions if 
adopted would have the effect of shifting all of the burden for 
solving the problems of the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
onto taxpayers and freeing the industry from further responsibility 
the group which plans to present its proposal thursday at a 
hearing of the house budget committee wants to create a resolution 
corporation as a new independent federal agency 
the resolution corporation would be responsible for liquidating 
or selling the more than 350 insolvent but still open sampls as well 
as any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the next three 
years 
it also would take over all of the obligations the fslic has 
acquired in rescuing institutions in the past for instance the 
fslic resolved the cases of 205 insolvent institutions last 
year largely by issuing promissory notes and guarantees against 
loss these obligations would be transferred to the resolution 
corporation 
the resolution corporation would raise money by issuing notes 
which would be guaranteed by the treasury any money the resolution 
corporation gets from selling failed sampls to new investors or from 
selling the assets would go toward paying off the notes however 
the treasury would have to pay most of the bill 
in the meantime a new industryfunded fslic would be created to 
insure the deposits of healthy sampls which would pay an insurance 
premium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks to 
their fund the federal deposit insurance corp 
banks currently pay 8 cents per 100 in deposits since 1985 
sampls have been paying a higher fee 21 cents per 100 in deposits 
barney r beeksma chairman of the us league argued that sampls 
already have paid 5 billion in extra assessments and cant afford 
to pay more if they are to build their capital a key reform 
advocated by the league and private analysts 
capital represents the amount of money put up by an institutions 
owners as backing for public deposits the more capital there is 
the greater the cushion against failure and the more incentive the 
owners have to operate the sampl safely 
weve paid all that we can pay and what were concerned with 
now is creating a viable insurance fund for the future beeksma 
said in a telephone interview somebody has to decide whether they 
want us to pay the bill for the fslic or build our capital to make 
sure this doesnt happen again we cant do both 
he said tapping taxpayers funds is a price for the mistakes 
that were made in the past by the congress the regulators and the 
few in our business that shouldnt have been let in 
the trade group also is recommending that both the resolution 
corporation and the new fslic should be independent of the federal 
home loan bank board the regulator of the nations 3000 federally 
insured sampls it said the current system of consolidated sampl 
regulation has not provided the necessary checks and balances 
the league rejected for now proposals to merge the insurance 
funds for sampls and commercial banks beeksma said the issue should 
be revisited by congress in three years after the furor 
subsides 
meanwhile the treasury department is finishing its own 
recommendations to president bush it hasnt disclosed the plan but 
it has said a key principal of its recommendation will be that 
further industry resources and additional insurance premiums should 
be tapped before public funds 
bush in a meeting tuesday with congressional leaders said he 
would propose substantial revisions next month to ronald reagans 
budget including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis 
in another development rep bob michel of illinois the house 
republican leader announced the creation of a gop task force to 
recommend solutions to the sampl crisis it will be chaired by rep 
stan parris rva a member of the house banking committee

morgenthau released a grand jury indictment charging that gotti and 
two associates had conspired to order the revenge shooting of the 
union leader who allegedly had a manhattan restaurant vandalized 
for using nonunion carpenters

gambino crime family over all others who might challenge it 
according to the indictment which charges gotti and two associates 
with conspiracy and firstdegree assault 
oconnor vice president and business manager of local 608 of the 
united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners survived the may 1986 
attack in which he was shot four times

brokers was managed by an alleged gambino family associate phillip 
modica law enforcement officials said 
at the bail hearing assistant district attorney michael 
cherkasky asked acting state supreme court justice george roberts to 
hold gotti and anthony tony lee guerrieri without bail saying

dozens of police officers district attorneys detectives fbi 
agents and investigators from the state organized crime task force 
descended on the little italy section of lower manhattan monday 
afternoon to arrest gotti 
morgenthau said investigators learned through electronic 
surveillance that a contract to kill oconnor had been given by the 
gambino group to the leader of the westies a crime gang that 
operated on manhattans west side 
several members of the westies were named as coconspirators in 
the indictment but were not charged 
at the news conference morgenthau insisted that his office had 
not been slow in indicting gotti saying when we had all of the 
evidence that we needed we proceeded very fast

theater director yuri lyubimov returned to moscow 
on tuesday to direct a play at the theater from which he was barred 
five years ago ballerina natalia makarova stepped onto the stage of 
the kirov theater for the first time since she fled in 1970 
the homecoming of the famed sovietborn artists unmentionable in 
their countrys own press until recently marked another lowering of 
barriers in president mikhail s gorbachevs drive to open soviet 
society 
meanwhile the government newspaper izvestia suggested that 
returning mstislav rostropovichs soviet citizenship would restore 
justice to the famed conductor of the national symphony in the 
united states 
rostropovich and his wife soprano galina vishnevskaya were 
stripped of their soviet citizenship in 1978 four years after 
leaving the soviet union in search of artistic liberty 
izvestia published an interview monday that the conductor gave to 
its paris correspondent yuri kovalenko kovalenko said in his 
article that to return soviet citizenship to vishnevskaya and 
rostropovich means to restore justice 
we did not humiliate ourselves by publishing the works of 
other exile artists and authors the article said our national 
pride was just increased and the attempts to divide the great 
russian culture by a deaf soundproof wall have inflicted serious 
damage 
tass the soviet news agency reported that lyubimov arrived in 
moscow tuesday at the invitation of the present management of the 
taganka theater where his politically daring plays and avantgarde 
interpretations made him a controversial figure in the soviet 
cultural world 
after soviet authorities had refused to let him stage three plays 
in the theater he founded he was fired and eventually stripped of 
his citizenship 
he continued his work in europe and directed his wellknown 
interpretation of dostoyevskys crime and punishment in the 
united states in 1987 lyubimov visited moscow briefly last year but 
did not direct 
tass said tuesday he plans to stage boris mozhaevs alive a 
play he tried to put on 20 years ago but which was banned by 
bureaucrats in the cultural sphere 
now lyubimov will complete his work the news agency said 
miss makarova 48 renowned on the kirov stage in leningrad in 
the 1950s and 1960s when she danced with rudolf nureyev broke into 
tears when she returned to the theater tuesday tass reported 
she fled her troupe during a london tour in 1970 saying she 
wanted to broaden her career by performing modern dances not staged 
in the soviet union she is scheduled to dance a pas de deux from 
the russian ballet onegin with her partner alexander sombart on 
thursday 
several years ago i could not even dream of returning to 
leningrad as a dancing ballerina tass quoted her as saying 
however now it has come true and i can now embrace my mother i 
rejoice at the changes taking place in my native country 
the official news agency referred to her as our guest from 
london

dobson lets go back then to those roots first of all as i 
understand it you were raised in what you considered to have been a 
healthy home you were not physically abused you were not sexually 
abused you were not emotionally abused 
bundy no no and thats part of the tragedy of this whole 
situation because i grew up in a wonderful home with two dedicated 
and loving parents as one of five brothers and sisters a home 
where we as children were the focus of my parents lives where we 
regularly attended church two christian parents who did not drink 
they did not smoke there was no gambling no physical abuse not 
fighting in the home 
im not saying this was leave it to beaver i dont know that 
such a home exists but it was a fine solid christian home and 
nobody i hope no one will try to take the easy way and try to blame 
or otherwise accuse my family of contributing to this because i 
know and i am trying to tell you as honestly as i know how what 
happened 
this is the message i want to get across that as a young boy 
and i mean a boy of 12 or 13 certainly that i encountered outside 
the home again in the local grocery store in a local drug store 
the softcore pornography that people called soft core as i think 
as i explained to you last night dr dobson in an anecdote as young 
boys do we explored the back roads and sideways and byways of our 
neighborhood and often times people would dump the garbage and 
whatever they were putting out of their house and from time to time 
we would come across pornographic books of a harder nature than of 
a more graphic explicit nature than we would encounter at the local 
grocery store and this also inclouded such things as detective 
magazines 
dobson those that involved violence 
bundy yes yes and this is something i think i want to 
emphasize is that the mostdamaging kinds of pornography and again 
im talking from personal experience are those that involve 
violence and sexual violence because the wedding of those two 
forces is as i know only too well brings out the hatred that is 
just just too terrible to describe 
dobson now walk me through that what was going on in your mind 
at that time 
bundy before we go any further i think its important to me 
that people believe what i am saying i tell you that i am not 
blaming pornography i am not saying that it caused me to go out and 
do certain things and i take full responsibility for whatever i 
have done and all the things i have done thats not the question 
here 
the question and the issue is how this kind of literature 
contributed and helped mold and shape the kinds of violent behavior 
 
dobson it fueled your fantasies didnt it 
bundy in the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process 
then at a certain time it is instrumental i would say 
crystalizing making into something which is almost like a separate 
entity inside at that point i was at the verge of acting out in 
this kind

dobson now i really want to understand that you had gone about 
as far as you could in your own fantasy life with printed material 
or printed and film and then there was the urge to take that 
little step or big step over to a physical event 
bundy and it happened in stages gradually it didnt 
necessarily not to me at least happen overnight my experience 
with pornography generally but with pornography that deals on a 
violent level with sexuality is once you become addicted to it and 
i look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of addiction 
i would keep looking for more potent more explicit more graphic 
kinds of material 
like an addiction you keep craving something that is harder 
harder something which which gives you a greater sense of 
excitement until you reach a point where the pornography only goes 
so far you reach that jumping off point where you begin to wonder 
if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just 
reading it or looking at it 
dobson how long did you stay at that point before you actually 
assaulted someone 
bundy well yeah that is a very delicate point by the way in 
my own development were talking about something about having 
reached the point or gray area that that surrounded that point over 
a course of years 
i would say a couple of years what i was dealing with there was 
very strong inhibitions against criminal behavior or violent 
behavior that had been conditioned into me bred into me in my 
environment in my neighborhood in my church in my school things 
that said no this is wrong even to think of it is wrong but 
certainly to do it is wrong im on that edge i would say the last 
vestiges of restraint the barriers to actually doing something are 
being tested constantly assailed through the kind of fantasy life 
that was fueled largely by pornography 
dobson do you remember what pushed you over that edge do you 
remember the decision to go for it do you remember you decided to 
throw caution to the wind 
bundy when you say pushed i know what youre saying i dont 
want to infer again that i was some helpless kind of victim in that 
were talking about an influence that is an influence of violent 
types of media violent types of pornography which had an 
indispensible in the chain of events that led to the behavior 
the assaults the murders 
its a very difficult thing to describe the sensation of 
reaching that point where i knew that that something had say 
snapped that i knew that i couldnt control anymore that the 
barriers i had learned as a child had been instilled in me 
were not enough to hold me back in respect to seeking out and 
harming somebody 
dobson would it be accurate to call that a frenzy a sexual 
frenzy 
bundy yes thats one way to describe it a compulsion a 
building up of this destructive energy another factor here i 
havent mentioned is the use of alcohol what alcohol did in 
conjuction with exposure to pornography is alcohol reduced my 
inhibitions at the same time the fantasy life that was fueld by 
pornography eroded them further 
dobson in the early days you were nearly always about half 
drunk when you did these things is that right 
bundy yes 
dobson was that always true 
bundy i would say that that was generally the case 
dobson all right if i can understand it there is this battle 
going on within there are the conventions that you have been 
taught theres the right and wrong that you learned as a child and 
then there is this unbridled passion fueled by your plunge into 
hardcore violent pornography and those things are at war with each 
other and then with the alchol diminishing the inhibitions you let 
go 
bundy yes and its accurate it just occurred to me that some 
people will say that well ive seen that stuff and it doesnt do 
anything to me and i can understand that virtually everyone can 
be exposed to pornography and while they are aroused to one degree 
or another they do not go out and do anything wrong 
dobson addictions are like that they affect some people more 
than they affect others but there is a percentage of people 
affected by hardcore pornography in a very violent way and you are 
obviously one of them

hahn to lie to grand jurors investigating his financial dealings and 
to filing a false 1986 income tax return

courtroom state prosecutors agreed to drop charges against profeta 
that he skimmed funds from his massapequa church for personal use

the cabinet adopted a budget tuesday that makes 
japan the top provider of foreign aid increases its defense 
spending and boosts its share of the cost of keeping us troops in 
japan 
the total budget raises government spending by 66 percent the 
largest increase in eight years to 47195 billion the government 
budget for fiscal 1988 which ends on march 31 was 441 billion 
in negotiations after the finance ministrys budget proposal was 
presented last week the foreign ministry and the defense agency won 
increases in japans foreign aid and defense spending 
a foreign ministry official said economic assistance to 
developing countries is likely to exceed 11 billion in fiscal 1989 
up from an estimated 10 billion in fiscal 1988 that would put 
japan ahead of the united states as the worlds largest donor of 
foreign aid based on estimates by the organization for economic 
cooperation and development 
due to differing fiscal years and accounting techniques it is 
difficult to draw direct comparisons between foreign aid budgets 
the 145 billion us foreign aid proposal for the fiscal year 
starting oct 1 includes military aid japans aid budget includes 
no military expenditures 
measured against the size of its economy japans aid is not 
outstandingly generous this year it will be about 03 percent of 
the gross national product higher than the us rate of 023 
percent but below the average of 036 percent among major western 
donor nations 
japans defense agency limited by law to defensive capabilities 
will have a budget of 306 billion in fiscal 1989 up 59 percent 
from this years 2878 billion said toshinori shigeie director of 
the foreign ministrys national security affairs division 
the increase will enable japan to meet fourthyear plans in a 
fiveyear program to beef up japans defense capabilities 
particularly its ability to defend its sea lanes shigeie said 
washington has urged tokyo to do more for its own defense but 
military spending is controversial in japan its constitution 
renounces war and the use of force to settle international disputes 
japan has agreed to shoulder a larger share of the costs of 
maintaining 64000 us troops here in fiscal 1989 it will spend 
111 billion or about 75 percent of the total cost moving closer 
to its goal of 100 percent 
of that amount 6953 million will be used to improve us 
military facilities in japan up 125 percent from this fiscal year 
and 4156 million will go to support the 20000 japanese employees 
of us bases 
until fiscal 1987 japan limited defense spending to 1 percent of 
its gross national product the total value of its goods and 
services in fiscal 1987 defense spending amounted to 1013 percent 
of gnp and in fiscal 1988 and 1989 the military budget will be just 
above 1 percent of gnp based on finance ministry estimates 
japans gnp is forecast to reach 304 trillion in fiscal 1989 
up 4 percent from 289 trillion in fiscal 1988 
measured against the size of its economy japans aid is not 
outstandingly generous this year it will be about 03 percent of 
the gross national product higher than the us rate of 023 
percent but below the average of 036 percent among major western 
donor nations 
the government has announced it will double its official 
development assistance to more than 50 billion for the fiveyear 
period ending in calendar 1992 in a bid to promote japans 
international contribution as a major economic power 
in fiscal 1989 japans foreign aid allocations will include 228 
million for measures equivalent to cancellation of the debts of some 
least developed nations said shigeo iwatani senior assistant for 
economic cooperation 
they also will include for the first time 156 million for 
small nongovernmental organizations that provide emergency relief 
and longterm grassroots assistance in developing nations 
iwatani said the ratio of outright grants to loans in japan was 
not available but said the proportion of grants would be higher 
than the 473 percent recorded in calendar 1987 
he said japan is adding personnel and strengthening research and 
evaluation of aid projects in response to criticism that the 
projects are poorly supervised and that loans usually provide 
contracts for japanese companies 
we are trying to improve the quality of japans aid iwatani 
said development assistance is a new field for japan 
the governments budget proposal which followed five days of 
negotiations between the finance ministry and other government 
bodies is expected to go to parliament for approval on jan 31

condemned killer ted bundy told an 
interviewer on the eve of his execution that i deserve the most 
extreme punishment society has but he said he didnt want to die 
bundy the 42yearold confessed killer of more than 20 young 
women in four states was executed in floridas electric chair early 
tuesday for the kidnap rape and murder of 12yearold kimberly 
leach of lake city 
although he said he felt remorse for all of his sexrelated 
murders bundy said there is no way in the world that killing me 
is going to restore those beautiful children to their parents 
toward the beginning of a videotaped interview with california 
psychologist james dobson at florida state prison bundy said he 
took full responsibility for all the things ive done 
but he said they were te result of a fantasy life fueled by 
hardcore pornography and alcohol 
he said he had essentially a normal upbringing in a christian 
family and i am essentially a normal person except for this 
destructive segment 
bundy handcuffed and sitting at a table across from dobson 
alternately sobbed and smiled during the 29minute interview he was 
dressed in the peachcolored shortsleeved shirt worn by death row 
inmates and he seemed to ponder each question and answer carefully 
sometimes pausing at length before answering 
dobson who has a daily radio program heard in 35 countries over 
1200 radio stations inquired about the killers youngest victim 
kimberly leach what did you feel after that he asked bundy 
bundy held his hands to his face closed his eyes and thought for 
a long time before responding i cant talk about that right now 
its too painful i cant do it i cant begin to understand 
the pain of these parents 
at one point he told his interviewer that he felt the full 
range of guilt and remorse but that he had it 
compartmentalized in his brain 
he said it was important to me that im not blaming 
pornography i take full responsibility but he said hardcore 
pornography guided and shaped what he did 
after he committed his first murder what were the emotional 
effects on you what happened in the days after that dobson asked 
it was like coming out of some horrible trance it was like 
being possessed by something so awful so alien 
i was absolutely horrified that i was capable of doing 
something like that

helped build the facility in rabta ard reported 
imhausenchemie has denied accusations first raised by us 
officials that it was involved in the rabta plant 
ard did not disclose where it initially got its information but 
said it was confirmed by the federal prosecutors office in 
karlsruhe the television also did not say if the employees traveled 
to libya to work on the plant 
earlier tuesday stern magazine said an official at 
imhausenchemie told investigators that officials at imhausen and 
the governmentowned salzgitter industriebau gmbh knew that 
shipments of salzgitter blueprints ended up in libya instead of hong 
kong 
the hamburgbased weekly did not name the official and it was not 
known whether it was the same person identified in the ard report 
salzgitter officials acknowledged last week that it had done 
business with imhausenchemie but said that was for construction of 
a pharmaceuticals plant in hong kong salzgitter officials late 
tuesday denied any involvement in the project in libya 
stern said it was also clear to experts with salzgitter that 
the libyan plant was not designed as a small factory for 
pharmaceuticals but a large chemical plant for the production 
of highly poisonous substances 
stern reported last week that salzgitter which manufactures 
steel products and industrial equipment delivered blueprints for 
the libyan plant 
salzgitter industriebau gmbh is a subsidiary of salzgitter ag 
and both are wholly owned by the west german federal government 
karlheinz von den driesch spokesman for the finance ministry 
said he could not comment on the stern report but he also told 
reporters the allegations will be investigated 
a spokesman for the prosecutors office in offenburg confirmed 
that an imhausenchemie employee was questioned but he declined to 
reveal what that person told investigators the spokesman hubertus 
voegele spoke in an interview with sueddeutscher runkfunk radio 
prosecutors are investigating imhausenchemie based in the black 
forest town of lahr and other west german companies for their 
alleged roles in the libyan complex 
last week stern said that the hong kong project called pharma 
150 was devised to disguise involvement by imhausenchemie in 
helping build the plant in libya which has the same name 
the magazine on tuesday said the giant west german electrical 
firm siemens sold switching and measuring equipment for pharma 
150 
siemens spokesman horst siebert said the company had delivered 
equipment to hong kong but denied it had done anything wrong 
stern telexed its report tuesday to other news organizations in 
advance of thursdays publication 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater denied on 
tuesday that president bush apologized to chancellor helmut kohl 
about news stories alleging west german involvement in the libyan 
plant 
friedhelm ost kohls chief spokesman said in bonn on monday 
that bush regretted commentaries in american newspapers that 
harshly criticized west germany over the libyan scandal because they 
failed to take into account the west german governments efforts 
to prevent the production of chemical weapons

in more than four hours of passionate debate 
tuesday nearly 1200 muscovites nominated the editor of a 
freewheeling weekly magazine for a new national legislature charged 
with carrying out reforms 
vitaly korotich of ogonyok magazine criticized in press and 
hounded by russian nationalists lost two previous tries for 
nomination backers at the dzerzhinsky district meeting however 
overwhelmingly moved him to the next stage of the complex process 
leading to elections march 26 
while supporters and opponents debated his reformist philosophy 
the editor was in the united states on one of several recent trips 
abroad 
vladimir tsvetov a television reporter who spoke for the 
candidacy said korotich and others like him make president mikhail 
s gorbachevs reform effort credible to foreigners 
we are on the edge and the soviet union can become a 
great free socialist country or bog down in bureaucracy again 
tsvetov said 
a small middleaged woman wearing glasses and a gray sweater 
grabbed a microphone but when the crowd heard the words 
korotich and slander a chant of down with pamyat 
drowned her out 
several young members of pamyat a russian nationalist group 
accused of antisemitism raised banners in the back of the hall 
criticizing korotich there was a crush of people straining to see 
then a roar of disapproval 
ogonyok reported earlier this month that pamyat members broke up 
an electoral meeting called to nominate korotich for the 
2250member congress of peoples deputies 
on jan 18 the government newspaper izvestia implied korotich 
supporters also were involved in the disorder the communist party 
paper pravda printed a letter denouncing his magazine as scum 
that defames the soviet union 
when the 995 green cards that counted as ballots tuesday were 
collected and counted korotich had 787 yuri skokov an electronics 
institute director who stressed economic reform got 145 
pyotr makarin a city official running the meeting spent the 
evening trying to shout over people who used any pause to comment or 
ask questions from the floor 
he stopped the meeting at one point and called out we will sit 
and wait until we restore elementary order the crowd gradually 
quieted 
after the earlier meeting was broken up korotich also lost in a 
try at the writers union slate such other backers of reform as 
andrei d sakharov the nobel peace prize winner have been passed 
over by their professional groups and had to seek endorsement 
elsewhere 
sakharov said last week the system for choosing candidates which 
became law in december should be more democratic 
under korotichs leadership ogonyok has printed many sensational 
stories about social problems and corruption of former leaders 
recent issues revealed longhidden statistics on the number of 
suicides in the soviet union and carried stories about the 
soninlaw of the late president leonid i brezhnev who was 
convicted of corruption in late december 
such articles have created ardent supporters and passionate 
critics 
nearly an hour before tuesdays meeting scores of people jammed 
near the entrance of trade union hall in cold clear weather 
they broke a pane of glass next to the entrance and shouted 
the door the door at officials who had locked the entrance 
because a quorum of 500 people had been assured and there was no 
more room 
a man at the edge of the crowd muttered they dont need 
korotich they need a stalinist camp referring to the vast labor 
colonies set up during josef stalins purges 
officials finally relented and let in the crowd which jammed the 
aisles throughout the meeting 
one third of the legislatures members will come from 
geographical districts like dzerzhinsky and another third from 
districts representing ethnic groups the rest are being chosen by 
the communist party and its affiliates trade unions and 
professional and social organizations 
korotichs nomination now goes to a district electoral commission 
that will decide which candidates are put on the ballot

mayor eugene sawyer picked up the endorsement of 
jesse jackson on tuesday in his bid to solidify black support and 
block richard m daley from attaining the mayoral post long held by 
his late father 
jackson appeared with sawyer 54 on a packed stage at a south 
side community center to formally endorse the mayor in the citys 
feb 28 democratic mayoral primary sawyer who is black is being 
challenged by daley 44 who is white and considered the 
frontrunner 
jackson called sawyer a healer who has continued city 
programs started by the late mayor harold washington the citys 
first black mayor 
sawyer who was elected mayor by the city council a week after 
washingtons death said jacksons endorsement would energize his 
campaign 
jackson said he waited until just five weeks before the primary 
to announce his endorsement because of deep divisions in the largely 
black coalition that boosted washington into the mayors office in 
1983 
his endorsement came a day after sawyers leading black 
challenger alderman timothy evans filed for election in a 
thirdparty bid designed to avoid a split in the black primary vote 
that would give an edge to daley 
many washington backers have called evans 45 the heirapparent 
to washington who died of a heart attack in november 1987 
jackson who has been considered an evans ally said his 
endorsement of sawyer applied only to the primary not the april 4 
general mayoral election in which evans would run 
jackson charged that daley the cook county states attorney and 
son of the late mayor richard j daley had sent a signal by 
singling out three blacks health commissioner dr lonnie edwards 
chicago schools superintendent manford byrd and police chief leroy 
martin as people he would replace 
avis lavelle daleys press secretary said jackson was wrong in 
his assertions she said daley has suggested that edwards resign 
that byrd be given a sixmonth contract extension and has said 
nothing definite about martin 
evans is seeking to bypass the primary and run under the harold 
washington party banner in the april special election to fill the 
remaining two years of washingtons term 
other democratic primary contenders are alderman lawrence bloom 
a white washington ally james taylor a former state legislator 
and sheila jones a lyndon larouche backer four others are seeking 
the republican nomination

the government on tuesday proposed 
pardoning the two longestheld nazi war criminals in the west a 
world war ii resistance group criticized the idea 
the case of the two aging german nationals convicted for their 
roles in deporting thousands of dutch jews to nazi death camps has 
been the focus of a bitter public debate here ever since the 
government first proposed releasing them in 1972 
the 43yearlong detention of franz fischer 87 and ferdinand 
aus der fuenten 79 also illustrates the sensitivities still 
surrounding this nations suffering under the 19401945 nazi german 
occupation 
the government argues that because five other war criminals who 
faced death sentences have been pardoned and released continued 
detainment of the two men would violate the principle of equality 
before the law 
dutch justice minister frits korthals altes who made the 
proposal in a letter to parliament said the move follows a plea for 
clemency by a group of 19 prominent victims of nazi persecution and 
a series of secret talks between that group and the government that 
began last summer 
the proposal requires approval by the 150seat parliament where 
it is expected to come under heavy fire 
in the letter korthals altes said there are still victims of 
persecution and participants in the former resistance who will 
be deeply agitated if the two men are released 
bill minco spokesman for the of the joint resistance foundation 
which opposes the pardons told a news conference its not they 
who are serving a life sentence its the victims of the nazis who 
are serving a life term their wounds will remain open forever 
in 1987 a public opinion poll showed two thirds of the dutch 
population opposed releasing the two war criminals 
but theo van lier one of the 19 people who signed the plea for 
release of the two men said since we spent the war fighting for 
the rule of law we should now abide by it ourselves 
since the 1987 death in berlins spandau prison of rudolf hess 
adolf hitlers deputy fischer and aus der fuenten have been the 
only war criminals known to have been detained since world war ii 
former resistance fighters concentration camp inmates and many 
of the 6000 dutch jews who survived the holocaust have repeatedly 
argued against releasing the two men whose death sentences have 
been commuted into life imprisonment 
the netherlands jewish population numbered 150000 before the 
war 
known as the breda two for the southern dutch city where they 
are being jailed fischer and aus der fuenten were arrested by 
allied troops in 1945 and sentenced in 1950 
thanks to the quality of dutch jails they are still in 
excellent health said minco 
last summer a team of prison doctors concluded the breda twos 
physical and mental condition was good enough to warrant continued 
detention 
aus der fuenten a former captain in the nazis elite ss police 
personally oversaw the deportation of dutch jews from amsterdam 
rotterdam and the hague as well as the westerbork concentration 
camp in the northeastern netherlands 
fischer headed the jewish section of the local branch of the nazi 
security service in the hague

bundy that was a major component and i dont know why i was 
vulnerable to it all i know is that it had an impact on me that was 
just so central to the development of the violent behavior that i 
had reached 
dobson ted after you committed your first murder what was the 
emotional effect on you what happened in the days after that 
bundy long pause please understand that even all these years 
later it is very difficult to talk about and reliving through 
talking about it is difficult to say the least but i want you to 
understand what happened it was like coming out of some kind of 
horrible trance or dream i can only liken it to after i dont want 
to overdramatize it but to having been possessed by something so 
awful and so alien then the next morning wake up from it remember 
what happened and realize that basically i mean in the eyes of the 
law and certainly in the eyes of god you were responsible to wake 
up in the morning and realize what i had done and with a clear mind 
and all my essential moral and ethical feelings intact at that 
moment absolutely horrified that i was capable of doing something 
 
dobson you really hadnt known that before 
bundy there is just absolutely no way to describe first the 
brutal urge to do that kind of thing and then what happens is once 
it has been more or less satisfied and recedes you might say or 
spent that energy level recedes and basically i became myself again 
i want people to understand this too and im not saying this 
gratuitously because its important that you understand this but 
basically i was a normal person i wasnt some guy hanging out at 
bars or a bum i wasnt a pevert in the sense that people look at 
somebody and say i know there is something wrong with him you can 
just tell i was essentially a normal person i had good friends i 
led a normal life except for this one small but very potent and 
very destructive segment of it that i kept vey secret and close to 
myself and didnt let anyone know about and part of the shock and 
horror to my dear friends and family years ago when i was first 
arrested was there was no clue they looked at me and they looked at 
the allamerican boy i wasnt perfect but i was ok i was the 
basic humanity and the basic spirit that god gave me was intact but 
unfortunately became overwhelmed at times 
and people need to recognize its not some kind of those of 
us who are or who have been so much influenced by violence in the 
media in particular pornographic violence are not some kind of 
inherent monsters we are your sons and we are your husbands and we 
grew up in regular families and pornography can reach out and 
snatch a kid out of any house today it snatched me out of my home 
20 30 years ago and as dedicated as my parents were and they were 
diligent in protecting their children and as good a christian home 
as we had and we had a wonderful christian home there is no 
protection against the kind of influences that are loose in society 
that tolerates

dobson you feel this really deeply dont you ted outside these 
walls right now there are several hundred reporters who wanted to 
talk to you and you asked me to come here from california because 
you had something to say this hour that we have together is not 
just an interview with a man who is scheduled to die tomorrow 
morning i am here and you are here because of this message that you 
are talking about here you really feel that hardcore pornography 
and the doorway to it softcore pornography is doing untold damage 
to other people and causing other women to be abused and killed the 
way you did others 
bundy listen im no social scientist and i havent done a 
survey i mean i dont pretend that i know what john q citizen 
knows about this but i have lived in prison for a long time now 
and ive met a lot of men who were motivated to violence just like 
me and without exception every one of them was deeply involved in 
pornography without question without exception deeply influenced 
and consumed by an addiction theres no question about it the 
fbis own study on serial homicide shows that the mostcommon 
interest among serial killers is pornography 
dobson thats true ted what would your life have been like 
without that influence you can only speculate 
bundy tears far better not just for me and excuse me for 
being so selfcentered here but it would have been a lot better for 
me and lots of other people and lots of other innocent people 
victims and families it would have been a lot better theres no 
question there would have been a fuller life certainly a life that 
would not have involved i am absolutely certain a life that would 
not have involved this kind of violence 
dobson im sure ted if i were able to ask the questions that 
are being asked out there one of the most important as you come 
down to your final hours are you thinking about those victims out 
there and their families who are so wounded and years later their 
lives have not returned to normal and will not return to normal 
they will never return to normal are you carrying that load that 
weight is there remorse there 
bundy again people will accuse me of being selfserving but i 
am just telling you how i feel through gods help i have been able 
to come to the point where i much too late but better late than 
never feel the hurt and the pain that i am responsible for yes 
absolutely in the past few days myself and a number of 
investigators have been talking about a number of unsolved cases 
murders that i was involved in 
its hard to talk about all these years later because it revives 
in me all those terrible feelings and thoughts that i have 
steadfastly and diligently dealt with and i think successfully and 
yet its reopened that and i felt the pain and i felt the horror and 
i can only hope that those who i have caused so much grief even if 
they dont believe my expression of sorrow will believe what i am 
saying now that there is loose in the towns and their communities 
people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day 
in day out by violence in the media in various forms particularly 
sexual violence and what scares me and its coming to the present 
now because what i am talking about happened 30 20 30 years ago in 
my formative state and what scares me dr dobson when i see 
whats on cable tv some of the movies and some of the violence in 
the movies that comes into homes today the stuff that they wouldnt 
show in xrated adult theaters 30 years ago 
dobson the slasher movies is what youre talking about 
bundy that stuff is im telling you from personal experience 
is the most graphic violence on screen particularly as it gets into 
the home to children who are unattended or unaware that they may be 
a ted bundy who has that vulnerability that predisposition to be 
influenced by that kind of behavior 
there are kids out there switching the tv dial around and come 
upon these movies late at night or i dont know when they are on 
but theyre on and any kid can watch them its scary when i think 
what would have happened to me if i had seen them and its scary 
enough i just ran into stuff outside the home 
but to know that children are watching that kind of thing today 
or can pick up their phone and dial away for it or send away for it

rescuers saved three buried miners tuesday and 
heard faint tapping inside a rundown gold mine where up to 200 men 
were trapped in a cavein officials said 
energy minister jose carrasco said saboteurs set a fire that ate 
through wooden supports and caused mondays collapse but police lt 
juan robles in nazca the southern town near the sol de oro mine 
said the mines operations were extremely disorganized and he 
blamed the collapse on poor maintenance 
carrasco said the tapping indicated that scores of miners might 
still be alive he said the mumber of miners trapped in the mine was 
unknown but ranged from 15 to 200 
robles said three bodies have been recovered so far he estimated 
tuesday that about 100 miners were trapped hours after the cavein 
robles said 150300 miners were trapped 
carrasco met with civil defense officials tuesday after reaching 
nazca 230 miles south of lima he told reporters on his return to 
lima on tuesday evening that two of the rescued men were 
hospitalized and a third was only slightly injured 
officials said fallen earth smoke and poison gas prevented 
rescuers from entering the mine until midday tuesday when special 
teams from state mines and the lima fire department supported by 
air force helicopters reached the site 
most officials had given up hope of finding any survivors 
i have asked for 100 body bags nazca mayor enrique li said 
on radio programas 
the bodies of three men were recovered at the mouth of the mine 
on monday two of them show signs of having died from poison 
gases robles said 
the other miners were believed to be on the second third and 
fourth levels of the mine which is halfway up a 3300foot 
mountain he said 
carrasco told reporters at limas airport that opposing groups of 
miners set the fires during a dispute over territory inside the 
mine but he did not elaborate 
robles said gas lamps set ablaze wooden tunnel supports on the 
second level of the fivelevel mine friday that fire was 
controlled robles said but it flared again saturday and heavy 
smoke overwhelmed miners working inside 
limas la republica newspaper quoted police as saying the miners 
started the fire themselves by setting the supports ablaze for 
better lighting 
officials said it was not known exactly how many men were inside 
the mine because the owners recently abandoned the operation and 
area residents mainly farmers have been working there for extra 
cash 
robles said about 900 men work the mine with picks and shovels 
and that each extracts up to a gram of gold a day worth 10 
officials said rescuers on the scene lack technical expertise and 
equipment mayor li said air compressors were needed urgently to 
clear the mine of fumes 
mining is perus most important industry and accounts for more 
than half of its foreign exchange gold production averages about 
60 million yearly and is the nations fifth leading mineral behind 
copper silver lead and zinc

joel steinbergs lawyer unsuccessfully sought a 
mistrial tuesday after jurors asked if they could infer from 
testimony about steinberg beating his lover that he also beat the 
child he is accused of killing 
the jury deliberated for six hours tuesday without reaching a 
verdict 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax had told the jurors 
during the trial and during his instructions monday that they could 
not draw such an inference 
on tuesday he reread his instruction that the evidence that 
steinberg beat hedda nussbaum was allowed only to show her state of 
mind at the time and to explain why she did not get help for 
6yearold lisa steinberg 
defense lawyer ira london who had objected to the evidence as 
irrelevant and inflammatory asked for a mistrial but was denied 
i told you so he said to reporters outside the courtroom 
he said it was impossible to show jurors the videotape of ms 
nussbaums injuries and her graphic testimony about beatings by 
steinberg without having the jury think the defendant had a 
propensity for violence 
later in the day london said steinberg was encouraged by the 
jurors seeking clarification on several points 
for the first time during deliberations he is feeling more 
optimistic london said of steinberg 
the jury also asked for and was shown three pieces of videotape 
introduced during the trial 
the tapes showed ms nussbaum when she was booked on murder 
charges a policewoman showing the bruises on ms nussbaums body 
and steinbergs knuckles which a policeman testified were cut 
later the jury provided a hint about its deliberations when it 
asked rothwax if it could consider lesser homicide counts against 
steinberg if it was not unanimous on the top count seconddegree 
murder 
rothwax had made clear in his instructions that the jury could 
consider manslaughter charges only if it was unanimous in acquitting 
him of murder and he repeated that tuesday 
the jurors request seemed to indicate division on whether 
steinberg is guilty of murder 
the jurors also asked to hear a definition of circumstantial 
evidence a rereading of what is required to find someone guilty of 
seconddegree murder first and seconddegree manslaughter and 
criminally negligent homicide and the meaning of reasonable doubt 
steinberg is charged in the death of lisa the girl he obtained 
at birth from an unwed long island teenager and raised but never 
legally adopted 
the child was removed comatose from steinbergs apartment on nov 
2 1987 and died of a brain injury three days later 
ms nussbaum 46 a former childrens book editor was the 
prosecutions star witness she testified that steinberg told her in 
bed after they freebased cocaine and while lisa lay comatose on 
their bathroom floor that he had knocked lisa down and she didnt 
want to get up 
after 12 weeks of trial and 52 witnesses the jury on monday 
received the case which had sparked national debate about 
responsibilities to report child abuse 
on monday alternate jurors who were dismissed expressed mixed 
views about ms nussbaums testimony some told reporters they 
believed ms nussbaum testified truthfully others werent sure and 
some thought she was covering up 
dr samuel klagsbrun ms nussbaums psychiatrist said monday 
his patient will interpret any verdict except murder as they 
didnt believe me 
if the jury shows any doubt she feels people will feel she is 
responsible or somehow she participated in the crime and that is a 
hurt that she finds almost unbearable he said 
steinbergs lawyers charge that ms nussbaum fatally beat the 
child in a jealous rage 
the prosecution maintains that ms nussbaum whose murder charges 
were dropped after she agreed to be a prosecution witness was too 
physically and emotionally disabled by 12 years of living with 
steinberg to have harmed lisa

dobson can you help me understand this desensitization process 
that took place what was going on in your mind 
bundy about the desensitization i would describe it in specific 
terms is that each time id harm someone each time i would kill 
someone there would be an enormous amount especially at first an 
enormous amount of horror guilt remorse afterward but then the 
impulse to do it again would come back even stronger now believe 
me i didnt the unique thing about how this worked dr dobson 
is i still felt in my regular life the full range of guilt and 
remorse about other things 
dobson but you had this compartmentalized 
bundy this comparmentalized very well focused very sharply 
focused area that was a black hole that was like a crack and 
everything that fell into that crack hole just disappeared does 
that make sense 
dobson yeah it does one of the final murders that you 
committed of course was apparently little kimberly leach 12 years 
of age i think the public outcry was greater there because an 
innocent child was taken from a playground what did you feel after 
that was there normal emotions three days later where were you 
ted 
bundy i cant really talk about that 
dobson thats too painful 
bundy i would like to be able to convey what that experience is 
like but i cant be able to talk about it 
dobson ok 
bundy i cant begin to understand i can try but im aware that 
i cant begin to understand the pain the parents of these children 
inaudible feel and i cant restore really much to them if 
anything and i wont pretend to and i dont even expect them to 
forgive me and i am not asking for it that kind of forgiveness is 
of god if they have it they have it if they dont maybe theyll 
find it someday 
dobson do you deserve the punishment the state is inflicted upon 
you 
bundy thats a very good question and ill answer it very 
honestly i dont want to die im not going to kid you i kid you 
not i deserve certainly the most extreme punihsment society has 
and i think society deserves to be protected from me and from others 
like me thats for sure i think what i hope will come of our 
discussion is i think society deserves to be protected from itself 
because as weve been talking there are forces loose in this 
country particularly again this kind of violent pornography where 
on the one hand wellmeaning decent people will condemn the behavior 
of a ted bundy while theyre walking past a magazine rack full of 
the very kinds of things that send kids down the road to be a ted 
bundy 
were talking here not just about more what im talking about is 
going beyond retribution which is what people want with me going 
beyond retribution and punishment because there is no way in the 
world that killing me is going to restore those beautiful children 
to their parents and correct and soothe the pain but ill tell you 
there are lots of other kids playing in streets around the country 
today who are going to be dead tomorrow and the next day and the 
next day and the next month because other young people are reading 
the kinds of things and seeing the kinds of things that are 
available when the media took over 
dobson ted as you would imagine there is tremendous cynicism 
about you on the outside and i suppose for good reason im not sure 
there is anything that you could say that people would believe some 
people would believe 
bundy yeah 
dobson and yet you told me last night and i have heard this 
through our mutual friend state attorney john tanner that you 
have accepted the forgiveness of jesus christ and are a follower 
and believer in him do you draw strength from that in these final 
hours 
bundy i do i cant say that being in the valley of shadow 
of death is something that ive become all accustomed to and that i 
am strong and there is nothing bothering me listen it is no fun 
it gets kind of lonely and yet i have to remind myself that every 
one of us will go through this some day in one or another and 
countless millions who have walked this earth before us have so 
this is just an experience which we all share and here i am

theodore bundy who was executed tuesday for 
the murder of a 12yearold schoolgirl once rejected a plea bargain 
that would have imprisoned him for life 
state attorney jerry blair said at the time that bundy ruined any 
chance of avoiding the electric chair by trying to outwit the 
prosecution 
in may 1979 bundy decided to admit his guilt in three florida 
killings on the condition that the prosecution would not recommend 
the death penalty 
blair projected the guilty pleas would have produced a life 
sentence with no chance of parole for at least 75 years 
but plea bargaining broke down when bundy tried unsuccessfully to 
remove public defender michael minerva from the case claiming he 
was trying to coerce bundy into admitting guilt blair said 
he believed bundys bid to drop minerva was part of a scheme to 
have his guilty plea reversed on appeal 
on tuesday state officials were poised to fend off one other 
legal ploy that might have postponed the 706 am execution 
gov bob martinez appointed three psychiatrists to be at the 
prison prior to the execution in case bundys attorney raised the 
claim that he was mentally incompetent to be executed 
defense psychiatrist dorothy lewis of yale university examined 
him and found him competent to be executed

ted bundys execution tuesday ended an ordeal for 
some families of his victims while others found it hard to 
comprehend that a moment they had sought for years had finally 
arrived 
good sighed vivian rancourt mother of bundy victim susan 
rancourt when reached at her laconner home and told of bundys 
earlymorning execution at starke fla 
the only thing i can say is thank god its finally over 
eleanore rose whose daughter denise naslund was slain by 
bundy was taken aback 
i feel kind of numb in a way my daughters murderer was taken 
care of he paid for what he did she said it seems like i was 
sentenced to a lifetime of waiting now theres really nothing to 
wait for 
in grand junction colo the father of a woman believed to have 
been murdered by bundy said he was relieved although investigators 
said bundy did not confess to the slaying 
were just happy hes been executed because it should have 
happened a long time ago said robert nicholson father of denise 
oliverson 
its been a nightmare for 14 years and hes devastated too many 
families and manipulated the justice system into a threering 
circus nicholson said 
in his final hours bundy 42 called his mother louise bundy 
twice at her tacoma home 
he kept saying how sorry he was that there was another part 
of me that people didnt know she said afterward adding that he 
sounded very much at peace with himself 
at the conclusion of the second call she told him youll 
always be my precious son 
in the days before his death bundy ended years of proclaiming 
his innocence and admitted finally to 20 deaths in western states 
including 11 in washington 
he did not own up to the crime he was killed for the 1978 rape 
and murder of a 12yearold lake city fla girl nor to the 
bludgeoning deaths that year of two florida state university 
sorority sisters for which he also was convicted 
his death left more questions still for some 
beverly and donald burr whose 8yearold daughter ann marie 
disappeared from a tacoma home near bundys nearly 30 years ago had 
hoped bundy could have shed light on their mystery bundy was 14 
when the girl disappeared aug 31 1961 
but bundy denied killing the girl said robert keppel a 
washington attorney generals investigator to whom bundy confessed 
the 11 washington killings 
belva kent of bountiful utah said that although she had not 
been told if bundy admitted responsibility for her daughters 
disappearance in the mid1970s im glad its over and thats 
about all 
the mother of shelley robertson 24 of denver who disappeared 
june 30 1975 said she remains opposed to the death penalty 
killing ted bundy wont make me feel better and it wont bring 
back shelley roberta robertson said a lot of people seem to 
want it out of a vengeance but it gives people a false sense of 
security and its terribly expensive 
a psychiatrist who examined bundy as part of a lastditch attempt 
to save him from execution concluded he suffered from a 
manicdepressive illness and that his mental problems likely started 
when he was an infant 
dr dorothy otnow lewis a new haven conn psychiatrist 
interviewed bundy on monday she determined bundy suffered from a 
manicdepressive illness that produced violent mood swings at a 
moments notice bundy could switch from euphoria and compulsive 
talking to anger followed by long periods of sullen silence she 
said 
she said bundy may have had a genetic predisposition to mental 
illness lewis said bundys maternal grandfather would kick dogs 
swing cats by their tails and beat people who angered him she said 
bundys maternal grandmother had been hospitalized more than once 
for psychotic depression and had undergone electroshock therapy 
bundy exhibited bizarre behavior at his grandparents house the 
psychiatrist said at age 3 he appeared several times at the 
bedside of his 15yearold aunt lifting the covers and placing 
butcher knives beside her 
in denver a former public defender who represented bundy when he 
was charged in a killing at aspen colo said he had mixed feelings 
as much as i disliked ted and thought he was a dangerous 
individual i have mixed feelings said attorney chuck leidner 
i do think the justice system stinks if ted bundy had been black 
or hispanic and poor and unattractive he would have been killed 
long ago he drew support because he was white middle class and 
welleducated 
mrs rancourt said hearing that bundy was dead brought relief 
im hoping that this will never be allowed to happen again 
this terrible wait she said we wont have to hear any more 
stories of how he played the system or his escapades 
for ms rose its like i cant believe that im here alive and 
hes dead hes been such a part of my life and existence she 
said choking back tears 
i dont know what its gonna be like not to run to the radio 
and tv and taping this and that and waiting on appeals and being 
disgusted with the judicial system i feel like what am i going to 
be doing 
but she added im glad hes dead

the contras have said hulls ranch was a way station for gun 
smugglers and cocaine traffickers

wideranging conspiracy was behind the bombing

a poaching ring that involved the 
slaughter of more than 400 black bears in the northeast was broken 
tuesday with the arrests of 11 people officials said 
officials said the bears were killed for their gall bladders 
which are prized as aphrodisiacs in the far east 
this is just the tip of this particular iceberg said walter 
bickford commissioner of the massachusetts department of fisheries 
wildlife and environmental law enforcement were aware of 
numerous other operations like this in massachusetts 
the arrests were made in raids that began at 6 am in 
massachusetts connecticut new hampshire and florida wildlife 
officials announced at a news conference 
the raids were the culmination of a 2year investigation that 
tracked approximately 50000 in transactions involving everything 
from endangered species to black bear gall bladders officials 
said game officials from massachusetts connecticut new york and 
us fish and wildlife service participated in the sting 
dozens of pelts including those of a mountain lion and several 
bobcats and gall bladders confiscated in the raids were displayed 
at the news conference 
the officials also showed photographs of 27 bear carcasses piled 
in a meadow in the catskills 
the hides sold illegally in the course of the investigation 
included those of two tigers two polar bears and one arctic fox 
officials said 
bickford said investigators bought at least 360 gall bladders in 
addition to carcasses and skins 
the arresting officers also confiscated boxes of pills that were 
said to contain small amounts of rhinoceros horn also considered an 
aphrodisiac 
this is a primitive superstition said bickford there is 
no proof whatsoever to the claim involving either the bear organs 
or rhinoceros horns he said 
dried powdered black bear gall bladders have a greater street 
value in the far east than heroin or cocaine does in the united 
states bickford said the organs can sell for 540 an ounce or more 
three of the arrested suspects were from massachusetts three 
were from connecticut four from new hampshire and one was arrested 
in florida wildlife officials said more arrests were expected in 
new york and an undetermined number of suspects in other states were 
still at large 
the arrested suspects together face more than 100 counts in their 
states ranging from illegal hunting to practicing taxidermy without 
a license penalties for each count range up to one year in prison 
and 1000 in fines

a 375pound former professional wrestler 
who said he strangled a 105pound woman after she savagely bit him 
during rough sex pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter 
tuesday 
larry finnegan jr 28 of greenwich whose ring name was 
crusher was originally charged with murder in the death last 
june of hazel koppel 20 a homeless woman whom finnegan said he 
paid to have sex with him 
under the plea agreement finnegan will be sentenced to 18 years 
in prison to be suspended after he serves 12 he is scheduled to be 
sentenced march 15 
the prosecution conceded in superior court that finnegans 
version of how koppel died was plausible given the substantial bite 
wound he suffered 
we had the visible effects of a bite mark on his left breast 
that was placed there by the victim for whatever reason assistant 
states attorney bruce hudock said 
we have to give some credibility to the story given by the 
defendant that he was just enraged that she would not let go of his 
chest area hudock said i concluded the jury would most likely 
find him guilty of manslaughter 
finnegan who was working as a truck driver for a moving company 
picked up koppel in stamford early june 6 1988 and was having sex 
with her in the cab of his truck when he killed her according to 
his attorney michael sherman of stamford 
he walked into stamford police headquarters that morning and told 
authorities that her body could be found in his parked truck

a jury on tuesday ordered the death penalty 
for a man convicted of kidnapping an offduty police officer from 
his apartment and shooting him to death 
the jury deliberated two hours before delivering the sentence 
against samuel lee green who was convicted late monday of 
firstdegree murder kidnapping and conspiracy 
the prosecution contended that green kidnapped and killed richard 
bowser after the offduty harrisburg police officer awoke during a 
burglary at his home on oct 22 1987 
green and bonnie sue pflugler who will be tried in february 
were arrested in florida a week after the murder while sleeping in 
the back of a van stolen in north carolina 
first assistant district attorney mark refowich who argued for 
the death penalty said he was pleased 
it was a statement by the jurors that they are sick and 
tired of this kind of senseless killing he said 
green 33 of harrisburg did not testify during the trial and 
would not allow his two lawyers to argue on his behalf during the 
sentencing phase said his attorney ronold karasek 
karasek said green was probably upset and frustrated with the 
firstdegree verdict green will appeal the case he said

ted bundy a charming law school dropout who 
ended years of denials that he was a killer with emotional 
confessions to the gruesome slayings of 23 women in four states was 
electrocuted tuesday for murdering a 12yearold girl 
bundys last words before a blackhooded executioner pulled a 
switch at 706 am sending 2000 volts through his body were to 
his lawyer and a minister give my love to my family and friends 
more than 100 proponents of the death penalty waiting in a field 
across from the florida state prison cheered lit sparklers and set 
off firecrackers at the signal that 42yearold theodore robert 
bundy had finally been put to death for a crime committed almost 11 
years ago three earlier execution dates were stymied by appeals 
burn bundy burn some shouted a group of about a dozen 
people parodied an old tune by singing on top of old sparky a 
reference to the nickname for floridas oaken threelegged electric 
chair 
only about two dozen people opposed to the death penalty turned 
up to keep a vigil in the field 
the people of florida today administered justice gov bob 
martinez said 1 hours after the execution if theres ever been 
anyone on floridas death row that deserved the electric chair ted 
bundy was that individual 
bundy had been quickwitted known for his cockiness and 
arrogance a handsome blueeyed charmer he was the subject of five 
books and a television miniseries the deliberate stranger 
but he recently claimed to feel gods presence and was 
reported at the end to be remorseful about his bloody trail of 
kidnappings sadistic sexual mutilations and slayings in his home 
state of washington and in utah colorado idaho and florida 
in an interview with religious broadcaster and psychologist james 
dobson hours before his execution bundy said his home life had been 
normal but early experiences with pornography had crystallized 
violent tendencies within him later alcohol reduced his 
inhibitions and he acted on those tendencies he said 
the most damaging kinds of pornography and again here im 
talking from personal experience hard real personal experience 
are those that involve violence and sexual violence bundy said 
he then issued a warning 
there is loose in their towns their communities people like 
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in and day 
out by violence in the media in its various forms particularly 
sexual violence bundy said 
in the last days of his life bundy slowly deliberately 
described his crimes in detail said russ reneau chief investigator 
for idaho attorney general jim jones reneau said bundy told how he 
made an overnight trip from salt lake city to pocatello idaho he 
said he was here for a specific purpose and that was to commit a 
murder he said 
but when asked why he killed reneau said bundy answered only 
obliquely when we asked him why he made that trip to pocatello he 
said it was because of the madness he did not elaborate on that 
his execution for the murder of sixthgrader kimberly diane 
leach of lake city made him the 20th man put to death in florida 
and the 106th in the united states since the us supreme court 
allowed states to reinstate the death penalty in 1976 
kimberly was kidnapped from the grounds of her junior high school 
feb 9 1978 just three weeks after the killings of two women at 
chi omega sorority at florida state university the childs body was 
found three months later in an abandoned pigsty bundy was also 
under a death sentence for the two chi omega murders 
until near the end he had insisted he was innocent although he 
had been suspected of as many as 36 killings and disappearances 
then late last week he began talking to investigators from the four 
western states closing the books on unsolved crimes including some 
in which he had not been a suspect 
the number of confessions was originally put at 20 but robert 
keppel a washington state attorney generals investigator said 
tuesday that bundy also admitted to killing a young hitchhiker near 
olympia in 1973 and two other women in washington whom bundy did not 
identify give times of death or say where the bodies were left 
shortly after the execution vivian rancourt of laconner wash 
mother of bundy victim susan rancourt sighed good the only 
thing i can say is thank god its finally over 
one of bundys final acts was to permit james dobson a 
california psychologist and host of a syndicated radio show to 
videotape an interview to be broadcast later dobson described bundy 
as feeling great remorse he quoted bundy saying his crimes 
should serve as a warning to the dangers of pornography 
bundy appeared frightened when he was escorted into the death 
chamber but he moved easily to the chair nodding to his attorney 
james coleman and gainesville minister fred lawrence who had 
counseled him earlier 
jim and fred id like you to give my love to my family and 
friends he said in a strong voice that trailed off at the end 
he was calm but visibly shaken said state rep randy mackey 
of lake city an official witness 
bundy stared straight ahead and his jaw tightened when workers 
adjusted a chin strap and fitted a hood over his shaven head when 
the switch was thrown by the anonymous executioner who is paid 150 
for the job bundys body surged back against the chair his fists 
clenched 
a doctor pronounced him dead at 716 am est 
gene williams owner of the williamsthomas funeral home said he 
accepted custody of the body but would not give any details on 
arrangements including whether there would be burial or cremation 
but he said no funeral was planned 
eleven years is too long said mackey referring to legal 
maneuvers that kept the execution in doubt virtually until the last 
minute 
the execution came a week to the day after the us supreme court 
denied an appeal in the leach case the days following were filled 
with a round of appeals by bundy lawyers the us supreme court 
voted 54 late monday against another stay 
john tanner a prosecutor who arranged for bundys confessions 
with investigators from the four western states said bundy had not 
finished telling the names and locations of bodies he just ran 
out of time 
the governor had insisted that bundy would not be allowed to use 
a protracted litany of confessions to delay his execution a fourth 
time 
you dont negotiate with a killer said martinez adding that 
bundy had had plenty of time in which to talk if he had wanted to 
conspicuously absent among the detectives lawyers friends and 
advisers visiting bundy in prison was the woman he married during 
the leach trial in orlando in 1980 the former carole boone 
she often visited bundy but prison records do not list a visit 
for the past two years however her son from a previous marriage 
james now in his 20s visited sunday 
among the official witnesses was kenneth robinson a highway 
patrol trooper who found the girls body 
i thought back and i felt like justice has been done 
robinson said but i wonder if he went through as much suffering 
as she did

a united nations envoy on tuesday sought 
to get iraniraq peace talks moving again by meeting with iranian 
leaders in tehran another planeload of iranian pows arrived from 
iraq 
the 124 ailing and disabled iranian prisoners of war were 
released unilaterally by baghdad in what iraqi president saddam 
hussein called a humanitarian gesture and was the second group 
to be repatriated in as many days 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said jan eliasson special 
envoy for un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar met with 
deputy foreign minister mohammad hussein lavasani and discussed ways 
to end the impasse 
iran and iraq ended eight years of fighting aug 20 under a un 
security council ceasefire resolution 
the resolution calls on the nations to halt all military 
activities withdraw troops to prewar borders exchange about 
100000 prisoners of war and start peace talks 
iraq occupies 259 square miles of iranian territory baghdad says 
it will not pull out unless iran gives up its right under 
international law until a peace treaty is signed to search ships 
in the persian gulf for iraqbound war cargo 
iran has not stopped iraqi ships since the ceasefire and 
insists that troop withdrawals must come next in the peace process 
tehran radio said eliassons trip is primarily for setting a 
date for the resumption of the peace talks iran however will 
not resume negotiations without a guarantee there will be progress 
according to the report 
the peace talks became snarled almost as soon as they began five 
days after the ceasefire took effect three rounds of negotiations 
since then have failed to break the deadlock 
the secretary general is determined that the various points of 
the resolution be implemented as soon as possible tehran 
television quoted eliasson as saying on his arrival monday night 
the television monitored in nicosia reported eliasson as saying 
he also plans to inspect the iraniraq border during his visit 
eliasson also swedens un ambassador is due in baghdad friday 
if there is no progress in future talks perez de cuellar still 
would be bound by the un security council to carry out provisions 
of the ceasefire resolution tehran radio said 
tehrans kayhan daily monday called for punitive measures to 
ensure progress and suggested a deadline be set for implementing the 
resolution the islamic republic news agency reported 
the official agency monitored in nicosia reported the newspaper 
as saying such measures should include a political and economic 
international boycott of iraq which can easily force baghdad to 
adopt a reasonable attitude towards the talks

comprehensive implementation of the resolution in sequential 
order 
tuesdays return of iranian prisoners of war followed the release 
of 131 on monday both groups were flown to tehran in an airliner 
chartered by the international committee of the red cross 
there was no indication tehran would respond to the iraqi moves 
the first prisoner releases since a red crosssponsored exchange 
broke down nov 27 because of a dispute over the number of prisoners 
to be freed 
before the exchange was halted 155 iraqis and 56 iranians were 
freed 
the red cross has registered 50182 iraqi prisoners held by iran 
and 19284 iranians by iraq the united nations and other officials 
say the nations together could hold as many as 100000 prisoners

former iranian prime minister mehdi 
bazargan says he plans to build his tiny opposition party into a 
national movement to challenge ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
hierarchy irans official news agency reported tuesday 
in his first interview in seven years bazargan told the tehran 
times newspaper that his freedom movement will field a candidate in 
augusts presidential election if political conditions are 
favorable the islamic republic news agency reported 
giving a public platform to bazargan the first prime minister of 
the islamic republic after the 1979 revolution underlined moves by 
iranian leaders to ease political restrictions after the august 
ceasefire in the eightyear war with iraq 
irna monitored in nicosia said in a separate report that 
khomeinis designated successor ayatollah husseinali montazeri 
told interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi tuesday there must be 
no delays in implementing a new law permitting opposition 
parties 
with the new law the people will really feel that they 
have a bigger role in the decisionmaking process and will see 
themselves in the center of the revolution and partners in it 
montazeri said 
irna quoted bazargan as telling the englishlanguage newspaper 
we will organize the party at all levels throughout the country so 
that we can present our plans to the people who will give their 
verdict 
if that verdict is in our favor we will naturally have the 
right to form a government the 81yearold political veteran 
said in the interview which was also reprinted by farsilanguage 
dailies 
his moderate freedom movement which frequently demanded that 
khomeini end the war is one of 28 groups that have applied to 
register as political parties 
the government announced dec 31 it will allow political 
organizations provided they do not conspire against the state 
since khomeini abolished the ruling islamic republic party two 
years ago as unnecessary the freedom movement has been the only 
recognized opposition faction in iran the rest were systematically 
eliminated in bloody purges in 1981 
there are no official parties within the hierarchy but factions 
that revolve around leading figures operate like parties 
khomeinis regime apparently hopes that giving moderate opponents 
a voice will isolate more extremist factions but the new political 
framework will be tightly controlled and many iranians are 
skeptical about how effective it will be 
there are indications that any new parties may be approved in 
time to take part in planned summer elections for rural city and 
provincial legislative councils totaling 300000 seats 
khomeini named bazargan a frencheducated engineer who was 
jailed by shah mohammad reza pahlavi prime minister feb23 1979 a 
few days after the revolutionaries took power 
but bazargans moderate policies seeking gradual social and 
economic reforms rather than the radical extremes of the 
revolutionaries ran foul of the fundamentalists 
accused by his opponents of being proamerican he resigned two 
days after militants stormed the us embassy in tehran on nov 4 
1979

a state board tuesday granted an expedited 
parole review to the man whose conviction in the 1976 fatal shooting 
of a dallas policeman was questioned in the film the thin blue 
line 
randall dale adams 40 who is serving a life sentence has been 
denied parole eight times most recently on jan 10 according to 
state records 
his next parole review was scheduled for december but under 
tuesdays action the texas board of pardons and paroles will 
consider adams appeal for parole soon said glenn t heckmann the 
boards executive director 
i would speculate it would be within the next 30 days normally 
decisions about whether to grant parole are made shortly after 
review he said 
the board expedited adams parole request based on information 
provided by state district judge larry baraka said karen armstrong 
an information officer with the board 
in a hearing last month baraka ruled adams did not receive a 
fair trial in 1977 and recommended he be granted a new one or set 
free 
during the december hearing the key witness against adams 
changed his story and testified that adams didnt commit the murder 
and wasnt even in the car police officer robert wood stopped just 
before he was gunned down but david ray harris now on death row 
for another killing stopped short of saying he pulled the trigger 
himself in woods slaying 
adams has maintained his innocence and contends prosecutors 
wanted to convict him rather than harris who was only 16 at the 
time because if convicted as a juvenile harris would have been 
released at age 18 
the case was the subject of errol morris documentary movie the 
thin blue line which questioned adams guilt 
adams has served more than 12 years in state prison in 1980 his 
death sentence was commuted to life 
barakas recommendation that adams be given a new trial or set 
free is before the texas court of criminal appeals which could take 
as long as two years to act on it attorneys say 
earlier baraka had said he would write to the sixmember board 
asking that adams be granted parole 
listening to the evidence theres reasonable evidence to 
believe the mans not guilty or didnt get a fair trial baraka 
said

armed civilians surrendered to the 
army tuesday after a oneday assault on an infantry base in which at 
least 36 people were killed and scores wounded the government said 
anyone there participated in a shocking spectacle president 
raul alfonsin said after visiting the camp it was a nightmare 
death once again death brutality barbarism 
alfonsin said the commandos were ultraleftists citing 
documents seized by soldiers after the camp was recaptured he said 
fighting political subversion is the last test of my government 
this is my fight and ill fight it to the finish so society is 
free of this aggression a somber alfonsin said at government 
house in a 12minute address to the cabinet military chiefs and a 
nationwide broadcast audience 
society wont tolerate more violence from whatever side he 
said 
alfonsin who also has had to cope with three insurrections by 
rightist army officers in the past 21 months said he would form a 
national security council to advise him on antisubversion strategy 
he did not elaborate 
alfonsin said 28 commandos were killed and 14 captured alive as 
government forces recaptured the 3rd infantry regiment base in la 
tablada on the outskirts of buenos aires which the commandos 
attacked monday morning 
seven soldiers and one policeman were killed and 67 soldiers and 
policemen were wounded four civilians were wounded 
troopers on tuesday tracked down snipers and searched bunkers at 
the camp captured weapons included sophisticated machine guns from 
the soviet union and china military officials said 
alfonsin toured the base in the afternoon looking closely at the 
charred bodies and buildings blasted by tanks and mortars soldiers 
were still exchanging gunfire with snipers in moppingup operations 
but no fire was aimed at alfonsin or his helicopter 
as dusk approached small fires still smoldered in gutted brick 
buildings half a dozen buildings were in ruins their windows blown 
out and tile roofs collapsed or burned away 
helicopter gunships clattered over the base and a seedy sprawl of 
project houses across the highway 
military and government officials said the attackers apparently 
intended to steal weapons from the camp armory 
reporters counted 15 bodies five blackened or mutilated by 
explosions or fire at least one was a soldier and two were women 
the identities and motive of the attackers were not known army 
officers said some were foreigners the government news agency telam 
reported without elaboration 
surely the objective was to take weapons and flee but the 
rapid action of the police and the armed forces made flight 
something they could not achieve said antonio berhongaray 
chairman of the senate defense committee and member of alfonsins 
radical civic union party 
cesar jaroslavsky radical civic union leader in the house of 
deputies said at least some in the raiders belonged to the peoples 
revolutionary army a leftist guerrilla group active in the 1970s 
confiscated pamphlets indicated the attackers called themselves 
the popular resistance front said jose ignacio lopez 
presidential press secretary he said other pamphlets indicated the 
group felt a military coup was imminent and wanted to prevent it 
gen walter jurado the buenos aires police chief said the 
captured attackers are believed linked to the leftist peoples 
revolutionary army 
the assault began about 630 am monday shooting continued more 
than 27 hours later when 13 men and a woman with their arms raised 
in surrender emerged from the shell of a building that had been 
blasted by tanks the day before 
all reports indicated four of the 14 were soldiers who had been 
held captive 
graciela marino a resident of the workingclass neighborhood 
around the base said bombs and shooting awakened the 
neighborhood monday morning and had continued since 
the suddenness and ferocity of the attack caught the government 
and armed forces off guard which could cause problems for 
alfonsins party in elections scheduled for may 14 
this isnt the best moment to start attributing blame but it 
surprises us that an operation of this size was not detected by the 
intelligence services even though were dealing with commando 
groups that are very well organized said sen eduardo menem of 
the opposition peronist party 
alfonsins elected civilian government took office in 1983 after 
nearly eight years of military rule

mayor henry cisneros reaffirmed tuesday his 
decision not seek a fifth term after key supporters said they would 
back the campaign of his opponent even if he sought reelection 
in a statement released by his office cisneros said he 
appreciated the encouragement of some supporters but was standing 
by his september announcement that he would not seek reelection in 
order to devote time to straightening out personal matters 
the 41yearold mayor had said sunday that he might reconsider 
his decision but said he would first speak with former mayor lila 
cockrell who is running again after he returned from speaking 
engagements in massachusetts 
he was scheduled to return tuesday afternoon but missed a flight 
and relied on his office to deliver the statement 
in september i said i would not seek reelection cisneros 
said in the statement when i made that declaration i in effect 
gave my word i stand by it my name will not be on the city 
election ballot in may 
when he announced last september that he would not seek office 
mrs cockrell said she would enter the race she already has raised 
about 40000 and has commitments from cisneros supporters 
certainly the part that i least desired was the role that i 
think i would have had to run against a good friend but i would 
have felt a responsibility to remain in the race mrs cockrell 
said after hearing of cisneros decision tuesday 
cisneros had said in december 1987 that he would not seek a 
statewide office and last september said he would not seek a fifth 
mayoral term because he wanted to devote time to his ill son john 
paul anthony who was born with a heart defect and stomach 
abnormalities 
a month later published reports linked cisneros in a romantic 
relationship with former fundraiser linda medlar 
cisneros said then he wanted time to straighten out his private 
life he later said he has not been able to do so because of long 
hours he put in during the campaign that resulted in voters saturday 
approving a halfcent sales tax tax increase to pay for a 174 
million 65000seat domed stadium

environmental groups can sue the government 
to try to stop logging of oldgrowth fir near spotted owl nests in 
western oregon a federal appeals court ruled tuesday 
the environmentalists lawsuit had been dismissed by a federal 
judge in portland but the 30 ruling on tuesday by the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals also lifted an appeals courts ban on new 
sales of oldgrowth timber near spotted owl sites 
both sides claimed victory 
we feel that that was a significant victory for the timber 
associations said industry lawyer mark rutzick he said the most 
important part of tuesdays ruling was the decision to lift the 
injunction and let the bureau of land management resume full timber 
sales pending some future decision by the district court in 
portland 
but attorney victor sher of the sierra club legal defense fund 
said the courts action does not give the industry what it wanted 
authority to allow sales to go forward unchallenged 
what they the court said is we are entitled to challenge 
those sales on a casebycase basis as they arise now and that the 
district court in oregon has to hear our case sher said we 
certainly intend to proceed to protect these critical areas 
the environmentalists suit had been dismissed by a federal judge 
in portland 
while removing the ban it imposed last june on new sales of 
oldgrowth fir within 21 miles of a spotted owl site the court 
said environmental groups could ask us district judge helen frye 
in portland to forbid specific sales as they were proposed the 
groups would have to show a likelihood of proving that a threat to 
the owl habitat violated federal law the court said 
the timber industry blamed the courts previous order for 
shutdowns of five lumber and plywood mills and reductions by nine 
others since sept 1 leading to the loss of 1000 jobs 
sher said those claims were based on false and irresponsible 
statements he said many of the mills were not authorized to buy 
timber from blm lands or had not bought any in 10 years 
the spotted owl which lives in northern california oregon and 
washington is not listed as an endangered species under federal 
law although sher said a federal judge has ordered the fish and 
wildlife service to reassess the birds status by may 1 
environmental groups regard the spotted owl as an indicator 
species whose reduction foreshadows a threat to other forms of 
life there are 289 spotted owl sites within the timber sale area on 
the western slope of the cascades sher said the suit contends 
logging of oldgrowth timber would kill the birds by destroying 
their habitat

hundreds of ixil indians ignoring 
leftist guerrillas warnings that the guatemalan army would kill them 
if they left their mountain refuge are coming down from the cold 
misty heights and settling in around an army garrison town 
in the mountains there are no clothes no medicines no salt 
no nothing said benito perez 22 who came down with his mother 
in october after seven years in the rebelpatrolled mountains 
the guerrillas tell us the army will kill us torture us if we 
come down but word has reached those parts that it is not like that 
now 
the guerrillas have been battling military and militarydominated 
guatemalan governments for a quartercentury the northern area of 
quiche province about 70 miles northwest of guatemala city was one 
of their bastions in the early 1980s 
government forces mounted a counterinsurgency campaign that has 
reduced guerrilla activity to isolated and circumscribed zones 
the campaign was heavily criticized by human rights activists who 
blamed the army for the massacre of tens of thousands of indians 
throughout northern and western guatemala 
the army sweeps and aerial bombardment drove thousands of ixils 
out of their homes and into the heights north of nebaj 
now they are trickling back 
they suffer hunger and sickness in the mountains said alba 
mendez psychologist for the governmentlicensed special commission 
for refugees and the displaced or ceard as it is known by its 
initials in spanish 
the human rights organization americas watch said in november 
that most of the 1700 or so indians who reached nebaj in the first 
six months of 1988 were captured by government troops during 
offensives and forcibly removed 
but indians continue to come down from the mountains albeit at a 
slower pace even though the armed forces have not carried out 
largescale operations north of nebaj in recent months 
miss mendez said an average of about 40 ixils have arrived each 
month since september she said virtually all of them came 
voluntarily 
relief officials say about 4500 ixils have come out of the 
mountains since 1987 and that several thousand probably remain in 
the highlands 
jacinto de paz who abandoned the hills with his wife and three 
children late last year said he was a guerrilla political officer 
who helped administer rebelcontrolled hamlets 
they the guerrillas have told everyone the army killed me 
he said but as you can see i am not dead politically they are 
losing strength so they tell a lot of lies but the situation has 
changed that is why were here 
new arrivals are held at the army garrison for several days with 
fightingage men debriefed by intelligence officers they are then 
transferred to the xemamatze camp about a mile outside nebaj 
some human rights groups have described xemamatze as a 
concentration camp but a recent visitor saw no wire or fence around 
it refugees must check in and out at the gate but otherwise are 
free to enter and leave 
in the camp women in distinctive red skirts and multicolored 
huipil blouses cook food and tend children in front of wooden 
tinroofed shelters that border a courtyard that doubles as a soccer 
field 
about 80 people were at xemamatze in early january in mid1988 
as many as 580 people were housed there ceard officals said 
officials at ceard said the united nations high commission for 
refugees pays for food blankets and clothes distributed at the camp 
the displaced spend between one and three months at the camp 
attending reeducation classes they are taught guatemalas national 
anthem and indoctrinated with the idea that communism is evil 
from xemamatze they return to their old hamlets or take up 
residence in one of the surrounding villages established by the army 
and government 
the villages are made up of rows or clusters of woodenwalled 
metalroofed oneroom dwellings with dirt floors but they have 
electricity and communal potable water and are by most accounts an 
improvement on the sometimes nomadic life in the mountains 
doctors and nurses from international relief organizations visit 
the settlements whose inhabitants also have access to a modern 
clinic in nebaj 
in addition to providing homes for the displaced the villages 
are a means by which the military maintains control over a 
population that in the past demonstrated guerrilla sympathies 
men aged 16 to 60 participate in civil defense patrols designed 
to inhibit guerrilla movement 
the villages are administered by locally elected councils that 
work closely with army authorities 
this war has become one of attention paid to people of human 
relations said capt carlos rodriguez of the nebaj garrison 
people realize there has been a change in the way the army acts 
now we concentrate on psychological operations we offer a hand to 
those who come down from the mountains and to the subversives who 
realize their error we reserve the iron fist only for the 
intransigents

the death of emperor hirohito has brought a wave of 
questions about japans monarchical system and its religious 
connections from scholars politicians and the public 
the main questions deal with hirohitos role in world war ii and 
the separation of religion and state the latter because the 
monarchy is seen by some as a link between the two 
the religion question is especially touchy as japan prepares to 
bury hirohito and formally enthrone his son emperor akihito 
some public figures have received death threats allegedly from 
rightists after making critical statements about the monarchy or 
the shintoism which once was the state religion they included 
mayor hitoshi motoshim of atombombed nagasaki and makato mori 
president of meiji gakuin university which did not issue a 
condolence statement after hirohitos death 
takako doi a member of the diet parliament and chairwoman of 
the japan socialist party was featured on newspaper front pages 
after saying hirohito as supreme military commander bore some 
responsibility for the war 
recent criticisms in overseas mass media have been very 
severe she said in response to a question about hirohitos 
wartime role the japanese people must accept these very 
modestly 
until the end of world war ii in 1945 hirohito was worshiped by 
the japanese as a divinity critics say any government connection 
with shinto rites for hirohitos funeral and for ceremonies 
involving the ascension of akihito to the throne could augur a 
return to the era of a state religion and religious oppression 
the government is violating the constitution which stipulates 
a separation of state and religion said takeshi kobayashi 
professor of constitutional law at nanzai university in nagoya 
akihito 55 immediately succeeded to the throne upon his 
fathers death but he still is expected to perform a series of 
ascension rites that the government defends as ceremonies permitted 
under the constitution 
kobayashi maintained that by funding and attending religious 
rites government leaders signal support for shinto which preached 
nationalism and devotion to a godemperor during japans fascist 
period 
prime minister noboru takeshita has said he would attend a 
religious ceremony at the start of the state funeral feb 24 
president bush will come to japan for the funeral but it is not 
known which aspects of it he and other foreign dignitaries will 
attend 
but about 100 foreign dignitaries are expected to attend the 
sojodennogi a shinto ceremony sponsored by the imperial 
palace one foreign ministry official said the rite will be stripped 
of its religious trappings 
members of takeshitas liberal democratic party are also 
preparing to hold the daijosai or the great food offering 
ritual as a state affair for akihito in november 1990 according to 
news reports 
the daijosai the last of three enthronement rites is based on 
ancient myths resurrected in the midmeiji period 18681912 by a 
government intent on forming a state faith 
like his father and grandfather akihito would share sacred rice 
and wine in a communion with the sungoddess ameratasu and other 
ancestral spirits and then receive the spirit of the late emperor 
critics say this rite is the base of the old idea that the emperor 
was divine 
koichi yokota a kyushu university professor who specializes in 
constitutional law charges that by sponsoring such rites the 
government is attempting to blur the role of the emperor as only a 
symbol of the nation as mandated by the 1947 consititution drafted 
by us occupation officials 
the term symbol in japanese is vague and can imply whatever 
is convenient yokota said in a roundtable discussion sponsored 
by the asahi shimbun a leading daily 
masanori nakamura hitotsubashi university professor of economic 
history contends that conservative politicians favor a new 
nationalism with the emperor playing an important part of it 
while they may get the people to love family and love 
society they wont be able to link it up to the patriotism of 
prewar and wartime japan nakamura said at another meeting 
hirohito died without clarifying where he stood when japan 
declared war 
if the emperor was able to end the war then he could have done 
something to prevent it charged takako sodei professor at 
ochanomizu womens university

academy awardwinner haing ngor appears sunday 
in a halfhour documentary called beyond the killing fields that 
he hopes will wake up the world to the plight of cambodian 
refugees 
the documentary shows the work im doing and is about the 
suffering of the people at the border he said we must wake up 
the world why has the world forgotten cambodia and especially its 
children 
before the killing fields no one knew what happened in 
cambodia the khmer rouge killed 4 million people if vietnam pulls 
out and the khmer rouge return they may kill the rest of the 
people 
ngor who won the oscar as best supporting actor for the 
killing fields in 1984 appears in a segment of national 
geographic explorer this sunday on superstation tbs 
he has been devoting most of his spare time and money from his 
acting career to helping the many thousands of cambodian refugees 
driven from their own country and forced by international policies 
to stay in the camps in thailand he works through two groups he has 
organized aid to displaced persons and enfant dangkor 
my main goal is to build a hospital to help the refugees he 
said right now thats hard because of the thailand government 
they talk but we havent seen a green light the money is there 
from contributions raised in europe 
the khmer rouge is the chinesebacked communist faction that 
overthrew the republic in 1975 the sovietbacked vietnamese pushed 
the khmer rouge out in 1979 but now the vietnamese are considering 
a pullout ngor said he estimates the population was 75 million to 
8 million in 1970 he believes between 700000 and 1 million died 
between 1970 and 1975 
during the reign of the khmer rouge ngor said his personal 
estimate is that 4 million cambodians were killed the international 
red cross places the number of deaths at 2 million 
the communists never think of civil rights he said if 
they want to kill they kill the khmer rouge want to create a 
utopian society mostly they want power all the power the 
killing fields told the story of one family that got out but what 
about the millions more who didnt get out almost my whole family 
was killed by the khmer rouge 
ngor a small intense bespectacled man lost his parents his 
brothers and sisters and his girlfriend he had been a physician and 
suffered intense and crippling torture at the hands of the khmer 
rouge 
my life is like skin of teeth he said the killing 
fields just touched the tip of the iceberg the real story is much 
worse 
he won the oscar for playing dith pran in the killing fields 
he plays a north vietnamese army captain in the iron triangle 
which stars beau bridges he recently began work in orange 
curtain a movie about vietnamese in this country 
he also will play himself in a movie based on his autobiography 
free at last and will star in another film called the other 
war 
ngor said he needs the worlds support to keep the khmer rouge 
from returning to power 
i dont want history to be repeated he said my people 
innocent people will pay the price the khmer rouge have already 
killed 95 percent of the educated people of cambodia most of those 
at the border are orphaned children they are the next generation of 
cambodians 
i was happy when the national geographic people came to me i 
am happy that we can show the world what happened to my country the 
war is not yet over the killings are not over yet

sharp disparities in local real estate prices 
between abutting communities and neighborhoods within them 
eventually become muted by financial pressures such as those that 
exist today 
and the stage is being set once again for major shifts of the 
same sort on the national scene that is from state to state and 
city to city should it occur it probably will be for the same 
reasons dictating the local moves 
in this metropolitan area for example hoboken and other 
lowerpriced new jersey communities that once seemed beyond 
consideration by builders are in smart buyers and renters 
flock there to get a view of new yorks skyline 
the once dilapitated times square area and midtowns neglected 
west side are being rebuilt and no doubt will attract people who 
once would live nowhere but in greenwich village or the upper west 
side harlem may be next 
the process has occurred in almost every city in america as 
financial factors overcome prejudice bargains become too great to 
decline factors such as cultural reputation and social 
acceptability give way not just to price but to an appreciation of 
natural beauty and convenience what was out becomes in 
enormous disparities in housing costs now suggest that some of 
those same factors will be working on the national scene as well 
consider for example that payments on the average 
conventionally financed st louis dwelling require 182 percent of 
income compared with 355 percent in the new york area and you see 
why individuals and industry must take notice 
lomas mortgage usa which produced these figures from its 
continuing study of real estate markets offers this breakdown 
st louis household income 46900 new home price 103400 
monthly payment 79695 percentage of income required 204 percent 
existing home price 93500 monthly payment 67559 percentage of 
income 173 
new york city area household income 48000 new home price 
167500 monthly payment 134072 percentage of income needed 
335 percent existing home price 135400 monthly payment 
109376 percentage of income 273 
in a special report to subscribers of lomas us housing 
markets the 10 least affordable metropolitan areas were listed as 
new york sa diego los angeles boston san francisco bay 
washington philadelphia atlanta baltimore seattletacoma all 
were near either the east or west coast 
in contrast the 10 most affordable areas were st louis 
cleveland miamifort lauderdale tampa kansas city indianapolis 
portland ore greensboro sc detroitann arbor and salt lake 
city 
a critical factor in evaluating the disparity in these figures is 
the financial pressure placed on young households today many 
require two incomes savings rates are down but down payments are 
up 
the price of housing therefore becomes a vital factor in 
maintaining lifestyle and eventually may be the determining factor 
even beyond employment in making a move it is a pattern that 
industry cannot ignore 
paul low lomas mortgage president points to national figures in 
making the point 
he observes that while the us average household income rose 
from 35500 in 1984 to 43000 in 1988 the selling price of the 
average conventional financed dwelling soared to 130800 from 
83100 
household income advanced 21 percent in the fouryear period the 
average home price ran up 574 percent producing a situation that 
makes homeownership much more difficult than it was in 1977 
in that year says low more than half the nations firsttime 
homebuyers were able to make at least a 20 percent down payment but 
10 years later though median household income had nearly doubled 
less than onethird of firsttimers were able to put 20 percent down

the first and only time bill griggs saw 
buddy holly perform he didnt know the bespectacled youth with a 
texas twang was the lead singer for his favorite band the crickets 
because holly released songs under his own name as well 
i hate to admit that now said griggs who has devoted his 
life since that 1958 show to keeping alive the legend of holly and 
other innovators of rock n roll 
as the president and founder of the buddy holly memorial society 
he is one of the leading experts on hollys life and music and owns 
an extensive collection of holly memorabilia he started a fan club 
14 years ago so that the memory of his idol would not fade away 
i was no longer seeing buddy holly in the media no longer 
hearing his music on the radio he said i just thought he had 
been forgotten after 1959 
the organization had more than 400 members after its first year 
and now has almost 5400 members from 31 countries who gather yearly 
to share memories and swap memorabilia 
its not so much a fan club as a research organization 
griggs said were trying to find out as much as we can about the 
man and his music ive interviewed just about everybody that i know 
of that knew him or worked with him 
the results of griggs research efforts almost fill two rooms of 
his home records posters photos and sheet music from holly and 
other 1950s rockers are stacked on tables and pinned to walls 
a glass case is reserved for griggs most cherished memorabilia 
a pair of hollys famous hornrimmed glasses a suit jacket a pair 
of his black oxfords a broken guitar string and even a guitar pick 
used by actor gary busey in the buddy holly story 
one of griggs most recent acquisitions is hollys toilet kit 
carried with him on the night 30 years ago when the plane carrying 
holly jp the big bopper richardson and ritchie valens crashed 
near clear lake iowa 
inside the brown leather bag is toothpaste a comb and brush 
suntan lotion hair gel and other personal items covered with the 
dust and grime of 1959 
this is very personal he said with awe its the last 
thing he had in his hands griggs declined to say how he obtained 
it 
the reverence with which griggs handles hollys belongings was 
strong enough to draw him and his family to lubbock from his home in 
wethersfield conn in 1980 after having visited here for several 
years 
it was buddy holly that brought us here in the first place and 
why we decided to move said griggs adding that he since has 
grown close to hollys remaining relatives the singers mother two 
brothers and a sister still live here 
im like family to them now and thats a very good feeling 
so strong is griggs attachment to the rock n roll era that the 
former k mart manager now makes a living running a mailorder 50s 
memorabilia business 
nostalgias become big he said people that lived through 
the era want to remember it those that didnt feel cheated and 
they want to know why their parents are so high on the 50s and why 
theyre hearing all these 50s songs on tv and radio commercials 
griggs 47 whose slicked back hair is reminiscent of the era he 
loves says the time between 1955 and the assassination of president 
kennedy in 1963 was a simpler more wholesome time 
we werent at war the kids didnt have a drug problem we 
werent burning draft cards we went to college to learn not to 
protest he said a few guys had greased hair and leather 
jackets and thats about as bad as it got 
todays world isnt so nice he says and contemporary music is 
just one symptom of what ails the 80s im really down on todays 
music it all sounds the same 
now buddy holly that was rock n roll 
buddy never copied himself griggs said he was never 
afraid to experiment and this is a 22yearold kid were talking 
about buddy was the first white rock n roll performer to use a 
full orchestra and strings and was one of the first to overdub his 
voice 
appreciation for hollys contribution to rock has steadily grown 
since the release of the movie about his life in 1978 and several 
recent biographies 
as hollys no 1 fan griggs feels a sense of accomplishment 
he wont be forgotten now he said i still think that what 
he did in 18 months is amazing compared to what elvis presley did in 
27 years and what the beatles did in nine years 
he left this 18month legacy of great music thats as fresh 
today as it was then

maria elena holly spends much of her time 
hunched over a paperpiled desk in her home trying to make buddy 
hollys dreams come true 
the legendary singer songwriter and musician who with his own 
blend of rock n roll and country influenced the beatles the 
rolling stones and many others dreamed that he would inspire young 
musicians and pave their way in the industry his widow said 
if buddy were still alive i think that he would be involved in 
every facet of the music industry she said 
although she has tried to realize that dream through a buddy 
holly scholarship fund preferably at texas tech university in 
hollys hometown of lubbock or through a festival there each 
attempt has failed 
three decades after holly was killed in a plane crash his widow 
pursues his dreams by answering letters from fans who say they will 
always remember and from opportunists who say there is money to be 
made making sure the public doesnt forget 
maria elena holly receives letters from three to 10 people each 
day 
buddy wrote and wanted his music to be received in a positive 
way and for people to enjoy it and for people to be inspired by his 
music and his determination to make it out there she said 
and thats where i come in with the youngsters i feel that 
through the letters it has done that anything that is a positive 
thing received from buddy hollys music it makes me happy it 
pushes me out there to continue putting his name out there and keep 
it there 
but shes not making holly available to the public without some 
personal benefit 
in 1987 she successfully lobbied texas lawmakers to approve 
legislation giving her full rights to hollys name voice likeness 
photographs and signature under the law hollys property 
cannot be used for commercial purposes without her approval 
bill griggs president and founder of the buddy holly memorial 
society says the law serves a good purpose 
if you go to memphis tenn to graceland across the street is 
souvenir store after souvenir store you can buy elvis presley 
toilet paper which to me is the epitome of bad taste he said 
thats why maria elena is so tough she wants to make sure 
everything is done above board and in good taste 
not only does the law keep hollys name and face off beer cans 
as one entrepreneur proposed but it also allows her to profit from 
the buddy holly music boxes posters and tshirts that are sold 
that was his legacy he left to us his family and the music 
was his legacy he left to everybody she said i feel very 
strongly that if someone is going to make money im going to make 
money and the hollys are going to make money 
maria elena santiago a native of puerto rico met buddy holly 
while she was a receptionist at peersouthern music publishing co 
in new york the morning after they met holly confronted maria 
elenas aunt who disliked musicians and asked for permission to 
marry her neice 
they had been married just six months when the small plane 
carrying holly ritchie valens and jp the big bopper 
richardson crashed near clear lake iowa on feb 3 1959 killing 
all three and their pilot 
she was pregnant when holly left on the tour and she suffered a 
miscarriage after the crash a year after holly died she remarried 
she and her second husband had three children before they divorced 
three years ago 
it was her dedication to holly that helped end her second 
marriage 
people ask you how did you get over his death well you 
dont get over his death you never do you cope with it but you 
never get over it she said turning her head to hide tears 
sometimes i do get upset and then i pick myself up and i say this 
is not going to bring him back so why not keep him here 
besides a few posthumously bestowed music awards and a few photos 
of holly she keeps his gibson j200 acoustic guitar and his black 
plasticframe glasses the glasses were found long after the crash 
stored in an iowa sheriffs files 
hollys fender stratocaster and other belongings are in lubbock 
with his family who are involved in negotiations with his widow to 
divide the items 
although she appreciates a statue erected by hollys friends she 
would have preferred the money to have been spent on a music 
scholarship 
thats what buddy wanted she said of the scholarship 
buddy wanted to help young people get established in the music 
industry to be able to help them in whatever career they chose in 
music

buddy holly influenced generations of 
musicians so does his hometown give him fitting recognition 
thatll be the day say fans and friends 
they complain that 30 years after his death this city takes 
scant notice of its most famous native son 
holly was 22 when he died on feb 3 1959 after the small plane 
carrying him ritchie valens and jp the big bopper richardson 
crashed near clear lake iowa 
a lifesize bronze statue stands in downtown lubbock as a tribute 
to the famous singer and musician who lived almost all his short 
life in this windswept farming town but it was erected by a few of 
hollys friends not the city government 
lubbocks efforts to capitalize on holly are pale compared to the 
milliondollar industry memphis built around the legacy of elvis 
presley 
this is the hometown of buddy holly and he should be remembered 
here said bill griggs the president and founder of buddy holly 
memorial society im not saying every street should be named 
after him and every radio station should be playing his music but 
there just isnt that much here for the fans 
those fans have not forgotten the sound of the shy young texan 
with the toothy smile big black spectacles and hiccuplaced vocal 
style that influenced recording artists as diverse as the rolling 
stones and linda ronstadt around the anniversaries of his birthday 
and death flowers cover hollys simple marble grave marker 
inscribed with a fender stratoscaster which lies in the city 
cemetery 
born charles hardin holley the fourth child of lawrence and ella 
holley the boy known as buddy took an early interest in music and 
was influenced by the country music he heard on the radio the e 
in his family name was dropped on the singers first recording 
contract 
from his first public exposure at age 17 on radio station 
kdavs sunday party show as a country duo with his friend bob 
montgomery hollys local stature was lowkey 
while most agree holly deserves more hometown recognition 
theres contention over who is to blame for the lack of local homage 
some holly devotees blame his widow maria elena holly for 
blocking those seeking permission to use her late husbands name for 
memorial concerts 
civic lubbock inc a cityappointed nonprofit organization 
sponsors an annual music festival at the time of hollys birthday 
but the number of musical offerings as well as attendance have 
declined steadily since the first festival in 1986 
but the event no longer can use the singers name since mrs 
holly successfully lobbied the 1987 texas legislature for a law 
forbidding commercial use of hollys likeness voice or name without 
her permission 
on the other hand she says city and festival officials arent 
interested in promoting holly with a music festival 
for almost 30 years now i have been talking to the officials 
and trying to convince them that doing a buddy holly week would help 
in every way she said but its one thing or another and 
nothing ever gets done 
jeff klotzman a civic lubbock board member says the city hasnt 
given up trying to promote lubbocks famous citizen with a festival 
the commitment is definitely there and the intent is to honor 
holly he said i dont think the city has turned its back on 
buddy holly by any stretch of the imagination 
mrs holly and others say no one in lubbock cared much about 
holly even when he was alive 
youd mention buddy holly around here and people would say 
oh you mean that kid who used to play down at the fruit and 
vegetable said larry corbin former owner of a country radio 
station where holly held informal jam sessions 
griggs said the citys disorganized attempt to stage a music 
festival was one reason the buddy holly memorial society moved its 
10th annual convention away from lubbock for two years the 
gathering of hundreds of fans has been held in clovis nm where 
the singer recorded most of his hits 
im not trying to be derogatory but the people in charge in 
this town are from the big band era said griggs who is bringing 
the meeting back to lubbock because of its accessibility and 
proximity to hollys grave i think we made our point to the 
city 
prior to the 1978 release of the movie the buddy holly story 
there was nothing in lubbock to commemorate the singer city 
officials rushed to put hollys name on a park built on the 
outskirts of town over an old landfill the park sign bearing 
hollys name has been defaced with spraypainted obscenities and a 
swastika 
in 1978 country superstar waylon jennings hollys bass player 
on his final illfated tour and other holly friends had the statue 
built 
waylon just wanted to do something for buddy in lubbock since 
he gave him his start said corbin who also put up money for the 
project 
but the bronze statue stood on a plot of city land for three 
years without anything to say who it was finally the statue was 
rededicated this time with a plaque 
his grave the park and the statue remain the only reminders of 
holly the small white frame house where he was born had been 
slated for demolition ironically on the 18th anniversary of his 
death it was saved after someone unaware of its historical 
significance purchased and moved the structure to another location 
now the lot stands vacant and weedgrown 
and while the iowa town where holly died has a buddy holly 
place among its streets no road or avenue in lubbock bears the 
singers name

after three decades the crickets are looking to complete the 
trip their leader buddy holly couldnt 
on feb 3 1989 the band is booked to perform in fargo nd 
the city holly ritchie valens and jp big bopper richardson 
were scheduled to play on that date 30 years ago instead their 
plane crashed in a snowstorm killing all three musicians and their 
pilot 
immortalized as the day the music died in don mcleans 1972 
epic pop song american pie the plane crash was the first great 
rock tragedy 
its going to feel a little strange ill have to admit said 
jerry allison one of two original crickets still playing with the 
band of the fargo date i still miss buddy because he and i grew 
up together 
in less innocent times musicians would be struck down by drugs 
drink cars guns and suicide their deaths form a macabre rock n 
roll hall of fame among them john lennon marvin gaye sam cooke 
andy gibb phil ochs jim morrison janis joplin peter tosh paul 
butterfield elvis presley jimi hendrix brian jones keith moon 
but when hollys tour plane went down seven miles north of clear 
lake iowa kids wore black armbands to school to honor stars not 
much older than themselves 
holly was only 22 when he died valens was 17 both were at the 
beginning of their careers but left behind enough work to create a 
sense of unfulfilled potential that nags today 
along with chuck berry rock n rolls first great poet holly 
was one of the first musicians in the rock era to write much of his 
own material he was the first to experiment with nowcommon studio 
techniques such as overdubbing and his hiccupping vocal style 
influenced such followers as paul mccartney who now owns the rights 
to hollys songs 
books have been written about the way he structured his 
songs scott isler senior editor of musician magazine said of 
the spare rock that propelled holly through such hits as peggy 
sue rave on not fade away and its so easy 
his music lives today on compact disks a laserdriven technology 
of which holly probably would not have dreamed and in automobile 
commercials a setting which may have made him cringe 
valens legacy is more modest although he was put back in the 
public eye with the 1987 movie la bamba the band los lobos also 
rereleased valens song of the same name that year and made it a 
hit valens other hits included donna and come on lets go 
the big bopper a former disc jockey was known for his song 
chantilly lace 
through movies of the lives of holly and valens one hasnt been 
made on richardson millions of people have learned how holly 
chartered a plane because he wanted to hurry to fargo to get his 
laundry done 
the crickets werent with holly on his final tour they stayed 
behind in lubbock texas when holly left his hometown to get 
married in new york city crickets guitarist sonny curtis shook 
allison awake the morning after with news of the crash 
the whole thing was unbelievable said allison who would 
rather celebrate the anniversary of hollys birth sept 7 1936 
than the day of his death but the crickets are a working country 
band and they dont shy away from gigs or hollys memory allison 
cowrote some of hollys bestknown songs including thatll be 
the day 
clear lake has remembered the three artists with an annual 
anniversary concert held for the last 10 years at the surf ballroom 
where they gave their final performance this years event is 
already sold out 
theyre proud of buddy holly and they like to flaunt the idea 
this is where buddy holly gave his last concert said disc jockey 
daryl hensley organizer of the event 
this years concert stars the diamonds bobby vee and freddie 
boom boom cannon rock relics from the holly era 
vee took over hollys scheduled appearance the night after the 
crash 
meanwhile the historical society in beaumont texas 
richardsons hometown plans to raise two statues on feb 3 one of 
buddy holly richardson and valens and a second of the big bopper 
alone 
musicians have long speculated where hollys muse would have 
taken him had he lived he was recording with a full orchestra 
shortly before he died and confided that he wanted to make gospel 
music like ray charles allison said 
would he have turned into a supper club crooner or would he 
have gone on to write some incredible stuff and break barriers 
down isler said 
referring to the crash as the day the music died is a bit 
hyperbolic although it makes a great song lyric isler said 
when american pie came out allison went to a record store 
and bought it pleased that another musician thought so fondly of 
holly he even backed mclean at a concert in texas where the 
singersongwriter sang the eightminute fable littered with obscure 
musical metaphors

but he has one regret id like to sit down with him sometime 
and say what do you mean by all these different things 
william griggs remembers being rocked by the news of hollys 
death when he was taking a lunch break from school griggs 
president of the buddy holly memorial society recently moved from 
connecticut to lubbock he said he visits hollys mother every few 
months to update her on fan club activities 
although devoting much of his life to holly griggs tries not to 
inflate the stars reputation which often happens to artists who 
die young 
so many artists who live on to their 40s and 50s had some 
failures in their lives griggs said people like buddy holly 
james dean and eddie cochran never had a chance to fail

the energy futures market began the week with a 
selloff as the price of crude oil dipped below 18 a barrel and 
refined petroleum products lost more than 2 cents a gallon 
technical factors and profittaking were mostly blamed for 
mondays decline which some analysts called an expected 
correction following a recent strong rally fueled by confidence 
in opecs productioncutting pact 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude plunged 
106 to settle monday at 1733 a barrel near the low of the day

deteriorate as mondays session wore on 
there were just waves of selling from everywhere today

a lot of people had felt that a correction was long overdue but 
they just didnt want to get out

cut its output to help shore up sagging worldwide prices

a prosecutor says the expresident of a 
defunct livingston brokerage house will testify against a former 
board member of the new york federal reserve bank who was accused in 
the federal banking systems first insider trading case 
the disclosure came at a hearing monday where gilbert c schulman 
admitted lying on the witness stand during his two trials for 
charges stemming from the 144 million collapse of bevill bresler amp 
schulman inc 
schulman 41 also admitted lying when he denied during the 
trials in april 1987 and july 1987 that he regularly received secret 
interest rate data from a board member of the new york federal 
reserve bank robert a rough 
assistant us attorney paul weissman said at the hearing that 
schulman would be called as a witness against rough at roughs trial 
on insider trading charges scheduled to begin feb 21 
schulman testified he and rough were friends for 15 years and met 
and talked regularly during 1982 to 1984 when rough served on the 
new york feds board as president of the national bank of sussex 
county in branchville but that no secret information was exchanged 
rough has pleaded innocent 
also at the hearing before us district judge dickinson r 
debevoise attorneys for schulman asked for a reduction of 
schulmans eightyear sentence for securities and tax fraud 
they suggested a total 30month sentence he has served 16 
months at the allenwood pa prison camp and five years 
probation including 2500 hours of community service at a soup 
kitchen 
debevoise sliced two years off the sentence attorneys said they 
were not sure what portion of the six years schulman would have to 
serve 
the judge recognized schulmans cooperation in the governments 
investigation of rough 
however i must say my cynicism does have some effect here 
he said he noted that schulman denied the charges in two trials 
the second resulting from a mistrial on some charges 
when that failed you turned over somebody to the government 
for prosecution debevoise said 
one of schulmans attorneys benson b weintraub said his client 
was the subject of harassment and ridicule by other inmates and 
staff at allenwood because of his cooperation 
he wears the jacket your honor of a snitch he said 
weintraub also spoke of the suffering of schulmans wife and five 
children aged 4 to 18 who sat in the row behind the defendant 
schulman told debevoise he had come full circle and admitted 
his guilt he said he would do anything he could to repay investors 
who lost money and to repay the internal revenue service 
sentencing on the perjury plea was delayed until after the rough 
trial 
rough 49 of sandyston township was indicted dec 8 on charges 
that he leaked secret data to bevill bresler on the discount rate 
set by the federal reserve in washington dc 
the discount rate is the rate the fed charges for loans to 
financial institutions and is one of the clearest signals the 
central bank has at its disposal to indicate its monetary policy to 
the financial markets the indictment said the firm made millions of 
dollars and avoided losses on the basis of the information in 
exchange rough allegedly received 47000 in interestdeferred 
loans 
the brokerage house collapsed in april 1985 four executives who 
pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors were subsequently 
sent to prison for charges stemming from the collapse 
as part of schulmans plea the government promised not to 
prosecute him further for crimes involving bevill bresler and to 
take no position at sentencing the perjury charge carries a 
fiveyear maximum sentence 
schulman agreed to cooperate fully and provide documents 
requested by prosecutors

futures traders of the 1980s have joined 19th 
century industrialists and 1920sera wall street financiers as 
targets of public suspicion says a businessschool professor 
because futures traders can make a lot of money very quickly by 
buying and selling things they dont even have there is this 
suspicion of the commodity speculators in chicago said hans r 
stoll a professor of finance at the owen graduate school of 
management at vanderbilt university in nashville tenn 
its much like the suspicion of midamerica visavis the 
robber barons of new york or wall street financiers stoll said 
monday in a telephone interview over the years the stock market 
has solidified a more conservative image but the futures markets 
have had more of it public suspicion in recent years 
suspicion by federal authorities has led to an fbi probe of 
commodity fraud in chicago where the nations two largest futures 
exchanges are still smarting from the bashing their industry took 
after the 1987 stock market crash 
on futures exchanges traders buy and sell contracts for future 
delivery of products ranging from wheat to treasury bonds the fbis 
undercover investigation of the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange is believed to be focused on organized 
traderigging and profitskimming by traders who work in the 
exchanges boisterous and crowded trading arenas or pits 
the disclosure of the fbis sting operation comes on the heels of 
two smaller commodity fraud cases in chicago and sets back the 
exchanges efforts to polish their industrys image in the wake of 
the 1987 market collapse 
some experts contend that massive selling of stock index futures 
contracts on the chicago mercantile exchange on oct 19 1987 
steepened and accelerated the stock markets slide 
a stock index future is a contract to buy or sell a specified 
group of stocks at a set price by a specified date some of the 
heavy selling of those contracts on oct 19 was by managers of large 
investment portfolios trying to hedge their losses in the regular 
stock market other traders sought to profit from price differences 
between the index futures contracts and the underlying stocks 
the chicago exchanges have roundly denied the charge that 
plummeting futures increased the pressure on stocks during the crash 
and have offered evidence to refute it 
but the dispute and the subsequent call by some in the securities 
industry for tighter regulation of futures markets spotlight a 
bitter rift stemming from the development of financial futures 
contracts in chicago in the early 1970s 
financial futures include the chicago board of trades 
industryleading treasury bond futures contract and the chicago 
mercs standard amp poors 500 index futures contract the trading 
volume in these wildly successful products dwarfs that of stocks and 
bonds and that means more money and power for the chicago 
exchanges 
i think theres maybe some envy some jealousy among the new 
yorkbased securities establishment said a market analyst who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity 
people think of new york as the financial center of the world 
yet the most successful financial instruments were invented in 
chicago so of course theyre jealous 
some players on wall street were rumored to be elated by news of 
a major trading scandal in chicago but marketwatchers couldnt or 
wouldnt confirm such talk 
anybody who takes heart or solace in what happens in chicago is 
wrong said james cramer president of cramer amp co a small 
moneymanagement firm 
and i think every one of us wishes the fbi would spend more 
time knocking on the doors of people who sell crack than on the 
doors of people who made a few outtrades bad trades on the 
chicago futures exchanges 
fears that a longrunning commodity scandal could sour 
speculators on the futures markets contributed to a sharp dip in 
seat prices on the exchanges last week analysts said 
but some of the members selling their seats may simply have been 
doing what futures traders do for a living betting on a trend 
you dont have to own a seat you can lease it said gordon 
linn president of linnco futures inc in chicago 
maybe you decide youd rather lease than own because maybe this 
type of thing the probe will drive seat prices down and youll 
have a chance to buy it cheaper

despite fears that drought would wilt 
bank earnings in the summer of 1988 farm banks in the midwest 
improved their performance in the third quarter even outperforming 
nonagricultural counterparts the federal reserve bank of chicago 
says 
it appears that the droughts effects on bank performance in 
the third quarter were not as severe as once forecasted said the 
january edition of the chicago feds banking barometer 
particularly during the real apex of the drought analysts 
were saying it would be real bad news for farm banks in the third 
quarter we didnt see it george gregorash banking analysis 
officer for the chicago fed said monday 
not only did earnings rise at 1747 midwest farm banks but the 
report said the quality of the banks credit and assets also 
improved in the julyseptember period 
the report also said that while earnings for the us banking 
industry improved for a third straight quarter reaching a record 
594 billion problem loans continued to plague banks in the 
southwest 
return on assets a measure of bank earnings was higher and rose 
further at midwest farm banks in the third quarter than at 
nonagricultural banks it said farm banks are lending institutions 
with agricultural loans other than real estate loans secured by 
farmland exceeding 30 percent of their total loans 
midwest farm banks had a return on assets of 102 percent in the 
third quarter or 102 for each 100 in assets that was up 28 
cents from a year earlier returns at nonagricultural banks in the 
midwest were 99 cents for each 100 in assets a rise of 7 cents 
from the third quarter of 1987 the report said 
certainly most analysts had forecast earnings under 1 percent 
of assets for farm banks when the drought first struck gregorash 
said 
the chicago fed attributed the improved earnings at midwest farm 
banks to a drop in problem loans provisions for loan losses fell 30 
hundredths of a percentage point to 036 percent of assets at 
midwest farm banks while at nonagricultural banks provisions for 
loan losses dipped 8 hundredths of a percentage point to 047 
percent of assets the report said 
the percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans for midwest 
ag banks fell from 441 percent a year earlier and 302 percent in 
the second quarter to 291 percent in third quarter of 1988 at 
nonagricultural banks the percentage of nonperforming loans dipped 
just 041 point from a year earlier and 008 point from the second 
quarter to reach 211 percent of total loans 
the figures on midwest farm banks covered districts supervised by 
federal reserve banks in chicago minneapolis st louis and kansas 
city mo 
states either entirely or partially in those districts are 
arkansas colorado illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky 
michigan minnesota mississippi missouri montana nebraska new 
mexico north dakota oklahoma south dakota tennessee wisconsin 
and wyoming 
as the midwest sustained its turnaround the distress continued 
in the southwest driven by extremely high provisions for bad 
loans the report said as a result of poor credit quality loan 
loss provisions as a percent of average assets were 254 percent in 
the third quarter in the southwest up from 142 percent a year 
ago and 236 percent in the second quarter of 1988

officials at the boeing cos two major unions say 
they havent heard their members complain about quality slipping at 
the planebuilder and are hardpressed to attribute a recent spate 
of bad news to anything but bad luck 
i dont understand how it could happen said dan mahoney 
general counsel for the seattle professional engineering employees 
association which represents about 26000 boeing engineers and 
technical workers everybody realizes this company survives on 
airplanes that stay in the air theres no effort were aware of to 
skimp on testing and quality assurance 
despite recent news accounts of some quality complaints by boeing 
workers mahoney and jack daniels spokesman for international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers local 751 said the 
complaints hadnt reached them 
i havent heard of anything daniels said adding if any of 
the 40000 boeing production workers had a complaint they could 
report it through their union shop stewards or business 
representives 
all our members are concerned about quality said daniels 
but we havent seen any evidence that quality has slipped 
in 1988 boeing smashed industry records for new commercial jets 
ordered 636 planes worth about 297 billion 
it introduced the 737400 a stretch twinjet and the 747400 
the worlds largest commercial jetliner it worked on a new smaller 
version of the 737 the model500 due out this spring and 
announced it was increasing aircraft production across the board 
during the next few years 
but 1988 also was the year safety of older aircraft became a 
worry sparked by a terrifying accident in which an aloha airlines 
737200 lost part of its roof over hawaii 
several airlines also criticized boeing for poor workmanship 
boeing executives said the work would be improved and the four 
carriers whose complaints were publicized later placed sizeable 
orders for boeing planes 
in recent weeks however little news has been good for boeing 
the disintegration of a pan am 747 over scotland on dec 21 
killing 270 was ultimately blamed on a bomb but not before 
speculation that the 19yearold plane might have failed 
on dec 26 an older eastern 727 made an unscheduled landing 
after it lost cabin pressure when a hole opened in the fuselage 
on jan 8 a 12weekold british midlands 737400 crashed in 
great britain after one engine failed and the other was shut off 
crosswiring in engine warnings systems was being investigated but 
no incidences of crosswiring in 737s have been reported 
crosswiring was found in cargohold fire extinguishing systems 
on seven boeing 757s after the federal aviation administration 
ordered a check on friday the faa also ordered the systems checked 
on boeing 767s because of the similarity of design 
in the past week an engine fell off a piedmont boeing 737200 
which still landed safely in chicago and a wing panel came off an 
eastern boeing 757 neither incident resulted in injuries 
last friday boeing announced it had completed a fiveday 
readjustment of its 747400 line to catch up work in some 
places and once again was reviewing its alreadydelayed schedule 
for delivering the new planes initial customers northwest and 
singapore airlines both said they were disappointed and need to get 
the new planes as soon as possible 
boeing commercial airplanes president dean thornton has 
acknowledged rapid growth has meant too many inexperienced workers 
and too much overtime boeing now employs more than 95000 in 
washington 55000 in commercial airplanes alone 
but bill whitlow jr analyst with dain bosworth co in seattle 
said boeings woes are shortterm blemishes on their reputation 
boeing set a tight schedule for developing the 747400 getting 
it certified and getting production up to what analysts estimate 
will be 55 to 60 planes in 1989 whitlow said theyre just trying 
to get too much done too quickly he said 
some 60 percent of all commercial jets flying were built by 
boeingsaid phil friedman an analyst with drexell burnham lambert 
in new york 
boeings market share is such that whenever a plane goes down 
the chances are good their name is going to be on it he said 
friedman also said boeings problems are shortterm if not 
why did they have the blockbuster year that they did customers 
putting up money is the best sign theyre convinced that quality is 
as good as it ever was 
its sort of an unfortunate random confluence of events 
mahoney said when you think of how many airplanes there are 
taking off and landing every minute of the day its one of those 
things

lawyers for lorrilard inc one of the 
tobacco companies sued in the landmark cipollone cigarette liability 
trial cant interview jurors from that case the trial judge ruled 
us district judge h lee sarokin rejected lorillards request 
at a hearing monday sarokin agreed with attorneys for antonio 
cipollone who said not enough reason existed to depart from federal 
rules in new jersey which only allow such interviews for good 
cause 
most of the exceptions involve cases in which there was evidence 
of jury tampering or interference lorillard made no such 
allegation saying it only wanted to speak to the jurors to 
discuss their impressions of the case for purposes of 
selfeducation according to court papers 
the company said it would make sure no juror would be harassed 
and that they would be told they could stop the interview at any 
time lorillard noted that some jurors had spoken freely to 
reporters and included copies of news articles in their court 
documents 
certainly in a case of this importance the court can 
understand the selfeducation motivation of counsel sarokin said 
adding that the reason was not enough to depart from the rules 
in june a sixmember jury awarded cipollone 400000 in damages 
finding that liggett group inc violated advertising promises that 
its products were safe liggett made the cigarettes smoked by 
cipollones wife rose before warning labels were put on packs in 
1966 
the cipollone verdict was the first to award money damages 
though it awarded them to cipollone only and not on behalf of his 
wife liggett has appealed 
damages were assessed only against liggett liggett philip 
morris inc and lorillard were cleared of conspiring to misrepresent 
the dangers of smoking and other claims 
mrs cipollone smoked for 40 years before dying in 1984 at age 58 
the cigarette industry spends millions of dollars defending 
itself against hundreds of smokerliability cases and waged a 
largescale public relations campaign during the trial 
lorillard states categorically that no information it obtains 
from the cipollone trial jurors will be used in any way in 
connection with the pending appeal of the cipollone judgment 
their court papers said 
lorillard also said no information from juror interviews will 
be used for any sort of public relations campaign or purpose 
three jurors told the philadelphia inquirer that they compromised 
into agreeing to award the damages to cipollone because two jurors 
insisted on finding the tobacco companies at fault 
as i look back on it today i dont think i did the right 
thing said jury forewoman marie mickens in the newspapers sept 
4 edition i hope they liggett win on appeal 
cipollones attorney alan m darnell argued that if wanting to 
learn about how a jury worked was enough to allow juror interviews 
then applications to interview jurors would be routinely granted 
because lawyers and parties are always curious about what really 
happened in the jury room

a consumer groups allegation that 11 million 
cadillacs may be prone to sudden acceleration runs counter to the 
findings of earlier government investigations general motors corp 
says 
the center for auto safety in a petition filed monday with the 
national highway traffic safety administration asked the agency to 
order the recall of cadillacs with ht4100 41liter v8 engines and 
made from 1982 through 1988 
gm responded that a 1986 nhtsa investigation of gm vehicles 
including cadillacs failed to find a common design flaw or 
manufacturing defect that could be a root cause for these unwanted 
acceleration incidents 
if the center has any technical information that would shed 
light on these incidents we would certainly like to see it said 
vince muniga a spokesman for gms cadillac division in detroit 
the center based its petition on public complaints of 120 
instances of unintended acceleration that allegedly resulted in 63 
accidents 70 injuries and five deaths 
two of the fatalities occurred in november when a 1985 cadillac 
eldorado crashed through the front of a department store in 
belleville nj killing two shoppers and injuring 13 
victims in many of these cases are pedestrians or bystanders 
unable to dodge an outofcontrol cadillac the center said in its 
petition 
nhtsa said it would respond to the centers request within 120 
days and declined to comment further on the petition 
gm said it would cooperate with any nhtsa investigation of the 
allegations 
nhtsa in response to an earlier petition by the center has been 
investigating allegations of sudden acceleration in 
frontwheeldrive cadillac devilles and fleetwoods made from 1985 
through 1988 
the models included in the centers latest petition are the 
19821984 devilles and fleetwoods 19821987 eldorados sevilles 
broughams and fleetwood broughams and 19871988 allantes 
federal engineers in recent years have investigated allegations 
of sudden acceleration in about 80 million vehicles produced by 10 
manufacturers according to figures compiled by the center 
about 440000 cars were recalled as a result of the 
investigations the center said

civic leaders lamented a us supreme court 
decision to strike down richmonds minority setaside ordinance and 
at least one minority contractor said his business wont survive the 
ruling 
merlin hargrove said the city law which required at least 30 
percent of any city contract to be subcontracted to minorityowned 
businesses meant 400000 in business over four years for his 
united unlimited construction co 
he said mondays ruling will mean the end of his company which 
employs nine people 
i was expecting it to go the other way he said of the 
ruling i guess the only thing you can do is pray 
dwight snead another minority contractor said his landscaping 
and paving business will survive but only because the ordinance got 
it started the law was enacted in 1983 and suspended in 1987 
pending the outcome of the supreme courts ruling 
snead said he never got city work before the setaside law was 
enacted since then he said hes received several million dollars 
in subcontracts on city projects and his company has grown from 10 
employees to 60 
the ordinance enabled us to become a general contractor said 
snead 
many city leaders were critical of the courts ruling which said 
the ordinance amounted to reverse discrimination 
the decision marks a dark day for the city a dark day for the 
country and a dark day for human relations councilman roy a west 
said 
im keenly disappointed in the decision councilman henry l 
marsh iii said but i think we have to regroup in richmond and 
make an attempt to comply with the supreme court requirements 
one voice of praise for the court came from councilwoman carolyn 
c wake who voted against the ordinance in 1983 
i feel that justice has prevailed she said because i 
believe very much in the marketplace and the free enterprise 
system 
councilman chuck richardson called the courts decision weak 
superficial superfluous and an excuse for the court to hide 
behind the feeble excuse that there was no evidence of 
discrimination was almost unconscionable 
richardson said blacks received less than 1 percent of all 
contracts before the ordinance forty percent of all contracts went 
to minorityowned companies during the life of the ordinance 
according to city manager robert bobb 
the ordinance was challenged in 1987 by ja croson co an ohio 
company that was the only bidder on a city project but failed to get 
the job because it lacked a minority subcontractor

treasury secretary nicholas f brady said today 
that congress should look at reducing or eliminating taxes on 
dividends as a means of discouraging debtfinanced corporate 
takeovers 
he acknowledged however that efforts to cut the federal budget 
deficit made that an unlikely prospect 
brady opposed eliminating the tax breaks on socalled junk bonds 
that are financing the multibilliondollar takeovers but he said 
the government may have no other choice if financiers do not put 
the same intensity and effort into evaluating where we are going s 
they have into taking us there 
the treasury secretary testifying before the senate finance 
committee said eliminating the tax deductions for interest paid on 
junk bonds would simply increase the cost of capital for american 
acquirers by effectively raising their interest rates 
the net effect would be a competitive disadvantage for us 
corporations he said 
instead brady urged congress to look at effectively reducing 
taxes on dividends he said west germany italy australia and new 
zealand give shareholders credit for taxes paid by corporations 
before dividends are distributed 
i recognize that at this juncture revenue considerations limit 
our ability to provide fundamental relief from double taxation of 
corporate income on both the corporations and their stockholders 
brady said 
the treasury secretary appeared to contradict a statement earlier 
by securities and exchange commission chairman david ruder that the 
debtfinanced takeovers known as leveraged buyouts or lbos do not 
pose a problem for the us economy 
brady has called the use of junk bonds in corporate takeovers a 
dangerous destabilizing element largely dedicated to 
unproductive purposes and he expanded on that view today 
i have a growing feeling that we are headed in the wrong 
direction when so much of our young talent and the nations 
financial resources are aimed at financial engineering while the 
rest of the world is laying the foundation for the future he said 
brady said the total value of leveraged buyouts has increased 
from around 11 billion in the fiveyear period from 1978 to 1983 to 
more than 160 billion in the past five years including 60 billion 
in 1988 alone 
a contributing factor in the proliferation of leveraged buyouts 
he said is the upfront fees collected by banks underwriters and 
fund managers in the transactions 
at the same time the companies acquired through the leveraged 
buyouts often lack the cash flow to keep up with the interest 
payments on junk bonds 
sadly these same parties may have relatively little if any 
investment in the longterm success of the new enterprise brady 
said given this arrangement it may very well be that the net 
effect of lbos is a financial snipe hunt where the new longterm 
investors flashlight in hand are left holding the bag 
in contrast the secs ruder said on cbs this morning earlier 
today that he thought lbos will increase ownership by management 
and will make us a more productive country 
i mean by that that after these buyouts the managers of the 
divisions typically will be allowed to run the divisions without 
having to be overseen by the top management of the large 
conglomerate and they may be very much more efficient in their 
management when theyre on their own he said 
president bush federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and at 
least a halfdozen congressional committees all are worried about 
corporate americas debt binge of takeovers financed with 
highinterest junk bonds 
the new administration already is under pressure to come up with 
proposals to curb the buyouts 
some economists worry that during a recession highly leveraged 
companies would not have enough cash flow to keep up their interest 
payments to junk bond holders and other creditors and might pull 
other companies down with them 
one could imagine that a company would get caught with a high 
level of debt during the period before theyve had a chance to 
refinance ruder said but that would only be one company or two 
companies and would not be a threat to the economy 
since last fall brady has had a team at the treasury department 
looking at whether the tax laws are encouraging companies to finance 
their expansions through debt rather than stock equity the group 
also has tried to determine corporate vulnerability in the event of 
an economic downturn 
the senate finance and the house ways and means committees last 
week issued a report showing that corporate debt has climbed by 613 
billion in the past five years while ownership equity has declined 
by 313 billion 
the report also said that the ratio of debt to equity in 
nonfinancial corporations has climbed from 30 percent to 46 percent 
from 1981 to 1987 
fears about the vulnerability of highly leveraged companies were 
heightened last september when revco ds inc the clevelandbased 
drug store chain entered chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings after 
defaulting on 700 million in bonds following a buyout 
despite the continuing booming economy bankruptcies continue to 
climb from 51 large companies defaulting on 11 billion in debt in 
1984 to 87 companies defaulting on 214 billion in 1987 
i think theres an appetite here to do something rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting ways and means 
panel told reporters last week something really should be done 
particularly when were seeing the junk bond abuse 
bush two weeks ago ruled out direct government action to curtail 
the new tide of takeovers most of them financed by borrowing huge 
amounts of money against the assets of the company being acquired 
through highyield junk bonds 
but he left open the possibility of changing the way the tax laws 
treat stock dividends and the deductibility of interest payments on 
debt used to finance takeovers 
there are things you can do in the tax laws he said if 
there are abuses of our tax laws the whole tax law will be 
reviewed to see how they can be eliminated 
greenspan the feds chairman also has urged congress to take a 
new look at how the tax laws encourage corporate debt and discourage 
equity

a leading us accounting firm said it 
was doubtful the european economic community could achieve a single 
capital market by 1992 
arthur andersen amp co of chicago said tuesday that serious 
problems in harmonizing regulations taxes and technology among the 
countries would prevent integration of the 12nation trading bloc on 
schedule 
an integrated european capital market with a common 
infrastructure will not be achieved by 1992 a report by the big 
eight accounting firm said a longer timetable is needed 
the eec wants to create a single europeanwide market by the end 
of 1992 to meet that goal the common market nations are in the 
process of dismantling barriers to the movement of capital goods 
and people among the member states 
about 80 percent of the 1000 experts from 13 countries who took 
part in the study predicted that international equity trading will 
remain concentrated in london tokyo and new york but the european 
exchange may lose some importance 
london will play a significant role in the international 
market but even its ability to compete with tokyo and new york is 
far from certain it said 
the report predicted that assets managed by european 
institutional investors would double in the next five years but said 
savers would demand more sophisticated investment instruments 
the study said european exchanges will have to cooperate rather 
than compete in order to handle the increased and more demanding 
business it also predicted gaps among common market countries as 
some remove regulations from their markets faster than others

amid reports that a government investigation of 
chicago commodity markets was expanding the head of the agency that 
oversees the markets said the probe should not shake investor 
confidence 
i think this is a very good example of how were doing in our 
job said wendy gramm chairwoman of the commodity futures trading 
commission 
john troelstrup a chicago attorney representing at least one of 
the traders subpoenaed told the associated press he understood the 
grand jury would meet today and wednesday 
the new york times reported today that at least a dozen more 
subpoenas were delivered to chicago traders monday and some people 
could appear today before a grand jury 
the chicago suntimes reported that unidentified sources said the 
fbi has asked the internal revenue service to conduct net worth 
investigations of some brokers and traders suspected of evading 
large amounts of taxes 
the suntimes also said the suspects are believed to be 
frantically trying to shift assets to relatives and business 
associates to hide unreported profits 
us law enforcement officials are investigating allegations that 
as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers 
out of millions of dollars on the chicago mercantile exchange and 
the chicago board of trade 
since last weeks revelations fbi agents and us prosecutors in 
chicago have said nothing for the record but on monday in 
washington ms gramm acknowledged her agency has been involved in 
the investigation from the outset 
ms gramm declined to say whether the cftc simply had been 
informed of the probe or had assigned personnel to it from the 
start nor would she say whether the agency knew that undercover fbi 
agents were operating on the floors of the exchanges and whether 
cftc records have been subpoenaed 
asked if the revelations should shake investor confidence in the 
futures markets ms gramm said the fact that we bring cases 
to root out fraud and abuse is an example of why people should be 
confident in our ability to police the markets 
fbi agents posing as traders recorded conversations about the 
alleged fraud at the exchanges and the government has subpoenaed 
traders and trading records dating back to jan 1 1983 
the investigation has raised jitters among many traders and 
sparked a rash of seat sales on the major exchanges six more seats 
were sold on both exchanges by the close of business monday 
bringing to 32 the total number sold since the probe went public 
thursday 
the mercs board of governors issued a letter urging traders 
not to be driven to irrational or selfdestructive behavior by the 
adverse publicity 
our own internal compliance department had already focused on 
many of the same practices that appear to be central to the federal 
investigation the letter read 
we will deal harshly with violators we stand ready to revise 
rules and enforce procedures where necessary 
the chicago tribune reported today that the fbi paid between 1 
million and 2 million to secretly buy three seats on the exchanges 
lease a fourth seat deposit 200000 with firms that processed the 
agents trades and stake the agents to trading capital

commerce secretarydesignate robert mosbacher 
said today the united states is lagging in the global race to 
develop a new generation of television sets and he promised to help 
us manufacturers compete in this and other hightechnology fields 
mosbacher told the senate commerce committee at his confirmation 
hearing that he was concerned that us manufacturers were losing 
ground to foreign competitors in such areas as highdefinition 
television 
japan and other countries have been racing to develop the 
technology for clearer tv pictures with the prize a 
multibilliondollar sales market for consumers worldwide 
we are losing the advantage we started out with in the 
hightechnology area mosbacher said it appears to me that 
while it is very late in the game it is not too late we can get 
back in the game 
mosbacher said he did not have any specific recommendations to 
make now but that this area would be a high priority once he took 
office he suggested there may be a need for new laws to waive 
antitrust restrictions that would allow us electronic companies to 
work together in developing highdefinition tv 
a central challenge facing the department of commerce is to 
support us economic growth and international competitiveness 
mosbacher said in written testimony submitted earlier 
to meet this challenge we must promote a better climate for 
increased us exports and help american industry develop and 
apply new commercial technologies that will make us more 
competitive 
mosbacher was praised by many members of the committee and he was 
expected to have no trouble winning confirmation 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas introduced mosbacher a wealthy 
texas oilman and longtime friend of president bush to the committee 
as a friend counselor tough competitor and an international 
businessman 
bentsen who was the democratic vice presidential candidate and 
was often critical of the reagan administrations stance on trade 
said he believed mosbacher exemplified a new activism that bush 
promised in his inaugural address last friday 
committee chairman sen ernest hollings dsc noted that the 
republican national committee released on monday a list of 249 
individuals and corporate representatives who gave at least 100000 
to the bush cause 
common cause a citizen activist group had urged the commerce 
committee to delay mosbachers confirmation until the list was made 
public mosbacher bushs campaign finance chairman raised more 
than 25 million in large donations 
hollings said that while the list of people willing to give 
100000 and more showed the need for limits on such contributions 
he was satisfied with publication of the list and did not feel the 
issue would hold up mosbachers confirmation 
among the goals mosbacher cited in his cabinet job were expanding 
us trade supporting research and development working to clean up 
coastal pollution and ensuring that next years census was conducted 
fairly and accurately 
mosbacher one of four texans named to the bush cabinet has a 
background very similar to the new president both were born to 
wealthy northeast families and went to texas after world war ii to 
make their fortunes in the oil business 
mosbacher proved to be more successful than bush amassing a net 
worth reportedly topping 200 million as the head of mosbacher 
energy co of houston an energy development company with leases 
along the gulf coast from texas to alabama and in the rocky montains 
mosbacher whose fortune makes him the wealthiest member of the 
incoming cabinet cuts a dashing figure in a generally staid group 
of bush appointees 
he is an accomplished sailor who has won several international 
yachting championships and his third wife georgette is a former 
model who has already made a big splash on the washington social 
scene 
bush and mosbacher became friends in the early 1960s with 
mosbacher often serving as a fund raiser for bushs political 
efforts mosbacher was chief fund raiser for bushs 1980 and 1988 
presidential campaigns and performed the same job for president 
fords 1976 campaign 
mosbacher and secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii and 
treasury secretary nicholas brady became known as the big three 
during bushs presidential bid last year the three senior campaign 
advisers to whom bush turned most often for advice 
because mosbacher is one of bushs oldest friends many expect 
mosbacher to play a more influential role in setting economic policy 
than previous commerce secretaries 
in announcing the nomination last month bush said that mosbacher 
would bring his tremendous energies to promoting us exports 
abroad 
while administration of us trade policy is considered the 
departments most vital role especially in an era of record trade 
deficits the farflung agency also is home to the census bureau 
the national weather service and the bureau of economic analysis 
which produces many of the governments statistical reports 
it is in the trade area however where mosbacher will likely 
devote most of his energies while the trade deficit has improved 
after hitting an alltime high of 1701 billion in 1987 many 
economists fear the improvement is in danger of stalling out unless 
the new administration proves more successful than the reagan 
administration in removing foreign barriers to us products 
the united states is currently fighting a ban imposed by the 
12nation european community on american beef treated with hormones 
the reagan administration on jan 1 began implementing 100 million 
in trade sanctions against european products in retaliation for the 
european decision to ban hormonetreated beef

hacking can be called an attitude toward problem solving a human 
urge to outwit conventional wisdom an exploration of limits not 
always absent whimsy 
when caltech students at the 1961 rose bowl rearranged the code 
of the cheering sections halftime show so their synchronized cards 
spelled caltech instead of huskies for the university of 
washington then spelled huskies backward this was a hack 
since robert morris a 23yearold cornell grad student was 
strongly suspected of planting a virus last fall actually a 
worm but dont bother your head about the distinction that 
gave 6000 interconnected computers electronic hits hacking has 
become a nasty word should it be 
according to steven levy the herodotus of hacking in his 
estimable history hackers the word stems from mit at the dawn 
of the computer age in the late 50s the incubator was the tech 
model railroad club 
in the real world defined by the hackers dictionary as a 
place whose inhabitants wear ties and are thought of as not unlike 
deceased persons hacking was how henry viii solved his marital 
dissonances or what inept golfers or unfelicitous writers do 
at mit where ingenious students had long since advanced from 
reassembling model a fords in a professors room hacking at the 
railroad club meant creating something of great panache and 
ingenuity without necessarily an ultimate utility circuits could be 
rewired not to make the tiny trains run on time but to make them do 
it more elegantly 
when computers began showing up on campus some railroaders were 
immediately drawn to them like moths to a diode they set behavior 
patterns which abide they lived by night when computers were idle 
neglected families food studies sunlight soap the last may 
account for the scarcity of female hackers 
early on hackers marked more by preoccupation than misogyny 
ignored girls because they considered them unprogrammable

kid than when youre middleaged 
a hacking prodigy can be called often unjustly a nerd 
the source of the term nerd is obscure in a very informal poll 
the only characteristic a majority agreed on was that nerds usually 
wear plastic pencil holders in their shirt pockets 
in a lacrosse game this writer once faced off against an mit 
defenseman whose stick was twice the length of mine rather than 
snarl that hed split my skull the next time the ref wasnt looking

easier for him to tutor math teachers in computer familiarization 
seminars a child lecturing the pharisees at the temple 
even then something had evolved that levy calls the hacker ethic 
this posited that access to computers and the data that fed them 
should be free keep in mind these were the 60s and that hacking 
in and of itself and for the pure freedom of it should be unimpeded 
by the high priests of the real world big business big brother 
big anybody computers promised a brave new world and all should 
romp unhindered in elysium

in the days of youth hacking can become a compulsion its 
practitionersan obsessive brotherhood the hackers world shrinks 
into the machine and blooms inside like a chinese chrysanthemum 
dropped into a water glass 
joseph weizenbaum a professor of computer science at mit writes 
in his book computer power and human reason 
compulsive programming hacking represents a 
psychopathology that is far less ambiguous than say milder forms 
of schizophrenia or paranoia 
about 1980 a hacker at stanford posted an anguished letter on 
the bulletin board of the universitys computer center the 
dispensing machine had been computerized so you could charge food 
cokes and beer it was also programmed to refuse suds to minors in 
the letter g gandalf called computing highly addictive to 
the point that very very few hackers remain close to their 
families very very few associate with anyone who is not at least 
partially a member of the hacking groupthe most brilliant minds 
at our top universities are learning how to play with 
multimilliondollar toys first and how to utilize them 
constructively secondthe hackers motivation to challenge 
themselves in any field not directly linked to computers gradually 
disintegratesthis is what takes some of the brightest and most 
capable minds in college today and turns them into narrowness 
a anonymous replied to gandalf a person who chooses to be a 
musician must devote hours and hours to gain adequate expertise but 
would you consider the computer hacker any less creative than such a 
person 
wa mozart lived bc and couldnt answer 
crispin a stanford hacker in the time of gandalf used to talk 
nationwide via electronic mail hackers call the us postal 
service snail mail dave flory thinks computer talk is 
antiseptic dehumanized no inflection no body language lynn 
gold a student at columbia university in new york thought there 
was something about crispins messages they were funny 
eventually they arranged to meet in the real world and got 
married in it 
some hackers never grow up says mandel computers remain 
their entire life they dont pay any attention to the real world 
you can burn out at 30 by losing your inspiration says jef 
but you can also have substitute skills to allow you to do better 
work a lot of kid hackers dont realize that they feel theyve 
lost it 
mozart had been dead four years when he was tenneys age tenney 
nonetheless doesnt think he has composed his last concerto for 
computer 
an employer will say wow how did you do this i tell him i 
did it hacking 15 years ago it was in my mental library

much faster theirs would have elegantly closed the trapdoors by

even more damage than it did wouldnt have had a mistake on it as 
the actual worm did 
did they know that when morris was in elementary school in new 
jersey he was so precocious the school let him use its computer to 
assign students to lunchroom tables that he let it be known that 
for a dollar hed work it out so you sat with your buddies and not 
your enemies and definitely not with your unfavorite teacher 
maybe he was rebelling against the authoritarianism of 
assigning kids to tables says jef the middleoftheroad hacker 
hes a cracker says leres i hope he does time it would 
be a precedent for others who might try the same thing 
poskanzer turns off his moon i got 39 requests for it when i 
offered it on bulletin boards ive copyrighted it but i give it 
away i dont care but i copyrighted it so no one else could put 
his name on it that i do care about

shearson lehman hutton holdings inc said tuesday 
it narrowed its fourthquarter loss over a year earlier while 
morgan stanley group inc reported a sharp jump in earnings 
both brokerage firms made a profit for all of 1988 although 
shearson said annual earnings fell slightly due partly to continued 
expenses from the acquisition of ef hutton inc in january 1988 
shearson said that for the three months ended dec 31 it lost 
135 million compared with a loss of 95 million in the 1987 
period revenue though shot up 63 percent to 29 billion from 
18 billion reflecting the hutton merger 
earnings in 1988 were restated to correct an overstatement in 
income from shearsons whollyowned subsidiary boston co 
for the year earnings totaled 96 million or 81 cents a share 
down 5 percent from 101 million or 1 a share in 1987annual 
revenue totaled 105 billion up 56 percent from 67 billionin the 
previous year 
morgan stanley said its fourthquarter net income rose to 1083 
million or 425 a share from 314 million or 116 a share in 
1987 revenue also rose to 5949 million from 3395 million 
for the year earnings totaled 3946 million or 1539 a share 
on revenue of 22 billion that compared with net income of 2309 
million or 899 a share in 1987 and 18 billion in revenue 
the october 1987 stock market crash had affected the results of 
both shearson and mortan stanley as it had with other brokerage 
firms that year 
but shearson noted that it also took a 77 million pretax charge 
in 1987 related to the underwriting of part of british petroleum co 
plcs disappointing 25 billion public stock offering which had 
taken place in the wake of the market collapse 
shearson blamed the decline in 1988 earnings on lower investor 
participation in the financial markets 165 million in expenses 
associated with the hutton merger and a 100 million pretax 
writedown of mcorp securities held by the firm 
chairman peter a cohen said while we forsee a continuation of 
a difficult enviornment in the financial markets we are optimistic 
for the year ahead we will continue to be diligent in cutting costs 
and reducing staffing levels 
morgan stanley chairman s parker gilbert and president richard 
b fisher attributed their companys improved results to favorable 
performances in equity and fixedincome divisions despite often 
sluggish markets in the united states and europe 
important contributions were also made by our asset management 
foreign exchange and commodities businesses they said in a joint 
statement

automobile dealers are on the front lines of the 
car wars and theres restlessness in the ranks 
many dealers say manufacturers are not doing enough to help them 
shoulder the burdens posed in selling cars to increasingly 
sophisticated consumers and in the face of growing competition 
if the incoming president of the national automobile dealers 
association has his way the dealers will be heard 
the dealers have been a whipping boy for the manufacturers long 
enough ron tonkin said recent in a telephone interview from his 
office in portland ore 
we feel very testy about the fact that in 1987 when automakers 
were making big profits dealers profits were down 12 percent 
tonkin said there has got to be some equity in this equation 
tonkin said one way of helping dealers might be to someday 
require automakers to pay for space on dealership floors much like 
food and beverage makers pay for shelf space at the supermarket 
tonkin takes office jan 31 at the end of the nada convention in 
new orleans 
scott lefever general manager of northtowne lincolnmercury in 
kansas city mo also thinks manufacturers need to do more to aid 
dealers such as improving sales training 
i dont think the training theyre offering is targeted to the 
reallife situation lefever said its what they would like to 
believe what happens in the sale they think the sale can go down by 
being only honest and truthful 
the people can adore you but they buy from you only because of 
the price he said 
dealers contacted in a spot check around the nation indicated 
they believe customers are more knowledgeable than they were five 
years ago about what they plan to buy and more sophisticated about 
ways of financing the purchase 
weve found some of them that come in that know more about a 
product than some of our salespeople said doug moreland owner of 
cherry creek dodge in aurora colo they seem more sure in their 
mind of what theyre looking for they want a lot more 
additionally the flurry of information available about car 
features options and available financing deals puts a bigger burden 
on a salesperson to cut through the mass of information said 
tonkin a megadealer who owns 10 dealerships selling 14 makes of 
cars and light trucks 
if the sales person doesnt sell the customer the first time 
the chances of selling a subsequent time is very very poor he 
said there is so much product out there 
competition poses another challenge as the growing number of 
foreign car dealers become increasingly willing to strike deals and 
bargain with customers a practice rarely seen in years past 
import sellers have been more willing to play the carselling 
game by traditional american rules as design and engineering of 
domestic and imported cars become closer and as the number of 
imported car dealers grows 
some of our import competitors are finding out that theyve got 
to get down and work to make a deal moreland said theyre not 
used to doing what we have to do 
bob smith owner of bob smith audivolkswagenporsche of 
hollywood calif has been in the car business for 52 years 
recently there have been bad times for audi business and he points 
to what he calls disappointing dealershipmanufacturer relationships 
as a cause 
theyve got a lot of financially poor dealers smith said 
they should buy them but they are just going to sit there and let 
us go down the drain 
audi sales slumped sharply last year falling to a daily sales 
rate of 22943 cars from 41322 in 1987 
company spokesman joe bennett said audi dealers already have 
access to dealer salesperson and sales manager incentives which 
can be passed along to customers to help boost sales he said there 
are no plans for the company to buy any of the 390 audi dealerships 
down from 402 a year ago

a few days after mario antoci took the helm at 
american savings he was asked to approve advertisements for a new 
6month certificate of deposit paying an attractive interest rate 
the new chief executive balked at the thought of what the offer 
would cost the savings and loan which had just been rescued from 
insolvency by the federal government 
but in the end he let the ads go after first cutting the rate a 
bit to a stillcompetitive 825 percent and inserting the words 
limited offer in the ad copy 
antoci uses the story to describe the tightrope walk he must 
execute as head of what used to be the single biggest insolvent 
savings and loan in the nation 
he must bring interest rates down from inflated levels that the 
struggling thrift used to attract desperately needed deposits but 
not so low as to chase away the loyal customers who have stuck with 
american through years of travail 
at the same time he must convey the idea the new american 
savings bought by corporate takeover strategist robert m bass and 
backed by 17 billion in federal promissory notes really is a new 
solid and conservative institution 
american savings is a new company with a 104yearold 
tradition but a new company with a new direction antoci 54 
said in a getacquainted session with reporters earlier this month 
american based in stockton calif was formerly the nations 
secondbiggest sampl it was seized by the federal home loan bank 
board last year and turned over to the bass group of fort worth at 
years end in exchange for a 350 million cash infusion 
the government assumed responsibility for the bad assets a huge 
portfolio of foreclosed real estate loans and mortgagebacked 
securities earning belowmarket interest rates and promised 
financial backing 
the good assets which at 15 billion are less that half of what 
american used to be worth on paper are the property of the 
recapitalized american savings a subsidiary of a new 
basscontrolled private holding company called new american holdings 
inc 
americans performance under its new management will be watched 
as a key test of the governments controversial handling of the 
nations sampl crisis 
the sales of some badly managed bankrupt institutions to 
financial sharpies such as bass for what some lawmakers considered 
firesale prices have incited widespread criticism in congress 
antoci hired away from the no 2 job at los angelesbased h f 
ahmanson amp co the parent of home savings of america the nations 
biggest thrift is chairman and chief executive officer of both the 
bassowned holding company and the sampl 
he told reporters that the bass organizations move to hire him 
reflected its commitment to the thrifts longterm health 
asked about speculation that bass would sell american in a couple 
of years antoci quoted him as saying this is a keeper 
rival thrift executives say antoci was a good choice for bass if 
hes interested in reestablishing american as a conservative 
traditionally run thrift though he isnt widely known on a personal 
basis antocis reputation is as a solid numbers man who embraces 
home savings conservative strategy of emphasizing singlefamily 
home lending 
antoci frequently invokes the home savings name and philosophy 
and the vision of the new american savings he painted for reporters 
is a near mirror image of home hell concentrate on investing in 
singlefamily mortgages the meat and potatoes of the traditional 
thrift 
ninety percent of those mortgages he said will be sixmonth 
adjustablerate loans which protect the thrift from interest rate 
swings 
antocis appointment sends a signal that the institution is 
going to be run in a conservative and traditional fashion says 
bob adelizzi president of san diegobased home federal savings amp 
loan 
hes described as a hard worker but an informal boss most of 
his former coworkers call him mario 
a scuba diver and avid boater he keeps his 58foot motor yacht 
moored off the back yard of his house on huntington harbor an 
orange county suburb south of los angeles 
though outgoing in social settings he says he doesnt intend to 
become a highprofile public spokesman in american advertising 
rather antoci says hes content to let a 1950sthemed ad 
campaign dress up his message that american will offer competitive 
rates and attentive service

the united states formally asked 
switzerland tuesday to freeze accounts at four banks cited by us 
officials in an insider trading probe that has caused a political 
scandal in france 
the accounts are believed linked to alleged stock market 
manipulation in the takeover of usbased triangle industries inc 
by the french stateowned industrial company pechiney sa 
the accounts were provisionally blocked dec 19 at that time 
swiss authorities acted on a request for judicial assistance from 
the us securities and exchange commission 
the formal demand lists detailed allegations including 
uscompiled evidence of criminal acts a swiss justice ministry 
spokeswoman said 
under a usswiss treaty judicial assistance can be granted 
only if the alleged offenses fall under the criminal code in both 
countries 
the banks cited by the us investigators are union bank of 
switzerland banque cantonale vaudoise schweizerische volksbank and 
banca della svizzera italiana accounts in the banks allegedly were 
used to steer part of the takeover transactions on the new york 
stock market 
top aides of french president francois mitterrand have been 
implicated in the affair alain boublil chief of staff of the 
french finance ministry resigned last week though he denied buying 
shares on inside information 
the sec alerted french authorities after noting abnormally heavy 
purchases of triangle shares in the week before pechiney publicly 
launched its successful takeover bid nov 21 
pechiney bought triangle the former parent of american national 
can corp for 56 a share nearly six times the value a week 
earlier 
french authorities have not yet asked switzerland for judicial 
assistance 
under the decentralized swiss judicial system implementation of 
the formal us request and subsequent possible moves like the 
lifting of bank secrecey and handover of records are up to 
authorities in each canton or state

martin marietta corp tuesday said its 
income fell about 60 percent in the fourth quarter reflecting 
establishment of a reserve to compensate for increasing competition 
in commercial satellite launching 
but for all of last year the company reported a 556 percent 
increase in profit record sales and an alltime high of backlogged 
orders 
the years results attest to the vitality and strong earning 
power of our core busineses and give us renewed confidence of solid 
future earnings progress said norman r augustine chairman and 
chief executive 
the company said aftertax earnings came to 237 million or 45 
cents a share in the three months ended dec 31 down from 594 
million or 112 a share in the corresponding 1987 quarter fourth 
quarter sales totaled 15 billion compared to 13 billion for 
1987s fourth quarter 
in 1988 martin mariettas profit totaled 3589 million or 
675 per share compared with 2307 million or 425 per share 
in 1987 the record sales amount was 57 billion up from 1987s 
51 billion and the backlog of undelivered orders amounted to 112 
billion vs 108 billion in 1987 
earnings for 1988 included a fourth quarter reserve of 90 
million or 105 per share to put the commercial titan launch 
program on a more conservative footing the company said the 
reserve was more than offset for the years results by a 225 per 
share from the third quarter sale of hoskyns group plc a british 
data systems subsidiary 
the reserve for the titan program reflects prospective revenues 
costs and demand for commercial launch vehicles titan equipment is 
used in the launch of commercial and military communications 
satellites 
it was considered a prudent action in view of current industry 
pricing following the recent entry into the world market of the 
chinese long march launch vehicle the company statement said

oil futures prices rebounded from the selloff at 
the start of the week as traders tuesday turned their attention to 
an upcoming meeting between opec and nonopec nations 
still the price of crude oil which broke the 19abarrel level 
this month remained well below 18 a barrel during the trading 
session and some analysts said it appeared doubtful that prices 
would return to those higher levels any time soon 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude rose 21 
cents to finish at 1754 a barrel 
the contract had fallen 106 on monday in what some analysts 
called an expected correction following a recent strong rally 
fueled by confidence in opecs productioncutting pact 
among refined petroleum contracts traded on the exchange 
february home heating oil settled 064 cent higher at 5087 cents a 
gallon after losing 210 cents on monday 
the february contract for unleaded gasoline which declined 208 
cents in mondays session settled at 5045 cents a gallon up 103 
cents 
right now the market is a little confused as to whether 
yesterdays decline was the beginning of a sharp movement downward 
or just a correction said andrew lebow senior analyst with 
edampf man international futures inc 
i think it was overdone and i think tuesday we just had a 
rebound off yesterday he said 
chris mccormack an energy analyst with drexel burnham lambert 
inc agreed but wasnt too bullish about the direction of prices 
in the near future 
i think the market pretty much has discounted all the bullish 
news mccormack said i dont think crude is sustainable at 
19 
analysts note that since early october west texas intermediate 
had risen more than 7 on optimism that the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries would significantly cut its output to 
help shore up sagging worldwide prices 
a daily quota of 185 million barrels went into effect jan 1 
and traders said there were indications that opec was sticking to 
that level 
analysts said traders were now turning their attention to 
thursdays scheduled meeting in london between opec and nonopec 
nations 
i think the market feels that something positive could come out 
of that meeting said mccormack

marathon oil co is looking forward to doing 
business in libya again but is still waiting for the green light 
from washington a company spokesman said tuesday 
we have not received official notification said donald 
herring marathons director of public affairsenergy so we are 
not able to really add any information to anything until we have 
some discussions with the government 
ronald reagan in one of his last acts as president last week 
authorized american oil companies to resume doing business in libya 
in a bid to head off the potential nationalization of their huge 
investment in that country 
the move also was designed to end what was called the significant 
windfall profits libya has reaped since the reagan administration 
imposed the ban on the us operations there in 1986 
in the absence of the american companies libyans have been 
working the us oil fields and keeping the income 
obviously it did not help that for 2 years we have been 
unable to be in libya where we have a onesixth interest in the 
oasis oil co those were profits lost herring said 
he said he did not have any figures on how much money marathon a 
subsidiary of pittsburghbased usx corp lost during the sanctions 
marathon is based in findlay ohio about 45 miles south of toledo 
in northwest ohio 
we have said that we would welcome a return to our libyan 
operation if government approval was forthcoming he said it 
appears that it is 
state department spokesman charles redman has said the 
announcement will permit the oil companies to resume their 
operations in libya transfer operations to foreign subsidiaries or 
sell their assets if they so desire 
other affected companies are occidential petroleum conoco 
petroleum w r grace and amerada hess their investments in libya 
are believed to total in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
before the embargo went into effect libya received 51 percent of 
the revenues derived from the us oil operations 
when the administration imposed broad trade sanctions against 
libya in 1986 it authorized the companies to negotiate 
standstill agreements with libya 
the agreements which expire june 30 provided for the suspension 
of company operations to protect the companies from charges of 
default on their contractual obligations to work their concessions 
in libya 
the companies have been concerned that libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi might seize their assets if the agreement expires and the 
sanctions are not lifted

the dollar and treasury bonds moved higher in response to 
greenspans testimony with the stock market following suit

positive or negative but since the bond market rallied it points

850 per 1000 in face amount by late afternoon

in a rarity these days for the 
economically depressed oilfield equipment industry a houstonarea 
manufacturer tuesday dedicated a new oil rig that officials said 
would be the largest and deepest land rig to drill in europe 
the 197foottall rig was assembled by houstonbased national 
oilwell for inanaftaplin of yugoslavia and will be used to drill in 
the dinarides area of that country near the coast of the adriatic 
sea 
the 105 million socalled superdeep rig is capable of 
drilling three wells simultaneously to depths of up to 25000 feet 
and is touted as having a unique brake system that controls the 
speed of the pipe going into the holes in the earth 
all of our new business is for overseas said donald w 
vogelsang general manager of drilling equipment for national 
oilwell there was an abundance of rigs ordered during the boom 
days and there are a lot available rigs for domestic use 
bozidar omrcen vice president for inanaftaplin saw the rig for 
the first time tuesday at a texas barbecue that marked the 
completion of the 10month project 
we are very satisfied he said this is a big day a lot of 
people are here to celebrate 
his company pumped 22 million barrels of oil in 1986 and is the 
leading marketer of oil and gas in yugoslavia tuesdays delivery is 
the largest of three rigs made for inanaftaplin 
the celebration in a warehouse adjacent to the rig was a dim 
reminder of the heady days of the late 1970s and early 1980s when 
oil prices approached 40 per barrel construction of oil rigs was 
nonstop and rig dedication parties were the norm 
pat smith spokeswoman for national oilwell recalled times when 
at least seven rigs were being assembled at one time in the 
industrial area east of houston 
for some companies now seven rigs would be a good year industry 
officials acknowledge 
for example this weeks latest baker hughes inc count of rigs 
looking for oil in the united states was 789 the lowest the count 
reached last year was 880 in december 1981 the tally peaked at 
4500 
the rig sent off tuesday is the first to be completed in months 
by national oilwell company chairman bob smith said 
to have a brand new rig of this size range is very unusual 
because the industry was so overbuilt and there is such an overhang 
in inventory and there hasnt been that much demand for new 
equipment smith said so this is very unusual although our 
company has 11 drilling rigs on order all overseas 
by and large the international companies are focusing their 
investments outside the united states for a company that is 
strictly a united states company that is a problem 
smith said he sees a turnaround in the domestic market but 
nothing significant for several years and even then no return to 
the boom conditions 
until it does the fact we have a strong international 
presence we will be able to maintain a strength in the company 
he said 
in addition to the rig inanaftaplin also is purchasing more 
than 60000 feet of pipe 
the rig probably would begin drilling a 6000meter project 
about 19000 feet by late may or early june according to omrcen 
vogelsang said now that officials were certain the rig would work 
and all bugs were removed it would be taken apart piece by piece 
and shipped to yugoslavia for reassembly

coffee futures prices fell drastically tuesday on the coffee 
sugar and cocoa exchange in new york 
the march contract dropped 634 points or 634 cents during the 
trading session 
it was a blood bath said bert ruiz a broker in new york 
with balfour maclaine corp the decline was due to the 
anticipation of a greater availability of coffee from brazil the 
market will be flooded with brazilian coffee due to the goverments 
economic austerity plan introduced last week 
because of new warehouse fees brazilian coffee exporters have 
had to unload their coffee onto the world market said ruiz 
futures prices have been rising since early december but have 
leveled off since a march contract high of 16690 on jan 3 
coffee settled 570 cents to 634 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in march at 13451 
futures prices of soybeans and corn climbed higher while wheat 
prices sank at the close on the chicago board of trade 
soybeans advanced more than 11 cents for the march spot contract 
a rumor that the russians bought 600000 tons of soy pellets 
from brazil or the united states supported the beans and corn went 
along for the ride said victor lespinasse a trader with dean 
witter reynolds inc 
weighing on wheat prices were a forecast of rain in the great 
plains growing area and talk that secretary of agriculturedesignate 
clayton yeutter isnt too keen on export bonuses lespinasse 
said 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 7 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 437 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 3 cents higher with march at 272 a bushel oats were cent 
to 2 cents lower with march at 235 a bushel and soybeans were 5 
cents to 12 cents higher with march at 767 a bushel 
futures prices of livestock and meat finished mixed to mostly 
lower after drifting higher most of the day on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
the market dipped in anticipation of an agriculture department 
cold storage report showing record inventories of frozen pork 
bellies said chuck levitt livestock analyst for shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
but while the report released after the closing bell had 
1133 million pork bellies on hand dec 31 the largest number ever 
for that date it was still 7 million less than expected said 
levitt 
live cattle prices supported by packer demand were mixed he 
said 
live cattle settled 27 cent lower to 30 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in february at 7282 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 17 cent lower to 30 cent higher with january at 8355 
cents a pound live hogs were 20 cent lower to 10 cent higher with 
february at 4312 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 55 
cent lower to 20 cent higher with february at 3915 cents a pound 
gold and silver prices tumbled on the commodity exchange in new 
york 
comments in washington dc on tuesday by president bush and 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan were interpreted as 
antiinflationary undercutting the prices for precious metals said 
jim steel of refco inc in new york 
gold settled 180 to 290 lower with the contract for delivery 
in january at 40630 a troy ounce and silver was 64 cents to 71 
cents lower with january at 613 a troy ounce 
platinum futures prices fell sharply on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
trading was weighed down by concerns about possible government 
instability in south africa following prime minister pw bothas 
recent illness said steel 
platinum settled 930 to 1230 lower with the contract for 
delivery in january at 53120 a troy ounce 
energy futures rose on the new york mercantile exchange 
traders think something positive could come out of thursdays 
meeting between opec and nonopec nations said analysts 
crude oil settled 21 to 35 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in march at 1754 a barrel and heating oil was 24 cent to

a government appeals board tuesday refused to 
disturb a contract that has been called the computer deal of the 
century denying a challenge by honeywell federal systems inc to 
last falls award to the american telephone amp telegraph co 
the contract at issue is expected to total more than 1 billion 
the board of contract appeals of the general services 
administration has issued an opinion today denying the protest of 
honeywell said judge vincent labella who chaired the threejudge 
panel that considered the matter 
the board proposes to release its opinion to the public 
wednesday after providing the parties an opportunity to request any 
appropriate removal of proprietary material that should be 
protected from disclosure but the protest has been denied 
honeywell federal systems was one of six competitors that fought 
long and hard for the air force contract which was finally awarded 
last october to atampt technologies inc a subsidiary of atampt 
the air force is acting as the executive agent for the other 
armed services which together are trying to standardize and update 
their computer systems the contract calls for atampt technologies to 
deliver about 20000 minicomputers over the next five years 
were very pleased by this decision herb linnen an atampt 
spokesman in washington said tuesday 
from the start we believed the air force conducted a thorough 
and proper evaluation which clearly supported its decision to award 
the contract to atampt 
the air force contract to atampt so far totals 9291 million but 
company and service officials agree its value could easily exceed 1 
billion depending upon what options are exercised 
the air force is buying the computers for its own use as well as 
that of the army navy coast guard defense communications agency 
and defense logistics agency from the moment bids were requested 
the contract had been recognized as being so large it could ensure 
the winner a strong position in the highly competitive industry for 
years to come 
judge labella did not offer any explanation of the gsa boards 
ruling noting the opinion would not be released until wednesday 
one of the main issues however involved the air forces internal 
ranking procedures for bids 
in its appeal honeywell charged it provided the air force a 
best and final offer that substantially undercut that of atampt 
744 million or 185 million below that of the winner while still 
passing technical muster 
the company alleged the air force recalculated its bid upward 
using internal criteria without informing the company but even with 
that change its bid still was more than 140 million below that of 
atampt 
ron cuneo vice president and general manager of honeywell 
federal systems said tuesday he had been informed of the decision 
but i have not seen the opinion obviously 
im disappointed of course that we lost he continued 
somehow you would think in this budget environment that 140 
million would mean something but apparently not generally i think 
the system works but im not sure it did here 
cuneo said it was premature to discuss the possibility of 
appealing the boards decision to the courts

were subpoenaed 
chicago mercantile exchange officials were informed today 
tuesday that many of the cme clearing member firms have been 
served with subpoenas to provide various records relating to trading 
activity on the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile 
exchange the mercantile exchange said in a statement 
the chicago mercantile exchanges attorneys have advised that 
such subpoenas are a normal part of a grand jury investigation and 
do not imply that the firms receiving such subpoenas or their 
officers are targets of the investigation or are suspected of any 
wrongful actions the statement read 
merc spokesman andrew yemma declined further comment on the probe 
the mercs jacobs described the clearing firms as middle men 
between the trader and the mercs own clearing house department 
which clears or matches buy and sell orders made during trading 
each day at the exchange 
clearing firms are required to own seats on the exchanges where 
they do business 
the board of trade and merc are marketplaces in which buyers and 
sellers essentially bet millions of dollars on the futures prices of 
financial instruments and commodities such as treasury bills or 
soybeans 
board of trade spokesman mark prout declined comment on the 
latest subpoenas the board of trade has 136 clearing firms 
prout said the only subpoena he knew about was served last 
thursday to the board of trade by the fbi which ordered the 
exchange to turn over records dating as far back as january 1983 
agents are to review the material at the exchange rather than remove 
the huge volume of documents subpoenaed prout said 
later tuesday two board of trade officials told traders and 
other members the exchange will never tolerate violations of our 
rules and regulations and have always aggressively prosecuted those 
who have broken our rules 
if any members have taken part in trading practices which are 
illegal or violate our rules and regulations they are not 
representative of the 3500 members of the cbot exchange chairman 
karsten mahlmann and president thomas r donovan said in a letter 
separately john troelstrup an attorney who said he represents 
at least one of those subpoenaed last week said he understood that 
some of those targeted by the fbi were to begin appearing before the 
grand jury in chicago on tuesday and wednesday 
he declined to name his clients or to say whether they were among 
those ordered to appear this week 
i know that subpoenas were issued for tomorrow wednesday and 
for a week from tomorrow said harvey silets an attorney who said 
he represents subpoenaed traders from both exchanges 
silets also declined to name his clients or to say when they were 
ordered to appear before the grand jury

farmers from oklahoma and north carolina 
blasted the farmers home administration on tuesday for the 
procedures being used by the government agency in contacting 
delinquent fmha borrowers 
fmha has developed this delinquency notice packet which cost 
you and me about 344000 to mail out to scare farmers during the 
holiday season don schierer a farmer from ponca city okla 
told the senate agriculture subcommittee on agricultural credit 
the information contained in the packet is what the progressive 
farm groups fought for but the fmhas implementation was the most 
narrow and rigid route possible said benny bunting of oak city 
nc chairman of the credit committee of the national family farm 
coalition 
over 80000 delinquent notices were sent under provision of the 
agriculture credit act of 1987 giving borrowers 45 days to request 
consideration in writing for loan program options 
the 45day period fell right at the time of the thanksgiving 
christmas and new year holiday season said sen patrick leahy 
dvt agriculture committee chairman thus fmhas timing was out 
of step with the intent of the act which required final notices be 
published by june 6 also their timing could not have been worse in 
terms of borrowers being able to comply 
sen david boren dokla subcommittee chairman also said the 
fmha has not followed the senates intent 
he chided neil johnson acting fmha administrator for the number 
of forms the agency required farmers to fill out in response to the 
delinquency notice 
the law says you farmers have to sign a letter within a 
45day period not fill out several forms said boren 
he urged johnson to put a safety net under the farmers who 
made an attempt to respond and give them more time 
he said he would ask agriculture secretarydesignate clayton k 
yeutter to make solving the problems connected with implementing the 
law a top priority

mai basic four inc asked a federal judge tuesday 
to lift a court order blocking a 20ashare bid for prime computer 
inc and tried to answer questions about the financing of the deal 
in court documents responding to a judges concerns mai basic 
said drexel burnham lambert inc is confident ofraising 875 million 
to finance the takeover despite its guilty plea in a massive 
securities fraud settlement in new york 
us district court judge a david mazzone last month said mai 
basic needed to make disclosures about the relationship between 
drexel and new york investor bennett s lebow who controls mai 
basic 
mazzone also said mai basic concealed information concerning past 
securities law violations or alleged violations by lebow and william 
weksel another principal in the takeover bid 
mai basic based in tustin calif said that drexel since 1986 
has been the primary financier for lebow and certain of his 
companies and owns 7 percent of mai basics common stock 
if the takeover goes through the disclosures say drexel burnham 
will earn 33 million in financing or advisory fees may perform 
future work worth 22 million in fees and will be allowed to buy 
more mai basic stock at a discount 
mai basic also said weksel agreed to turn over 208000 in 
profits made from a separate stock sale as part of a consent decree 
with the securities and exchange commission in 1986 lebow has been 
sued in connection with that case but no action has been taken 
against him by the sec the disclosures said 
drexel last month agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay 
a record 650 million in fines and restitution to settle the 
securities fraud case in us history 
natickbased prime said the financial disclosures do not provide 
enough information on the deal and that the company will fight to 
keep the court order in place 
prime said in a statement that the documents do not adequately 
explain how mai basic plans to meet federal requirments concerning 
using the takeover targets own stock as collateral for loans needed 
to finance the deal 
as of jan 19 709 percent of primes undiluted outstanding 
common stock had been tendered mai basic spokeswoman toni lee said 
the company has extended its tender offer until jan 30 
but prime spokesman richard eckel said because of the firms 
convertible debentures bonds that the bearers can convert to 
common stock the tenders represent only about 53 percent of the 
total diluted stock 
one of the conditions of mai basics original tender offer was 
that the company control 67 percent of the fully diluted stock 
eckel said 
in a related offensive mai basic released a letter to prime 
blasting the company for an unnecessary exorbitantly expensive 
and clearly unsuccessful program to convince shareholders not to 
accept mai basics offer 
the letter from lebow points out that a majority of shareholders 
have accepted the tender offer and calls on prime officials to 
negotiate

polaroid corp on tuesday rejected as 
inadequate a 32 billion hostile buyout offer from shamrock 
holdings inc setting the stage for a threatened proxy fight for 
control of polaroid 
shamrock a television and radio concern owned by the roy e 
disney family last week increased its offer to 45 per share for 
all polaroid stock including 97 million shares issued under 
polaroids controversial employee stock ownership plan 
the previous offer of 26 billion or 42 per share did not 
include the employee shares 
in a statement polaroid called the latest sweetened offer 
inadequate from a financial point of view and not in the best 
interest of polaroid and its stockholders except shamrock and its 
affiliate 
polaroids board strongly recommends that stockholders reject 
the shamrock offer and not tender any of their shares of common 
stock polaroid stated 
on tuesday polaroid stock rose 12 cents a share to 40 on the 
new york stock exchange 
tom reed a spokesman for shamrock said the burbank 
califbased company would proceed with its plan to nominate a slate 
of candidates for election to polaroids board at the companys 
annual meeting may 9 
shamrocks candidates would be committed if elected to selling 
the company either under shamrocks offer or to any third party that 
made a higher bid 
shamrock president stanley p gold said he was disappointed by 
polaroids rejection of shamrocks 45 per share offer 
in a prepared statement issued from burbank gold said we 
intend to vigorously pursue our tender offer and our previously 
announced plans to wage a proxy contest for control of polaroid if 
our tender offier is not consummated prior to polaroids may annual 
meeting 
polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips declined comment on 
shamrocks proposed proxy challenge 
shamrock said when it extended its offer jan 19 that about 131 
million polaroid shares or 183 percent of the outstanding stock 
had been tendered and not withdrawn 
shamrocks tender offer expires march 15 and is contingent on 
obtaining at least 90 percent of polaroids 716 million outstanding 
shares 
alex henderson an analyst with prudential bache inc said 
polaroids management could be forced into a leveraged buyout to 
thwart shamrocks takeover attempt 
my guess is that the next time shamrock is forced to extend its 
offer that the number of tendered shares will probably move up to 
close to 25 million he said 
henderson said 25 million tendered shares amounting to nearly 
35 percent of the outstanding shares combined with the 69 million 
he said shamrock already holds could frighten polaroid executives 
into financing a leveraged buyout to avoid having to sell the 
company to shamrock 
polaroid has been resisting shamrock since last july when 
shamrock offered 40 per share in a friendly but unsolicited bid 
shamrock is appealing a delaware chancery court ruling upholding 
the employee stock ownership plan the delaware supreme court has 
scheduled a hearing on the appeal march 16 
shamrock contends the employee stock was issued to block a 
takeover if it is invalidated shamrock has promised to raise its 
offer to 336 billion or 47 per share 
the stock plan owns about 14 percent of polaroids stock it 
makes a takeover extremely difficult because under delaware law a 
hostile suitor must gain at least 85 percent of its target for a 
takeover to be allowed polaroid is incorporated in delaware

conagra inc filed suit tuesday in us 
district court in omaha claiming tyson foods inc violated federal 
securities laws by issuing false and misleading statements 
during its bid to acquire holly farms corp 
conagra spokesman walt casey said the suit asks the court to stop 
tyson from issuing any further misrepresentations about tysons 
offer to acquire holly farms or a separate agreement between holly 
farms and conagra 
tyson the nations largest poultryprocessing operation last 
week increased its offer for holly farms to 6350 a share valuing 
the company at 13 billion 
also on tuesday tyson filed an amended suit in a delaware court 
seeking to block the friendly merger worth about 1 billion between 
memphis tennbased holly farms and conagra based in omaha 
last year in an effort to avert the takeover the holly farms 
board of directors worked out the friendly merger with conagra 
tyson went to court in delaware and obtained a ruling that the 
merger didnt adequately protect the rights of holly farms 
shareholders the holly farms board responded to that ruling by 
setting up an auction last week 
last thursday tyson officials said they thought the deal had 
been completed but hours later holly farms board raised some 
concerns about legal entanglements arising from the conagra 
agreement and about tysons ability to make good on its offer 
tyson made a false public claim casey said when the company 
said holly farms had accepted a 63ashare bid from tyson last 
thursday followed by the holly farms boards questions about the 
offer 
casey said tyson also issued a news release last friday 
indicating that the holly farms board would recommend tysons 
6350ashare proposal to shareholders but later holly farms said 
its board was unable to accept tysons proposal 
that intentional market manipulation was part of tysons 
effort to induce holly farms shareholders to prematurely sell their 
stock casey said in a statement 
casey said conagra has two contracts with holly farms a 
termination fee and a lockup option allowing the foodprocessing 
company to buy about half of holly farms key facilities regardless 
of whether the company succeeds in buying holly farms 
any offer that does not recognize those conditions is illusory 
at best casey said in an interview 
conagra does not ask for specific damages in the suit casey said 
the most immediate thing is asking the court to enjoin tyson to 
cease and desist any further misrepresentations casey said 
james blair general counsel for tyson said tuesday that tyson 
has asked a delaware judge to invalidate the merger agreement with 
conagra and issue a declaration that would permit holly farms to 
accept the tyson proposal 
i think its just legal posturing legal ploys blair said 
referring to conagras suit i know our people havent done 
anything wrong however its hard to comment about it until i see 
the suit 
tyson is seeking 500 million in damages from holly farms board 
holly farms and conagra if the deal falls through 
tyson says that lockup option must be removed before it agrees to 
the acquisition

ashland oil inc says its chief executive 
john hall has talked with iranian officials about a possible 
outofcourt settlement of the multimilliondollar lawsuits between 
them 
hall has met from time to time with iranian officials for months 
according to ashland spokesman roger schrum but he said the 
negotiations were mostly about ashlands countersuit 
schrum also denied an oil industry trade publication report 
which quoted an iranian oil official as saying ashland already had 
agreed to pay 283 million to the national iranian oil co 
ashland has not agreed to pay principle or interest involving the 
iranian state oil companys claim schrum told the lexington 
heraldleader on monday 
the case is scheduled to go to trial may 15 in us district 
court in jackson miss a similar but separate lawsuit is winding 
its way through bermuda courts 
national iranian oil has contended that ashland failed to pay for 
283 million worth of oil the iranians sent the company in 1979 
after revolutionaries seized power in iran and took us embassy 
workers hostage in tehran 
jimmy carter who was president at the time imposed a trade 
embargo against iran apparently during the time between the order 
of the oil and its delivery 
the iranian oil company has asked for 283 million plus interest 
bringing the amount of its lawsuit to more than 500 million 
ashland has countersued the iranian company for breach of 
contract contending that the iranians failed to deliver all the oil 
ashland had ordered 
ashlands countersuit could amount to more than 500 million 
iranian deputy oil minister kazempur ardebili however said 
ashland had offered to pay the iranian company the original price of 
the oil shipments according to platts oilgram news 
steve truitt an attorney for national iranian oil in washington 
dc said he was prohibited by law from commenting on the case to 
the news media 
an oil industry analyst said he expected ashland to negotiate a 
settlement with the iranians 
ive always been convinced that they ashland were going to 
settle the only question was how said jack shaughnessy of 
advest inc 
ashland previously set aside the money to settle with the iranian 
company shaughnessy said and ending the case would clear the decks 
of the uncertainty of a trial 
but shaughnessy said he would be surprised if ashland paid the 
iranians as much as 283 million 
a us district court judge has ruled that iranian oil minister 
gholamreza agazadeh must come to the united states to give a 
deposition before the trial 
national iranian oil has appealed the ruling requiring agazadehs 
appearance said alex alston jr a mississippi attorney for the 
company

venezuelan presidentelect carlos 
andres perez said he plans a series of economic reforms including 
elimination of the twotiered foreign exchange system 
perez addressing a group of business leaders late monday said 
the twotiered exchange system in operation to allow subsidized 
imports of strategic goods would be eliminated once he takes office 
feb 2 
the official exchange rate is 1450 bolivars to the dollar while 
the free market rate fluctutates between 30 and 40 bolivars to the 
dollar 
perez did not say whether the bolivar would be allowed to float 
according to the market or whether one single official rate would 
be established 
in the last two days the bolivar has gained on the dollar on 
rumors that the incoming government would establish a single rate of 
about 25 bolivars to the dollar below the current market rate 
along with reform of the exchange system perez promised to do 
away with price controls reduce government spending and free 
interest rates 
advisers to perez earlier this week said the economic reforms 
could even include turning over staterun companies to the private 
sector although perez did not mention this possibility in his 
speech to the business leaders 
venezuela is currently in the initial phases of talks with the 
international monetary fund and the world bank in order to receive 
fresh funds to back up dollar reserves depleted by a stagnating 
economy 
critics of the reform package say perez is giving in to pressures 
from the international banking system that will lead to hardships 
for the general population including soaring inflation with the end 
of subsidized imports and price controls 
perez said his government would not decree an across the board 
wage increase but would mandate a rise in the minimum wage and 
implement a food basket at reduced prices for the poorest 
venezuelans

several of the nations largest petroleum companies said tuesday 
their fourthquarter profit fell as the erosion of crude prices hurt 
oil and gas production dragging down gains in refining and 
marketing 
exxon corp the nations largest oil concern said its profit 
plunged 11 percent while chevrons earnings were down 25 percent 
mobils declined slightly and sun cos profit fell 8 percent 
separately amerada hess corp said its earnings rebounded after a 
loss in the 1987 quarter 
for the threemonth period ended dec 31 exxons net income fell 
to 14 billion or 106 a share from 16 billion or 112 a 
share in the comparable 1987 period 
no 2ranked mobil said earnings declined 1 percent in the latest 
quarter to 469 million or 114 a share from 474 million or 
115 a share in the yearearlier period 
chevrons net income totaled 175 million or 51 cents a share 
from 234 million or 68 cents a share in the yearearlier quarter 
while amerada hess reported net income of 66 million or 80 cents a 
share 
analysts said that after several quarters of rising earnings oil 
companies failed to withstand the steady drop in petroleum prices 
that occured throughout most of 1988 
with the decline in crude prices last year versus a year ago 
the companies just werent able to offset it from stronger 
refining and marketing said thomas c lewis an analyst with duff 
amp phelps corp a chicago investment concern 
however industry experts said tuesday that steadily rising oil 
prices in 1989 could improve exploration and production performance 
in the first quarter but wont necessarily lower margins in 
refining because of recent improvements in that segment of the 
business 
new yorkbased exxon said fourthquarter revenue remained nearly 
unchanged at 22 billion vs a year earlier 
exxon said earnings for all of 1988 rose 9 percent to 53 
billion or 395 a share from 48 billion or 343 a share in 
1987 sales for 1988 rose 5 percent to 875 billion from 833 
billion in 1987 
the company said earnings from refining marketing and chemicals 
operations continued strong in the fourth quarter due to lower 
crude oil acquisition costs and relatively firm product prices 
but weak crude prices resulted in sharply lower earnings from 
exploration and production despite an increase in output exxon 
chairman lg rawl said in the fourth quarter alone exxons us 
production earnings plunged 57 percent to 144 million from 335 
million in the 1987 period and for all of 1988 they fell 37 
percent to 829 million from 12 billion the company said 
mobil also based in new york said fourthquarter revenue 
declined 2 percent to 139 billion from 142 billion in the 
yearearlier period 
for all of 1988 mobil earnings rose 55 percent to 21 billion 
or 509 a share from 13 billion or 328 a share in 1987 
revenue rose 7 percent to 549 billion from 514 billion in 1987 
mobil chairman allen e murray attributed the companys yearly 
gain to improved profit margins in refining and marketing due to 
strong worldwide demand and improved margins in europe japan and
