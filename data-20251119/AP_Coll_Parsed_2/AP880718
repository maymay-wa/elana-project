michael dukakis and jesse jackson held a summit 
just hours before the democratic national convention opened monday 
with jackson saying ive sent a signal for unity in the fall 
campaign and dukakis agreeing to specific steps to strengthen the 
role of his rivals supporters in the party 
dukakis insisted there was no deal no fine print worked out in 
the nearly threehour meeting at his hotel only a better 
relationship with the man who fought for the presidential 
nomination until the end 
i want jesse jackson to play a major role in this campaign i 
want his supporters who are out there by the millions to be 
deeply involved in this campaign dukakis told a packed news 
conference after the meeting and he is going to be involved 
actively and fully 
obviously i want to play a supportive role a complementary 
role jackson said monday night 
the agreement between the candidates includes financial backing 
from party funds to pay for jacksons campaigning on behalf of the 
ticket and needed personal staff said ron brown jacksons 
convention manager 
of course funding will be made available for the travel plans 
for rev jackson said dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas 
if the mans got to travel were not going to let him fly 
commercial said joseph warren a longtime dukakis supporter who 
has been involved in the negotiations make no mistake about it 
what jesse needs jesse will get 
in addition jackson supporters will get close to half the new 
25 atlarge slots on the democratic national committee and a new 
vice dnc chairman 
when the democratic national committee meets on friday it 
will be more reflective of the new democratic party jackson said 
california assemblywoman maxine waters an outspoken jackson 
backer revealed the vice chairman slot as part of the deal and 
pronounced herself satisfied 
dukakis announced it to the world he needs jesse jackson 
she said 
and jackson made it clear that he was sending the signal to his 
supporters that dukakis had looked for since the primaries ended 
ive sent a signal that we are involved jackson said 
adding that dukakis now must send a signal to jackson backers in 
some sense gov dukakis must convey to those persons that he is 
reaching out ot them that he cares for them that they are on his 
agenda when it is all said and done the nominee must convince 
people 
and there was a wave of speculation about jacksons impact on a 
dukakis administration even though jackson says he wants no job 
there are many things one could think of he could be an 
outstanding drug czar said house speaker jim wright he has 
the passion the belief the dedication 
dnc treasurer sharon pratt dixon said that there was clearly 
going to be a reflection of jesse jackson in a dukakis 
administration 
speaking with reporters after the jackson supporter addressed 
the convention dixon said he might be used as sort of a roving 
ambassador jesse jackson sees himself in a more global 
perspective thats his scene thats his stage 
for his part jackson was upbeat about the meeting with dukakis 
and his running mate in part because there were no roadblocks to 
his pushing platform ideas in tuesday nights convention session 
we did not come here for fireworks we came here for noble 
works jackson told more than 2000 of his delegates and 
supporters 
today we had a great meeting with governor dukakis and sen 
lloyd bentsen a serious meeting he added in that meeting 
there was the good judgment that debate is healthy for democracy 
i think there was a real meeting of the minds said brown 
who sat in on the meeting 
the summit meeting was held in dukakiss hotel suite just 
across peachtree street from the hotel where jackson is staying 
jackson has bedeviled dukakis for weeks by pushing his 
presidential hopes and then his hopes for the vice presidency 
saying he and his constituency had earned consideration after 
dukakis picked bentsen for the no 2 spot the tensions between the 
campaigns increased 
at last at the news conference jackson admitted his campaign 
would officially end wednesday night 
im still looking for a chicago miracle jackson said a 
near impossibility considering dukakis lock on far more than a 
majority of the delegates if the miracle does not come to pass 
then well have passed over to the next phase of our campaign 
a bit later the greekamerican governor of massachusetts 
replied i dont think were going to have a chicago miracle 
were going to have an athenian miracle 
jackson said he wouldnt encourage anyone to put his name on the 
roll call on thursday night when bentsen is scheduled to be 
confirmed as the vice presidential nominee 
and jackson promised to work for the ticket against george bush 
and the republicans in the fall 
we met and discussed matters of serious and significant 
concern a relationship of substance support and candor the 
commitment to help build a team that will expand our party and 
carry us to victory in november he told the news conference 
at a later stop jackson added there was no discussion today 
on the planks for the platform 
asked if he was depressed by the end of his campaign jackson 
said it was the opposite theres a sense of relief 
brountas denied that any agreement was reached that would 
guarantee jackson supporters a role in a transition to a dukakis 
administration should the democrats win in the fall 
we decided not to go beyond the campaign brountas said 
jackson agreed adding that a future role will follow naturally 
thats a bit far off but it stands to reason if youre part of 
the campaign if you win you are part of the transition and 
youre part of the government lets take it one step at a 
time

former president jimmy carter the last democrat 
to occupy the white house was back on prime time monday night at 
the opening session of the democratic national convention and told 
delegates that we are the party of change 
introduced as a great american and a great democrat carter 
forecast that the partys presidential ticket of michael dukakis 
and lloyd bentsen would recapture the white house not just so 
democrats can take office in washington but because we know that 
change is long overdue 
we want the federal deficit brought under control we want a 
coherent foreign policy he said we want to bring back to 
washington people who are more interested in public service that in 
private gain 
the former president swept out of office by ronald reagan in 
1980 took a jab at republican george bushs effort to continue 
running against him by reminding voters of the doubledigit 
interest and inflation rates that prevailed during his last year in 
office 
i have one announcement to make said carter which like a 
number of other things this year may come as a bit of a surprise to 
the incumbent vice president 
my name is jimmy carter and i am not running for president 
did you hear that george 
the former president was the last speaker at the opening 
session taking the podium about a half hour after texas state 
treasurer ann richards delivered the keynote address 
by the time he spoke the crowd that packed the hall for ms 
richards speech had thinned and many seats were empty 
former secretary of state edmund s muskie who introduced 
carter reminded the delegates of the camp david accords which 
brought peace between egypt and israel 
he told the truth he made his country strong said muskie 
during his speech carter appealed to the democrats to unite 
behind the partys presidential ticket 
if i had to give you just one special message tonight i would 
summarize it in a single word he said unity 
let us go forth from this convention united behind our 
candidates and our ideals and with our eyes on the prize he 
said 
carter carried only six states and the district of columbia in 
1980 and the economic statistics the iran hostage crisis and his 
description of the nation as suffering from a malaise were 
frequent targets of republican rhetoric in the 1984 campaign 
his presidency was seen even by many democrats as a failure and 
he was largely ignored by his party for years although he 
addressed the 1984 convention in san francisco 
but this year he was welcomed back by his party just as he 
welcomed the democrats to georgia where he served as governor 
before running for president 
hours before carter addressed the convention dukakis and jesse 
jackson turned up for a luncheon at the carter presidential center 
in his convention speech carter praised both men 
jesse jackson has stirred the soul of our country given hope 
to millions and healed wounds that have too long divided our 
people from one another he is an inspired leader destined for 
further greatness he said 
dukakis said carter ran a brilliant campaign of substance 
and respect for the intelligence of the american people hell be a 
great leader for our country 
carter said the nation deserves a foreign policy based on the 
values that unite us as americans and then turning to criticism 
of the reagan administration he cited unilateral white house 
decisions us marines dying in lebanon harbors illegally 
mined and contras illegally armed ransom paid in weapons to the 
ayatollah appeasement in the face of apartheid in south africa 
we democrats do not fear change he said we welcome it 
change means hope change means life above all change means 
opportunity 
our party is best equipped to meet the challenge of change 
because we are the party of change

asianamericans are better paid and better 
educated than american whites but a report by government civil 
rights experts is reluctant to declare an asian success story 
and insists that discrimination still exists 
presentation of the 289page study to the us commission on 
civil rights which had ordered it prompted concern over its 
impact one commissioner mary frances berry of the university of 
pennsylvania said it might lead to more discrimination when the 
public realizes how much more asians are earning 
six of the seven commissioners voted friday to hold off on 
adopting the document as an official government report until more 
outside experts can review and interpret it 
the study billed as the first comprehensive look at the incomes 
of nearly 4 million asianamerican residents shows that 
nativeborn american families with chinese ancestry earn 50 percent 
more than families in which both husband and wife are white and 
korean and japanese families earn 46 percent and 44 percent more 
respectively 
but some asianamerican ethnic groups are not faring so well 
usborn filipinos and indians along with recently immigrated 
vietnamese have below average incomes with nonimmigrant filipino 
families earning 80 percent of nonhispanic whites indians 71 
percent and vietnamese immigrants 60 percent 
based on 1980 census and morerecent immigration figures the 
study puts average annual income for usborn chinese families at 
39805 compared with 26514 for white families the figures for 
other households headed by asianamericans born in the united 
states are korean 38610 japanese 38324 filipino 21190 
and indian 18789 
no figures are given for usborn vietnamese since nearly all 
vietnamese have come to the united states within the last 25 years 
and few adults are native americans 
in the figures for more recently immigrated asian families 
incomes are much closer to those of white americans with the 
exception of vietnamese immigrants who earn an average of 15873 
the study says 
the study notes that immigrant asian families tend to be 
somewhat larger than other us families with more family members 
working but this is not necessarily true of asian families which 
have been in the united states for generations 
it also says that poverty rates are lower than average for us 
chinese japanese and korean families while they tend to be higher 
than average for families who trace their roots to the philippines 
india and vietnam 
commission assistant staff director james cunningham who helped 
direct the study said it was undertaken with the understanding 
that discrimination exists against asianamericans and was an 
attempt to measure its impact 
the fact that it shows higherthanaverage earnings for most 
asian ethnic groups however is by no means to say there is an 
asian success story cunningham said 
the study points out that early asian immigrants were laborers 
with a second wave beginning in the 1960s consisting of 
highereducated people who should qualify for betterpaying jobs 
the trend recently has swung back to lessskilled immigrants coming 
to join us resident family members it says 
the study gives the average years of schooling for asians born 
in the united states as 149 for chinese 1382 for koreans 1373 
for japanese 1342 for indians and 124 for filipinos the average 
for nonhispanic whites is 1286 
the study says asians historically have suffered serious 
discrimination in the united states sometimes due to antiasian 
laws and it says there are still some instances of it 
but it concludes that there now is not systematic job 
discrimination against asians in general 
and it says there is no evidence of job discrimination against 
asian women either nativeborn or foreignborn with ethnic asian 
women more likely to work and earn more than white women 
but the study says the statistics indicate employment and 
earnings disparities may be caused by labor market discrimination 
directed against nativeborn indian and filipino men 
it also says that further study is needed to determine whether 
asians are prevented from attaining high management levels because 
of their racial origins the study says that while there are more 
asians per capita than whites in professional positions fewer 
attain management status 
the census data do not enable us to determine whether such a 
pattern is caused by discrimination or choice says the report 
which was written largely by staff economist harriet duleep 
the 1980 census lists the us asian population as 806040 
chinese 774652 filipinos 700974 japanese 361531 indians 
354593 koreans 261729 vietnamese and 378644 with other asian or 
pacific origins filipinos who have been immigrating in far 
greater numbers than other asian groups over the past several 
years are now believed to outnumber us chinese 
asian minorities make up about 145 percent of the total us 
population

federal investigators probing alleged fraud in 
pentagon weapons contracts have subpoenaed records related to a 
florida health club in which rep bill chappell once had an 
interest a lawyer said sunday 
edwin c cluster of ocala fla said he received a subpoena 
dated june 23 from the federal grand jury in alexandria va 
requesting documents related to the health club and to the company 
that acquired the club from chappell a florida democrat 
cluster refused to elaborate saying in a telephone interview 
i got the subpoena and thats all ill say 
federal officials are investigating allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could be 
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
chappell whose name has come up in connection with the defense 
probe is chairman of a house appropriations subcommittee on 
defense however authorities have said no member of congress is a 
target in the investigation 
the washington post reported earlier this month that the racquet 
club of ocala inc intervened in late 1984 to cancel chappells and 
his partners personal liability for a large part of their 
indebtedness for a failed ocala health club and also removed the 
two men as defendants in a suit related to its foreclosure 
the principal officers of the racquet club were leonard killgore 
and george l dalferes killgore a former chappell aide was then 
an official with the washington office of avco corp a rocket 
builder the post reported in mondays editions that chappell 
acknowledged in a 1984 civil case that he began living in 
killgores house with the killgore family in october or november of 
1983 
dalferes was vice president of government affairs at martin 
marietta corp another major defense contractor at the 
companys office just outside washington martin marietta reported 
that it bought the health club in may 1986 a little more than a 
year after dalferes and his partners rescued it from foreclosure in 
the deal that canceled chappells personal liability for the failed 
health club 
the citizens lobby group common cause has called on the house 
ethics committee to investigate chappells ties to military 
contractors citing the arrangement to relieve chappell of 
liability on the health club 
chappell in a statement in early july said there was 
absolutely no benefit to me either way from the transaction 
it was an arms length transaction as supported by public 
record he said 
contacted by the post about the subpoena he said through a 
spokesman that the truth about the deal had been misrepresented and 
he declined further comment

fifteen years after the first oil embargo the 
us economy has stopped making gains in energy efficiency 
according to experts who say the country may be losing ground 
low prices account for the change along with the fact the 
united states uses much more energy in comparison with other 
countries analysts say 
the energy information administration has revised 1987 figures 
to show efficiency unchanged from 1986 jerry lagace an eia 
economist said in an interview friday 
its the first time since 1976 that efficiency failed to improve 
lagace noted that energy efficiency in the economy may have 
increased for the first quarter of the year over the 1987 quarter 
but the 35 percent increase is so large that i dont believe it 
this will probably be revised downward 
gains have been running at about 25 percent per year since the 
mid1970s eia had expected future gains of about 1 percent per 
year preliminary 1987 statistics had indicated a 05 percent gain 
over 1986 
lagace said further study is needed to pin down reasons growing 
exports of goods that take a lot of energy to produce such as farm 
machinery could be one reason more driving is another possibility 
efficiency has been improving throughout the industrial market 
economies since the 1960s though the 1973 oil embargo greatly 
accelerated it us performance has been strong some major us 
competitors have done better 
energy is very cheap here said art rosenfeld director of 
the center for building science at the lawrence livermore national 
laboratory at berkeley calif 
when you and i were growing up they flared natural gas and 
we built a lot of uninsulated houses because it was cheaper to burn 
more gas than to add insulation rosenfeld said in an interview 
attitudes change slowly so we havent paid attention to 
investments that take five six or seven years to pay back like 
the germans and the japanese do rosenfeld said 
europe and japan use high gasoline taxes to raise revenue and 
hold down consumption while the united states throughout the 1970s 
kept gasoline under price controls and required minimum mileage 
standards for automobiles gasoline in italy last year was 
quadruple the us price in japan triple and in germany more than 
double 
today the average new us car must get 26 miles per gallon and 
all cars average 189 mpg 42 percent better than in 1973 the 
average italian car gets 30 mpg and in japan the average is 31 mpg 
if us cars nevermind trucks and buses did as well as 
italys us gasoline consumption in 1986 would have been about 28 
billion gallons or 25 percent less 
triple the price of gasoline and usage would be cut in half 
over time said mark ross a professor of physics at the 
university of michigan who is working on energy studies 
last years 948 cent average price for a gallon of unleaded 
regular was the lowest ever after factoring out inflation 
many americans want big gains before doing anything several 
studies have shown that homeowners refuse storm windows and other 
projects offered by utilities if the payback takes longer than six 
months 
industries with reserves of engineering talent like chemicals 
and electronics have made major strides dow chemical co usa 
recorded a 40 percent reduction in energy needed to make a pound of 
chemicals from 1972 to 1987 
but many are ignoring opportunities it takes 25 million btus 
for us steel makers to produce a ton japan does it with 17 
million said william chandler an analyst with the batelle 
memorial institutes washington office 
international energy agency figures show the united states in 
eighth place among 20 major countries in industrial efficiency 
gains from 1973 through 1985 behind japan luxembourg britain 
germany denmark italy and belgium and fourth behind canada 
norway and luxembourg in use measured by energy per dollar of 
value added in manufacturing mining construction and agriculture 
some gains stem from the decline of heavy industry the iea 
estimated that lower production accounted for 55 percent of the 
reduction in us total industrial energy use from what it would 
have been in 1983 if efficiency trends of the 1960s had continued 
unchanged that was a recession year and later figures are not 
available 
overall counting cars buildings and everything the united 
states still uses more energy per dollar than anybody but canada 
the united states was 24 percent below canada but 22 percent 
above thirdplace new zealand 97 percent above west germany 110 
percent above japan and 144 percent above the best performer 
switzerland 
the 23 percent us improvement over 1973 was bettered only by 
luxembourgs 43 percent and japans 31 percent 
there are longer distances to drive in the united states but 
chandler said geography and climate account for at most a 
quarter of the differences with europe

drought and heat have riddled much of this 
years grain crop but some conservationists already are worried 
about 1989 and what might happen if good weather sends farmers 
flocking into fields to catch up 
assuming the drought breaks and farmers have a normal season in 
1989 beginning with this falls planting of next years winter 
wheat crop producers could opt to take advantage of higher 
commodity prices by staying out of federal acreage programs and 
plant fencerow to fencerow 
kenneth a cook senior associate at the conservation 
foundation a private research organization based in washington 
says congress ought to look harder at this question before putting 
the finishing touches on an emergency aid plan to help farmers 
recover from the drought 
lets say a guy gets a check for 10000 or 20000 or 
50000 cook said is there any expectation that if hes 
gotten that assistance in the fall of 1988 hell have to behave 
responsibly toward his land in the spring of 1989 
the measure which appears all but certain to be signed by 
president reagan has cleared the senate agriculture committee it 
would provide payments of up to 100000 for droughtstricken 
farmers and could cost up to 7 billion overall 
similar aid is being packaged in the house but was kept open 
for possible finetuning when lawmakers return to work on july 26 
after working out differences between senate and house versions 
the droughtaid bill could reach the white house in august or early 
september 
some of these checks are going to be pretty big cook said 
in a telephone interview friday do we have a hold on that fellow 
next year when hes going out to plant his fields 
cook said he and other environmental advocates fear the 
droughtaid money being earmarked by congress could help finance 
crop expansion that might threaten millions of acres of land that 
should not be planted at all 
this involves the setaside or acreage reserve land that is 
taken from production under annual commodity programs to qualify a 
farmer for price supports and target price deficiency payments 
on the remainder of his acreage used for crops 
farmers signed up to take 54 million acres from production this 
year under these annual programs which include wheat feed grains 
cotton and rice under the 1985 farm law they are required to 
maintain the idled land in ways to protect it from erosion 
that doesnt include 25 million acres locked out of production 
for 10 years under the longterm conservation reserve program 
under it farmers agree to idle highly erodible land and protect it 
by planting grass or trees in return for annual rental payments 
from the government 
another provision of the 1985 law involves sodbuster and 
swampbuster prohibitions against plowing up new land for crops 
if a farmer does that he stands a chance of losing all price 
support and other benefits 
but cook said that if commodity prices remain or continue 
higher many farmers may be tempted to stay out of government 
programs in hopes of making it financially on larger plantings at 
least for a year or two 
what happens when the good times roll thats the question 
were asking and were hoping that the good times do roll he 
said we want prices to come back because its bad for the 
environment when prices are low and farmers are not able to afford 
good conservation 
cook added but its nonsense to think that without some kind 
of control were going to have sound conservation during a period 
of expansion the 1970s proved that 
beginning with huge grain sales to the soviet union in the early 
1970s exports soared encouraging more land to be brought into 
production the export market faded in the early 1980s however 
and federal programs had to be expanded to take more land out of 
production 
the current drought is reducing grain stockpiles sharply and has 
sent commodity prices up sharply on friday the labor department 
reported that drought sent wholesale prices of raw food up 42 
percent in june the most in more than 2 years 
examples of price increases at the unprocessedfood level in 
june according to the labor department included wheat up 253 
percent corn 243 percent and soybeans 22 percent 
strong conservation measures come about in hard times as they 
did in the 1985 law because politically the farm community 
needed to get the large amounts of funds that were required cook 
said 
now were in a situation where its a drought and it truly 
is an emergency in many parts of the country he added we know 
that assistance is needed and the environmental community stands 
strongly behind assistance to the farm sector thats not the 
question the question is what happens next year if farm prices 
continue higher and if participation in the programs drops

cleanup crews have recovered close 
to 460000 gallons of spilled oil from the port of corpus christi 
and officials say the shortterm damage to wildlife appears to be 
minor 
the port was closed at midnight wednesday after the nord 
pacific a 780foot oil tanker crashed into a southwestern 
refinery oil dock spilling more than 600000 gallons of oil 
the inner harbor was opened friday to ship traffic on a limited 
daytimeonly basis said coast guard lt margaret jones 
things are going so smooth that it looks like we might be able 
to open fully monday or tuesday ms jones said 
were pretty effective at getting the oil out of the water 
she said theres been some normal sheen of oil in the water but 
no oil has been stirred up 
the spill endangered birds and marine life officials said and 
may have a longterm affect on wildlife 
there will be a reduction in food sources such as plankton 
needed by such organisms as shrimp and crabs larry gamble 
environmental contaminant specialist for the us fish and wildlife 
service said saturday 
gamble said crabs and jellyfish have been affected by the spill 
but that the shortterm damage appeared to be minimal 
ive found quite a few blue crabs fiddler crabs and one 
hermit crab dead in the marshy area he said in addition he 
said at least two birds and an opossum died from the spill 
there have probably been more than two birds killed because 
when birds are injured theyre vulnerable to prey and so they hide 
and we might not have found them yet gamble said 
gamble and volunteers sounded a propane cannon and air horns 
saturday to steer birds away from the oily marsh area near the 
dock volunteers have been at the scene every day since the 
accident

president augusto pinochet evidently 
seeking eight more years of rule has toned down his authoritarian 
image in public appearances he portrays himself as tenderhearted 
as well as toughminded 
in addition the rightwing army commander tries to present his 
government as more democratic and participative political analysts 
see it as a bid to win the electoral backing of many undecided 
chileans 
i cant govern alone i need you to help me he told a group 
of youths at a breakfast meeting in the southern city of concepcion 
during a questionandanswer session peppered with avuncular 
observations and jokes 
he told the audience a new period of rule for his government 
will bring fundamental change there will be a democracy 
the government plans by early october a yesorno ballot on a 
presidential candidate to be picked by the heads of the army air 
force navy and national police no specific date has been set and 
no candidate yet named but pinochet who as army chief will 
participate in the selection is seen as the probable nominee 
if he wins the ballot the candidate will serve eight years 
starting in march 1989 if he loses an open election will be held 
in 1990 and pinochet remains in power until then 
pinochets frequent trips and public rallies have all the 
earmarks of a presidential campaign in high gear confetti and 
balloons fill the air colorful banners proclaim support for a 
yes vote and crowds cheer pinochets predictions of an 
electoral victory 
his change in personal style has emerged at the gatherings and 
in progovernment advertisements aired regularly on television 
threepiece suits have been substituted for the military uniform he 
long favored gone are the scowl and dark sunglasses of the first 
years after he seized power in a bloody 1973 coup 
he smiles broadly kissing and embracing women and children 
during trips to the provinces he always drops in at a local 
bookstore and buys several volumes on religion philosophy and 
history 
during the overnight trip to concepcion he purchased among 
other books erich fromms the art of loving 
in an interview published by the santiago newspaper la tercera 
pinochet stressed his human side declaring those who know me 
well realize i am not a tough man but a principled one 
ive never had trouble getting along with anyone he was 
quoted as saying 
maria eugenia hirmas a sociologist specializing in mass 
communications says pinochets campaign strategists are starting 
to introduce elements that neutralize his image of toughness and 
intransigence 
they have him in civilian dress they show him in contact with 
children and young people with women smiling and with an open 
expression she wrote in a study for the santiagobased latin 
american institute for transnational studies 
she told the associated press that the intent is to show him 
as a family man the loving grandfather a man with whom you can 
talk 
she noted however that pinochet still retains his tough side 
which reveals itself in intense anger and scathing sarcasm whenever 
he refers to his critics 
addressing a recent rally of supporters in talcahuano a port 
city near concepcion pinochet called opposition leaders 
traitors and said they have sold their own mothers for 
political gain 
in the plebescite he said we will wipe them off the map 
the crowd loved the tough talk responding with the chant 
hard hand pinochet 
he has two messages for two different groups mrs hirmas 
said for the more moderate group he is a man of reason capable 
of leading a political transition for the other group he is the 
tough military man saying watch out we know how to use force 
carlos huneeus a political scientist and pollster openly 
critical of pinochet said he believes the new softer image is 
prompted by opinion surveys which show a no vote prevailing in 
the plebescite 
he said it is aimed at winning over the substantial bloc of 
voters who say they havent yet decided how to vote 
in huneeus most recent monthly opinion poll conducted for an 
institute run by the academy of christian humanism about 25 
percent of those surveyed said they plan to vote yes about 41 
percent plan to reject the candidate the rest said they are 
undecided or dont plan to vote 
other polls by oppositionbacked organizations show similar 
results 
governmentcontracted polls show most people voting yes but all 
polls show about 30 percent of the public undecided or at least 
unwilling to admit their stance 
huneeus told the ap that softening pinochets image was like 
trying to declaw a tiger and has not improved his standing in the 
polls 
this mans popularity isnt rising he said you cant 
change your image overnight

the soviet style of government has handicapped 
scientific research and there have been efforts to hide its 
inadequacies behind showcased examples of success a leading 
russian scientist says in an article published in a us journal 
roald z sagdeev director of the soviet space research 
institute and a member of the ussr academy of sciences says a 
bureaucracy led by comically obtuse leaders with little 
understanding of science has stifled soviet research for decades 
and left science there weak and unproductive 
sagdeev writing in the quarterly journal issues in science and 
technology said the soviets can be justly proud of 
contributions to the study of the laser the launching of sputnik 
and of subsequent achievements in space 
but because of illconceived government policies during 
the past half century soviet science has suffered deep and still 
bleeding wounds said sagdeev who is a key science adviser to 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
exaggerated claims have been made for the achievements of 
soviet science sagdeev said science has its own criteria for 
success however and soviet achievements have not measured up to 
them 
he said science has failed to strengthen industrial productivity 
because we have not faced up to the real problem soviet 
fundamental science is too weak to contribute much to practical 
applications 
the shortcomings in soviet science are apparent from the 
subatomic world of physics to the boundless world of astronomy 
he said soviet scientists sagdeev said have contributed little 
or nothing to the recent new discoveries in atomic physics in 
astronomy or in biology 
a leading problem is that few soviet scientists have access to 
computers sagdeev said while scientists in other countries use 
them routinely when the soviets planned to send a satellite to 
halleys comet scientists in the soviet space research institute 
had to build a computer because such a machine is not made by 
soviet industry he said 
while researchers around the world are taking advantage of 
these magnificent tools computers soviet research workers and 
engineers resemble soldiers attempting to fight a modern war with 
crossbows he said 
he said since world war ii soviet attempts at major science 
projects have been increasingly dragged down by bureaucratic 
machinery that smothers original research 
department barriers he said keep laboratory researchers from 
communicating with students thus handicapping the soviet 
production of new scientists 
bureaucrats attempted to apply central production planning 
techniques to science research said sagdeev often with ludicrous 
results 
in the 1960s scientists even had to promise to achieve a 
specific amount of progress within a designated period he said 
some physicists recognizing the absurdity of the exercise 
pledged to make one discovery of worldwide importance two 
discoveries of allunion importance and three of siberian 
importance to please political leaders at all levels 
while scientists he said saw this as nonsense political 
leaders can be comically obtuse 
french german and american science is vibrant with new ideas 
while soviet science is stultifying he said 
sagdeev has published similar criticisms in soviet publications 
the national academy of sciences said sagdeev wrote and 
submitted the article for us publication in issues which is 
published by the academy the national academy of engineering and 
the institute of medicine

president reagan is relaxing at his 
california ranch while the democratic party installs michael 
dukakis as its presidential nominee 
reagan who already has made several speeches on behalf of the 
gop nomineetobe vice president george bush plans an active role 
in trying to keep the white house in republican hands this fall 
the president and his wife nancy flew to their mountaintop 
ranch from washington on sunday to spend a comfortable and quiet 
week in the seclusion of the santa ynez mountains while the 
democratic national convention takes place in atlanta 
white house spokesmen have gone out of their way to sidestep 
reporters questions about whether reagan will be following the 
events in atlanta but reagan left no doubt in his saturday radio 
address that he expects to hear much said there in criticism of his 
policies 
during the radio address reagan urged listeners to accept his 
argument that he has steered the nation toward economic good times 
and cautioned americans against accepting a badtimes message from 
the democrats 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan would spend 
this week much like he has spent previous vacations at rancho del 
cielo mixing light paperwork with horseback riding and ranch 
chores reagan may sign some congressional legislation while he is 
in california 
the reagans will spend the week at the ranch with no public 
appearances scheduled and will return to washington next sunday 
reagan has few major outings planned between now and midaugust 
when he will travel to new orleans to appear at the opening session 
of the republican national convention 
the white house has said reagan plans at least one 
campaignrelated appearance per week from labor day until congress 
adjourns likely in the first week of october and then will hit 
the campaign stump twice a week on behalf of bush and other

slade gorton says he lost his us senate 
seat in 1986 because he didnt listen enough to the voters two 
years later hes attempting a rare comeback and hes all ears 
all kinds of people ask why why did i lose that 1986 
campaign the 60year republican told his kickoff rally in 
spokane this spring there are many answers but the most 
important can be reduced to a single simple word listening 
one thing i pledge he said when i am taught a lesson i 
learn it well and for good 
gorton a former state attorney general and state house majority 
leader was one of several conservative republican senators swept 
into office by the ronald reagan landslide of 1980 he upset new 
deal democrat warren magnuson by campaigning as a younger more 
vigorous and more fiscally conservative candidate 
but six years later gorton was swept out as disaffection with 
the reagan administration helped democrats recapture the senate he 
lost a close race to brock adams a former congressman and 
transportation secretary in the carter administration 
gorton returned home to practice law but he bounded back onto 
the political scene in april six months after sen dan evans a 
fellow republican made the surprise announcement that he would not 
seek reelection 
evans a former governor was appointed to the senate in 1983 
after the death of democrat sen henry m jackson and won a special 
election that year to complete jacksons term 
chastened and eager to dispel an image of aloofness gorton said 
his new efforts to listen more and talk less have led to a tougher 
stance on fighting drugs and crime a holdtheline approach on 
federal taxes and a pledge not to tamper with social security 
costofliving increases he calls for the death penalty for some 
drug pushers and opposes increases in personal taxes 
he also has to contend with a strong propat robertson faction 
in the state gop and a primay opponent former white house aide 
doug smith who says gorton is too liberal and does not represent 
the republican party he also is weak and indecisive 
still gorton is the oddson favorite to defeat smith in the 
sept 20 primary and polls show him ahead of both of the democrats 
running that day us rep mike lowry of seattle who was defeated 
by evans in the special senatorial election and us rep don 
bonker of vancouver 
i have tried to have an appeal to everyone from robertson 
republicans to scoop jackson democrats he said my support is 
very very broad 
he calls bonker and lowry very liberal liberals and says 
that except for very minor differences their actual message is 
identical 
they seem to be competing for the same 20 percent on the left 
and leaving most of the 80 percent in the rest of the political 
spectrum to us 
if successful gorton would become only the sixth person in more 
than 60 years to win a senate race then lose one and then win 
again according to the senate historians office the last senator 
to do so was chapman w revercomb a republican from west virginia 
he won office in 1942 lost a reelection bid in 1948 lost again 
in 1952 then won a special election in 1956 to complete the term 
of sen harley m kilgore who died in office 
more recently democrat howard m metzenbaum of ohio was 
appointed to the senate in 1973 to fill a vacancy when republican 
william b saxbe resigned to become attorney general under 
president nixon metzenbaum lost in the 1974 primary to john h 
glenn jr but then won election to the senate in 1976 ousting 
republican robert taft jr

richard thornburgh the attorney general 
nominee gained a reputation as a hardliner on law enforcement 
issues during his two terms as pennsylvania governor favoring the 
death penalty and a tough stance on drugs 
thornburgh who turned 56 on saturday had a mixed record on 
abortion and a civil rights record one black leader termed 
indifferent 
as former us attorney former assistant attorney general and 
twoterm governor thornburgh has a full background on issues but 
none of them is expected to prove a stumbling block for quick 
approval of thornburghs nomination 
the senate judiciary committee is planning an early august 
hearing on thornburgh with a full senate vote possible before 
congress recesses for three weeks after aug 12 
initial capitol hill reaction to his appointment has been 
positive with senators focusing not so much on thornburghs record 
as on his credentials 
the hearings are not expected to produce the fireworks that 
surrounded consideration of thornburghs predecessor edwin meese 
iii meeses conservative views as well as ethical concerns voiced 
by his critics led to a 13month confirmation fight that ended in 
a 6331 vote of approval by a republicancontrolled senate in 
february 1985 
thornburgh a yale graduate was not touched by scandal during 
his eight years in harrisburg pa ending in 1986 he remains 
popular and has not ruled out another run for governor in 1990 
but his tenure was not without controversy and some of the 
issues that made pennsylvania headlines are likely to present 
themselves in his new post 
on civil rights i certainly dont think you could put him in 
the category of outstanding he was indifferent said democratic 
state rep dwight evans of philadelphia a member of the 
pennsylvania legislatures black caucus 
caucus members complained of inaction by thornburghs 
administration in the face of accusations of racial discrimination 
by the state police in hiring and promoting black officers in a 
wellpublicized case a federal judge found in 1983 that 
courtmartial charges against a black state police lieutenant were 
racially motivated 
evans said thornburgh did not distinguish himself in hiring 
blacks or helping minority businesses win state contracts the 
governor had two black cabinet members 
but sen arlen specter rpa a member of the judiciary 
committee who has known thornburgh for 22 years said hes been 
very sensitive on civil rights issues i think hes got a good 
record on that 
on abortion thornburghs appointment was criticized by sen 
gordon humphrey rnh who said from the point of view of the 
prolife movement the nomination is a bitter disappointment 
actually thornburgh has a mixed record on abortion 
in december 1981 he vetoed a restrictive abortion law saying 
he objected to a section that said life started as conception and 
another that mandated a 24hour waiting period but in 1982 
thornburgh signed a watereddown version of the bill that required 
doctors to notify women about the risks of abortion and the 
availability of medical assistance for prenatal care and childbirth 
on prisoner paroles thornburgh ended the liberal policy of his 
democratic predecessor milton shapp of reducing sentences so 
inmates could be eligible for parole 
in pennsylvania a life sentence means exactly that unless 
commuted by the governor even when it was recommended by the 
pardons board thornburgh seldom commuted a sentence to permit 
parole 
thornburghs administration saw restoration of the death penalty 
and he signed execution warrants for several convicted murderers 
but stays were granted by courts and the chair still has not been 
used in the state for more than 20 years 
as governor thornburgh signed a bill mandating a fiveyear 
prison term for anyone convicted of using a gun during a crime and 
supported efforts to provide tougher sentences for some 
drugrelated crimes 
thornburgh typically cautious with the press said at the white 
house tuesday that he could not answer substantive questions on 
whether he would pursue an ethics investigation of meese 
in resigning meese said he was vindicated by an unreleased 
independent counsels report into his conduct that reportedly 
recommends no criminal charges among other matters the counsel 
looked at meeses assistance to wedtech a defense contractor under 
investigation for alleged payoffs to win government contracts

jesse jackson on sunday denounced as an 
illusion the idea that nomineetobe michael dukakis should 
dominate the democratic national convention saying this is not a 
coronation while the two sides agreed to meet monday 
as talks between the two campaigns continued jackson called on 
his delegates to be disciplined for the fourday convention 
warning he might contest dukakis every step of the way 
if you have a quarter that was all smooth it would be 
counterfeit there has to be some indentation and there has to be 
some debate and deliberation to arrive at a consensus jackson 
said on cbs face the nation 
jackson called dukakis on sunday morning for another private 
telephone talk on the day the massachusetts governor headed to 
atlanta 
i did it to keep lines of communication open jackson told a 
news conference in the afternoon 
dukakis confirmed the call but neither man would reveal the 
details 
we talked on the telephone this morning dukakis said 
well probably be talking a little later this evening and im 
sure were going to be meeting during the course of the 
convention 
dukakis aides said the governor had scrapped at least part of 
his monday morning schedule and later dukakis spokesman dayton 
duncan announced the two would meet privately monday at 830 am 
at dukakis campaign hotel 
sources who asked not to be identified by name said that dukakis 
and jackson were negotiating several issues including jacksons 
demand to play a significant role in a transition effort in forming 
a democratic administration if dukakis is elected in november 
dukakis sources said it would be better to deal with the issue 
after the election 
these sources also said jackson is seeking the right to appoint 
two or three dozen atlarge members to the democratic national 
committee a step that would increase his clout in the party 
structure 
dukakis rival also wants an agreement outlining an officially 
sanctioned role in the fall campaign including financial support 
from dukakis it was not clear whether jackson had explicitly asked 
dukakis to provide him with a charter jet of his own 
a dukakis source said the dukakis camp would welcome campaign 
efforts by jackson particularly in voter registration but that 
any funds would have to come from the party 
in addition the two sides were discussing unresolved platform 
issues although these did not appear to be the main stumbling 
block toward a unity agreement 
dukakis was said to be insistent that party chairman paul kirk 
remain in his post as long as he wants 
apart from the negotiations with jackson dukakis was said to be 
considering a plan to appoint a transition planning office in the 
days immediately after he leaves atlanta one name mentioned as a 
potential head of the effort was marcia hale who has played a key 
role in organizing the convention for the massachusetts governor 
there can be no final resolution until there is mutual trust 
and respect and a feeling of comfort which can only grow from a 
facetoface meeting said jackson convention manager ron brown 
we expect there will be a meeting the time hasnt been 
determined said dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas after a 
twohour afternoon meeting with jackson aides 
california assembly speaker willie brown a jackson aide said 
the talks were proceeding in a pleasant vein 
at a series of campaign stops across the convention city 
jackson kept up the pressure on dukakis 
this is not a coronation this is a convention he told 
several hundred cheering labor delegates in a sweltering hotel room 
where the temperature topped 100 degrees 
were not threatening to leave the convention were talking 
about threatening to stay he told the delegates 
jackson made it clear that he is not ready simply to allow 
dukakis and his forces to have a smooth debatefree convention 
starting monday 
the fact is minority planks will be debated and deliberated 
upon and decided by the convention jackson said our minority 
planks are majority positions for example most americans do not 
want any more taxes on the middle class and poor people but 
corporations and the wealthy must pay their share 
told that dukakis doesnt want a call for higher taxes in the 
platform and that its supposed to be his convention jackson 
quickly responded 
thats an illusion this is a convention of the people its 
the delegates convention they will determine who the nominee will 
be they will determine what planks will be agreed upon 
at a baptist church jackson vowed to press on 
our time is upon us now he told more than 1000 people at 
the service were fighting the right fight weve come a long 
way dont you surrender you cannot have new life without some 
pain 
with the crowd he chanted never surrender never surrender 
but he warned them to be mature and disciplined 
dont make friday decisions on sunday dont decide what 
youre going to do until the votes are cast he said 
dukakis called jackson a valued member of the partys team but 
he made it clear in boston who was headed for the democratic 
presidential nomination and who was not 
you cant have two quarterbacks dukakis said 
there was sense that an agreement needed to be reached quickly 
before the convention officially opens monday night 
time is short our convention opens tomorrow said jackson 
convention manager brown 
kirk odonnell a dukakis adviser added very definitely 
there is an appreciation of a sense of urgency and there is a 
desire for unity 
but walter fauntroy the district of columbias delegate in 
congress and a jackson delegate said i think it has not yet 
dawned on the dukakis campaign how important it is that there be a 
genuine partnership and shared responsibility for achieving 
victory 
the candidates words about each other were complimentary 
we know each other we like each other we respect each 
other dukakis said 
governor dukakis and i have a good personal rapport but there 
are some unresolved matters jackson said at this point there 
is no defined place for the progressive wing in the campaign 
at this point no role has been offered or accepted or defined in 
the campaign beyond atlanta 
even as jackson suggested the fight could go on through the vice 
presidential roll call on the conventions final night he promised 
the party would leave atlanta unified for the fall campaign against 
republican george bush

atlanta police have undergone sensitivity 
training to handle demonstrators at the democratic national 
convention opening today but theyre equipped with 4000 worth of 
tear gas in case gentle persuasion doesnt work 
policing the convention will cost up to 4 million most of it 
for overtime pay for local officers part of the cost is being 
defrayed by the federal government and atlanta business interests 
half of the citys 1400 policemen will be available for 
convention duty 
we cant always predict we have to assume that someone will 
try to do something and we have to try to minimize that 
possibility said dick murphy head of the democratic national 
committees security advisory committee 
helicopters will monitor bus routes that the 5372 delegates and 
alternates will use to reach the omni convention hall the secret 
service will check each of the 163 buses for hidden explosives 
the georgia bureau of investigation and the secret service are 
providing bodyguards for visiting governors and other dignitaries 
specially selected detectives will investigate crimes against 
convention delegates 
police are manning barriers a halfmile around the convention 
hall and will question anybody who wants to pass inside people 
with no business on the other side will be discouraged but not 
prevented from entering said deputy police chief willie taylor 
municipal courts are geared to process minor offenders within 
three hours of arrest the american civil liberties union is ready 
to intervene in cases that may involve free speech issues with a 
group of volunteer lawyers 
police say they have been told to do only what is necessary to 
keep the peace and to make arrests as a last resort 
at sensitivity training sessions police have been coached 
in how to deal with taunts and insults from demonstrators state 
county and local police have received special training in 
antiterrorist tactics arrest procedures and crowd control 
eugene guerrero head of the georgia aclu said his organization 
and the police had discussed how to handle demonstrators we have 
a good sense about the police here he said 
a twoacre parking lot facing the omni has been set aside for 
demonstrations and groups from white supremacists to gay rights 
advocates have signed up for twohour slots between 9 am and 11 
pm sunday through thursday 
the city will provide a stage and sound system and says any 
group that talks beyond its allotted time will be unplugged 
the subway stop for the omni has been closed for the duration of 
the convention the estimated 100 freight trains that pass under 
the convention complex each day will carry armed guards and the 
railroads have agreed not to haul hazardous materials 
in may the atlantafulton county emergency management agency 
conducted drills on how to deal with 179 worstcase scenarios 
ranging from a terrorist bombing to a subway accident or spill of 
nuclear materials 
atlanta police maj ww holley said atlanta does not rule out 
large demonstrations and random disorders but added we will not 
have a convention like they had in chicago the democratic 
convention in 1968 was marred by violent clashes between chicago 
police and thousands of antiwar demonstrators

the letter from sarom taing was fresh in her mind 
as kitty dukakis stood at the gates of a thai refugee camp a guard 
telling her the trip was in vain that she would not be allowed in 
the vietnamese attacked nongchan camp where my brother is 
taing had told mrs dukakis shortly before her 1985 trip to the 
camp on the thailandcambodia border i fear that time is running 
out and i do not know what to do 
mrs dukakis fell to her knees imploring the guard to let her 
into the camp to search for the boy hout pich 
i think he was so thunderstruck by my doing that and knew i 
wasnt going to get off my knees until he said yes is her 
recollection of the dramatic gesture that won her entrance to the 
camp the visit led to permission for pich to come to the united 
states 
pich graduated from high school this year and is off to college 
in the fall mrs dukakis proudly displays his picture in the 
living room of her brookline home 
she is both a political wife and political activist she is a 
trusted adviser to her husband michael the massachusetts governor 
and democratic nomineetobe but she also has an agenda of her own 
mrs dukakis has an office in the massachusetts statehouse just 
down the hall from her husbands and from there has lent influence 
to a variety of programs to assist refugees soviet dissidents and 
jews the homeless and arts and environmental organizations 
she relishes the prospect of taking her projects to the white 
house 
i think every first lady has a very different stamp to that 
office different responsibilities and interests mrs dukakis 
said in a recent interview at her home i see the role as one 
just filled with opportunities and challenges i would want to 
continue my work with refugees the homeless and also to continue 
my lifelong involvement with the arts 
the latter commitment can be traced back to her upbringing in a 
house rich in cultural interests her father harry ellis dickson 
is a former violinist with the boston symphony orchestra who was 
later the associate conductor of the boston pops in addition mrs 
dukakis has for 30 years been a student and teacher of modern dance 
she traces her desire to work on behalf of refugees and soviet 
jews back to her parents as well both are jewish met while 
studying in berlin and returned to the united states as hitler came 
to power there was frequent talk of the holocaust as kitty grew up 
she smiles when reminded that if her husband is elected 
president that she would be the first jewish first lady 
i feel a great deal of pride in my ethnic and religious 
background she said 
delicate spinal surgery forced her off the campaign trail in 
june but she recovered ahead of schedule and looks forward to 
resuming campaigning after this weeks democratic national 
convention where her husband will accept the partys presidential 
nomination 
to some the dukakises seem like an odd couple she with her 
flair for the dramatic and taste for the finer things and he known 
for caution and frugality but they are as one longtime family 
friend put it like teenagers in love 
mrs dukakis was a freshman at brookline high school when her 
husband was a senior they knew of each other but never met 
ironically they were introduced years later by sandy bakalar who 
dated dukakis in high school 
that was in 1961 shortly after mrs dukakis divorced her first 
husband and moved back to brookline with her 3yearold son john 
i liked michael very much from the beginning she said he 
already was talking about entering politics and i saw in him 
someone with courage and compassion a commitment to people and 
programs that help people 
they were married in 1963 and recently celebrated their 25th 
anniversary they have two daughters andrea 22 and kara 19 son 
john took the dukakis name altough he has never been legally 
adopted by the governor 
all have been active in the campaign 
part of mrs dukakis campaign pitch is her story about her 
26year addiction to amphetamines which she ended by seeking 
treatment in 1982 but did not disclose until last year she has 
been trying to quit smoking for years sneaking off during campaign 
appearances to have a cigarette out of her husbands view 
dukakis calls himself a doer a word used frequently by mrs 
dukakis associates when asked to describe her efforts her 
activism has won widespread praise tempered with 
characterizations of her as sometimes arrogant and overly 
aggressive 
she rejects such notions 
i prefer the word determined she said i find it 
interesting that i never hear the word aggressive used to describe 
men who are aggressive im a strong person and i feel very 
determined to get done what i set out to do

helmeted police with riot shields pushed back 
opponents of a white supremacist rally that authorities canceled to 
avoid blood in the streets of atlanta on the eve of the 
democratic national convention 
despite some shoving and tense encounters in the broiling heat 
there was no violence and no charges were filed as protesters 
chanted antipolice and antiku klux klan slogans and burned an 
american and a confederate flag 
through it all worshippers at central presbyterian church which 
faces the capitol steps where the rally was to have been peered in 
their sunday finery through closed glass doors at all the fuss 
outside 
this was a hostile angry nasty crowd and thats why we 
canceled the march said public safety commissioner george napper 
it was a tough call because this is america he said but 
said he was determined to avoid blood in the streets of atlanta 
the mississippibased nationalist movement had planned to rally 
on the steps of the golddomed state capitol then march to a 
parking lot across the street from the omni the site of the 
convention for a demonstration 
but police said they could not guarantee the safety of the 
klanstyle group of about 150 whose leader richard barrett later 
was taken into protective custody 
the city has set aside the twoacre parking lot for 
demonstrations and parceled out twohour time slots for the 
duration of the convention 
twenty people showed up as the coalition to support cuban 
detainees held the first of the scheduled protests which began on 
sunday 
the mad housers a homeless relief group based in atlanta built 
a small red white and blue hut as an example of the structures 
they put up for homeless people 
about 120 people marched from nearby atlantafulton county 
stadium to the protest zone to demonstrate against ethiopian 
control of that countrys eritrean province 
the nationalist movement marchers were to have come from the 
stadium to march from the capitol to the convention site but 
remained at the stadium only barrett and a man with a cap reading 
thank god for aids were on the capitol steps 
the front of the capitol was roped off confining some 500 
antiracism protesters to either end of the street in front of it 
as temperature shot past 90 degrees the sweltering police in heavy 
black riot gear tried to ignore chants linking them to the klan 
the protesters representing no one group chanted such slogans 
as no kkk no fascist usa and quit your jobs quit your 
jobs quit your racist jobs 
gene guerrero the chairman of the georgia chapter of the 
american civil liberties union called the decision to cancel the 
march a shameful act on the part of the city 
later about 250 of the counterdemonstrators marched to the 
protest zone chanting we just took the klans march 
convention security spokeswoman jackie barrett said barrett no 
relation was taken into protective custody when he entered the 
protest zone 
a small group of his backers tried to march to the protest zone 
despite the cancellation the counterdemonstrators surrounded them 
but police separated the two groups before there was any violence 
and took the supremacists away in a bus police said they were not 
arrested 
in other demonstrations 
legal a gay rights group pressed for more efforts to cure 
aids and for an end to discrimination against homosexuals sen 
alan cranston dcalif a sponsor of major aids funding 
legislation addressed the crowd of about 2000 
radio personality casey kasem was among the speakers for 
compassion campaign 88 an animal rights group promoting 
legislation to outlaw steeljawed leg traps use of veal cages 
that hold calves immobile to keep their flesh tender and some 
chemical tests on animals 
the cuban support group protested what organizers said was an 
immigration and naturalization service review process that was much 
too slow the process was developed following riots by some 3800 
cuban detainees last december at federal penitentiaries in atlanta 
and in oakdale la

national political conventions have become such 
madefortv events that the chairman of the democratic national 
committee openly refers to his partys gathering this week as a 
fourpart miniseries 
you never get a second chance to make a first impression 
says dnc chairman paul kirk 
the most imposing features of the new omni convention hall a 
sports arena reborn as the birthplace of the 1988 democratic 
ticket are its two dozenplus tv skyboxes and an enormous tiered 
camera platform closer to the podium than ever before 
television used to adore political conventions because they were 
full of conflict and color but once the parties realized they were 
on display they strove for tranquility above all snore said the 
networks and limited coverage this year to two hours nightly 
now organizers have a new challenge how to make a lively 
lengthy and essentially harmonious gathering as compressed and 
compelling as roots or taipan 
from 9 to 11 pm kirk said we are going to have to be jam 
up and jelly tight to get everything we want in there 
he and other party leaders have been playing to the primetime 
livingroom viewer since preparations began 
when the party selected the omni we looked at this hall as a 
television studio kirk said and that is how it has been remade 
as a temporary set for a fourday pageant less suspenseful than 
an afternoon quiz show but brimming with patriotism and spectacle 
to the naked eye the wooden podium is roughhewn and the red 
white or blue slipcovers on the delegates folding chairs are loose 
and shabby but both are effective on television as seen by five 
rows of cameras stationed 66 feet from the podium the same 
distance as in a large tv studio 
they may have cut back their programming but abc cbs and nbc 
still dominate the arena with their enormous glass skyboxes 
equally large is the box occupied by cnn the atlantabased cable 
network which is providing much more extensive coverage 
some two dozen other skyboxes for smaller stations and groups 
also ring the omni jutting out over clumps of delegate seats and a 
special niche cut high on the wall to hold the miles of cable that 
are the medias lifeline 
underneath the podium speakers are primped and primed by 
makeup experts and teleprompter coaches before an escort takes 
them up a narrow stairway to the rostrum the objective 
eliminating for the viewer the distractions an uncomfortable novice 
might offer 
its a fact of life says mike sheehan the head coach 
most people are going to be seeing this on a 19inch box 
speakers emerging from the subterranean maze of holding and 
preparation rooms will be shifting their gazes from left to right 
where their speeches will be rolling by on two teleprompter 
mirrors for special effect to underline their most dramatic or 
important lines theyll stare straight ahead at those rows of 
cameras and hope their memories dont fail them 
lights will warn speakers that their time is almost up no 
whoopee cushions promises sheehan a pneumatic lift will help 
minimize height differences for instance the gap between the 
5foot8 dukakis and lloyd bentsen his 6foot2 running mate 
behind the scenes the dnc is mounting one of the most 
sophisticated and elaborate press operations ever put together for 
a national political gathering according to an overview written 
by the dnc press office itself 
direct services to the media range from distribution of a press 
survival kit complete with a free subway pass and a packet of 
aspirin to a network news liaison charged with locating quotable 
democrats for harried television reporters and programmers 
the dnc is also operating both audio and electronic party 
lines to transmit convention press releases speeches and 
schedules and a convention satellite news service with hours of 
interviews speeches and prepackaged programs available to tv 
stations across the country as well as the hundreds actually in 
atlanta 
the modern convention is an opportunity above all else to 
communicate a message says dnc spokesman mike mccurry that is 
to say as the dnc overview put it a strong and positive message 
about our nominee and our plan for america

the first time dorothy bush called the roll at a 
democratic national convention in 1944 franklin d roosevelt was 
nominated for his fourth term 
since then she has tallied the votes for and against harry 
truman adlai stevenson twice john kennedy lyndon johnson 
hubert humphrey george mcgovern jimmy carter twice and walter 
mondale this week shell do it for michael dukakis too 
dorothy bush is that nice lady with the soft southern accent who 
becomes a media star every four years when she sings out alabama 
65 votes and runs through the list past wyoming to puerto 
rico virgin islands guam american samoa and americans abroad 
its her most visible job as secretary of the democratic party 
now 71 she was the first woman ever elected as an officer of 
either the democratic or republican party and has been reelected 
with little or no opposition at the reorganization meetings that 
follow the national convention she expects there wont be any 
problem next friday either 
on sunday a day for rehearsing and microphone checks dorothy 
bush was on the podium putting the states through their paces 
madame chairman michigan is happy to be here boomed a 
voice from her far left 
so are we said mrs bush so are we she sounded as if 
she meant it 
this is my 12th convention said mrs bush afterward i 
want these people to know im glad they are here the personal 
touch is important 
the amount of television time devoted to mrs bush is tied 
directly to the problems that arise the more problems the more 
roll calls the more dorothy bush 
the smoother it goes the better i like it she says 
the biggest change in those 48 years has been the increased 
presence of women in the delegation she says and she finds that 
gratifying 
theres also been a change in numbers in 1944 there were 1176 
votes to count this year there are 4162 
in her job she says a sense of humor helps 
one year the puerto rico delegation answered her call with 
puerto rico casts siete votes for she doesnt remember the 
candidate 
says mrs bush i answered puerto rico casts siete votes 
even though i dont speak spanish i know siete means seven

john cox puts words in the mouths of politicians 
and he can just as easily take them out 
cox may have one of the most pressurepacked and powerful jobs 
of all at the democratic national convention running the 
teleprompter the computerdriven gizmo that projects words onto 
glass plates so politicos can deliver speeches without burying 
their faces in text 
one slip of the hand and cox a prompter operator could leave 
a presidential candidate well speechless 
its a big responsibility and you have to remain calm when 
everyone around you is screaming said cox who will be 
positioned down a steep shoulderwidth staircase in the bowels of 
the podium 
when the speech is in progress the operator controls the flow 
of words with a computer gametype knob kind of like presidential 
pacman precision is the key only about 18 words at a time appear 
on the glass which is about the size of a 19inch television 
screen 
youve got to keep going with them cox said you take the 
pace off the speaker how well it works really depends on how much 
time youve had to rehearse and whether they go off the script 
coxs los angelesbased company computer prompting services 
has more experience projecting words at the academy and grammy 
awards ceremonies the big difference here he said is the 
magnitude of debate some 36 hours worth of words over the 
fourday affair 
the shear volume of material has made this into a tough job 
he said 
a speech may not arrive at the teleprompting cavern until an 
hour before its to be delivered its fed into the computer which 
handles the projecting 
lastminute changes are common and the operators have to 
rehearse with the speakers to calibrate their rhythm and discuss 
the probability of departing from the text 
i dont get nervous ive done this a lot cox said 
and if something goes wrong with millions of people watching 
its back to good ole paper 
we have someone on the podium reading along who can hand copy 
to the speaker he said

senior advisers to michael dukakis say several 
aides to jesse jackson are likely to be appointed to state 
leadership posts for dukakis prospective presidential campaign 
possibly before the democratic national convention ends thursday 
top dukakis aides discussed campaign strategy for this fall 
against republican george bush at a meeting sunday with 35 of the 
apparent democratic nominees state directors 
another session was planned for thursday if unresolved disputes 
with the rival jackson camp are settled by then dukakis officials 
hope to announce that several jackson operatives have agreed to 
join the dukakis campaign as state directors and deputy directors 
hes got some very good field organizers said dukakis field 
director charlie baker who arranged the meeting my view is that 
we can take a great step toward winning by aggressively recruiting 
these folks i expect a number of my important field staff to come 
from the jackson campaign 
baker and other officials refused to divulge names but several 
sources close to dukakis said the prospective appointees include 
key organizers in some states where jackson won primaries and 
caucuses 
jackson won in several southern states where dukakis hopes to 
surprise bush including alabama georgia louisiana mississippi 
south carolina and virginia 
jackson also won in michigan but dukakis already has named a 
state director there 
jack corrigan director of operations for dukakis said the 
state directors were promised that dukakis would commit the 
necessary resources to be competitive in all 50 states 
gov dukakis is fully committed to a 50state campaign 
corrigan said 
said another senior aide kirk odonnell we are poised for 
truly a national campaign and a national victory 
baker a veteran of dukakis state campaigns said several 
longtime aides to dukakis designated vice presidential running 
mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas also were expected to join the 
dukakis operation in texas that campaign is headed by tom 
cosgrove who was state director for dukakis successful primary 
efforts there and in new jersey 
other aides attending the sunday meeting with state directors 
included susan estrich the dukakis campaign manager joseph 
warren campaign secretary donna brazile a deputy field director 
who worked for jackson in 1984 and robert farmer chief 
fundraiser

michael dukakis put a difficult chapter in his 
presidential campaign behind him by signing legislation closing the 
states books on the last fiscal year and scaling down this years 
budget 
whatever happens to me in november the governor and 
prospective democratic presidential nominee said sunday i want 
this state of ours to continue to build its reputation for fiscal 
responsibility and fiscal restraint 
the bill signed by dukakis before he left for the democratic 
national convention in atlanta closed a 446 million revenue 
shortfall in the state budget from the past fiscal year and cut or 
delayed 225 million in spending for the new year 
the troubled state finances were an embarrassment for dukakis 
who has promoted himself in his presidential campaign as a sound 
fiscal manager 
the 116 billion state budget for fiscal 1989 which began july 
1 is dukakis 10th and potentially last as governor the budget is 
supported by a series of tax increases on corporations cigarette 
smokers and personal investors increases in court fees and traffic 
fines and the use of lottery surpluses destined for cities and 
towns 
closing out fiscal 1988 was accomplished largely by bond 
borrowing to pay for building maintenance local highways and other 
projects that were slated to be paid in cash the governor also 
tapped 27 million in state employee pension surpluses 
as we have been saying for the last four months we will 
finish 88 with a modest surplus and weve done that said 
administration and finance secretary frank keefe so we are 
absolutely tickled pink 
but some administration watchers doubted that the states 
financial picture was quite so secure 
after the election then there is going to be a fiscal crisis 
and then you are going to see tax increases major tax increases 
said barbara anderson of citizens for limited taxation an advocacy 
group that promoted a state tax cap resulting in a rebate to 
taxpayers last year 
human services advocate deborah weinstein said the fiscal 1989 
budget poses a strong risk that we cant provide this years 
level of services for legal services for the poor and various 
health services for the disabled children and adults 
but dukakis said his fiscal 1989 budget plan contains no 
cutbacks in services and we will continue to expand in certain 
important areas 
the revenue problems for fiscal 1988 were twofold a sharp drop 
blamed by the administration on federal tax changes in capital 
gains and a lawsuit lost by the administration to prevent 
corporations from using outofstate losses to reduce instate 
income 
the lawsuit will cost the state 92 million alone half of 
which dukakis will pay off in fiscal 1988 and the other half in 
fiscal 1989 
dukakis maintains that the revenue drop following a 400 
million budget surplus in fiscal 1987 was unforeseen but is 
temporary

new york gov mario cuomo stole the show when the 
democratic national convention opened four years ago but will 
watch from the sidelines tonight when his party convenes its 1988 
meeting 
cuomo who delivered a stirring keynote address to the 1984 
convention is to lead the new york delegation into the omni 
tonight to hear texas state treasurer ann richards deliver the 
opening speech 
while cuomo is the titular head of the new york delegation the 
conventions second largest he will play no formal role at the 
gathering 
in fact cuomos not even chairman of the new york delegation a 
job thats being handled by his handpicked state democratic 
chairman laurence kirwan 
cuomo has said that part of the reason he cant play a bigger 
role at the convention at least within the new york delegation is 
that he has to be in albany to attend to state business 
he planned to be back at the state capitol on tuesday and then 
to return to atlanta on wednesday for the nomination of michael 
dukakis cuomo political aide john marino said sunday 
four years ago the national convention had a stronger new york 
flavor 
cuomo delivered the keynote thenrep geraldine ferraro of 
queens was the vice presidential nominee and new york city mayor 
edward koch also spoke 
this year neither cuomo nor koch helped themselves much when it 
came to getting plum convention assignments cuomo refusing until 
just before the new york primary to end speculation that he might 
be interested in the nomination for himself stayed neutral until 
all the primaries were over 
for his part koch did take sides in the new york primary 
against jesse jackson backing tennessee sen albert gore koch 
said that jews would have to be crazy to vote for jackson 
cuomo saved himself some possible political embarrassment by 
telling national party chief paul kirk well before convention 
assignments were handed out that he didnt want a formal role koch 
decided to go to ireland with new yorks cardinal oconnor while 
the convention is on

it isnt basketball but tonights primetime 
game live from the omni is sure to see just as many elbows and 
inside moves 
i think its going to be awful said nbc reporter lisa myers 
as she considered the prospect of grabbing delegates and 
politicians for floor interviews during the four nights of the 
democratic national convention starting today 
it looks like its going to be absolute murder said abcs 
brit hume 
two of the omni arena would fit into the moscone center in san 
francisco where the 1984 democratic convention was held not only 
is the omni much smaller but the massive podium and camera 
platform built for the occasion eat up a lot of the maneuvering 
room for reporters down in the fray 
a floor reporters job necessarily entails getting from one 
state delegation to another across the hall sometimes on a 
moments notice at most convention sites there is an outer 
corridor just off the floor where reporters can rush around to the 
other side 
not at the omni getting across the floor will mean pushing 
through the masses 
within about the first 30 minutes i think we can anticipate 
gridlock said myers 
bill plante of cbs said he was more worried about getting a 
story than getting crushed he considers his assignment a choice 
one putting him close to large contingents of jesse jackson 
supporters in the michigan and california delegations 
i think therell be action i dont know how hard its going 
to be to move around and cover it but sharp elbows are tools of 
the trade he said 
no question about it the hall has been turned into a 
television studio plante said but we still have to find the 
actors in the drama there 
hume wondered what would happen if there were a law against 
network reporters using the term make our way during a 
convention wed come to a complete standstill he said we 
never just go somewhere at a convention we make our way i guess 
were going to make our way with difficulty through this 
convention 
not only will it be crowded but all the television lights will 
make it hot 
and it will be noisy a blaring orchestra will make it difficult 
for floor reporters to hear instructions from control booths in the 
trailers behind the hall 
the only thing worse than being here said hume is not 
being here

television audience levels for the convention have been in a 
steady decline since 1976 
in 1980 the threenetwork average rating for common coverage 
was a 90 in 1984 it dropped to a 77 
the highest rating for the democrats convention was chicago 
1968 when the threenetwork average was a 129 
the rating is a percentage of the number of us households with 
television sets according to the ac nielsen co which revises 
the estimate each year currently the number is 886 million 
only abc would venture a prediction of the number of viewers who 
will tune in all or part of any network coverage about 96 
million thats about a 7 percent drop from 1984

words of support and shouts of outrage rippled 
around the world as thousands of people marked the birthday of 
nelson mandela the antiapartheid leader who turned 70 today in a 
south african jail 
celebrations ranging from rock concerts to church services were 
planned today in at least 30 countries in south africa the 
whiteled government has banned events related to mandelas 
birthday 
dozens of nations have in recent days demanded the release of 
mandela who has been jailed for nearly 26 years 
britains antiapartheid movement which organized a prayer 
service for mandela today at st james church in london said 25 
activists marched 590 miles from glasgow scotland to deliver to 
the south african embassy here more than 30000 cards signed by 
britons calling for mandelas release 
a music festival starring mark knopfler of the rock group dire 
straits was planned for tonight in the racially mixed south london 
suburb of brixton the organization said 
antiapartheid activities were planned in at least 30 countries 
including the united states japan india cuba east and west 
germany nigeria and venezuela it said 
on sunday tens of thousands of demonstrators thronged londons 
hyde park for a promandela rally similar gatherings were held in 
amsterdam and rome 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev was among dozens of 
government leaders who sent birthday messages 
it distresses one to realize that you mark the birthday in a 
prison dungeon into which you were thrown by the racists more than 
a quarter of a century ago gorbachev said in a telegram sunday 
at the london rally south african archbishop desmond tutu 
declared mandela to be head and shoulders above any contemporary 
leader in south africa 
any sensible government would realize that nelson mandela is 
absolutely essential for peace and stability in southern africa 
he said 
the mostly young white crowd roared with approval as the face 
of mandelas wife winnie flashed on a giant video screen in a 
taped message she expressed thanks to the entire international 
community for seeking her husbands release 
we are very moved very touched by this gesture she said 
in toronto thousands rallied on the grounds of the ontario 
legislature to mark mandelas birthday in montreal about 600 
gathered in nelson mandela park to dance and listen to music and 
speeches 
mandela was among eight african national congress leaders 
sentenced to life imprisonment on june 11 1964 for sabotage and 
conspiracy to topple the government 
he is in pollsmoor prison in cape town and president pw 
bothas government has refused repeated international appeals for 
his release saying he must first publicly disavow violence 
south african diplomat justus de goede the secondranking 
official at the london embassy said in a radio interview that the 
guerrilla group was committed to the violent overthrow of the 
government and noted that bomb and grenade attacks by the 
organization guerrillas were increasing 
i think it is asking a great deal of any government to 
knowingly release the leader of an organization which has this 
political manifesto into society without some sort of guarantee 
de goede said 
the outlawed guerrilla group has waged a sabotage and bombing 
campaign since 1961 aimed at undermining the government and ending 
apartheid the system of racial separation that enables south 
africas 5 million whites to dominate the 26 million blacks 
politically and economically

the gentle key deer who inhabit the 
florida keys are so cute its killing them 
emboldened by handouts from wellmeaning residents many of the 
bambiesque creatures have been run over by cars while crossing 
highways in search of food 
the smallest species of whitetailed deer in the nation the 
endangered animals roam among the everincreasing houses on this 
island nibbling roots homeowners plants and flowers and 
begging for snacks 
a few days ago a young one was eating our tomatoes i went 
out to take its picture and he trotted up to me for a handout 
said island resident grace manillo 
theyll sit there and be cute and beg for food theyll eat 
anything its the deers undoing you can love them to death 
added deborah holle manager of the national key deer refuge 
the deer about 2 feet tall and 70 pounds when full grown will 
even munch marshmallows and potato chips said holle 
we have one herd fed junk food daily we noticed two of them 
with the worst coats weve ever seen 
but poor coats are the least of the deers troubles dogs and 
wild pigs maul them about a fifth of all newborns drown in ditches 
dug years ago to control mosquitoes they lack sufficient fresh 
water development is whittling away their habitat outside the 
7400acre federal refuge and the handouts make them lose their 
savvy becoming easy prey for poachers 
the handouts which are illegal have a more insidious effect 
they make the deer bold enough to cross busy streets to reach 
houses where they can count on snacks 
between 1980 and 1987 345 of the 431 deer found dead on big 
pine key and the several neighboring keys they also inhabit were 
killed by cars 
cars killed all but eight of the 31 found dead so far this year 
prompting holle to spend 20000 from the refuge budget for extra 
monroe county sheriffs deputies to ticket speeders on nearby 
roads but she fears more of her 250 precious wards may soon die on 
the highway 
compounding the problem is a controversial road first proposed 
in 1985 to siphon off traffic from oftenclogged us 1 the main 
drag through this island the road would cut through prime 
deerroaming territory and is opposed by the us fish and 
wildlife service which manages the refuge the florida game and 
freshwater fish commission and local environmentalists 
but area residents overwhelmingly favor the road so they can 
avoid us 1 and say objections to the route come too late 
the route was published in newspapers we followed the county 
attorneys advice we picked a route able to move people in the 
most efficient way with the least disruption to the environment 
now people are yelling key deer said bill becker who founded 
the committee that drew up the highway plan 
said mrs manillo we need a bypass road but im not 
convinced thats the place to put it but some say people are more 
important than the deer and get annoyed they are inconvenienced 
by the deer 
holle said the deer have always struggled it was never a 
garden of eden here they had storms and fresh water was probably 
the biggest limiting factor 
the refuge was established in 1957 to save the 50 deer that 
remained then in 1967 the deer received endangered species 
protection and by 1978 the population grew to about 400 now its 
dwindling again mostly because of development that destroys 
habitat and brings cars says holle who spends 2 million a year 
to add land to the refuge 
but she fears her efforts may not save the deer from extinction 
they have a very low reproductive rate says holle she also 
views the proposed road as a deer death trap 
mrs manillo agreed 
the deer run right out into traffic she said people 
speed the deer kills go on and on and on

secretary of state george p shultz 
lashed out today at south koreas unwillingness to open its markets 
to american exports saying that if his statements spark 
antiamericanism then so be it 
its got to work both ways if its going to work he said 
in urging a free market flow of goods between the two nations 
washington regards trade as lopsided in seouls favor 
speaking to the korean newspaper editors association shultz 
also said washington will support efforts by south korea at 
reconciliation with communist north korea but stands ready to 
repel any attack from what he described as a menacing terrorist 
state 
in a prepared speech shultz praised the recent progress of 
democracy in south korea but offered sharp criticism of the 
nations economic policies in a following questionandanswer 
session 
if my statement causes antiamericanism so be it im going to 
stand up for the principles i believe in shultz said 
he accused south korea of failing to open its markets to 
american beef and citrus fruit imports despite a 3yearold 
agreement to do so 
sometimes it seems to us that everyone wants the us market 
to be open and thats as far as it goes thats not an open world 
trading system its got to be reciprocal the secretary said 
antiamerican sentiment in south korea has increased because of 
public resentment of us pressure to open korean markets to 
imports 
koreans claim they are a developing nation and their young 
economy must be protected despite its enormous trade surplus 
south koreas dynamic economic growth has been fueled by exports 
to the united states the trade deficit last year was about 10 
billion in seouls favor 
shultz said lack of market access for us imports has created 
some domestic political problems in the united states 
you think we dont have farmers who notice that they cant 
penetrate other peoples markets and they dont raise cain 
shultz said have you ever seen the tractors on the streets of 
washington protesting closed markets abroad 
the normally lowkey shultz answered questions about south 
koreas economic policies with unusual force and intensity 
trade problems are expected to also loom large in japan 
shultzs eighth stop in a ninecountry tour of east asia and the 
pacific 
shultz was to fly to tokyo later today after talks with south 
korean president roh taewoo earlier he met with members of south 
koreas main political parties including opposition leaders and 
foreign minister choi kwangsoo 
in his speech shultz called on north korean leaders to 
rethink the severe restrictions they imposed on the lives of 
their citizens and liberalize their rigid communist economy 
even as we support the efforts of our ally in the south to 
promote dialogue and national reconciliation we will also stand 
firm in the face of violence and threats to intimidate he said 
americas resolve to help our korean ally repel aggression 
from the north is as firm now as when we signed our mutual defense 
treaty in 1953 shultz said the united states has about 42000 
troops in the south 
shultz said washington would carefully study north korean 
actions before moving toward contacts with pyongyang he said it 
was premature to consider opening trade ties between the two 
nations 
shultz said that if north korea staged a terrorist attack during 
the the olympic games in seoul which open in september it would 
be an aggression against the whole world the whole world will 
be watching

discoverys tiny fuel leak has been 
stopped but not fixed and officials have decided to testfire the 
ships three main engines before deciding whether to remove the 
space shuttle from the launch pad for repairs 
while preparing for that crucial july 28 test engineers will 
decide if there is a way to fix the difficulttoreach leak on the 
pad whether the leak can be isolated from the fuel system or if it 
is so insignificant that is does not pose a flight hazard if left 
as is 
by draining and purging the line engineers have stabilized 
the leak and feel it is safe to proceed with the flight readiness 
firing chuck hollinshead director of public affairs at the 
kennedy space center said sunday 
if discovery has to be rolled back to a hangar its planned 
launch as the first postchallenger shuttle flight would be delayed 
up to two months the flight readiness firing of the three engines 
already has been delayed two days so even if the shuttle stays on 
the pad there likely will be a delay of at least a few days of the 
sept 6 launch target date 
the decision sunday by shuttle managers came after engineers 
traced the source of the gas leak to a fitting on a line leading to 
an oxidizer tank that serves a steering engine system 
the steering engines maneuver the shuttle in orbit and are 
separate from the main propulsion engines that are to be test fired 
the oxidizer tank is deep within an engine compartment and 
engineers said the leak probably could not be reached without 
removing the 22foothigh compartment a very complex operation 
never before done on the launch pad 
by going ahead with the test firing shuttle managers hope to 
minimize lost time if discovery has to be taken off the pad 
engineers have completed two weeks of preparation for the test 
operations they would have to repeat if the firing were conducted 
after the shuttle was taken back to the hangar and then returned to 
the pad 
the flight readiness firing will check engine modifications made 
since the challenger explosion and provide the launch team with 
valuable launch countdown practice 
discovery is being prepared for the first shuttle mission since 
challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on jan 28 1986 
killing its crew of seven 
the flight originally was scheduled for february but has been 
postponed five times because of various technical problems 
five veteran shuttle crew members are to ride discovery on a 
fourday mission during which they are to deploy a communications 
satellite conduct experiments and check out more than 200 
modifications made since the challenger accident

lot us officials said

smallcaliber weapons barclay said 
in washington pentagon spokeswoman maj kathy wood said nine

pedro sula is 125 miles north of the capital the injured were 
taken to a hospital in san pedro sula and later flown to palmerola 
maj wood said about 150 soldiers were on the oneday leave and 
that all returned to palmerola as a precautionary measure

troops in honduras since the leftist sandinistas seized power in 
neighboring nicaragua in 1979

wounded in accidents or incidents of violence since the united 
states began joint military maneuvers with the honduran military in 
1982 
ten soldiers were injured in a helicopter crash during the 
deployment of about 1500 american troops to honduras in march 
following a reported incursion by nicaraguan troops into honduras

juan ramon matta 43 was taken to the united states to face 
drug trafficking charges and questioning for the 1986 slaying in 
mexico of us drug enforcement administration agent enrique 
camarena 
the honduran constitution forbids the deportation of honduran 
nationals 
demonstrators burned the us consulate and us information 
service office in the capital to protest mattas deportation and 
the us military presence in honduras the violence prompted the 
government to temporarily impose a state of emergency restricting 
civil liberties

cheeseburgers with a side of fries may be on 
their way to warsaw to put americanstyle fast food on the polish 
menu 
two indianapolis companies saniserv and curtis international 
plan to open burger boy restaurants in warsaw within the year said 
businessman gabriel e aguirre 
theres nothing there to compare with the fast food as you 
know it said aguirre president of saniserv a maker of 
foodservice equipment theres different types of finger foods 
but nothing in the magnitude of what we have here 
burger boys menu will be almost completely american with 
double and single burgers cheeseburgers fish sandwiches french 
fries shakes soft drinks and dessert turnovers 
there will also be a minimum of one product known very well to 
the nationals like kielbasa aguirre said saturday 
the restaurants will sell food and buy supplies using the local 
currency the zloty which will make its menu affordable to the 
average pole 
if they charge in local money it will be enormously popular i 
think said david mason a butler university political scientist 
who specializes in poland but mason questioned whether the 
restaurants could find such items as ground beef in poland 
for somebody whos not into the system i dont know how 
theyd get meat said mason whose most recent visit to poland 
was two years ago the kind of meat they put into hamburgers 
would be very hard to find 
aguirre however said he already has visited local bakeries and 
meat processors and didnt foresee any problems in obtaining 
supplies 
about 2 or 3 years ago there were a lot of difficulties for 
poles to obtain food he said things have really changed in 
the last two years 
as part of economic reforms in poland the government has 
encouraged western companies to invest there mason said 
pepsicola and cocacola soft drinks already are made and sold 
there he said 
there are a lot of americanstyle places run by poles mason 
said when we were there a couple years ago they were selling 
pizza although its not pizza as we know it they also had hot dog 
stands but what they call hot dogs were buns filled with mushrooms 
and onions because they didnt have any meat 
aguirre said he hopes to open 2530 restaurants within the first 
two years in poland saniserv will supply equipment and design the 
interiors of the restaurants and curtis international a trading 
company with an office in poland will hire local workers and 
coordinate operations with suppliers and the government 
the government which controls all but the smallest of business 
ventures in poland will share a percentage of sales aguirre said 
the share is less than 10 percent he said 
curtis is a subsidiary of curtis publishing co owned by 
indianapolis citycounty council president beurt r servaas 
saniserv was part of the operating company for the former burger 
chef chain in 1977 burger chef was sold to hardees food systems 
inc and aguirre bought saniserv 
in april mcdonalds opened its first outlet in a sovietbloc 
country in budapest hungary the burger giant also announced it 
would open a string of restaurants in moscow starting next year

the soviet union says it has granted political 
asylum to an american who was unfoundedly persecuted by us 
intelligence agents the fbi says the defector was the target of an 
espionage investigation 
the government daily izvestia and the official tass news agency 
reported sunday that the man sought asylum because he was being 
hounded by us agents but fbi spokesman thomas deaken in 
washington dc said glenn michael souther a us navy veteran 
in his early 30s was the subject of a pending espionage case 
he said souther disappeared in may 1986 shortly after graduating 
as a russian major from old dominion university in norfolk va 
deakin refused to give details of the case involving souther he 
said he could not say when the case had been opened but that 
its been pending since before souther disappeared 
in todays editions the washington post quoted unidentified 
sources as saying fbi and navy officials were concerned about 
southers disappearance because he had special security clearances 
souther disappeared shortly after being questioned by fbi agents 
and is known to have visited his mother in illinois and used a 
oneway ticket to rome the home of his former wife and son the 
post reported 
one us intelligence expert told the paper that investigators 
had been acting on more than suspicions but didnt catch him in 
the act and thus could not hold souther at the time he was 
questioned 
deakin said he had no information on the report 
izvestia said southers appeal to the presidium of the supreme 
soviet or the parliament for refuge in the soviet union was 
motivated by his wish to hide from us secret services which 
unfoundedly persecuted him 
guided by humane considerations the presidium of the supreme 
soviet of the ussr complied with the request it said 
us embassy spokesman richard gilbert said american diplomats 
were not contacted about the incident and were unfamiliar with both 
the man and the circumstances surrounding his flight 
a duty officer at izvestia said he did not know how to contact 
the american and that the editorial offices responsible for the 
publication were closed for the weekend 
other americans have defected to the soviet union in recent 
years in january theodore and cheryl branch of erie pa sought 
and were granted asylum while on a tourist trip to the country 
an american serviceman wade roberts was granted asylum here in 
april 1987 after leaving his post in giessen west germany and 
slipping across the border into east germany in the trunk of a 
rented car roberts decided late last year that he was unhappy with 
his new life in soviet turkmenia and turned himself in to us 
authorities to face desertion charges 
arnold lockshin an american communist party activist from 
houston arrived in moscow with his family in october 1986 and has 
settled in the capital according to soviet press reports 
lockshin a cancer researcher claimed he was harassed by the cia 
because of his political views 
another american who was granted refuge in the soviet union is 
edward lee howard a former cia agent who defected in august 1986 
howard disappeared from his santa fe nm home in september 1985

nicaraguan rebel 
leaders headed into a crucial meeting today splintered by 
disagreements over who should lead the antisandinista movement 
the 54member nicaraguan resistance assembly comprising 
representatives of exiled political parties and business and labor 
groups began three days of talks sunday in santo domingo 
sundays closeddoor session dealt mainly with financial and 
administration matters said assembly spokesman frank arana today 
the contras were expected to vote on a new sevenmember directorate 
the five current assembly directors adolfo calero pedro 
joaquin chamorro alfredo cesar aristides sanchez and azucena 
ferrey are seeking another oneyear term the two other seats 
have been vacant 
col enrique bermudez the contras controversial military 
commander announced sunday he was seeking election as an 
independent to one of the vacant seats in the directorate 
he said his candidacy represented an attempt to reorganize the 
organization and give the military arm of the contra movement a 
formal say in political decisions 
the purpose would be to project the image of unity 
integration and participation of all factions involved in the 
sevenyear war to overthrow nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government bermudez said 
bermudez 56 one of the founders of the resistance movement 
faces opposition from other nicaraguan exiles who accuse him of 
maintaining close ties with supporters of the deposed nicaraguan 
dictator anastasio somoza and of trying to take over the movement 
critics say his elevation to the directorate would place too 
much political power in the hands of the military 
bermudez candidacy casts doubt on the future of assembly 
director calero currently considered the political head of the 
movement 
chamorro and calero tried unsuccessfully to remove bermudez as 
military chief in april after he fired six regional contra 
commanders in nicaragua for lack of discipline 
calero declined comment on bermudez candidacy saying only that 
he would work with whoever is elected to the directorate 
chamorro said if the colonel wants to sit on the directorate he 
should renounce his position as commanderinchief of the contra 
forces 
when there are seven people and only one of them has a gun 
then the one who gets his way is the one with the gun chamorro 
said 
another assembly director cesar welcomed bermudez candidacy 
saying he could assume the role of a sort of defense minister 
for the group representing the interests of the rebel forces 
my personal opinion is that it will strengthen the 
directorate he said to me its not only a sign of unity but 
its also a sign that the military commanders are a lot more 
interested now in political matters 
he argued that if bermudez wins it will strengthen the 
likelihood of a political settlement of the nicaraguan conflict 
bermudez denied that he had any interest in consolidating 
personal power and said he thought he could heal divisions within 
the movement 
we are trying to regroup and reorganize the exiles to 
complement the efforts of the political parties in nicaragua he 
said 
asked whether he was seeking a greater voice for the military 
within the resistance movement bermudez said not a greater 
voice participation 
the contras took up arms against the government in 1981 many of 
them had once supported the rightist proamerican dictator somoza 
who was swept from power and replaced by the leftist sandinistas in 
1979 
the united states cut off military aid to the rebels in february 
and reductions in nonmilitary aid led to layoffs of 130 contra 
staffers and the closing of political offices worldwide 
on march 23 the contras and sandinistas signed a ceasefire 
accord and began a series of talks that have so far failed to 
achieve their desired goal a lasting peace

hundreds of people jeered and taunted 
the younger brother of former president chun doohwan today as he 
went on trial on charges of embezzling millions of dollars 
prosecutors questioned chun kyunghwan 46 about allegations he 
had amassed a fortune by using government and family connections as 
head of the semiofficial saemaul undong development group during 
his brothers administration 
the opening session was marked by boos and taunts as chun 
consistently denied prosecution charges abut 400 people inside the 
crowded courtroom shouted punish chun as hundreds of police 
stood guard outside 
the younger chun was arrested march 31 and accused of peddling 
influence and embezzling about 10 million in saemaul funds 
investing them in real estate and private business 
also on trial were 12 other people including saemaul officials 
and the younger chuns two brothersinlaw they have been indicted 
on embezzlement bribery and other charges 
chun and most other defendants denied charges of diverting 
millions of dollars to invest in real estate contending the money 
was spent only for saemaul development projects 
but some of chuns aides acknowledged government charges and 
said chun sanctioned embezzlement and tax evasion if convicted he 
could face a prison sentence or the death penalty in the most 
extreme case 
the opposition has demanded parliamentary questioning about 
wrongoings under the former president who left office in february 
at the end of a sevenyear term 
today three opposition party leaders including kim daejung 
issued a joint statement that accused president roh taewoo with 
trying to protect his predecessor 
we demand pesident roh take a clear attitude as liquidator of 
wrongdoings under the former administration the statement said 
president roh accepted a cabinet decision july 14 to veto two 
oppositionsponsored bills aimed at forcing the former president to 
testify in the national assembly on corruption charges 
the bills which have been returned to the legislature would 
likely be killed as the opposition lacks a twothirds majority 
required to override a presidential veto the opposition controls a 
combined 166 seats in the 299member assembly

on duty early today to enforce a curfew intended to prevent 
looting thousands of residents remained without power 
gov terry branstad declared pottawattamie county which 
includes council bluffs a disaster area on sunday 
to see that kind of devastation and not have more personal 
injuries or more serious injuries i think we can just count our 
blessings branstad said sunday after touring the area 
officials from the federal emergency management agencys 
regional office in kansas city planned to tour council bluffs today 
to assess the destruction 
council bluffs mayor tom hanafan said sunday that losses to 
residences and commercial buildings totaled 165 million 
insurance adjusters projected the overall damage figure would reach 
20 million to 25 million 
a thunderstorm packing 92 mph winds and up to four funnel clouds 
skipped over downtown omaha on friday afternoon before one funnel 
touched down briefly on the interstate 480 bridge that spans the 
missouri river connecting omaha and council bluffs 
within minutes a tornado slammed into a 700squareblock area of 
western council bluffs severely damaging at least 160 homes 
uprooting 100foot trees downing power lines and upending scores 
of railroad cars officials estimated the city lost 30 percent of 
its trees 
larry allen chairman of the pottawattamie county board of 
supervisors estimated 10000 homeowners will file insurance claims

reduced to a section of about 100 square blocks sunday earlier it 
covered most of the northern half of the city

really only the tip of the iceberg said jack kellog a volunteer 
for the pottawattamie county chapter of the red cross 
for one day they can eat canned beans after that they need 
some nutrition he said 
hanafan said the 165 million loss figure is what city 
officials plan to file with the fema it includes only residences 
and commercial buildings it does not include some categories of 
damage that insurance adjusters used to come up with the 20 
million to 25 million estimates such as damage to public

the governmentbesieged teamsters union is 
celebrating an end to its 32year marriage of convenience with 
republican presidential candidates and has chosen to dance with a 
new partner at the democratic national convention 
even though the unions new president is an irish catholic 
bostonian who supported michael dukakis opponents in previous 
elections the teamsters hosted a party here sunday night 
symbolizing a return to the labor movements halfcentury courtship 
with democrats 
william j mccarthys upset election last week to succeed the 
late jackie presser as the teamsters president had cast doubts 
among some union leaders that organized labor could unite behind 
the democratic presidential nominee for the first time since 1956 
mccarthy 69 had supported edward king in both his 1978 upset 
of the incumbent dukakis for the democratic gubernatorial 
nomination in massachusetts and had opposed dukakis successful 
challenge of king four years later 
that sort of personalizes it one official of another union 
commented 
mccarthy is known among other labor leaders to have opposed the 
teamsters reaffiliation with the aflcio last october implicit in 
the reunion was an understanding that the teamsters would go along 
with the labor federations democratic presidential endorsement 
commanding a fourth of the delegates at this weeks convention 
labor leaders have openly wondered whether the new teamsters chief 
would abide by pressers promise to work with the rest of labor 
to create the biggest political giant this country has ever 
seen 
with the largest political campaign chest of any group in the 
country the question is not academic 
at the end of march the teamsters drive democratic 
republican independent voter education political action committee 
had 55 million 15 million more than the american medical 
association and 18 million more than the national association of 
realtors 
teamster political operatives sought to assure more than a dozen 
presidents of other unions here sunday that mccarthys upset 
election last friday over dukakis supporter weldon mathis 
pressers designated heir will not return the union to the gop 
camp 
theres about as much chance of us endorsing george bush as 
there is it snowing in atlanta tomorrow said one senior teamster 
official 
the teamsters generally had courted republican presidential 
candidates ever since dwight eisenhowers bid for reelection in 
1956 
presser had been the only major labor leader in the country to 
support ronald reagan in the 1980 and 1984 elections saying then 
the aflcio was out of touch with workers in its endorsements of 
democrats jimmy carter and walter mondale 
but presser who died july 9 began grumbling about the reagan 
administration more the four years ago first over its appointees 
to the national labor relations board and then over his indictment 
in 1986 on labor racketeering and embezzlement charges 
the final straw according to teamster officials was the 
governments suit to wrest control of the union from its leaders on 
a claim they are puppets of organized crime 
mccarthy was notably absent from sundays reception teamsters 
and other labor leaders said that is characteristic of the low 
priority he places on national presidential politics 
upon taking over the unions reins last friday mccarthy said he 
would have no comment on a teamsters presidential endorsement 
until after both conventions democratic and republican the 
same position taken officially by the aflcio 
but a teamster official noted that despite his endorsement of 
dukakis opponent in massachusetts gubernatorial races mccarthy 
had served on the governors labormanagement council 
and a senior aflcio official acknowledged that the teamsters 
were not alone in abandoning dukakis at the end of his first time 
as massachusetts governor 
about half the labor movement was against him then the 
official said speaking on the condition of anonymity he messed 
up his first term 
another teamster official also noted that dukakis although he 
was the last of the democratic presidential candidates to do so 
had spoken against a justice department suit to take over the 
16millionmember union on a claim its leaders are puppets of 
organized crime 
george bush is the only candidate out there now who has not 
spoken against the suit said tim oneill a spokesman for the 
union 
asked if the teamsters planned a similar reception at the gop 
convention next month in new orleans another official commented 
coldly we see no reason to be there

in a weedy field amid abandoned railroad 
tracks and stacks of 55gallon drums stands an old brick firehouse 
called butchs hauling 
a tanker truck is parked next to a sewer drain setting the 
stage for midnight dumpers to dispose of hazardous wastes 
illegally and unsafely and for investigators to practice catching 
them 
hundreds of law enforcement agents and evironmental officers 
gather at butchs hauling each year to practice ways of 
investigating reports of illegal waste dumping 
they are the forces battling a national problem that is 
particularly acute in the densely packed northeast with its heavy 
industrialization high costs for proper dumping and lack of places 
to do it 
the training center is run by the northeast hazardous waste 
project formed in 1980 to fight illegal chemical dumpers and 
serving as the model for similar projects elsewhere fourteen 
states are part of the project 
prior to 1980 there was not really any formalized institution 
to go after the criminal dumpers legally said jeanne e rush 
director of the northeast project i dont think there was an 
awareness of how critical the problem was after that everything 
started being of concern to the states 
the northeast project has organized 25 training programs most 
lasting three days for 1500 participants from local state and 
federal agencies including the fbi and the environmental 
protection agency 
a lot of criminal prosecutors dont have the background in 
environmental prosecutions said ms rush there are a lot of 
aspects of an environmental criminal trial that are different than 
a regular homicide trial 
participants are taught techniques for raiding illegal dump 
sites collecting evidence and preparing search warrants 
there is an awareness course that helps members of various 
agencies put aside their sometimescompeting interests and work 
together 
with this training we now have a lot more respect and 
tolerance for what the other group is doing said linda range of 
the new jersey department of environmental protection 
another course is designed for agents who inspect approved 
hazardous waste facilities 
an advanced course provides a mock waste case to investigate 
first the trainers set up the scene dumping drums labeled as if 
they carried toxic material emptying tainted water into sewers and 
arranging for a telephone tip to the class 
the trainees put on their protective suits and masks and go to 
work investigating the tip as they would a real case of illegal 
dumping 
they use files created for the project to investigate the 
company involved take samples of the waste and seek clues from the 
drum labels 
it helps to understand the complexities or crack decisions you 
have to make project training chairman jay strauch said of the 
instruction he received in 1983 
the thing that it taught me the most was cooperation with 
regulatory people you have to have somebody tell you what youre 
dealing with said strauch a criminal investigator in ohio 
the project also provides toplevel state officials with a way 
of exchanging information coordinating enforcement programs and 
passing similar laws in their respective states 
the association has been extremely beneficial in promoting the 
federalstate partnership in environmental enforcement said 
carroll g wills an environmental specialist with the epas 
national enforcement investigations center in denver 
the states making up the northeast project are connecticut 
delaware maine maryland massachusetts new hampshire new 
jersey new york ohio pennsylvania rhode island vermont 
virginia and west virginia

the lastsecond basketball victory over 
neighboring big ten rival wisconsin in 1986 was a proud moment for 
the university of minnesota to savor as it turned out it was the 
last proud moment for quite a while 
on the morning after the 6765 victory of jan 23 1986 three 
members of the golden gophers basketball team were accused of rape 
in an incident in a madison wis hotel room 
the three later were acquitted in a trial filled with sordid 
testimony but the notoriety was only beginning for minnesota 
which is among the nations largest universities 
with 44293 undergraduate and graduate students and 18000 
extension students the minnesota campus sprawls over both banks of 
the mississippi river near downtown minneapolis 
the misdeeds improprieties and embarrassments over the next 31 
months were dizzying 
the mens basketball team was placed on probation by the 
national collegiate athletic association for numerous infractions 
mostly over its recruiting of student athletes 
university president ken keller resigned in a scandal over 
hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on his official residence 
kellers interim replacement richard sauer admitted 
plagiarizing part of a magazine article while applying for a job 
elsewhere 
a former university official was indicted on charges of 
swindling money and giving it to athletes the schools popular 
athletic director paul giel was fired 
the troubles may be unprecedented among major universities 
robert l gale president of the association of governing boards 
of universities and colleges recalls discussing minnesotas skid 
with colleagues they would say those poor devils everything 
has happened to them at once 
the longterm effect isnt clear 
it is going to be more difficult for the university to 
function in an autonomous fashion because the legislature is going 
to be looking over their shoulder a lot more than it has in the 
past said gale 
after the 1986 rape charges many people began looking over the 
universitys shoulder 
a big ten report later that year said the mens athletic 
department had the conferences lowest rate of graduation from 1978 
through 1983 
while the school was still reeling from that report ncaa 
investigators arrived to investigate recruiting 
in march the ncaa announced 40 rules violations most of them 
in the basketball program under coach jim dutcher who resigned 
after the rape trial 
in the same month keller resigned after a sixweek controversy 
over university financial management it was sparked by his 15 
million renovation of the official residence at more than twice the 
budgeted amount 
keller also approved a 200000 remodeling of his offices 
including a 15822 mahogany desk and credenza 
students picketed the mansion and a local radio stations ditty 
referred to keller as the renovation man his commitment to 
focus plan to upgrade some programs cut others and reduce 
enrollment by 8000 was mockingly referred to as commitment to 
furniture 
a widening probe turned up a 221 million reserve fund critics 
called it a slush fund and it rankled professors whose programs 
had been targeted for elimination and angered some contributors and 
alumni who quit giving 
when sauer took over the presidents duties he remained in his 
own home accepted a used desk and set out to mend fences 
then the plagiarism scandal hit him while he was applying for 
the presidency of north dakota state university 
after he apologized to the university of minnesota regents they 
gave him a unmanimous vote of confidence north dakota state since 
has asked him to renew his application for the presidency 
sauers troubles were followed by the athletic department coming 
under further investigation luther darville former acting 
director of the schools office of minority and special student 
affairs was indicted in may on three counts of felony theft by 
swindle 
darville has fled to his native bahamas and authorities have 
started extradition proceedings 
university officials acknowledge that the turnover among top 
personnel has caused problems but they say the school is running 
more smoothly than might be expected 
i think the fact is that the university is being wellgoverned 
by the interim people said david lebedoff chairman of the 
university of minnesota board of regents 
george robb the universitys associate vice president for 
external relations said the schools reputation among the public 
is less important than its image among potential students and 
faculty 
the graduate student or faculty member who might be thinking 
about coming here in physics is much more concerned about the 
physics department than the athletic department he said weve 
got more than 100 new endowed chairs that have resulted from the 
fundraising campaign that just finished thats almost an 
unheardof number of endowed chairs 
david merkowitz spokesman for the american council on 
education said he couldnt recall any other university having so 
many problems recently 
still merkowitz said i am absolutely sure a university like 
minnesota with 45000 students is going to survive these things

more than 20 years ago jewish satirist yuli 
daniel was thrown in prison and the verse that helped put him there 
banned from official publication now a leading literary magazine 
has ended the silence 
five poems were published in the magazine ogonyok sunday by the 
writer who friends say has been in a coma for a month after a 
series of heart attacks 
the weekly published daniels work on page 30 along with a 
small photo of the poet taken at least 20 years ago 
yuli daniel prose writer and poet yuli daniel war veteran 
and a man of difficult fate the magazine said before you are 
his first publications after a break of more than 20 years 
the verse published by ogonyok was markedly less political than 
the satires that led to daniels arrest and conviction in 1966 but 
prominent dissident sergei kovalev termed the publication an 
important step in the interesting and complicated processes we 
are going through now 
kovalev said he recognized the poems as among those daniel wrote 
in prison 
the trial of daniel now 63 and ailing and fellow writer andrei 
sinyavsky marked the start of a harsh crackdown on dissident 
political views and writings 
daniel spent five years in prison and labor camp following his 
conviction for unauthorized publication of his works abroad he 
worked in kaluga and moscow after his release from exile but 
refrained from dissident activities 
the satires that drew official ire in the mid1960s were 
published abroad under the pseudonym nikolai arzhak 
over the past two years a handful of soviet publications 
including ogonyok have taken up soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs call for glasnost or more openness and released 
longbanned writings by some of the bestknown soviet intellectuals 
ogonyok despite criticism from officials as high as the ruling 
communist party politburo has continued to release controversial 
works by writers disgraced under previous leaderships it has 
carried the most critical analyses to date of repressions meted out 
by dictator josef stalin 
kovalev who spent 10 years in prison and exile for dissident 
political activity during the era of president leonid i brezhnev 
said the publication of daniels poems may signal a broader review 
of the injustices suffered by artists and activists during 
brezhnevs 18year leadership 
we hope there will soon be rehabilitation of not only stalins 
victims but those of the 1960s as well kovalev said 
the poems published sunday include the ring in which the 
author recounts his trial as if it were a boxing match 
daniels biting satire of the soviet system drew the ire of 
brezhnevs functionaries who instituted a cultural crackdown after 
the ouster of premier nikita s khrushchev in october 1964 
his most famous work this is moscow calling mocked what he 
saw as insensitivity and detachment in the kremlin hierarchy it 
included a satirical proposal for a public murder day in which 
all soviet citizens over the age of 16 would be allowed to kill 
someone provided it was not a policeman or transport worker 
soviet poet andrei voznesensky said he had not had a chance to 
read ogonyok but was pleased by the publication of daniels poems 
after so many years 
voznesensky and poet yevgeny yevtushenko have emerged as the 
most vocal supporters of gorbachevs policy of giving artists and 
intellectuals more freedom of expression 
daniels wife irina uvarova was at the hospital with her 
husband sunday and could not be reached for comment 
sinyavsky who was tried and convicted with daniel emigrated to 
paris after his release from a sevenyear term 
the convictions served to unify many political and cultural 
activists who were dismayed by the turnaround they witnessed under 
brezhnev after a period of relative literary freedom under 
khrushchev

rioters pelted police with stones 
and set fire to barricades fences and piles of rubble today before 
being driven out of amsterdams last great squatter stronghold 
the abandoned fourbuilding waterfront warehouse known as 
conradstraadt had been home to scores of squatters for more than a 
decade todays eviction apparently brings the squatter movement to 
a close 
police said at least five conradstraat rioters were arrested for 
disorderly conduct and two policemen were injured as batonwielding 
officers tried to clear the perimeter around the squatter community 
police initially were forced to pull back from the conradstraat 
after being met by a barrage of paving stones thrown by 
demonstrators who had gathered in a vacant lot next to the 
warehouse complex sunday night 
the conradstraat complex caught fire during the eviction action 
and police were hampered by billowing black smoke that could be 
seen across the city 
rioters set fire to fences piles of rubble and barricades but 
it was not determined how the warehouse complex caught fire 
firefighters and fireboats were called in to battle blazes in the 
brick complex 
most of the approximately 140 persons who lived or had workshops 
in the complex had left by the time the rioting broke out 
one who stayed throughout the eviction action was a 27yearold 
sculptor who identified himself only by his first name alex 
ive been here two years he told the associated press 
and it was really a good place to be an artist 
we werent a group but we were helping each other he said 
as he stood in a trashstrewn groundfloor room of the complex 
as part of an agreement with the city the squatters had 
received utilities service for which they shared the cost 
a 42yearold woman who identified herself as annettte had lived 
in the complex for two years with her sevenyearold twin daughters 
im not really glad to leave she said as she clutched a 
few belongings and pondered whether to return to her burning 
building to fetch more the woman who lived on welfare said she 
would seek lodgings in one of the few remaining squatter dwellings 
left in amsterdam 
led by a payloader riot police converged on the conradstraat 
area shortly after dawn but their repeated baton charges were 
repulsed by demonstrators 
after about an hour police gained the upper hand and pushed the 
rockthrowing demonstrators out of the rubblestrewn vacant lot 
the conradstraat colony has gained fame in amsterdam because of 
the artists workshops and other impromptu enterprises begun there 
by its occupants

mike obrien always believed a good miniature 
golf course was one of the best expressions of american folk art 
so he couldnt help but wonder what a course designed by trained 
artists would be like 
now hes got his answer in the form of par excellence an 
indoor 18hole miniature golf course that opened saturday at a 
gallery owned by the school of the art institute of chicago it was 
designed by obrien and 21 other chicago artists 
gone are the dutch windmills and chinese pagodas in their place 
are wrecked cars earthquake debris cemeteries and nuclear weapons 
players can putt over the bottlecap strewn floor of a tavern 
into a corporate boardroom and through an archway dedicated to 
tasteless home improvement materials 
at the 18th hole the grim reaper gets the ball and keeps it 
obrien did the 13th hole himself 
its called in search of par excellence after a popular 
business book said obrien as he put the finishing touches 
saturday on his hardwood trimmed miniature executive suite 
you shoot through the sales bar graph and if you hit top 
sales your ball goes into the corner office the one with the 
picture windows and the hole he said if your sales are lower 
you wind up in a less desirable office and have to take more 
shots 
the course playable at 2 a round will be in place through 
august 20

giving away lemonade is cheaper than 
giving away hotel rooms when its hot if you have to give away 
something that is 
the chamber of commerce here feels the obligation whenever the 
temperature tops 90 degrees which is not supposed to happen often 
in natures airconditioned city 
lemonade lassies in shorts were set for another giveaway 
today after a weekend on which the town sweltered through its 
hottest day ever 96 degrees on saturday 
even at 100 a day during this recordsetting heat wave the 
giveaway is proving much cheaper than the first stunt the 
chamber tried 
when we first started we went to the hotel and they 
reluctantly agreed not to charge for rooms whenever the temperature 
went above 90 degrees said chamber member eddie steele 
by golly it was within two weeks that the hotel was jammed to 
the rafters with a convention of moose when the next heat wave 
hit the angry hotel paid off but we only gave away the hotel 
rooms once steele said 
that was 50 years ago and the switch to lemonade was on 
in the past whole summers have passed without bluefield giving 
away one drop partly because the temperature of record is at the 
airport which generally has lower readings than downtown 
when the mark reaches 90 a lemonade giveaway is set for the 
next day except when it reaches 90 on a weekend when the giveaway 
is set for the next workday after saturdays 96 the high was 
only 89 on sunday 
weve had to do it about five or six times which is the most 
weve had in 10 or 15 years steele said 
between 300 and 400 people a day have shown up at the chambers 
lemonade stands downtown steele is certain townfolk take advantage 
they go out of their way to get it he said

the us ambasador to bahrain today 
welcomed irans acceptance of a un ceasefire resolution but 
us naval officers said they were waiting for official word from 
washington 
its time for rejoicing said ambasador sam h zakhem 
its beautiful news zakhem praised president reagan for 
drumming up support for peace in this part of the world for 
which we have waited so long 
iraq and iran are the true beneficiaries theyve had enough 
of the killing and bloodshed he said 
in washington the state department said it would have no 
immediate comment on the iranian announcement 
holy cats youve got to be kidding exclaimed an officer 
aboard the navys command ship coronado moored at bahrain when 
informed of the news by telephone he said it was the first such 
word received aboard the ship 
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said no 
official word had been passed to other us ships in the persian 
gulf 
officers declined to speculate on how quickly or in what way a 
ceasefire would affect the navys operations in the waterway the 
united states now has 27 us warships in and around the persian 
gulf to guard commercial shipping 
were taking a waitandsee attitude said the officer 
until we hear it from the horses mouth well just hope for the 
best and see what happens 
rear adm anthony less commander of the persian gulfbased 
naval forces was not aboard the flagship but was advised of the 
report by telephone 
a naval source who spoke on condition of anonymity said less was 
elsewhere with a team of us military experts investigating 
the july 3 downing of an iranian jetliner by the us missile 
cruiser vincennes 
the vincennes was also anchored off bahrain but it was not 
immediately known if it had received word of the iranian 
announcement 
irans announcement that it would accept un security council 
resolution 598 came almost a year to the day after the united 
states began escorting kuwaiti oil tankers to protect them from 
iranian attack 
the first two kuwaiti tankers reflagged by the united states 
departed on the initial upbound convoy to kuwait on july 21 1987 
after one of the tankers was damaged by an iranian mine three 
days later the us government ordered a buildup of forces 
including minesweeping helicopters and ships that more than 
tripled the us naval force in the persian gulf

the weekend but much of the east and parts of california wilted 
under hot air that pushed temperatures to record highs 
the first significant storms in three months dumped more than 2 
inches of rain on parts of michigan but weather experts said it 
didnt mean an end to the drought the storms also blacked out at 
least 155000 electricity users and contributed to at least two 
deaths officials said sunday 
to get a socalled end to the drought to get us back to a 
normal amount of water in the reservoirs we really need more of a 
steady rain over periods of time meteorologist don baker said 
sunday in michigan if it falls too fast it tends to run off

we really need a lot 
iowa had a weekend of feast or famine with some areas in the 
west getting a double drenching while some scorched areas in the 
east got little or no rain

destructive tornadoes roaring through council bluffs and some 
places got more than 5 inches of rain 
this is the best rain weve had all year said melba wilcox 
who farms with her husband near bagley iowa she said her rain 
gauge showed 25 inches fell early saturday i went outside to 
make sure it was real 
scattered thunderstorms spread rain over much of kansas and into 
parts of western missouri el dorado kan got 252 inches of rain 
in a day and a half and other parts of central and eastern kansas

shield claimants have overwhelmingly voted in favor of a 
reorganization plan that sets up a 25 billion trust fund to 
settle lawsuits over the birth control device a robins lawyer told 
federal judges today 
attorney dennis drebsky said 9834 percent of the dalkon shield 
claimants approved the plan which includes a 32 billion buyout 
agreement with american home products corp 
more than 19 million or 9995 percent of robins common 
stockholders also voted in favor of the plan all other classes of 
claimants and shareholders voted overwhelmingly for the plan he 
said 
robins was driven into chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings by 
hundreds of thousands of claims filed by women who said they 
suffered infections spontaneous abortions and other injuries from 
the use of the dalkon shield intrauterine device which robins 
marketed in the early 1970s 
the reorganization plan calls for claimants to receive payments

sen lloyd bentsen acknowledging his link with 
michael dukakis could upset his conservative texas supporters has 
asked them to back his senate reelection campaign regardless of 
your commitments in the presidential race 
the appeal came in a letter sent to supporters after dukakis 
the probably democratic presidential nominee selected bentsen as 
his running mate last tuesday 
in the past many texas conservatives supported bentsen a 
former houston insurance executive and republican vice president 
george bush another texan 
i understand that some of my friends will feel that this 
latest development creates a predicament for them bentsen said 
in a note from his austinbased election committee 
regardless of your commitments in the presidential race the 
campaign for the senate is vital to texas and must be vigorously 
conducted bentsen said 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee also said he 
was grateful for the bipartisan support he has received 
jack devore bentsens spokesman said he did not know how many 
of the letters were mailed 
the day dukakis announced plans to run with bentsen texas 
commerce bancshares chairman ben love who has supported both bush 
and bentsen summed up his dilemma 
this will produce probably more ulcers than the plunge to 10 
per barrel in the price of oil love said 
texas law allows a senator to run for reelection as well as for 
vice president 
if bentsen were elected to both positions his successor in the 
senate would be chosen in a special election 
polls have shown bentsen has a strong lead over his senate 
opponent rep beau boulter rtexas

police have uncovered no new information during 
an investigation into the 1968 death of the second wife of melvyn 
paisley a central figure in a pentagon procurement scandal a 
newspaper reported 
police may close the investigation next week unless new clues 
surface the seattle times reported sunday mary lou paisleys 
death was ruled an accident at the time and there was no formal 
police investigation 
we dont even know if there was a crime because we havent 
got anything to substantiate that said sgt harlan bollinger 
paisley was a boeing co executive at the time of his wifes 
death he left boeing in 1981 to become assistant secretary of the 
navy and later became a defense consultant he has been a central 
figure in a justice department probe into bidrigging and bribery 
at the pentagon 
it warranted a much more thorough investigation than was given 
back then bollinger said if something like that happened 
today we would have done a tougher investigation and got all the 
information that led up to her death 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella said friday that 
paisley had not been contacted by police and has no inclination 
to dredge up a sad and tragic event that was closed out 20 years 
ago 
paisley told authorities in 1968 that his wife who was an 
artist apparently had gotten up during the night to paint and was 
overcome by fumes while cleaning her brushes 
police decided that mrs paisleys broken ribs and other 
injuries were inflicted inadvertently by firefighters administering 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the couples home in the suburb of 
kent 
friends and family however have questioned the circumstances 
of mrs paisleys death her body was found in a bathroom face 
down in a pile of towels covered with the toxic solvent carbon 
tetrachloride 
according to the coroners report paisley told authorities that 
his wife took two sleeping pills after having a drink and went to 
bed 
but lab tests showed no trace of the paint cleaner no trace of 
the sleeping pills and no alcohol in her bloodstream an autopsy 
listed the cause of death as drug hypersensitivity 
dr donald reay county medical examiner said there is no way 
to determine whether the autopsy tests were accurate the medical 
examiner who performed the autopsy died last year 
the sheriffs office says all police reports on the death were 
apparently destroyed in routine purges of nonhomicide files 
a retired police detective dick phillips however kept the 
only copies of pictures take of paisleys autopsy 
in my mind it was never justified that we never looked into 
it said phillips he said he kept the photos in part because i 
felt that the facts of the autopsy disputed the facts of the case 
so strongly 
nine months after the death paisley married his secretary at 
boeing mildred mcgetrick they were divorced in 1980 and he 
married computer analyst vicki mckim

irans islamic republic news agency 
reported today that iran has accepted un resolution 598 calling 
for an immediate ceasefire with iraq irna also carried a 
statement in english by irans general command of the armed forces 
explaining why the resolution was accepted the following are 
excerpts from the statement by the general command 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the day the oppressive regime of iraq violated irans territory 
the nation fully realized that the savage aggression was the result 
of an international plot to damage the islamic revolution 
today new conditions have been created which call for adoption 
of new stances in order to continue the sacred defense and protect 
islam and the islamic revoluton 
although the enemies of islam have not for a moment stopped 
their plots against the islamic revoluton recently as the blows of 
muslim combatants of iran on the battered body of iraq became more 
deadly the scope of plots became wider 
the world arrogance united states as well as the reactionaries 
came to help iraq with all their power 
in order to damage the revolution they did not spare any 
criminal act and tried to uphold the baghdad regime through their 
massive military financial political and propaganda assistance 
and armed the iraqi army with massive weapons and aids for fresh 
aggressions and continued crimes 
today the whole reactionary and arrogant worlds are trying to 
portray our enemy which has committed unprecedented crimes in the 
history of the world as a peaceloving regime and on the contrary 
misportray our innocent and resistant nation which has always 
sought and still is seeking to thwart the aggression as 
warmongering muslims before world public opinion 
in addition they arrogant and reactionary worlds put utmost 
pressure on iran and threaten the iranian nation 
under such circumstances it is natural for us to try to expose 
the aggressor and prevent the enemies of islam and those who are 
against the independence of nations from taking initiative in 
international scenes 
the announcement of the islamic republics new stand to un 
chief javier perez de cuellar is aimed at implementing this new 
policy 
it is beyond question that defending islam and acting bravely is 
not an act peculiar only to the battlefields but that adoption of 
new methods which can tip the balance to the advantage of islam and 
foil enemy plots speaks for courage in its own right 
at this crucial juncture the armed forces general command 
headquarters deems it necessary to stress the following points 
1 in continuation of the previous statements released by the 
armed forces general command headquarters we once again urge the 
iranian people to man the war fronts to confront enemies 
aggressive nature and foil their criminal acts our brave military 
commanders are still doing all within their power to continue 
safeguarding the islamic revolution 
2 what has happened is expedient by divine assignment 
3 the great leadership of imam khomeini who has successfully 
led the islamic revolution even in the most crucial juncture is 
still the most reliable shelter for the freedom loving people of 
iran whose hearts have been enlightened by such a leadership

reasons and not out of any desire for peace 
in the first official reaction from baghdad to irans 
announcement today that it was accepting un security council 
resolution 598 the official nassif ltayyif jassem said iraq had 
reservations 
our previous knowledge of the devious iranian regime makes us 
be cautious and wary until peace is achieved and until we reach an 
agreement between iran and iraq for peace he said 
we havent been officially apprised of the iranian letter to 
the united nations we are still dealing with news we learned about 
by listening to tehran radio he said in statements reported by 
the iraqi news agency 
the iranian general commands statement did not explain the 
reasons behind irans new stand in terms of a desire for a real and 
just peace but mentioned the circumstances and reasons for their 
latest position in terms of tactical reasons he was quoted as 
saying in a report monitored in nicosia 
jassem appeared to be referring to a portion of the statement by 
the iranian general command which said the arrogant worlds a 
reference to the united states had sought to portray iraq as a 
peaceloving regime because of baghdads previous acceptance of 
security resolution resolution 598 
iraq accepted the resolution immediately after it passed but 
only on condition it was also accepted by iran 
the iranian general command statement advocated a new policy 
to expose the aggressor and prevent the enemies of islam 
from taking the initiative on the international scene

policy iraqi statement said 
the iraqi information minister pointed out that the statement 
of the general command described iraq as hostile not changing the 
old language 
referring to a portion of the iranian statement which called for 
defending islam jassem said this amounted to a call for 
aggression and expansionism 
he who wants peace does not have to call for massing troops on 
the front he said a reference to the iranian general commands 
call for iranians to man the front 
iraqi president saddam hussein on sunday called on irans rulers 
to agree to an honorable end to the war 
irans rulers have to accept the peace road they have to 
abandon their unjust dreams and foolish mottos and slogans their 
hollow illusions after their defeats the iraqi leader said in 
urging the iranian leaders to accept the un resolution 
iraq accepted resolution 598 immediately after it was passed on 
july 20 of last year but only on condition iran abided by it too

democratic nomineetobe michael dukakis and 
jesse jackson emerged from two hours of preconvention unity talks 
today and said they would work together to win the white house from 
the republicans this fall 
at a news conference a few hours before the rap of the opening 
gavel at the convention jackson made no explicit pledge to support 
dukakis nomination but he signaled harmony when he said he had 
no plans to challenge texas sen lloyd bentsens nomination for 
vice president and would offer no encouragement to anyone 
seeking to do so 
dukakis said jackson will be a very important member of this 
team that democrats put together for the fall 
well be campaigning together and well be campaigning 
separately said the man certain to win the democratic 
presidential nomination 
the news conference came at the end of private discussions in 
dukakis hotel suite and both men appeared in excellent spirits 
dukakis praised his rival lavishly for his efforts in 
registering voters and said i want jesse jackson to play a 
major role in this campaign i want his supporters who are out 
there by the millions to be out there in the fall 
asked about jacksons insistence on a role in any transition to 
a democratic administration should the party win the white house 
dukakis said that wasnt discussed 
once weve won the victory if we can build the kind of 
bondthat we think we can the rest will take care of itself 
jackson said his name would be entered into nomination for 
president wednesday night and he was hoping for a miracle 
but he added if the miracle does not come to pass then we 
will pass over to next phase of our campaign 
he listened closely to dukakis description of their 
discussions and said the governor has adequately defined the 
relationship 
i seek no job no salary no title i seek to serve to keep 
america strong to make america better he said 
in television interviews just before the two men met on the day 
the democratic convention opens dukakis spoke in general terms of 
the issues that sources say are in question jackson is seeking the 
right to appoint additional members of the democratic national 
committee and wants a significant role in any transition apparatus 
created for a new democratic administration 
jackson dukakis sole remaining challenger also wants the 
party to finance his campaign travels the sources said 
we will have some atlarge members of the dnc and i suspect 
there will be a good representation which reflects the kind of 
strength that people have at the convention dukakis said today 
on nbctv 
the massachusetts governor also promised to reach out to various 
groups of people in forming his administration if he is victorious 
in the general election he said of jackson he is going to be an 
important part of our team as we go into november he said 
but dukakis added there can be only one quarterback on that 
team only one person who throws the ball and calls the signals 
and that has to be the president of the united states 
separately dukakis was reported to be considering a proposal to 
appoint a transition planning group shortly after this weeks 
democratic national convention wraps up business 
officials said marcia hale who has played a key role in 
organizing the convention for dukakis was being considered to 
direct the transition group 
the talks between dukais and jackson are intended to result in a 
unified party convention the sources who discussed the 
negotiations spoke only on condition they not be identified 
these sources said that while some platform issues remained 
unresolved they were not viewed as the main stumbling blocks to an 
agreement 
instead the talks have centered largely on jacksons call for 
increased clout within the democratic national committee his 
desire to be seen as an official representative of the party in the 
fall campaign and his proposal to be included in any transition 
planning should dukakis be elected 
dukakis sources said sunday night that any decision on a jackson 
role in transition arrangements should wait until after the 
november election 
jackson has demanded an officially sanctioned role in the fall 
campaign including financial support from dukakis it was not 
clear whether jackson had specifically asked dukakis to furnish him 
a chartered jet of his own 
a dukakis source said the massachusetts governor would welcome 
campaign efforts by jackson particularly in voter registration 
but that any funds would have to come from the party 
the sources said jackson is seeking the right to appoint two or 
three dozen atlarge members to the democratic national committee 
a step that would increase his clout in the party structure 
dukakis has said he will not consider any proposals to remove 
party chairman paul kirk who annoyed jackson last week when he 
traveled to boston to introduce dukakis and his choice of sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas as his vice vice presidential running mate 
for his part dukakis was eager to see bentsens nomination go 
unchallenged on thursday night

douglas wrong way corrigan returned 
here today for ceremonies commemorating his famous wrong turn 50 
years ago that led him to fly thousands of miles east instead of 
west to ireland instead of california 
look no hands the 81yearold american declared hands 
aloft in a triumphant gesture as the aer lingus plane carrying him 
from dublin landed at baldonnel airport after a 10minute flight 
first to greet him at baldonnel now irish air force 
headquarters was rw osullivan the aviation engineer who met 
him the first time he landed in dublin in 1938 
us ambassador margaret heckler told the aviator im so 
proud of you you are amazing 
corrigans first transatlantic hop as pilot of a 900 monoplane 
was forbidden by us officials who said his plane wasnt safe he 
said he would fly back to long beach calif but somehow he landed 
in ireland anyhow 
this time corrigan arrived in ireland by commercial jet for 
festivities celebrating his famed wrongway flight then boarded 
the shorts360 propellor plane renamed ww2 for wrong way in 
his honor and flew to baldonnel in the cockpit 
he sported the same leather flying jacket he wore on his first 
flight 
corrigan flew from new york as an honored passenger of aer 
lingus the irish airline on a boeing 747 he wouldnt say in an 
interview before his dekparture from kennedy international airport 
sunday night if the true story of what happened 50 years ago might 
come out during his visit to ireland 
but corrigan of santa ana calf hinted recently that his 
wrongway explanation may change after he arrives in dublin 
nevertheless he stuck to his story during the initial ceremony 
today 
before his departure corrigan was whisked in a new york police 
department helicopter to the brooklyn airfield for a nostalgic 
visit 
it looks a little different than it did 50 years ago its got 
more buildings scattered around he said but the runway is 
still there and the control tower 
his aer lingus flight was delayed for several hours because of 
rain in new york when he took off from floyd bennett field in 
brooklyn on july 17 1938 it wasnt raining at all the 
81yearold corrigan recalled it took him 28 hours to get to 
dublin 
when i saw the water i didnt think it was the pacific but at 
that time i was in the air for 26 hours and when i came down 
through the clouds i noticed i had been reading the compass needle 
backwards he told irish state radio 
that was when i first realized i had been going east instead 
of west he said 
todays flight took about six hours and corrigan did not seem 
to be suffering from the effects of jet lag when he arrived in 
ireland this morning 
i believe hes in splendid form we had plans hed rest for a 
while but he really wasnt interested in that said margaret 
coyne an aer lingus spokeswoman in dublin corrigan is staying in 
dublin as a guest of aer lingus which plans three days of 
ceremonies 
on july 18 1938 when he first touched down in ireland he only 
had 3 in his pocket and didnt know anyone corrigan said 
on his arrival in dublin a half century ago corrigan claimed 
my compass froze i guess i flew the wrong way 
he has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his 
home base of long beach calif after federal aviation authorities 
said his used curtissrobin monoplane was too heavy for a safe 
flight to ireland 
the bureau of air commerce forerunner of the federal aviation 
administration suspended corrigan from flying for five days after 
he made his unauthorized flight 
but america and ireland loved his explanation after he returned 
to new york he was given a tickertape parade there was a meeting 
with president franklin roosevelt and a movie the flying 
irishman starring corrigan as himself 
corrigan a woodworker was inspired to try aviation when he 
helped build the spirit of st louis which charles lindbergh 
flew across the ocean in 1927 he bought his plane for 310 in 1931 
and spent 590 modifying it 
also present at the ceremony welcoming corrigan to ireland were 
transport minister john wilson dublins deputy lord mayor alice 
glenn and aer lingus chief executive david kennedy who wished a 
hearty cead mile failte 100000 welcomes to mr douglas wrong 
way corrigan

after the smiles and kind words exchanged by 
jesse jackson and michael dukakis today jackson still faced the 
challenge of keeping his delegates many of whom passionately 
believe he should have a place on the ticket in line with him at 
the democratic convention 
jackson was to meet today with his delegates to keep open the 
lines of communication and give them an idea about what to expect 
from the convention 
he and dukakis were talking unity at an upbeat news conference 
after their private meeting today jackson said he had no plans to 
have his name put in nomination for vice president or to encourage 
supporters to do so in opposition to dukakis choice 
though he said his name still would be formally offered for the 
presidential nomination jackson acknowledged with a smile that it 
would take a chicago miracle for him to beat dukakis who 
clinched the nomination in the primaries 
jackson has been telling his followers to take it one day at a 
time but even while stressing the need for discipline among his 
supporters he also keeps them fired up with the call to never 
surrender 
i have one gear its forward never backward never sideways 
i will never surrender you must never surrender he told a 
cheering crowd of close ot 4000 at a sunday nights glittering 
stage tribute to him featuring singer al green and other performers 
on the day before the opening of the democratic convention as 
aides were working diligently to set up todays meeting between 
jackson and dukakis jackson campaigned around atlanta preaching 
at a church service speaking to a labor convocation talking to 
the democratic national committees black caucus 
he also raised money to fuel his new political action committee 
called keep hope alive it will give political contributions to 
office seekers who espouse a progressive agenda 
jackson predicted sunday the democrats would have a great 
convention but not necessarily a quiet one because he wants to 
debate the platform issues on which he and dukakis disagree 
formal talks on the platform were suspended by jackson who was 
miffed last week when dukakis failed to tell him ahead of time 
about his vice presidential choice 
we can afford to lose a point on the floor but not our 
integrity he told the dnc black caucus session where he raised 
money for his pac 
later at the entertainment tribute he said those who are 
afraid to debate a different point of view thats the politics of 
hysteria 
earlier he told labor union delegates that the convention was 
not a coronation were not threatening to leave the 
convention were talking about threatening to stay 
jackson made it clear the question of his name being entered for 
the vice presidential nomination wasnt settled and that 
differences over the platform remained 
he asked delegates to wait and see how theyre treated before 
deciding what to do on the vice presidential question a clear 
reference to the meetings with the dukakis campaign over jacksons 
future role in the campaign and the party 
however he suggested that the tension between the two camps 
wasnt all that big a problem 
weve seen conventions where candidates were coming into the 
conventions attacking each other personally gouging each other 
jackson said in 1968 there were riots that will not happen in 
atlanta 
in fact he said internal debate is the best tradition of our 
party its good for our party our time is upon us now were 
fighting the right fight 
you cannot have new life without some pain whenever weve 
made progress real progress its always through creative tension 
america were about to have a great convention he declared

race has been ruled out as a motive for 
the slaying of a young black woman found with kkk scratched 
into her thighs police said 
a black man jeffrey allen dawson 29 of kingston was being 
held without bail in the ulster county jail in the death police 
said sunday that dawson knew the victim anna kithcart 19 of 
kingston and that both were drug abusers 
dawson was arrested late saturday and pleaded innocent to a 
seconddegree murder charge this morning at his arraigment in city 
court 
the young womans partially clad body was found tuesday morning 
behind kingston hospital 
kingston police detective michael turck said sunday that any 
racial motive in the case has now been ruled out despite early 
speculation that it might be race related because of the kkk 
inscription presumed to represent the initials of the ku klux klan 
dawson and the victim were both seen at the royal grill bar 
monday evening just before miss kithcarts death but turck said 
police were not sure whether they were together or if they left at 
the same time 
sometime afterward police said the two apparently got into an 
argument behind the hospital a few blocks from the bar kithcarts 
body showed evidence of strangulation and a blow to the head the 
exact cause of death has not been released 
there is evidence of drug use and abuse prevalent throughout 
this case dawsons actions were not racially motivated said 
turck dawson was a suspect in the case from the beginning he said 
investigators speculated the letters kkk may have been 
carved onto the victim after she was killed 
also charged in the case is a transient and former mental 
patient who is accused of sexually abusing the victims corpse 
joseph kiernan 41 was not considered a suspect in the death 
although police said they believe he may have carved the initials 
police have obtained a handwriting sample from kiernan and are 
awaiting test results to determine whether it matches the writing 
of the person who inscribed the initials assistant district 
attorney john prizzia said 
miss kithcarts father has said his daughter was a drug abuser 
im almost positive it was a drug rub eugene kithcart said 
last week 
kingston is located about 25 miles north of wappingers falls on 
the opposite shore of the hudson river last november 16yearold 
tawana brawley of wappingers falls was found with the letters 
kkk and racial epithets scrawled in a charcoallike substance 
on her skin after she was missing for four days 
she later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of 
white men but she and her family have refused to cooperate with a 
state investigation

police bans and tight security 
prevented major public celebrations on nelson mandelas 70th 
birthday today but his wife said the day still focused attention 
on the crimes of apartheid 
celebrations protests and church services were planned in at 
least 30 countries and world leaders issued statements condemning 
the imprisonment of the leader of the outlawed african national 
congress 
but in south africa police banned events related to mandelas 
birthday 
mandelas wife winnie told a news conference in johannesburg 
she was disappointed that the planned celebrations including a 
sunday concert in the soweto township had been prohibited 
we had every intention of conveying a message of goodwill and 
of hope with that concert she said 
we wanted this to be a peaceful day mrs mandela said 
its our own way of focusing on the crimes of apartheid 
she said she was humbled by the worldwide attention focused on 
her husband probably the worlds best known and most influential 
prisoner 
mrs mandela said her husband was in perfect health and 
completely aware of everything thats going on around the 
world 
but she said mandela has been isolated in a prison hospital 
since undergoing a prostate operation two years ago he must 
petition prison officials to see other inmates and is allowed only 
40minute visits she said 
more than 1000 students attended an indoor service at the 
university of the western cape made up mostly of mixedrace 
students 
also antiapartheid activist rev alan boesak called for 
mandelas release in a service at st francis catholic church in 
the black township of langa there were no reports of incidents at 
either location 
police have refused to grant permission for outdoor gatherings 
and none was scheduled 
police maintained a visible presence at many school campuses 
today they also dismissed students at several black schools in 
cape town to prevent confrontations 
authorities broke up a planned meeting at the bontehewel high 
school in the mixedrace township of athlone outside cape town and 
sent students home 
late sunday night a house was burned down on property north of 
johannesburg where an amateur soccer game and tea party were to be 
held in mandelas honor saturday the owner miranda harris said 
police vehicles had parked in front of the house and obtained a 
court order banning the party 
beeld the progovernment afrikaanslanguage daily said in an 
editorial today there would never be a better time to release 
mandela from prison 
the paper said mandela served his propaganda war better in 
jail than he would as a free man birthday wishes from around the 
world the paper said proved mandela had acquired a status 
larger than life that he would have a hard time maintaining out 
of jail 
the countrys leading financial daily business day criticized 
the governments strategy of banning birthday celebrations 
there is nothing the government could have done which would 
have been more effective in building the legend of nelson 
mandela the newspaper said 
meanwhile security forces some in armored vehicles patrolled 
the countrys major black townships though there were no reports 
of violence 
police also set up several roadblocks including one outside 
cape towns pollsmoor prison where mandela is held 
in the past week more than 30 people involved in birthday 
events in the cape town area have been arrested 
mrs mandela last week rejected a government offer to have a 
sixhour visit with her husband on his birthday deciding to focus 
attention on other prisoners held for antiapartheid activities 
said the familys attorney ismail ayob 
the visit which would have been the couples longest reunion 
since mandela was jailed 26 years ago was a special concession by 
prison authorities who normally grant only 40minute visits 
mrs mandela planned to stay home and would likely to visit her 
husband later in the week ayob said 
mandela is probably the worlds best known and most influential 
prisoner and his birthday has drawn worldwide attention 
the countries whose governments have called for mandelas 
release in the past few days include britain japan west germany 
east germany canada italy switzerland denmark finland 
iceland norway and sweden 
mandela was jailed in 1962 for leaving the country illegally and 
inciting unrest while serving a fiveyear term he was sentenced 
to life imprisonment in 1964 for sabotage and plotting the 
overthrow of the white minority government 
most of south africas 26 million blacks have never seen mandela 
or heard him speak because it is illegal to publish his picture or 
quote his words in south africa yet he has become the embodiment 
of black resistance to apartheid

the past 16 months and many years before that without developing 
enormous respect and genuine friendship somebody who has done 
what he has done who has not only competed so successfully in this

the united states but has probably registered more people as 
voters than anybody in this country has reached out and been able 
to involve and win the support of literally millions and millions 
of americans many of whom were never a part of the political 
process many of whom are young are people that he and i and

the soviet leadership today rejected a bid by a 
predominantly armenian region to secede from the republic of 
azerbaijan in a bitter territorial dispute that has sparked five 
months of unrest in the caucasus 
the presidium of the supreme soviet of the ussr confirmed 
today that nagornokarabakh belongs to azerbaijan the official 
soviet news agency tass said 
the decision at the special session was unanimous even though 
armenia which has supported the effort by the region of 
nogornokarabakh to separate from azerbaijan is represented on 
the presidium 
at the same time the presidium made provision for measures 
that would ensure the regions real autonomy as well as 
unconditional fulfullment of a comprehensive program for its social 
economic and culutural development tass said the presidium is 
the governments highest executive body 
nagornokarabakh has been part of the mostly moslem soviet 
republic since 1923 although threequarters of its 160000 
inhabitants are ethnic armenians who are predominantly christian 
on july 12 the legislature of the delawaresized district voted 
to secede from azerbaijan and join neighboring armenia but 
azerbaijans government voided the decision hours later calling it 
illegal 
the 1977 soviet constitution requires that any of the nations 
15 constituent republics agree before any change can be made in its 
borders 
both nagornokarabakh and armenia which has voted to accept the 
region asked the central soviet leadership to intervene in the 
dispute which has kept the caucasus on the boil with ethnic 
tensions since february and has triggered strikes that have cost 
more than 100 million 
the presidium headed by president andrei a gromyko has more 
than 30 members and includes top government and communist party 
officials including mikhail s gorbachev the partys general 
secretary and top leaders from all 15 republics 
tass said representatives of armenia azerbaijan and 
nagornokarabakh would first deliver reports to the presidium and 
that members of the executive body would take part in the debate 
it gave no estimate of how long the meeting might last or when a 
decision could be expected 
because of the constitutional provision that gives azerbaijan an 
effective veto over any change in nagornokarabakhs status it was 
uncertain what moves the presidium might take 
tass said gromyko opened the session by noting that the 
situation in nagornokarabakh had worsened since the presidium last 
discussed the issue on march 23 when it rejected as 
intolerable the armenian campaign for annexation 
the search for the right solution the 78yearold soviet 
head of state declared should be conducted within the framework 
of the constitution of the ussr socialist values and mutual 
respect for the opinion traditions and national dignity of every 
people 
gromykos reference to the constitution may have signified 
highlevel opposition to the transfer of sovereignty 
any action taken by the moscow leadership will be keenly 
followed by other ethnic groups now demanding more say about their 
future including the baltic peoples of lithuania latvia and 
estonia and the crimean tatars 
the dispute over nagornokarabakh began in february when the 
mountainous regions legislature voted to ask azerbaijan and 
armenia to consent to the transfer of sovereignty 
armenias legislature agreed june 15 but azerbaijans 
parliament rejected the request two days later setting the stage 
for the breakaway declaration by nagornokarabakhs lawmakers 
the dispute has triggered street demonstrations and strikes by 
armenians in nagornokarabakh and armenia itself since february it 
has sparked ethnic violence including rioting on feb 28 in the 
azerbaijani city of sumgait in which 32 people 26 of them 
armenians were killed 
gorbachev made a personal appeal for calm to the people of 
armenia and azerbaijan on feb 26 but the turmoil only briefly 
subsided 
a multimillion dollar economic and social development plan 
announced by the government and party for nagornokarabakh also 
failed to placate armenians who consider the enclave part of their 
historic homeland 
since may 23 a general strike has shut down industries and 
offices in stepanakert the administrative center of 
nagornokarabakh and a sympathy strike called july 4 in armenia 
and its capital yerevan has persuaded thousands to stay off the 
job 
yerevan party chief ms minasbekyan told armenians on 
television that in the days of strikes the republic has lost 
some 70 million rubles 113 million the official tass news 
agency reported from yerevan late sunday 
minasbekyan said that for each day the strike continues 32 
apartments will go unbuilt 
tass reported over the weekend that the situation in the 
nagornokarabakh autonomous region is becoming more tense with the 
approach of todays meeting of the presidium of the supreme 
soviet

six dead seals were found in 
limfjorden bay signaling the possible spread of a herpes virus 
that has claimed hundreds of the mammals in north european waters 
the carcasses had drifted ashore in the limfjorden which 
stretches across the northern part of the jutland peninsula the 
bay previously untouched by the virus is home to about 800 seals 
tests by the state veterinary serum laboratory showed that they 
died of acute pneumonia caused by the same virus that has killed 
seals in danish and german waters according to danish radio 
the epidemic is caused by a herpes virus believed linked to 
pollution 
the seal population in limfjorden is the third biggest in danish 
waters and experts were hoping that it would be saved from 
disease since the bay is virtually sealed off from other waters

secretary of state george p shultz who lashed out 
at south koreas closedmarket economy is expected to take up 
trade issues tuesday when he meets prime minister noboru takeshita 
and other japanese leaders 
in contrast to south korea however both sides here have noted 
progress in tackling the trade problems that have marred 
usjapanese ties 
things are moving in the right direction its a different 
atmosphere now a senior us state department source said as 
shultz began his 40hour tokyo visit 
a japanese foreign ministry official said last week that japan 
has agreed to liberalize its imports of american beef and citrus 
is opening up public works contracts to american construction 
companies and is reducing its vast trade surplus with the united 
states 
we cant be complacent but we have shown the world how to 
cope with the problem the japanese official said speaking 
anomyously 
the us trade deficit with japan which stood at about 60 
billion last year is expected to shrink by 5 billion to 10 
billion by the end of 1988 
but japanese officials are in turn concerned about a us 
congressional trade bill that is widely regarded in asia as 
protectionist growing protectionism in the united states has been 
a key theme of shultzs nearly completed ninecountry swing through 
asia and the pacific 
shultz a staunch advocate of free market economics was 
critical of south koreas efforts to keep american beef citrus 
cigarettes and other products out of that countrys booming 
domestic economy 
an awful lot of people have said to me that you shouldnt keep 
pressing for these marketopening measures because its causing 
koreans to be antiamerian shultz said before departing seoul 
for tokyo and i have to say well if that causes you to be 
antiamerican help yourself 
sometimes it seems to us that everyone wants the us market 
to be open and thats as far as it goes he said thats not an 
open world trading system its got to be reciprocal 
south koreas dynamic economic growth has been fueled by exports 
to the united states with which it enjoyed a trade surplus of 
about 10 billion public resentment of us pressure to open 
korean markets has increased antiamerican sentiment 
in seoul shultz also pledged american military support in event 
north korea tries to disrupt the upcoming olympics in the south 
korean capital 
military aggression will be deterred thats what our forces 
are here for shultz told reporters i think being prepared is 
the answer to preventing aggression from taking place 
voicing confidence in a terroristfree olympiad shultz said if 
pyongyang staged any attack it would be an aggression against the 
whole world the whole world will be watching 
shultz quoted south korean leaders as expressing the seemingly 
universal opinion that the united states maintain its troops in 
south korea until tensions with the north subside the us has 
42000 troops in south korea under an agreement made following the 
korean war 
shultz stressed that washington supported recent seoul efforts 
at reconciliation with north korea but said the united states 
would itself move cautiously in dealing with a nation he described 
as terrorist 
in tokyo shultz also is expected to discuss problems in 
cambodia and korea the future of us military bases in the 
philippines and a multilateral plan to rehabilitate the ailing 
philippine economy

michael dukakis is promising to wage war on 
drugs homelessness and poverty if elected president but he isnt 
saying how he would do that and still mop up all that republican 
red ink in washington 
dukakis has leavened traditionally liberal stands on health 
insurance education and social security with a commitment to 
businesslike efficiency in managing the affairs of government 
his bedrock campaign vow is to preside over an economy that 
provides good jobs at good wages for every citizen and he 
cites the turnabout in the massachusetts economy over the past 
decade as evidence of his capacity to occupy the chief executives 
mansion at 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
but this efficiencyminded governor has not provided voters a 
balance sheet explaining just how he proposes to fulfill these 
promises while still mopping up the republican red ink in 
washington 
he extols partnerships with the private sector like programs he 
launched in massachusetts to build day care centers and subsidized 
housing 
dukakis also points with pride to massachusetts recent 
enactment of the nations first law requiring most employers to 
offer workers basic health insurance a program that will cost the 
state 550 million through 1992 
dukakis noting that most of the 37 million americans without 
health insurance are in working families says a similar 
requirement could be imposed nationally without creating a huge 
federal bureaucracy or costing the treasury a dime 
he has attached dollar signs to only a few of his campaign 
pledges a 500 million economic development fund to spur regional 
growth 250 million on a national teaching excellence fund to 
lure college students into the profession with scholarships 3 
billion in housing subsidies over three years for a national 
partnership for affordable housing to help end the shame the 
disgrace of homelessness in america 
he promises to make a firstrate education a birthright for 
every child and to provide welfare mothers real training for real 
jobs his state has been a pacesetter in training programs to 
provide a pathway out of welfare 
he vows there will be no cuts or meanstesting of social 
security 
dukakis says of reducing the gaping federal deficits there 
are only four ways to do it cut spending increase revenue 
improve economic performance and reduce interest rates we must do 
all four 
no serious candidate for president can rule out the 
possibility of new taxes he says but he insists that before any 
be considered an attempt be made to collect every dime we can 
of the 110 billion that scofflaws and cheats fail to pay the 
treasury each year 
any new taxes should be based on ability to pay dukakis 
says 
he speaks often of ending reagan administration cuts in student 
aid and other social programs but not of launching new federal 
initiatives 
he promises to wage a real war not a phony war against 
drugs by appointing an antidrug czar cutting off foreign aid 
to countries that refuse to crack down on drugs expanding drug 
treatment and education programs and giving the coast guard 
customs service and the drug enforcement administration the support 
they need 
he also would authorize our armed services under appropriate 
circumstances to assist foreign governments seeking to destroy 
drug crops and labs within their borders 
he opposes such strategic weapons systems as the mx and 
midgetman missiles as well as the b1 bomber already in limited 
production but he also vows to beef up conventional us forces 
promising to insist on real defense for our dollars 
dukakis frequently ridicules president reagans strategic 
defense initiative and says the nation needs star schools not 
star wars but he would scale back not eliminate basic research 
on the space defense shield to its pre1983 level of less than 1 
billion a year 
on americas huge trade deficit dukakis has generally opposed 
protectionist legislation saying if were going to make america 
no 1 again weve got to do more than wave a fist at our foreign 
competitors weve got to roll up our sleeves go to work and beat 
them 
on education dukakis promised to create tuition prepayment 
plans for families who can save for students who must borrow 
he said i will propose an education insurance fund that like a 
reverse social security will allow loan repayment through 
payroll withholding 
he opposes the death penalty 
he supports medicaid funding of abortions 
on energy the new england governor is adamantly opposed to an 
oil import tax he would seek to repeal the windfall profits tax 
fill the strategic petroleum reserve encourage use of natural gas 
and oppose construction of new nuclear plants until waste disposal 
and other problems are resolved 
on the middle east dukakis has promised to reinvigorate the 
quest for peace along the lines laid out in the camp david accords 
he is a strong supporter of israel 
dukakis is a critic of political action committees he has 
refused to accept pac contributions and supports lowering the limit 
on how much they can give congressional candidates from 5000 to 
1000

jesse jackson is trying to get what he wants at 
the democratic national convention by refusing to say just what it 
is that leaves artfully unanswered the riddle that has worried the 
democrats all year 
jackson described his demands in euphonic generalities that 
right up to the conventions opening day defied any settlement 
with michael dukakis the democratic presidential nominee in 
waiting 
that preserved what little suspense remained in the democratic 
script more to the jackson point it preserved the losing 
candidates role on the convention stage 
jacksons platform dissent will be played out on tuesday his 
name will be entered in his losing cause on the roll call for 
presidential nomination on wednesday night he said today he would 
not enter it for the vice presidential nomination on thursday and 
would not encourage anyone else to do so but it is still possible 
somebody will put his name up against sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
dukakis choice and the certain nominee 
nonetheless jackson says that by the end of convention week 
the party will be united 
dukakis will be in control from tonights opening gavel when 
delegates vote on a major issue they will vote with dukakis 
although his camp can afford to provide conciliatory leeway for 
victories by the jackson minority on some points 
jackson says he isnt after a job a title or a position i 
seek a partnership i seek equity i seek shared responsibility 
he said 
later the black candidate tried a plantation analogy i dont 
mind working he said ill go out and pick the voters ill go 
back and bale up some votes but when i get back to the big house i 
want to help count the cotton 
jackson complains that the democrats have not defined a place 
for the progressive wing in the campaign 
dukakis could of course reply that he is something of a 
progressive or at least that some of his best friends are 
progressives 
dukakis and his lieutenants have said repeatedly that they want 
jackson in the councils of the party and on the campaign for the 
democratic ticket theyve said that jacksons campaign allies will 
have a role but they are not about to give away pieces of the 
political command the massachusetts governor won in the democratic 
presidential primaries 
dukakis said sunday that jackson is an important member of the 
democratic team but added pointedly that he wont be calling the 
plays every team has to have a quarterback the massachusetts 
governor said thats the nominee 
jackson had a sporting reply the democratic convention is 
just the allstar game not the world series he told his 
supporters dont make world series decisions dont just say how 
well youre doing because you make a great shot in the first 
quarter 
ron brown jacksons convention manager said a unity accord 
would require mutual trust and respect and a feeling of comfort 
which can only grow from a facetoface meeting the two met two 
weeks ago in boston but that was before dukakis chose bentsen as 
his vice presidential nominee and let it be known publicly before 
he told jackson privately 
another adviser frank watkins said the jackson camp wants to 
be in the circle in the loop on the team once thats clear 
he said such matters as campaign travel arrangements and staff 
help for the general election will fall into place 
he didnt quite dismiss speculation that one of the things 
jackson wants is access to a chartered campaign airplane after 
all said watkins if the dukakis people want jackson to campaign 
in california one day and new york the next they wont expect him 
to walk 
that general election campaign role is the one that will count 
for the dukakis ticket and for jackson as well 
former president jimmy carter said jackson will work for the 
ticket in carters view jackson will not risk being seen as the 
cause of a democratic rift that might lead to defeat on nov 8 
along with his demands jackson sends regular signals that he 
will be aboard for the campaign against the republicans 
while he told labor delegates on sunday that the convention 
should not be a coronation jackson added 
were not threatening to leave the convention were 
threatening to stay

if democratic convention visitors to atlanta want 
southern cooking they will have to look for it among 
restaurants that take 28 yellow pages to list but its there and 
its worth the hunt 
it is one of a few distinctive regional cuisines left in 
america but it is changing and it is hard to define 
southern cooking is primarily home cooking not chefs art 
writes nathalie dupree in her book new southern cooking 
our desire to preserve hold on to and remain set in our ways 
is reflected in our politics and customs and in the soul food that 
became a trademark and mainstay of southern cooking she writes 
much of it came from former slaves who were our cooks 
a few atlanta restaurants specialize in traditional southern 
dishes thelmas kitchen and mary macs tea room are among the 
betterknown ones 
but amanda brown olmstead publicist for the nationally 
broadcast public television series new southern cooking with 
nathalie dupree has a different idea about the best place to 
find southern cooking in atlanta 
my advice is to make a friend and eat in she said thats 
where you are going to find true southern cooking the way my momma 
did it and the way we still do it 
visitors can expect to find lots of carbohydrates such as grits 
and biscuits and a lot of fried food especially chicken there 
is nothing more southern than those three foods she said 
southern regional specialties are becoming more complex ms 
duprees new book has a grits recipe that includes turnip greens 
parmesan cheese and whipped cream not traditional but certainly 
southern new approaches to traditional ingredients live 
cheekbyjowl with hush puppies and corn bread 
the southern ham or sausage biscuit she said is now a popular 
fastfood item across the country 
southern cooking is the stuff of poems comfort and coronaries 
nostalgia and bad nay cruel jokes it is improperly 
generalized the spicy cajun offerings of south louisiana have 
little in common with the rest of the region 
other regional specialties such as barbecue are available 
almost everywhere in some form or another 
this son of the pacific northwest fell happily into his first 
rural barbecue pit two years ago it was peanuts redneck 
barbecue on a back road near athens ga believe every word on 
the sign 
the word barbecue comes from the old french from the beard 
to the tail which is how they skewered goats for cooking back 
then in mexico today the wildly popular barbacoa is almost 
always goat and usually reserved for sundays 
in the south it is pork unless specified otherwise most rural 
pits close early and dont serve alcohol generally they do just 
one thing and they do it very well 
barbecue is taken seriously and southerners go through it like 
sherman through georgia a comparison visitors would do well to 
avoid 
atlanta has its share of good barbecue pits but the ones with 
atmosphere lurk outside smaller towns usually in tinroofed 
ramshackle buildings redolent of hickory smoke and pungent sauce 
furnished with long common tables and benches ask locally 
theres no real secret to barbecue the genius cook at the 
fresh air barbecue near jackson ga told visitors recently 
most folks just dont take time to do it right 
the time to do it right from when the fresh hams are put in the 
slowcooking smoker until they fall apart in their savory glory is 
about 24 hours 
barbecue often comes with brunswick stew which is another 
southern standby and a piece of corn bread the size of europe 
sauces vary from the pointless to fiery potions it takes a whip and 
a chair to tame try a little before you slop it on 
memphis claims the title of the american mecca of barbecue 
thats probably true but dont say so at peanuts or at the fresh 
air just dont

a motorcyclist who led police on 
a chase at up to 140 mph across six freeways took advantage of his 
lead to stop for gas and a coke before he was caught authorities 
said 
cary watson 30 who told police he was a professional 
motorcycle rider was arrested sunday afternoon at a restaurant in 
oceanside 
that was more than an hour after officers tried to pull him over 
for nearly colliding with a police car in huntington beach 80 
miles away said sgt ed deuel 
watson of nearby ontario reached speeds up to 140 mph as he 
led patrol cars and a police helicopter on the chase deuel said 
the helicopter was called to the scene immediately because 
that was the only way we could stay with the motorcyclist through 
the traffic he said 
watson evaded officers on city streets for seven minutes then 
headed north on the san diego freeway the sergeant said the chase 
took police onto five other freeways 
watson stopped in san juan capistrano where he took 2 worth of 
gasoline without paying for it deuel said he then rode his 1987 
honda interceptor to the restaurant deuel said 
he took off his helmet put it on the motorcycle went inside 
and ordered a coke to go said lt george renek who surmised 
that watson hoped to mingle with the crowd and get lost in it 
watson was arrested without incident and booked for 
investigation of misdemeanor reckless driving evading arrest 
petty theft and drag racing he was free on bail deuel said 
i think he just didnt want to get a ticket renek said

jackson let me express my thanks to governor dukakis and 
senator bentsen 
weve had a very fruitful and thorough meeting today 
we said early on in my campaign that we had the challenge to 
win the three prerequisites were to one expand our party and 
make room for some new people people who had grown cynical who 
had withdrawn whod pushed out of the process who felt abandoned 
but had the power to vote 
it was our challenge to renew their faith revive their spirits 
establish within them hope again 
the excitement that we feel in atlanta today is hope has been 
unleashed on our nation ghettoes barrios farmers who are 
trapped in the double drought of the cutoff of support from 
washington and the lack of rain but feel the hope that a new day 
is coming and theyre holding on until the morning comes 
and so a key has been to expand our party 
the second key to build a viable broadbased coalition where 
the interests of many democrats converge we find common ground 
move from a history so often a battleground racial or sexual or 
religious or even regional battleground to economic and social 
common ground and on tomorrow higher ground 
we talked about building that coalition and then to change our 
national priorities 
we met and discussed matters of serious and significant concern 
a relationship of substance support and candor the commitment to 
help build a team that will expand our party and carry us to 
victory in november 
the platform negotiations will resume today no doubt therell 
be debate and deliberation on tomorrow night but debate and 
deliberation stirs the soul of our democracy through debate over 
the soul of our party we debate policy and priorities and 
direction 
on wednesday night my name will go into nomination when that 
is over we go on to another level of our campaign because then we 
will have a nominee 
things are fundamentally changed then we move from the allstar 
break of american politics on to the world series in november we 
intend to win 
we talked about expanded roles and participation in the 
democratic national committee at the state and national levels and 
then we talked about legislation that will make a difference that 
will be emphasized in the campaign that has great meaning that 
plantclosing legislation that senator bentsen has been so 
identified with his commitment to dc statehood to enfranchise 
those residents who live in the capital of our country or the 
commitment that congressman conyers has to universal onsite same 
day registration or congressman dellums commitment to legislation 
that will end apartheid in south africa or the abc childcare 
legislation or economic setasides for development 
so the range of subject matter was broad indepth in detail 
in my judgment fruitful 
were now on a track that will lead to expanded involvement 
more excitement and great motivation to build a team that will 
carry us to victory and will spare the people of the agony 
abandonment and neglect they felt these last seven years 
of all of the programs to end dope cutting it off at the 
source strengthening border patrols or clinics for those who are 
sick the most effective dope program is hope hope is the 
alternative to dope 
hope must dispel our fears our reasonable doubts to gain for 
us our sense of selfesteem we must build a campaign of hope in 
all of our doing keep hope alive

douglas wrong way 
corrigan going the right way this time returned monday to the 
airfield where he landed his small plane 50 years ago after leaving 
new york on a flight to california 
look no hands the 81yearold american declared arms 
aloft in a triumphant gesture as the commuter plane carrying him 
from dublin landed at baldonnel airport corrigan wore the same 
leather flying jacket he had on when he landed here the first time 
an army band a cabinet minister and the us ambassador greeted 
him along with rw sullivan the aircraft engineer who met him on 
the first trip 
he came to ireland by commercial jet for festivities celebrating 
his famous wrongway flight then joined the pilot in the cockpit 
of a propeller plane renamed ww2 or wrong way 2 for the 
10minute flight to baldonnel 
corrigan has always said he misread his compass headed east by 
mistake and did not know until his 900 curtissrobin monoplane 
pierced the clouds 28 hours later that he was over ireland he had 
applied to fly the atlantic but was refused because the plane 
carrying 330 gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil was 
deemed too heavy to be safe over the ocean 
before leaving the united states for his first trip to ireland 
since the texasborn pilot hinted his story might change but he 
stuck to it at the initial ceremony 
i followed the wrong end of the compass needle he told 
admirers at baldonnel airport its a simple thing to happen it 
shouldnt have happened i was the first one to admit that i had 
made a mistake and i was willing to correct it 
he recalled that the the runway at baldonnel now irish air 
force headquarters was a grass strip the last time he landed there 
i taxied up to a little shack where there were two men in 
uniform corrigan said i was in trouble until they found out 
what my name was and the policeman said hes just another 
irishman coming home 
us ambassador margaret heckler said monday im so proud of 
you you are amazing 
corrigan said he had never really been in ireland before because 
he had no passport or other papers the first time he arrived 
this time im in ireland and i have the papers to prove it he 
said 
also present were transport minister john wilson alice glenn 
deputy lord mayor of dublin and david kennedy chief executive of 
the national airline aer lingus who wished a hearty cead mile 
failte 100000 welcomes to mr douglas wrong way corrigan 
wilson congratulated the sprightly american on still being able 
to fit into his 1938 flying jacket and said he hoped corrigans 
plane now partly dismantled at his home in santa ana calif 
might one day return to ireland for exhibit 
when corrigan landed in ireland on july 18 1938 after a flight 
that was supposed to take him to long beach calif he had only 3 
in his pocket and knew no one he said in an interview sunday 
before departing from new york 
this time accompanied by his son harry and daughterinlaw 
charlotte corrigan crossed the atlantic in six hours as an honored 
guest of aer lingus in a boeing 747 the airline plans three days 
of ceremonies for him 
us aviation authorities suspended corrigan from flying for 
five days after he his unauthorized trip to dublin but americans 
and the irish loved his explanation 
the results in the united states were a new york tickertape 
parade a meeting with president franklin d roosevelt and a movie 
the flying irishman starring corrigan as himself 
he was a woodworker and took up aviation when he helped build 
the spirit of st louis in which charles lindbergh made the first 
solo flight across the atlantic in 1927 
corrigan bought his own plane for 310 in 1931 and spent 590 
modifying it for the trip

irans acceptance of a ceasefire in its 
war with iraq could cause major economic and political shifts in a 
region that has forged eight years of policy around the persian 
gulf war 
an end to the war could also be an ominous development for 
israel both iran and iraq are enemies of the jewish state but 
have been preoccupied with fighting each other 
the brief statement released today by the official islamic 
republic news agency in which tehran said it accepted a un 
ceasefire resolution raised hopes that the war would finally come 
to an end 
iran which has suffered a series of defeats at iraqi hands in 
recent months may have decided finally to accept an end to the 
conflict alternatively it may be seeking time to rebuild its 
battered war machine 
early reaction from iraq was cautious 
iraqs information minister nassif ltayyif jassem said iran 
accepted the resolution for tactical reasons and not out of any 
desire for peace 
our previous knowledge of the devious iranian regime makes us 
be cautious and wary until peace is achieved and until we reach an 
agreement between iran and iraq for peace he was quoted by the 
iraqi news agency as saying 
iraq accepted the un resolution soon after it was issued last 
year 
with eight years of hostility to overcome each side will be 
highly suspicious of the others motives a factor that could 
delay a shift away from military spending 
but an end to clashes on land and over the persian gulf would 
remove a major threat to the countries that provide much of the 
worlds oil supplies and sit on half of its known oil reserves 
there would be no need for the united states to maintain a 
massive and costly fleet in the persian gulf to protect oil 
shipping from warrelated attacks and to prevent growing soviet 
influence 
the removal of the us fleet and us pressure for an arms 
embargo of iran would remove a major source of friction between the 
united states and a country it has long viewed as vitally 
strategic improved relations could benefit the americans held 
hostage by proiranian factions in lebanon 
iraq and iran would be free to use some of their massive oil 
wealth to rebuild their warravaged cities ports and oil 
facilities rather than buying military hardware from china france 
the soviet union and elsewhere 
an end to clashes would lessen hostility between iran and iraqs 
main arab backers kuwait and saudi arabia which have suffered 
missile strikes attacks on ships and terrorist acts apparently 
linked to their support of iraq 
iran and iraq will also be under pressure from their warweary 
populations to once again fill their illstocked shops with 
affordable consumer goods and their pockets with the money to buy 
them 
businessmen throughout the world who have suffered for years 
with unpaid credits to iraq and lost business opportunities in iran 
will be looking for massive rewards in the reconstruction efforts 
munition makers will suffer contractors will benefit 
especially the japanese french west german and korean companies 
who have stood by the warstricken countries through hard times 
the effect on global oil markets is uncertain 
but freed from iraqi attacks on its oil shipping iran would be 
able to increase its oil exports at least to the 237 million 
barrelsaday quota laid down by the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries at a time of excess supply and soft prices 
iraq which has no quota because of its insistance that it have 
the same quota as iran is producing 27 million barrels a day and 
exporting via pipelines through saudi arabia and turkey its gulf 
ports were shut down at the start of the war 
unlike iran which has largely avoided debt iraq faces 
repayment of 30 billion in debts to western governments and 
private companies although an end to the war would probably 
loosen further credits 
youve got a country with over 200 billion barrels of proven 
oil reserves they plainly have a way to repay a western 
diplomat in baghdad said earlier this year 
the end of the socalled tanker war in the gulf would slash 
massive insurance premiums now charged for ships in the waterway 
making it more attractive for ships to use ports and drydocks there 
investors who have been fearful of putting money onto the rim of 
a war zone should be attracted back to states such as bahrain and 
dubai 
ports just outside the gulf such as fujaira and khor fhakkan 
would probably suffer as they lose traffic which had flocked there 
to avoid the costly hazardous journey up the gulf

gunman apparently took potluck shooting at whatever cars came 
by 
jason poore who also lives nearby said the shooting started 
near the moped shop and lasted 15 to 20 minutes 
i was coming around the corner and i saw the lights on at the 
moped shop which is unusual for a weekend poore said 
i went home and didnt think nothing of it i sat in the front 
room and heard something popping that sounded like firecrackers 
poore said 
hayes and two of the wounded were taken to north carolina 
baptist hospital according to public relations director roger 
rollman 
oldham said the murder warrants had not been served because 
hayes was in critical condition 
the rest of the wounded were taken to forsyth memorial hospital 
where two were admitted authorities said

texas treasurer ann richards planned monday to 
get a prespeech massage paid for by her mother to soothe away 
any prekeynote jitters 
im terribly nervous im sure ill just be a jittering fool 
by the time im supposed to go on she said early in the day 
as keynote speaker monday on the opening night of the democratic 
national convention ms richards who wants to run for texas 
governor in 1990 had the nations ear 
the keynote i think is the person who just sort of opens the 
door and says come on in and thats what i hope i can do 
tonight talk about who i am where i came from where i think the 
country has been and invite the public to join us she said 
ever since she got the keynote assignment ms richards a 
54yearold divorced mother of four has said she would use it to 
persuade voters that democrats can do a lot to help families 
its not a party issue she said adding however that 
the past eight years of republican administration has made it 
harder on family life 
family life and its demands on women can be the best 
management training in the world according to ms richards who as 
state treasurer handles more than 150 billion worth of 
transactions a year 
managing a house is probably the greatest management training 
in the world youre juggling lives youve got to do it on time 
youve got to bring people to a consensus you have to allow 
everyone to save face all the decisions have to be decisions that 
make everyone happy i think i bring that to my job she said 
and the whitehaired former county commissioner has said the 
speech should be a vehicle for the democratic national ticket not 
her own political future 
im not trying to go down in the history books ill just try 
to communicate and deliver a message she said

innkeeper cindy alper must keep a close 
eye on where a customer sits in the swiss hutte restaurant because 
part of the dining area is in massachusetts and the rest is in new 
york 
there are different meals taxes in the two states her 
husband gert said recently in the massachusetts section its a 
5 percent tax and in the new york part its 7 percent 
the alpers said they knew about the inns dual statehood when 
they bought it two years ago 
the bookwork is a little more the liquor licenses for both 
states and the different taxes but it hasnt been too different 
from other restaurants mrs alper said most people who know 
about it find it amusing 
but mrs alper took exception to publicity the inn received over 
the winter when she had trouble renewing her massachusetts liquor 
license 
the license was revoked temporarily by the egremont selectmen 
when the alpers failed to attend a public hearing to transfer the 
liquor license from the inns former owner 
as a result drinks could be served only in the new york side of 
the restaurant the confusion has since been resolved 
many of the inns patrons are weekend travelers to the community 
of 1200 people from new york massachusetts connecticut and new 
jersey mrs alper said noting that the tanglewood music center is 
nearby in the berkshire mountains 
the alpers arent the only ones coping with life on the edge 
doing business on a twostate basis is nothing new to catamount 
ski area president and general manager william gilbert 
my father years ago built a golf course half in new york and 
half in connecticut gilbert said adding that he once took part 
in a venture to construct a marina on the line between new york and 
new jersey 
this hasnt been a novelty for us gilbert said we were 
almost destined to come to catamount its been our history 
but gilbert said the ski area is not on the border 
that is a misnomer for all intents and purposes we are two 
resorts one is in massachusetts and one is in new york gilbert 
said 
gilbert said he and his partner approached the ski area as two 
separate ventures from the start securing operating permits and 
licenses from new york and from massachusetts 
we were realistic you cant go to massachusetts and say 
will you let new york take care of everything both states regard 
you as part of them and want to take care of what is theirs 
the resort even splits its utilities the lights for night 
skiing are on massachusetts power lines and the lifts run on new 
york electricity 
if there is a power failure in massachusetts we can run the 
lights from new york gilbert said 
law enforcement on the border line also can be unusual egremont 
police chief michael k balcom said 
prior to my coming here the only communication egremont had 
with new york authorities was by telephone the first thing i did 
as chief was to set up radio contact with the columbia county 
sheriffs office he said 
whatever the hardships gilbert and the alpers said they would 
do it all again although mrs alper said there are limits 
ive heard of a restaurant further north on the new 
yorkcanada border i dont know if i would want to do business 
between two countries the two states is enough

the hot dry weather in most of the nation 
this summer may just be a hint of things to come 
researchers using five computersimulated climate models 
forecast that summers in the united states generally will be drier 
over the next 10 years although the models differ on how 
widespread the dry spell will be 
climate observers disagree about the relationship between 
drought and the greenhouse effect in which carbon dioxide methane 
and other gases accumulating in the air trap energy from the sun 
and raise the earths temperature but most express concern about 
increases in these gases 
to study the problem william w kellogg of the national center 
for atmospheric research in bolder colo and zongci zhao of 
peking university used five different climate models to calculate 
the effect on soil moisture their findings were reported in the 
current edition of the journal of climate 
climate models are complex computerized simulations of the 
workings of the earths climate and weather while they attempt to 
duplicate the same processes the versions developed by different 
scientists vary 
kellogg and zhao took the five most respected models doubled 
the calculation for the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
and then ran the computers through several yearly cycles to see 
what would happen to the weather 
three of the models predicted drier summers over the majority of 
the north american continent the other two also called for large 
dry areas although not as extensive as the first three there was 
some indication of increased winter wetness however at least in 
canada 
the researchers found that the regions closer to the poles 
warmed more than the equatorial regions as a result of the 
greenhouse effect that reduced the temperature difference between 
the poles and equator which reduces the planets largescale 
circulation and rainfall patterns 
here is a rundown of the effect on soil moisture according to 
the calculations in the five different climate models run by 
kellogg and zhao 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration geophysical 
fluid dynamics laboratory model summer dry over all of the united 
states winter dry over the united states south of a line running 
generally from cape hatteras in north carolina west to northern 
california 
united kingdom meteorological office model summer dry over 
all of the united states except for portions of southern 
california arizona and new mexico very dry in the great plains 
and southeast winter dry over the united states east of the 
rockies moist over southern california and nevada 
oregon state university model summer dry over all of the 
united states except a portion of southern california and a region 
including arkansas mississippi and the gulf coast from new orleans 
to the florida panhandle winter dry over all of the united states 
except for the northern plains states from wisconsin west through 
eastern washington and oregon

southwesterly through the northwest corner of mexico 
temperatures recently have been the highest since record keeping 
began daniel l albritton told a joint hearing of house committees 
concerned with agriculture and weather problems 
however albritton noted that the weather is subject to large 
periodic changes and recent hot weather may just be a part of that 
cycle

beneath a leafy plane tree at a cafe where 
politics is a hot topic the betting is that michalis will 
squeeze out a narrow victory in november 
michalis is how michael dukakis is known to the 640 people 
who live in pelopi the greek village that bills itself as his 
hometown even though he was born in the united states 
we dont want to shout about it but the gut feeling here is 
that michalis will make it said costas stefanou the 42yearold 
president of the mountain village 
even though dukakis has made only one visit here in 1976 during 
his first term as massachusetts governor he has been honored by 
officials of the village on the island of mytilene 
in june the sixmember local council put up a sign outside town 
that says in greek and english welcome to the hometown of 
michael dukakis 
they also changed the name of the main street a cement strip 
where dogs snooze and chickens wander from athanassios diakou to 
michael dukakis street 
we decided that whether michalis gets elected or not hes 
rewriting the history of our village so he should be remembered 
stefanou said 
the villagers mostly sheep and goatbreeders whose annual 
income averages around 1500 say theyd like to charter a couple 
of jumbo jets to take everyone to washington if dukakis wins 
we should be there for the inauguration michalis may have 
been born in america but hes from pelopi and hes one of us 
said giorgos hatzimichalakis 
they also intend to offer dukakis a plot of land on the mountain 
to build a house where he can think and write or do some 
gardening hatzimichalakis said 
islanders on mytilene also known by its ancient name of lesbos 
are proud of a creative tradition that started with sappho the 6th 
century bc poet who wrote of love between women odysseus elytis 
whose poetry won the nobel prize for literature in 1978 also comes 
from mytilene 
the village of gray stone houses has a spectacular view across a 
narrow strait to the coast of turkey windy and bleak in winter it 
provides a cool refuge in summer from the fierce mediterranean heat 
michalis came here for a few hours on a summer afternoon he 
spoke good enough greek and we sat under the plane tree and 
chatted he seemed a plain straightforward sort of man stefanou 
said 
i remember he liked watermelon he ate his portion and wasnt 
shy about asking for more he added 
dukakis grandparents stylianos and olympia were born in 
pelopi in the 1860s when the island was under ottoman turkish rule 
the village was known then as yelia the greek word for laughter or 
ridicule 
it was renamed in the 1940s after pelops the mythological ruler 
of southern greece at a time when many greek villages adopted 
classical names the villagers say pelopi sounds a bit more 
dignified than yelia 
like other islanders seeking a better life stylianos dukakis 
moved to turkey as a young man to open a grocery store in the town 
of edremit where panos dukakis the governors father was born in 
1896 
the dukakis family had what what we call anisychia a kind 
of restlessness that drives you to get ahead said yiannis 
manolis whose father bought the ruined dukakis family home in 
pelopi in 1933 
nailed to the rebuilt courtyard wall a neatly lettered sign says 
in english this here is the house of the dukakis family 
there is no such sign on the former dukakis home across the 
strait in edremit a prosperous town of 30000 people set in a 
coastal plain covered with olive trees only a few residents know 
the house a twostory building with a vine growing above the door 
on a narrow street lined with artisan workshops 
my father was given this house when the populations were 
moved he never knew who lived there before and i never heard of 
michael dukakis until this year said mahide tassi 50 who lives 
there with her daughter 
more than 4 million greeks and turks were involved in population 
exchanges that followed a failed greek invasion of turkey in 1921 
we thought the house had been a wine store my father used to 
tell how he found a big vat of wine when he moved in she said 
there are no records that list property ownership in edremit 
before world war i a period when greeks owned many of the towns 
stores and controlled much of the trade along the turkish aegean 
coast 
when i heard the presidential candidates family had lived 
here i checked the records but they dont go back so far said 
hayrullah yildiz subgovernor for the edremit district 
the dukakis family kept their links with pelopi by spending two 
months there every summer according to villagers 
the governors father lived with relatives in mytilene town for 
a few months before sailing for the united states in 1912 to join 
his three brothers there his parents and sister followed the 
following year 
by contrast with pelopi there is no hometown backing for 
dukakis in edremit according to yildiz 
i dont think theres any special interest in dukakis here 
were always happy with whoever gets elected whether its ronald 
reagan or michael dukakis or even kirk douglas he said 
but the family that lives in the former dukakis home would like 
the presidential candidate to visit 
win or lose id like to entertain him here said mrs 
tassi gesturing around her brightly painted living room decorated 
in traditional turkish style with benches covered with red cushions 
and weavings

bentsen thank you very much governor dukakis reverend 
jackson there has been a reaching out on both sides in bringing 
these forces together this truly is a politics of inclusion 
there are those who would like to take the approach or perhaps 
the saint ignatius view of politics that what you want is purity 
of ideology and if you find that and work toward that to the 
ultimate finally you have a party of one and you sure dont win 
any elections 
but what you have seen here is a politics of inclusion of 
bringing people together and people who share a common view on 
things that are important to this country of ours jobs health 
care understanding as we have done in the welfare bill you have 
a young single mother on welfare out of a job offering her the 
education the day care for that child so that she can work 
herself out of poverty and into a productive role in our society 
as she wants and to work for the ultimate civil right in our 
country and thats equality of opportunity 
thats what well be striving for 
education where we look at a report today of a child born 
today 19 years from now spending 60000 for a college education 
in a public college and with this administration a cutting back 
in student loans 
looking at housing and the question of affordability there 
those are the things that bring us together 
i say to you that i cannot remember any time since 1964 when 
this party has been more united and brought together to victory 
and im convinced with that 
were going to face a tough fight in november of 1988 but with 
this kind of unity and the motivational work of reverend jesse 
jackson and the leadership of michael dukakis who took a state 
like massachusetts and its economy and turned it around and did it 
with effective management 
a man who his peers have chosen as the most effective governor 
of all the governors in the 50 states with this kind of cohesion 
and unity im convinced were going to win a great victory in 
november 
thank you

a conservative political action committee 
lodged a complaint with the federal election commission on monday 
which charged house speaker jim wright of texas with violating 
campaign laws in part by selling thousands of copies of his book 
to wealthy supporters 
the complaint by citizens for reagan was filed as wright 
prepared to open the first session of the 1988 democratic national 
convention in atlanta wright denounced the complaint as groundless 
and a blatant political attack 
peter t flaherty the groups chairman made clear his intent 
was to embarrass democrats during the week massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis receives the partys presidential nomination 
if the democrats want to have someone as corrupt as wright 
chairing their convention thats their business flaherty said 
in a statement 
but wright cannot hide from his troubles while hes up on that 
platform flaherty said the public is entitled to a thorough 
investigation of these charges and we want to make sure it takes 
place 
in atlanta wright said obviously there are people in the 
republican ranks who are trying their fevered and frantic best 
to spread mud and slime wherever they can 
i have always deplored that type of negative politics i think 
it degrades the political process wright said he said he 
believed the public would ignore the charges and see through 
the gesture 
the house committee on standards of official conduct known as 
the ethics committee began its own investigation of wrights 
activities earlier this summer 
the citizens for reagan complaint centers largely on the sale of 
wrights 117page book reflections of a public man at 595 
each 
it alleges that the 54642 wright received from royalties on 
the sale of the book actually were concealed campaign contributions 
by supporters seeking to avoid the 1000perperson contribution 
limit set by law 
the complaint also alleges that book sales may have been used by 
wright to evade the legal ban on officeholders receiving payment of 
more than 2000 for a single speech 
it alleges the new england life insurance co paid 2000 for 
copies of the books instead of paying wright directly for his 
speech 
the complaint says that this suggests that book sales may 
have been used to circumvent the law limiting payments for speeches 
in a final count the citizens for reagan complaint also accuses 
rep tony coehlo dcalif the house majority whip of campaign 
law violations in holding fundraisers on a yacht with expenses 
picked up by a texas savings and loan institution 
coelho could not immediately be reached for comment 
the complaint acknowledges that coehlos campaign committee and 
the democratic congressional campaign committee paid vernon savings 
and loan of vernon texas 25184 to reimburse its expenses for the 
fundraisers 
but it states that they did so only after the violation was 
revealed

republican strategists gloated about the 
attention being focused on jesse jackson and took potshots at lloyd 
bentsens finances monday as they fought for some of the limelight 
surrounding the democratic convention 
kentucky sen mitch mcconnell said democrats were on the verge 
of a massive violation of campaign spending laws while former 
white house political strategist ed rollins said jackson is getting 
the lions share of attention at a time when certain nominee 
michael dukakis should be the focus 
the democrats have a rough hurdle to get through this week 
rollins said hes been able to get through the primary process 
without falling into the usual traps unfortunately this week the 
eyes of the world are going to focus on mike dukakis for the first 
time hes got to decide who he is 
his comments came as a republican truth squad met with 
reporters in a downtown hotel and were punctuated by the chants of 
run jesse run coming for a mass rally just outside 
this is the sound of peace breaking out next door said rich 
galen a spokesman for the national republican congressional 
committee which is sponsoring the attacks 
the republicans picked two sore spots for democrats by deciding 
to focus on bentsens finances and the dukakisjackson difficulties 
though jackson and dukakis met on monday rollins said there are 
still big questions remaining for voters who are paying attention 
to the democrats this week 
referring to dukakis rollins noted hes said hes going to 
be the quarterback and you can only have one quarterback on the 
team far more important is who is going to be the coach 
is jesse jackson going to call the shots rollins said if 
he is there are a lot of americans who arent going to vote for 
this ticket 
on the finance issue bentsen has been criticized for a 10000 
chairmans club he formed soliciting memberships from 
lobbyists that was disbanded after news accounts and bentsen said 
he had made a mistake 
but the republican on monday chose to focus on bentsens 6 
million war chest for his senate campaign in texas 
under texas law bentsen is able to run simultaneously for both 
the senate and vice president mcconnell said he should put the 6 
million into an escrow account because spending that money in texas 
on behalf of his senate campaign would be indistinguishable from 
spending it on behalf of the dukakisbentsen ticket 
the issue is particularly crucial mcconnell said because texas 
is a swing state he said that allowing bentsen to spend the money 
would in essence allow democrats to violate the 46 million 
spending limit in presidential campaigns 
bentsens doublebarreled campaign gives the democrats an 
exclusive pipeline for unlimited contributions to the dukakis 
effort in texas under a system where private money is totally 
prohibited mcconnell said 
galen rejected suggestions that the republicans were engaging in 
a negative attack 
we have done this previously on a much smaller scale said 
galen its not an effort to be negative its an effort to be 
comparative 
and rollins said he anticipates the democrats will take similar 
steps at next months republican national convention in new orleans 
theyre more than welcome to come said rollins

after years of steady efficiency gains 
motivated by the oil shocks of the 1970s the momentum for 
downsized cars thicker insulation and other energysaving 
developments appears to have run out 
in fact government experts see a 1988 reversal in the economys 
declining energy consumption 
the energy departments semiautonomous energy information 
administration recently revised upward its estimate of british 
thermal units used per dollar of gross national product last year 
the estimate went from 19900 to 20000 btu the same as in 1986 
said information administration economist jerry lagace 
the estimate for the first three months of 1988 is for an 
increase so large i dont believe it lagace said although he 
added this will probably be revised downward 
the united states began becoming more energy efficient in the 
mid1970s after a 1973 oil embargo by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries showed how dependent americans were 
on imported oil gasoline prices rose steeply after the first 
embargo and again after a second oil embargo in 1979 
as a result of the oil shocks us energy useage declined an 
average of 25 percent each year after 1976 
although there are numerous explanations for the reversal in 
energy efficiency the simplest is the low oil prices of recent 
months 
last years 948 cent average price in the united states for a 
gallon of unleaded regular gasoline was the lowest ever after 
factoring out inflation 
another possible explanation for the reversal of energy 
efficiency is the turnaround in us industrial production 
according to estimates by the international energy agency in paris 
about half of the past gains in us industrial energy efficiency 
came from the decline of heavy industry in the economy 
but as the operating rates at american factories mines and 
utilities rise many companies are restarting older lessefficient 
equipment or delaying retirement of the equipment in addition the 
recent revival in american exports has been paced by many products 
that take lots of energy to produce such as construction equipment 
adding to the turnaround in energy use are homeowners who have 
been wary of making longterm energyefficiency investments 
several studies have shown that homeowners offered lowcost 
deals and interestfree loans by utilities turn up their noses if 
the payoff will take more than six months 
the same is true of many businesses said mark ross university 
of michigan physicist studying energy problems ross said that he 
finds on his visits to factories that people are not struggling 
with how the process might be improved they are worried about 
labor relations product quality all the regulations that they 
must comply with management and engineering staffs are stretched 
to the limit 
energy is very cheap here said art rosenfeld director of 
the center for building science at the lawrence berkeley national 
laboratory at berkeley calif who has worked with ross 
when you and i were growing up they flared natural gas and 
we built a lot of uninsulated houses because it was cheaper to burn 
more gas than to add insulation 
attitudes change slowly so we havent paid attention to 
investments that take five six or seven years to pay back like 
the germans and the japanese do rosenfeld said 
today the average us new car must get 26 miles per gallon and 
all cars average 189 mpg 42 per cent better than in 1973 
however the average car in italy where gas is four times the us 
price gets 30 mpg in japan the average is 31 mpg 
in the overall economy counting cars buildings factories and 
everything else the united states still uses more energy per 
dollar than any other country but canada according to the energy 
information administration mesurements 
the united states was 24 percent below canada but 97 percent 
above west germany and 110 percent above japan

sen lloyd bentsen declared today that democrats 
had put it all together with jesse jacksons promise to 
campaign for the ticket 
bentsen michael dukakis choice for running mate joined the 
massachusetts governor and jackson at a news conference where the 
three men spoke of new unity reached in meetings behind closed 
doors 
there has been a reaching out on both sides said the texas 
senator 
bentsen said the democrats face a tough fight in november 
but with this kind of unity and the motivational work of jesse 
jackson and the leadership of michael dukakis im convinced 
were going to win a great victory in november he said 
bentsen was visiting state delegations today to woo delegates 
who do not yet support his addition to the ticket 
at a new jersey delegation meeting he was greeted with applause 
as well as some jackson placards afterward he received a warm 
welcome from the ohio delegation even though many ohioans wanted 
their senator john glenn as the vice presidential candidate 
i just left a meeting with gov dukakis and jesse jackson and 
we have put it all together bentsen told the cheering crowd 
ohio gov richard celeste said bentsen was needed to put a 
little more shoulder to the wheel in texas while the democrats 
would still win ohio 
glenn celebrating his 67th birthday today said its going 
to be a great day when this tallinthesaddle texan right here 
becomes the vice president of the united states 
the texas senator and the massachusetts governor swept into town 
sunday for their partys national convention and declared their 
partnership one of mutual admiration 
making their first joint appearance in the convention city at a 
party hosted by cable news network the two men traded accolades 
dukakis called bentsen a man whom i have admired and respected 
for some time 
bentsen who has been candid about differences he has with some 
of dukakis views beamed and applauded for his part bentsen said 
dukakis speaks a language we understand in the south jobs and 
education 
bentsen said he did not believe any talk about the electoral 
vote lock the republicans have on the south were going to win 
georgia and texas and state after state across this country 
bentsen was greeted at the event by former president jimmy 
carter and georgias two democratic senators wyche fowler and sam 
nunn 
nunn predicted unity among the democrats that would pay off in 
november with a victory 
but a more immediate task for dukakis and bentsen is to resolve 
differences among the delegates some liberals see bentsen as too 
conservative while some of jacksons supporters are angry that the 
veteran civil rights activist was not picked for the no 2 spot 
in the new jersey delegation for example assemblyman alan 
karcher said he was not happy with bentsen he added we want 
to know about his positions 
bentsen on sunday suggested his position on the ticket had 
already helped dukakis apparently referring to a houston 
chronicledallas morning news poll showing the democratic ticket 
had pulled even with the republicans in texas 
another poll in the chicago tribune indicated that the 
dukakisbentsen ticket led bush in california new york and 
illinois accounting for 107 of the 270 electoral votes needed to 
win the white house the survey showed the democrats running even 
or slightly ahead in bentsens home state and behind in florida

president reagans spokesman said 
today the united states welcomes irans willingness to accept a 
united nations ceasefire resolution aimed at ending the 8yearold 
iraniraq war 
but at the same time spokesman marlin fitzwater said i think 
we have to be cautious because us officials are unsure of the 
precise conditions of irans agreement to un resolution 598 
we dont know what their intentions are he said 
fitzwater also refused to say to what extent irans move would 
lead to a lowering of the american military profile in the persian 
gulf although he did say the united states has been prepared to 
terminate tanker escort operations if peace came to the region 
the united states welcomes irans formal acceptance of un 
resolution 598 as well as iraq president saddam husseins 
fitzwater told reporters at a briefing in santa barbara calif 
where reagan is vacationing this week 
this major breakthrough is an important first step fitzwater 
said it opens the way for an end to the 8yearold tragic war 
as vice president george bush told the united nations last 
thursday we have long sought a just negotiated settlement 
fitzwater pledged that the us government will continue to do 
all it can to help build a durable peace with iran and iraq 
but the spokesman said that it is very difficult to determine 
all of the motives that might be behind this move by irans 
revolutionary government 
one has to believe however that the recent losses that iran 
has suffered at the hands of iraq played a major role he said 
fitzwater said the downing of an iranian passenger jet by a us 
navy cruiser may have been a factor us officials say the jet 
was misidentified and was shot down accidentally 
we will just have to wait and see how they the iranians 
intend to pursue with implemenation of the ceasefire resolution 
which calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities withdrawal 
by the belligerents to prewar boundaries and the repatriation of 
prisoners of war 
as a first step iran and iraq must observe an immediate 
ceasefire fitzwater said he said the united states is willing 
to be a party to any system that ensures a successful 
peacebuilding effort the un has the lead here 
fitzwater noted that the united states has had a military 
presence in the gulf region for some 40 years and said there would 
be no end to that presence 
but he said we have always said that as hostilities end we 
will be willing to consider withdrawal of the shipescort 
operation

despite his peacemaking session with michael 
dukakis jesse jackson said today he expects debate and 
deliberation by the full democratic national convention over 
platform planks that remain in dispute 
with the massachusetts governor and his only challenger in 
accord their lieutenants were expected to reach compromises on 
many of the jackson campaigns 13 minority positions 
but jackson appeared ready to fight on the convention floor 
tuesday night for his cornerstone issues an endorsement of higher 
taxes on the wealthy and corporations a fiveyear pentagon freeze 
and fullfunding of head start prenatal and nutrition programs 
for mothers and infants 
dukakis said before the meeting that he was confident the 
democrats would produce a good solid platform despite 
continued disagreement between his forces and the jackson campaign 
on certain planks 
jackson made a similar point in their joint appearance after 
their private talks 
the platform negotiations will resume today no doubt there 
will be debate and deliberation on tomorrow night but debate and 
deliberation stirs the soul of our democracy jackson said 
through debate over the soul of our party we debate policy and 
priorities and direction 
there will be some reasonable disagreement i suspect on 
certain platform planks but the platform process itself has been 
remarkably peaceful and harmonious dukakis said on abctvs 
good morning america 
he predicted that the democrats will come out of this 
convention in very strong shape with a good solid platform 
on the eve of the convention jackson said sunday that it is up 
to the delegates to decide whether his minority positions on taxes 
and defense are actually majority positions 
the democratic party faced the possibility of a lengthy debate 
tuesday on some of the 13 minority reports filed by the jackson 
campaign however most were expected to be dropped if jackson and 
dukakis settle their larger differences 
until then party spokesman mike mccurry said the platform is 
in the twilight zone 
party chairman paul g kirk jr told reporters today that he 
likes the streamlined platform as presently written its a good 
strong platform that could help the democrats win kirk said 
the majority report is under 4500 words and even with all of 
jacksons amendments it would still be the partys shortest 
platform in five decades 
the platform committee chairman michigan gov james j 
blanchard was hosting a luncheon today for the 186member panel to 
celebrate its compliance with kirks instructions to produce a 
short document 
rosemary freeman executive director of the platform committee 
said it would take at least 30 minutes to debate and conduct a roll 
call on each disputed minority plank party rules allow 10 minutes 
for each side to speak before the roll is called 
the dukakis campaign has said repeatedly it will not accept 
jacksons call for higher taxes a pentagon freeze a policy of 
nofirstuse of nuclear weapons and support of selfdetermination 
for the palestinians 
some jackson minority planks cover less thorny domestic issues 
that lend themselves more readily to compromise these included 
jacksons call for full funding of head start prenatal care and 
the women infants and children program doubling the education 
budget and creation of a national health program 
delegates from the national education association which boasts 
one of the largest labor contingents at the convention voted at a 
caucus sunday to support the jackson education plank more than 
half the 291 teacher delegates are dukakis supporters

iran said today that it will accept a 
un resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in its nearly 
8yearold war with iraq which has claimed an estimated 1 million 
lives 
however iran also said it will not withdraw its troops from its 
borders and called on iranians to prepare to thwart further iraqi 
attacks 
the announcement came one day after president saddam hussein of 
iraq cited his countrys recent string of battlefield victories and 
urged iran to accept an honorable peace iraq which has 
already accepted the yearold un resolution said today it 
remained skeptical about irans intentions 
president reagans spokesman welcomed the move but said the 
united states must remain cautious 
in a message to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
iran said it accepts ceasefire resolution 598 in the interests 
of security on the basis of justice the official islamic 
republic news agency said 
in new york perez de cuellar said he had received a letter from 
president ali khamenei of iran saying tehran accepted the 
ceasefire resolution the secretarygeneral said iran accepted the 
resolution unconditionally 
they say that they have decided to officially declare that the 
republic of iran accepts security council resolution 598 perez 
de cuellar said it is very clear that it is an acceptance which 
doesnt refer to any conditions 
iran did not say when the ceasefire would go into effect 
however the secretarygeneral said he would begin consultations 
with iran and iraq as early as today to arrange a ceasefire 
the iranian news agency quoted a statement by the general 
command of the iranian armed forces formed recently by ali akbar 
hashemi rafsanjani after the speaker of the parliament was made 
acting commander of irans armed forces 
irans acceptance of the resolution appeared to reflect a 
further strengthening of the position of rafsanjani who is 
regarded as a pragmatist 
in a speech last month rafsanjani referred to the possibility 
of nonmilitary solutions to the war in an extraordinary 
comment he also suggested recently that the time had come for iran 
to emerge from the international isolation caused largely by the 
iraniraq war 
nevertheless rafsanjani said in an interview on iran television 
today the decision to accept the resolution was made by ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini irans undisputed leader the 88yearold 
khomeini announced the decision to top iranian leaders during a 
meeting on sunday rafsanjani said 
iraq responded skeptically to the announcement saying iran had 
accepted the un resolution out of tactical reasons and not a 
desire for peace 
our previous knowledge of the devious iranian regime makes us 
be cautious and wary until peace is achieved and until we reach an 
agreement between iran and iraq for peace iraqi information 
minister nassif ltayyif jassem said in baghdad jassem who was 
quoted by the iraqi news agency said his government still had not 
been informed officially of the iranian move 
in santa barbara calif president reagans spokesman said 
today the united states welcomes irans willingness to accept the 
ceasefire resolution 
but spokesman marlin fitzwater added i think we have to be 
cautious because us officials are unsure of the precise 
conditions of irans agreement to un resolution 598 we dont 
know what their intentions are he said 
fitzwater refused to say whether irans move would lead to a 
lowering of the us military profile in the persian gulf but he 
said washington has been prepared to terminate tanker escort 
operations if peace came to the region 
the united states maintains a fleet of 27 ships in and around 
the persian gulf to protect neutral shipping from warrelated 
attacks 
in a report monitored in nicosia the iranian news agency said 
today new conditions have been created which call for adoption of 
new stances in order to continue the sacred defense and protect 
islam irna said 
we once again urge the iranian people to man the war fronts to 
confront the enemies aggressive nature and foil their criminal 
acts the general command of the armed forces said all muslim 
combatants deployed on the war fronts are prepared to respond to 
any aggression and movement of the enemy 
irna said the ceasefire acceptance was part of a strategy of 
defending the islamic revolution that toppled the government of 
shah mohammad reza pahlavi in 1979 it said the iranian position 
should not be interpreted as caving in to pressure from the united 
states and iraq 
in the past three months iraq has recaptured nearly all the 
territory it lost to iran over the past six years there has been 
no official casualty toll in the war but foreign analysts put it 
at more than 1 million 
one of the conditions for the un ceasefire was that both 
countries return to their borders at the time the war started in 
1980 the resolution also calls for an exchange of prisoners and 
determination of who was responsible for starting the war 
iran had demanded that iraq be labeled the aggressor before it 
accepted the resolution iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after 
border skirmishes 
in addition to its battlefield defeats the tehran government 
has found it increasingly difficult to recruit soldiers and keep 
its economy afloat 
in april the iraqis began recapturing territory lost to iran 
and claim they have since seized about 133 strategic heights in the 
northern region of the 730mile long front 
they also launched assaults in the south that recaptured the 
southern faw peninsula in april and the shalamcheh and majnoon 
islands in may and june 
the war prompted a heightened us military presence in the 
persian gulf 
last year the us navy began escorting 11 kuwaiti tankers that 
had been reflagged with the stars and stripes the navy later 
expanded its protection to neutral commercial vessels that 
requested help after coming under attack 
on july 3 the cruiser uss vincennes mistook an iranian jetliner 
for a warplane and shot it down killing all 290 people aboard 
in may 1987 iraqi aircraft fired missiles at uss stark killing 
37 american serviceman iraq said the attack was a mistake and 
apologized 
iran sought a security council emergency hearing on the airliner 
attack and during debate last week but the council has so far 
refused to condemn the united states for the attack 
during the debate nation after nation on the 15member council 
urged iran to accept the ceasefire resolution those nations 
included the soviet union britain france china japan and west 
germany 
debate on the airliner tragedy was to resume today the security 
council is expected to issue a resolution or statement on the 
attack 
irans presence at the security council meeting was its first 
appearance at the council which it has boycotted since the 
beginning of the iraniraq 
hussein in his speech sunday proposed that iran and iraq sign 
a peace accord exchange prisoners return to their respective 
borders and vow not to interfere in each others internal affairs 
in addition to recent territorial losses the iranian population 
suffered a severe psychological blow in the socalled war of the 
cities between feb 29 and april 21 
as many as half of tehrans 6 million population fled to the 
countryside to escape the missiles that blasted a path of 
destruction across the city 
the iranians were clearly outgunned the iraqis fired nearly 200 
longrange missiles believed to be upgraded soviet scud weapons 
the iranians were only able to fire onethird that number in 
retaliation

michael dukakis emerging from unity talks with 
jesse jackson on the opening day of the democratic national 
convention guaranteed his unbowed rival a major role in the 
presidential campaign jackson said he would not mount a challenge 
for the no 2 spot on the ticket 
dukakis said they struck no deals but predicted they would 
forge the strongest grassroots organization ever formed in a 
campaign for the white house 
in turn jackson said we intend to win in november though 
he did not offer an outright endorsement of dukakis im still 
looking for a chicago miracle on wednesday night when the 
presidential nominating roll is called jackson said 
if the miracle does not come to pass then well have pass 
over to the next phase of our campaign jackson said with a 
smile 
dukakis the inevitable nominee of the party cracked i dont 
think were going to have a chicago miracle but were going to 
have an athenian miracle a reference to his greek heritage 
at a later meeting with more than 2000 supporters and 
delegates jackson sounded a conciliatory note that the dukakis 
campaign no doubt hopes will hold through the convention 
the two leaders held about two hours of talks in an atlanta 
hotel just hours before 4000plus delegates gather for the opening 
session of a convention that will crown dukakis as the presidential 
nominee thursday night 
tonights highlight is the keynote address by texas state 
treasurer ann richards a fiery populist who allowed that she was 
terribly nervous about her primetime speech 
if the democrats can keep to their tightly scripted and 
frequently altered schedule the convention will be called to 
order at precisely 601 pm edt and run until 11 pm edt the 
three networks abc cbs and nbc will cover the final two hours of 
the gathering 
republicans meanwhile gloated about the attention jackson is 
stealing from the nomineeinwaiting former white house political 
strategist ed rollins at a gop truth squad news conference 
quoted dukakis as saying there can only be one quarterback for the 
campaign 
far more important is who is going to be the coach rollins 
said is jesse jackson going to call the shots 
tensions have been running high between the campaigns ever since 
dukakis passed over jackson last week and picked texas sen lloyd 
bentsen as his running mate 
trying to smooth differences and placate jacksons supporters 
dukakis declared i want jesse jackson to play a major role in 
this campaign i want his supporters to be deeply involved 
however dukakis acknowledged he had not forged an agreement 
with jackson 
theres no deal theres no fine print said dukakis 
thats not the way you win elections 
jackson who had been pressuring dukakis for what he called 
shared responsibility in democratic affairs said were on a 
track that would lead to expanded involvement 
he played down his demands which sources say call for a major 
role for jackson in shaping the administration if dukakis wins i 
made it very clear today i seek no job no salary not title 
jackson said i seek to serve to keep america strong and to make 
america beautiful 
bentsen joined dukakis and jackson at a standing room only news 
confernce theres been a reaching out on both sides and bringing 
those forces together this truly is the politics of inclusion 
said bentsen whose moderatetoconservative views have drawn 
criticism from jackson and his supporters 
despite his unhappiness about dukakis selection of bentsen 
jackson said we have no plans to submit my name in nomination 
for the no 2 spot on the ticket moreover he said there will 
be no encouragement of anyone to do it 
platform negotiations which had been suspended by jackson were 
back on track jackson said 
he said after the wednesday night nomination vote which dukakis 
has more than enough delegates to win the campaign moves in a 
fundamental new direction and the roles will change 
he is going to be involved actively and fully in a way that 
will bring us together and will build the strongest grass roots 
organization we hope that has ever been organized in a presidential 
campaign dukakis said 
while it was clear that not all differences had been resolved 
dukakis said well be campaigning together well be campaigning 
separately but hell be a very very important part of this team 
dukakis said they would make an effort to bring into our 
campaign key people from jacksons camp 
the meeting was the first facetoface discussion between 
dukakis and jackson since a july 4 dinner at the massachusetts 
governors home in brookline though they have talked by telephone 
they had not met since dukakis picked bentsen as his running mate 
we made the judgment not to let our ships pass in the night 
not let our ships crash jackson said 
as the delegates made their way to this sweltering convention 
city the dukakisjackson rift was topic a 
sources said jackson wanted an agreement outlining an official 
role in the fall campaign including financial support from 
dukakis it was not clear whether jackson had explicitly asked 
dukakis to provide him with a charter jet to travel in 
dukakis aides said they would welcome campaign efforts by 
jackson but that any funds would have to come from the democratic 
party 
accompanied by bentsen dukakis arrived here sunday he defended 
his choice of a running mate and at the same time took a dig at the 
reagan administration for the irancontra affair 
dukakis said he picked bentsen because if there is somebody at 
the national security council who comes to me with a cockamamie 
idea that we ought to trade arms to the ayatollah for hostages 
hes bentsen going to come into my office and pound the desk and 
say mr president thats crazy 
bentsen in turn said the massachusetts governor speaks a 
language we understand in the south jobs and education 
with assistance from a hollywood production company the stage 
was finally set at the omni for a convention celebration that will 
conclude thursday night with dukakis claiming the presidential 
nomination he set out 17 months ago to win 
the main podium is fixed on a threetier platform that towers 85 
feet high at its highest point and is 120 feet wide and 100 feet 
deep thousands of seats had to be ripped out to make way for the 
huge structure eating up already scarce space

iran unconditionally accepted a un 
resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in its war with 
iraq secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said today 
the acceptance came just hours before the security council was 
to resume debate on the us navys downing of an iran jetliner in 
the persian gulf 
the secretarygeneral said he would begin consultations with 
iran and iraq today to arrange a ceasefire and hopes it could take 
effect in a week 
i intend in the afternoon to start my consultations to begin 
to set up a dday for the implemention for the resolution of 
course it has to begin with a ceasefire said perez de cuellar 
he showed reporters at the un secretariat building the letter 
of acceptance signed by irans president ali khamenei 
they say that have decided to officially declare that the 
republic of iran accepts security council resolution 598 said 
perez de cuellar 
when asked if iran still insisted on punishment or denunciation 
of iraq as a first step toward a ceasefire the secretarygeneral 
said 
there is no such reference in the letter it is a very 
factual letter there is no claim no conditions it is very 
clear that it is an acceptance which doesnt refer to any 
conditions 
it is what they the iranians call official acceptance 
they considered that before they have always tacitly accepted the 
resolution now they say we have officially accepted it said 
perez de cuellar 
word of irans acceptance of the un resolution first came 
today from that nations islamic republic new agency which quoted 
a military statement it also said iran would not withdraw troops 
from its borders 
iraq already has agreed to the security council resolution 
which passed on july 20 1987 but iran had not previously accepted 
or rejected the resolution claiming that iraq must first be 
identified as the aggressor in the war 
an iraqi diplomat un counsellor mudhafar a alamin said 
today that his government would have to study irans letter before 
reacting to it there has been no official reaction from bagdhad 
security council members and guest speakers have been pressing 
iran to accept resolution 598 during debate on the iran jetliner 
disaster which began thursday when vice president george bush and 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati presented their 
countries cases 
on friday britain china france and the soviet union who 
along with america make up the five permanent members of the 
security council called on iran to abide by the ceasefire 
resolution to end the nearly 8yearold war 
iran had effectively boycotted the council for eight years 
contending that it favors iraq 
in the council debate iran had initially called for 
condemnation of america for shooting down the iranian jetliner on 
july 3 killing all 290 peopl aboard most of whom were iranian 
late last week however it became apparent that iran could not 
muster enough votes on the council to condemn the united states 
and iranian diplomats fell back to demanding that america accept 
full responsibility for the tragedy and that the us navy leave 
the gulf region 
irans acceptance of the ceasefire resolution will strengthen 
its argument in the council that all foreign navies should leave 
the region since a ceasefire would make their presence to protect 
shipping unnecessary

delegates not yet supporting his addition to the ticket 
at a new jersey delegation meeting prior to the joint press 
conference he was greeted with applause but also some jackson 
signs afterward he went to the ohio delegation and received a 
warm welcome even though many ohioans wanted their senator john 
glenn as the vice presidential candidate 
i just left a meeting with governor dukakis and jesse jackson 
and we have put it all together he said to extended cheers 
ohio gov richard celeste said bentsen was needed to put a 
little more shoulder to the wheel in texas and that the democrats 
would win ohio anyway

its going to be a great day when this tallinthesaddle texan 
right here becomes the vice president of the united states 
the texas senator and the massachusetts governor swept into town 
sunday for their partys national convention and declared their 
partnership one of mutual admiration 
making their first joint appearance in the convention city at a 
party hosted by cable news network the two men traded accolades 
dukakis called bentsen a man whom i have admired and respected 
for some time 
bentsen who has been candid about differences he has with some 
of dukakis views beamed and applauded for his part bentsen said

republicans have on the south i dont believe that one for a

he said the party was appealing to the mainstream democrats 
who have long been the anchor of our party and also mainstream 
americans 
nunn predicted unity among the democrats that would pay off in 
november with a victory but a more immediate task for dukakis and 
bentsen this week is to resolve problems ranging from dismay among 
liberals at a man they see as too conservative to anger among 
jacksons supporters that the veteran civil rights activist was not 
picked for the no 2 spot 
in the new jersey delegation for example assemblyman alan 
karcher said he was not happy with bentsen 
we want to know about his positions he said 
bentsen on sunday suggested his position on the ticket was 
already helping dukakis apparently referring to a houston 
chronicledallas morning news poll showing the democratic ticket 
had pulled even with the republicans in texas 
another poll in the chicago tribune indicated that the 
dukakisbentsen ticket led bush in california new york and 
illinois accounting for 107 of the 270 electoral votes needed to 
win the white house the survey showed the democrats running even 
or slightly ahead in bentsens home state and behind in florida

us industry in june operated at its highest 
point in eight years edging closer to a level that economists 
believe signals a pickup in inflation the government said monday 
the federal reserve board said american factories mines and 
utilities operated at 831 percent of capacity last month up 02 
percentage points from may 
it was the third consecutive monthly increase the seventh rise 
in nine months and the highest level since march 1980 when the 
operating rate was 837 percent 
were in the danger zone said david jones an economist 
with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer we 
are pushing back up to the levels we saw back at the beginning of 
the decade when we saw more inflation 
jones predicted that by the fall operating rates would move 
past 85 percent the level economists believe indicates the 
presence of inflationary production bottlenecks the concern is 
that as companies have difficulty meeting demand and their products 
become more scarce prices will rise 
capacity constraints are usual in an economy in its 67th month 
of expansion but jones said the drought in the farm belt a 
tightening labor market and the recent increase in the value of the 
dollar are combining to worsen the inflation pressures that would 
normally be present 
last month the drought sent grain and poultry prices soaring by 
more than 20 percent unemployment dropped to a 14year low of 53 
percent and the dollar rose to its highest level since last fall 
a development that could eventually increase import prices 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in testimony to 
congress last week warned that the fed will push interest rates 
higher if necessary to combat inflation he said unemployment and 
factory operating rates will have to level off to avoid 
accelerating price increases 
the june operating rate of 831 percent was 28 percentage 
points higher than a year ago however the breakdown by industry 
in the federal reserve report may ease inflation fears somewhat 
some of the areas that have been the tightest dont seem to be 
getting any worse said cynthia latta an economist with data 
resources inc a lexington mass forecasting firm 
the operating rate at plants making petroleum products dropped 
from 855 percent in may to 845 percent in june textiles from 
918 percent in april to 907 percent in may the latest month 
available and rubber and plastics from 881 percent in april to 
873 percent in may 
another hopeful sign latta said are plans by us businesses 
to increase building and equipment purchases by 119 percent this 
year if realized that would be the biggest gain in four years and 
should lead she said to an easing of operating rates by late this 
year or early next year 
also any time industries add capacity it tends to be state 
of the art and it tends to be more efficient that should alleviate 
prices pressures somewhat foreign competition is still very stiff 
so companies will do their best to avoid cost increases and 
increase productivity she said 
the operating rate at manufacturing plants which has been 
pushed up by a boom in exports held steady at 832 percent in june 
a 01 percentage point increase to 817 percent at plants making 
durable goods big ticket items expected to last three or more 
years was offset by a 02 percentage point decline to 852 
percent at plants making nondurable goods 
the operating rate in the mining industry which includes oil 
drilling rose from 814 percent to 821 percent in june 
at utilities the june rate jumped 20 percentage points to 818 
percent electric utilities which increased output to keep air 
conditioners going during the heat wave had an operating rate of 
854 percent up 26 percentage points over may 
in the steel industry and other primary metals manufacturing 
the rate was down 02 percentage points to 872 percent in june 
manufacturers of motor vehicles and parts reported a june drop 
of 03 percentage points to 834 percent the decline followed 
three steep increases from the 768 percent rate in february 
the rate at paper plants increased by 01 percentage point to 
950 percent in may but that was below the 970 percent peak last 
december the rate at chemical plants rose 02 percentage points to 
862 percent in may

during the idle hours at the democratic national 
convention and there are many delegates turn into partygoers 
souvenirseekers shoppers diners and with the rest of atlanta 
sufferers in the heat 
the only thing that delegates to the democratic national 
convention dont do much of is sleep 
the official convention schedule fills five hours a day but 
there is no shortage of things for the delegates to do with the 
remaining 19 
in the big hotels downtown conventiongoers have a chance to 
get their picture taken with michael dukakis and jesse jackson the 
stars of the week for 5 you can put your arm around them lean on 
their shoulders and take home a moment in history 
the only problem is these are lifesized cardboard cutouts not 
the real people there are so many of them around atlanta they are 
like santa clauses at christmas time 
pose with the next president said a sign cast your vote 
now 
oops one woman was heard complaining why dont they have 
lloyd bentsen 
the macys store in the heart of the delegate hotels proclaims 
itself the life of the party 88 
sylvia farmer from boston thought so for the price of a picture 
frame she sat while a caricaturist drew her face next to a 
democratic donkey mrs farmer is not a delegate and nobody in her 
family is 
what they are is democrats and this is the place for democrats 
to be this week 
im for dukakis and half of my family is for dukakis and half 
for jackson she said 
an aisle away chef henry haller who worked in the white house 
and still wears the presidential seal on his white smock was 
giving a cooking demonstration involving oranges and a liqueur a 
sales woman was passing out printed recipes of what haller was 
cooking including nancy reagans cointreau orange flambe even 
in atlanta this week some matters are vital enough to transcend 
party lines 
besides haller was the reagans cook for their first six years 
in the white house he ended his service there last september after 
cooking for presidents for 21 years 
delegates with time on their hands there werent many stop 
at the protest zone a parking lot a block from the omni where 
issues were aired by speakers hour after hour under the broiling 
sun and then deep into the night 
at one point there were more than 50 riothelmeted policemen 
protecting the citizenry from one speaker and four listeners 
the police themselves became a point of curiosity two cops one 
male and one female were photographed by a television crew why 
did he want to take my picture the policeman asked his partner

house speaker jim wright chairman of the 
democrats 40th national convention said monday the partys 
allbutcertain nominee michael dukakis must be not appear 
ungracious in giving jesse jackson a prominent role in the fall 
campaign 
i think its up to dukakis to do what he does graciously not 
begrudgingly wright said 
with the two rivals meeting face to face to define jacksons 
role i think the healing already has begun wright said i 
think theyre closing ranks 
wright said he had spoken with both men since dukakis 
disappointed many jackson backers by passing over jackson for the 
no 2 spot on the ticket 
jesse jackson simply wants to feel involved respected the 
role is becoming defined now last week he was concerned that it 
was amorphous wright said in an interview with a small group of 
reporters 
he said the agreement would encompass such issues as jacksons 
campaign duties and arrangements for his travel and staff all 
that is a part of it wright said 
but he said there should be no sharp public lines drawn by 
either side about what that role should be to set up arbitrary 
standards for each to prove hes a man is juvenile in the 
extreme utterly childish said wright 
he said advisers in both camps had apparently been setting up 
that kind of confrontation 
some of mikes friends say are you gonna let him get away 
with that mikes smarter than that if you had two stupid men 
youd have an irreconcilable situation but they are both smarter 
men more mature than that 
wright said he believes jacksons longrange future in the party 
will be one of prominence but he declined to be specific 
the convention is not jesse jacksons finish line its his 
starting line he said 
wright said he expected all but three or four planks of the 
partys platform to be settled through compromises and said the 
handful that remain the subject of floor fights will not be on 
matters that damage the partys run for the white house 
wright predicted the weeklong convention meeting would end as 
a lovein but acknowledged it just takes us a little while 
to get there 
he said his role as chairman of the convention would be largely 
in the background 
i dont have any illusions that the chairman runs the 
convention he said he lets it run itself and just helps see 
that it doesnt run off the track he said he planned to share 
duties of presiding over the sessions with his four cochairmen 
former new mexico gov toney anaya rep norm mineta of california 
mayor lottie shackelford of little rock ark and gov madeleine 
kunin of vermont 
wright said his own muchpublicized ethics case pending before a 
house investigating committee would not be an issue at the 
convention asserting that the public sees through the charges 
and believes they are politically motivated 
he said as he has traveled around the country speaking since the 
charges were leveled by rep newt gingrich rga audiences have 
been supportive ive had people come up to me and say im a 
republican but i deeply resent the manner in which these people 
are trying to blacken your reputation wright said

here are excerpts from a statement 
released monday by irans general command and transmitted in 
english by the islamic republic news agency on irans acceptance of 
un resolution 598 calling for an immediate ceasefire with iraq 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the day the oppressive regime of iraq violated irans territory 
the nation fully realized that the savage aggression was the result 
of an international plot to damage the islamic revolution 
today new conditions have been created which call for adoption 
of new stances in order to continue the sacred defense and protect 
islam and the islamic revoluton 
although the enemies of islam have not for a moment stopped 
their plots against the islamic revoluton recently as the blows of 
muslim combatants of iran on the battered body of iraq became more 
deadly the scope of plots became wider 
the world arrogance united states as well as the reactionaries 
came to help iraq with all their power 
in order to damage the revolution they did not spare any 
criminal act and tried to uphold the baghdad regime through their 
massive military financial political and propaganda assistance 
and armed the iraqi army with massive weapons and aids for fresh 
aggressions and continued crimes 
today the whole reactionary and arrogant worlds are trying to 
portray our enemy which has committed unprecedented crimes in the 
history of the world as a peaceloving regime and on the contrary 
misportray our innocent and resistant nation which has always 
sought and still is seeking to thwart the aggression as 
warmongering muslims before world public opinion 
in addition they arrogant and reactionary worlds put utmost 
pressure on iran and threaten the iranian nation 
under such circumstances it is natural for us to try to expose 
the aggressor and prevent the enemies of islam and those who are 
against the independence of nations from taking initiative in 
international scenes 
the announcement of the islamic republics new stand to un 
chief javier perez de cuellar is aimed at implementing this new 
policy 
it is beyond question that defending islam and acting bravely is 
not an act peculiar only to the battlefields but that adoption of 
new methods which can tip the balance to the advantage of islam and 
foil enemy plots speaks for courage in its own right 
at this crucial juncture the armed forces general command 
headquarters deems it necessary to stress the following points 
1 in continuation of the previous statements released by the 
armed forces general command headquarters we once again urge the 
iranian people to man the war fronts to confront enemies 
aggressive nature and foil their criminal acts our brave military 
commanders are still doing all within their power to continue 
safeguarding the islamic revolution 
2 what has happened is expedient by divine assignment 
3 the great leadership of imam khomeini who has successfully 
led the islamic revolution even in the most crucial juncture is 
still the most reliable shelter for the freedom loving people of 
iran whose hearts have been enlightened by such a leadership

vips feeling miffed at being barred from the 
center of the action during the democratic national convention 
shouldnt feel too bad even the organizers mother cant get a 
floor pass 
jane kahn mother of atlanta 88 committee president bobby kahn 
said she and her husband probably would wind up like so many 
others watching the convention in the special vip room at the 
nearby georgia world congress center 
bobby kahn 30 was executive director of the georgia democratic 
party when efforts began to bring the 1988 convention to atlanta 
he headed the successful drive then moved to the atlanta 88 
corporation that was set up to manage preparations 
he told us we cant get on the floor during the convention 
mrs kahn of savannah said a little wistfully there are too 
many requests and hell bend over backwards not to show favoritism 
i may get to be an elector if michael dukakis wins in georgia 
but when bobby brought me the papers to sign for that he told me 
it still wouldnt get us on the convention floor

gov mario cuomo told fellow new york democrats 
on monday that michael dukakis was as close to a sure thing to 
be elected president as weve seen for democrats in the last 20 or 
40 years 
cuomos comment in a speech to the new york delegation to this 
weeks national party convention came soon after dukakis and rival 
jesse jackson met and then declared party unity 
thats wonderful said cuomo at a subsequent news conference 
when asked about the dukakisjackson peace pact it means that 
what we all predicted with 100 percent confidence and with just a 
little trepidation has apparently occurred theyre going to work 
together for the common good 
cuomo who was propelled to national prominence by his keynote 
address four years ago has no formal role at this years 
convention he and his wife matilda met briefly with this years 
keynoter texas state treasurer ann richards at the omni 
convention hall and presented her with a steuben glass apple 
at his news conference cuomo said he was certain there were no 
secret deals made between dukakis and jackson and said such a move 
would be dumb 
from what i know of mike dukakis he would not make a deal 
hed be afraid to reveal said cuomo adding that hed been in 
regular contact with both men over the past few days 
as cuomo made his remarks at the downtown hotel where the new 
york delegation is staying supporters of tawana brawley staged the 
first of what they said would be twicedaily demonstrations the 
black teenager says she was abducted and sexually abused last year 
in new yorks dutchess county by six white men one of whom flashed 
a badge like a police officers 
miss brawleys mother glenda brawley marched with her sister 
juanita the rev al sharpton and about 60 other people while 
attorney c vernon mason chanted through a bullhorn 
new yorks like mississippi used to be mason said new 
yorks like alabama used to be down souths up north now 
he also chanted mario cuomo is a racist 
sharpton has complained about cuomos handling of the brawley 
investigation claiming that authorities are mounting a coverup on 
the advice of sharpton and others brawley has refused to cooperate 
with cuomos special prosecutor in the case state attorney general 
robert abrams 
cuomo said miss brawleys mother will eventually be arrested for 
refusing to appear before a grand jury reviewing evidence into the 
allegations but he said theyll do it when its safe and right 
were not going to make a bad situation worse 
miss brawley is also in atlanta but she did not appear at the

an american mountain climber died 
earlier this month in a blizzard in the himalaya mountains between 
pakistan and india his climbing partner reported monday 
im dying i just want to get warm were the last words of 
gary silver 40 of spokane wash according to his friend gary 
speer who was with him on an expedition that took them to 
gasherbrum 2 a 26400foot peak in the karakorum range in the 
western himalayas 
speer 36 returned to islamabad on sunday 
speer and silver left the pakistani capital city along with two 
other american climbers who abandoned the expedition at the outset 
when one of them couldnt breathe at the high altitude 
on july 1 speer and silver who had had climbing experience in 
north and south america headed up from a base camp at 17000 feet 
at 19000 feet silver also became sick and decided to return to 
the base camp while speer continued alone 
when he came to within 100 feet of the peak high winds forced 
him to descend to 23000 feet there he found silver who had 
teamed up with a canadian doctor roland willenbrock to try to 
reach the top of the mountain 
the two ignored speers warning that a snowstorm was brewing and 
continued toward the summit the exhausted speer headed back 
for three days a blizzard trapped silver and willenbrock at a 
camp at 24000 feet 
on july 8 the two began their descent but at 23000 feet 
silver could not continue and willenbrock contacted speer by radio 
according to willenbrock silver told the doctor im going to 
die 
he later became unconscious and died from cerebral edema a 
swelling of the brain from lack of oxygen 
willenbrock began walking toward the lower camp in the blizzard 
and mostly in the dark to reach speer at the lower camp 
on july 9 at 3 am speer mounted a rescue party of two swiss 
and two american climbers to find silvers body 
the doctor who had planned to specialize in heart surgery 
suffered frostbite and will lose some of the fingers on his right

mayor edward i koch said monday that the rev 
jesse jackson was stealing the spotlight at the democratic 
convention from michael dukakis and urged that the party unite to 
win the white house 
we ought to get together no demands let the guy run for 
president koch said in an interview with reporters at city hall 
jackson has been demanding full partnership with dukakis in 
the upcoming campaign 
koch said i happen to think the largest number of people 
respond to the quarterback the quarterback in this case is 
dukakis he represents reflects the mainstream democratic 
politics 
the mayor said i think it is a huge error on the part of 
whose who are seeking to diminish the dukakis role by making 
demands upon him which he cant respond to 
koch is not going to the convention he said that if dukakis had 
asked him to be a delegate he would have instead he is going to 
ireland on a pilgrimage for peace in northern ireland with cardinal 
john oconnor 
during the new york primary this spring koch backed tennessee 
sen al gore over dukakis and attacked jackson saying that jews 
who support israel would be crazy to vote for him because of 
his propalestinian positions

a navy helicopter on a minedetection 
exercise exploded over the sea monday and officials feared all 
eight crew members were killed a coast guard official said 
a search was under way in the area 11 miles west of the golden 
gate bridge but a coast guard spokesman said rescuers did not 
expect to find survivors 
the cause of the blast was not immediately known 
the crew of a private vessel the northern lights reported 
hearing two explosions about 11 am and then saw the helicopter 
disappear from the sky said coast guard petty officer thomas 
cowan 
there were eight people on board we expect no survivors 
said cowan he said search crews found a lot of wreckage 
cowan had said six bodies were found but later said he had been 
speculating and that seven helmets were found but no fatalities had 
been confirmed 
three helicopters two from the navy and one from the coast 
guard joined the cutty blackhaw two smaller coast guard vessels 
and the northern lights in the search 
cowan said searchers were hampered by fog that reduced 
visibility to 150 yards 
navy spokeswoman virginia felker said the helicopter was 
attached to mine countermeasures squadron 15 based at alameda 
naval air station on the eastern shore of san francisco bay 
she said the helicopter was conducting routine mine 
countermeasure operation that involved using radar equipment and 
pulling a weighted sled to simulate towing a mine

american officials sifting through several 
claims of responsibility have concluded that the palestinian abu 
nidal organization probably conducted the july 11 attack that 
killed nine people aboard a greek cruise ship 
but the united states is not certain whether libya abu nidals 
main benefactor commissioned the attack on the city of poros 
cruise liner sailing in the aegean sea 
the method of operation the style of the attack all point to 
abu nidal one official said but we have to be cautious about 
the linkage to libya added the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna gets much of his 
funding from libyan leader moammar gadhafi and maintains 
headquarters in tripoli 
american counterterrorism officials contend that since the us 
aerial bombing on libya two years ago gadhafi has been using 
surrogate groups to carry out terror attacks against the united 
states but the official said that in some terror attacks its 
not clearcut whether libya ordered them or maybe it was just a 
wink and nod kind of thing in which gadhafi gave implicit 
approval 
callers have claimed that at least three groups carried out the 
gunfire and grenade assault on the city of poros in which 98 
people were wounded the groups are the organization of the 
martyrs of the popular revolution in palestine the islamic jihad 
group believed to be holding some western hostages in lebanon and 
the jewish defense league whose spokesman has denied an anonymous 
claim of responsibility 
none of these ring any bells they sound like hoaxes said 
the american official 
another official also speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the attack was similar to those carried out simultaneously at the 
vienna and rome airports in december 1985 in which 19 people were 
killed and more than 100 wounded there is also similarity with the 
1986 attack on an istanbul turkey synagogue in which more than 20 
people were killed he said 
running in shooting and throwing grenades seems to be the 
method in all these cases the first official said 
he discounted reports that the cruise liner attack was intended 
to gain freedom for a palestinian arrested in greece last month 
whose extradition is being sought by the united states in 
connection with the 1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner in hawaii 
this has the earmarks of a longplanned event not something 
put together on the spur of the moment he said 
the palestinian arrested in greece mohammed rashid has been 
charged with entering the country with a forged syrian passport 
greece is reportedly reluctant to extradite him to the united 
states saying it does not have sufficient proof of his culpability

those who frequent conventions to see and be seen 
are facing a monumental challenge at this years democratic 
gathering where the only thing scarcer than podium time is floor 
space inside the convention hall 
the paucity of floor passes even for highranking officials and 
party operatives has prompted party officials to convert the 
georgia world congress center across from the omni into a giant 
consolation prize of invitationonly parties and other events to 
ease the pain of exile 
judging by the amount of cavorting and schmoozing i saw in the 
hallways yesterday that plan is working out fine dnc spokesman 
mike mccurry said monday 
the podium schedule is continually shifting and expanding 
reflecting the intense lobbying efforts of governors mayors and 
congressional candidates to gain exposure their moments in the 
spotlight fall outside the primetime window of network tv 
coverage but theres more than enough compensation in the hundreds 
of newspapers and tv stations voracious for local news and 
personalities 
podium time is a good boost for these candidates theyll 
certainly be covered in their print outlets said anita dunn 
spokeswoman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
her group managed to get eight candidates including six 
challengers onto the tuesday night schedule in a saturday 
edition of the program the segment is listed as a 10minute 
introduction of the senate contenders by monday the candidates 
had won 19 minutes and the right to make brief remarks 
not to be outdone the house congressional campaign committee 
went to bat for its own candidates we are coequal branches of 
government winked the committee chairman beryl anthony dark 
in the revised schedule released monday the wednesday session 
opens 39 minutes earlier 31 of them are devoted to remarks about 
and introductions of the house hopefuls 
the governors apparently weighed in as well the new wednesday 
schedule gave those from louisiana pennsylvania and kentucky four 
to five minutes each for speeches that are nowhere to be found in 
earlier schedules 
other late additions to the week included speeches by house 
majority leader tom foley of washington and district of columbia 
mayor marion barry a jesse jackson supporter and introductions of 
geraldine ferraro the 1984 vice presidential candidate and 
someone identified only as the young delegate 
who lost bob farmer the miracle fundraiser of the dukakis 
campaign was slashed from four minutes to two house speaker jim 
wright went from 14 minutes to 10 and sen christopher dodd of 
connecticut fell from 10 minutes to six a videotape highlighting 
the career of dnc secretary dorothy bush was cut in half and six 
minutes were trimmed from the time allowed for vice presidential 
nominations 
mccurry said speakers have been astonishingly cooperative about 
keeping their remarks brief weve been able to persuade them 
that four minutes on the podium constitutes a major address he 
said 
while convention planners can add a few minutes here and 
subtract a few there to accommodate heavyweight requests for podium 
time there is virtually nothing they can do to supplement the 
meager floor space in the omni 
many who thought they were political insiders are being left 
out victims of the limited passes available and the dncs 
firstpreference policy for working journalists and technicians 
responsible for communicating the weeks events to the taxpayers 
who are footing the bill 
the pressure mccurry said is coming mostly from party 
dignitaries fundraisers operatives and staff people who are 
not delegates the closest they may get to the convention is a 
world congress center auditorium with a big screen on which to 
watch the proceedings 
if the dnc succeeds as mccurry says it has the refuseniks 
wont mind theyll be happily diverted by parties receptions and 
hospitality suites sprinkled with notables to make them feel 
like theyre part of the action 
the whole plot is to turn the wcc into the highprestige place 
to rub elbows said mary jane gallagher a consultant to the dnc 
press office 
scott widmeyer another consultant said he is already convinced 
of that with 20000 people milling around this is the place to 
conduct business this is the place to buttonhole people he 
said if you really want to be seen this is the building to be 
in

grant to pay the people who take care of me until i die 
recipients of the awards from 150000 to 375000 over five 
years are free to spend the money any way they wish individuals 
cannot apply for the grants instead they are nominated 
anonymously and reviewed by a 15member committee with final 
approval made by the john d and catherine t macarthur 
foundations board of directors 
i figured out how to make it you figure out how to spend 
it macarthur told his board before he died in 1978 his wife 
died shortly thereafter 
the grantmaking foundation is one of the largest private 
philanthropic groups in the united states macarthur owned bankers 
life and casualty insurance company

roldans group with the help of outside investors buys and 
renovates vacant housing then rents it at affordable prices to 
workingclass and poor families 
roldan said he would like to think that his work helps build 
futures for hispanic youths housing or a home is the place where 
lives get built or shattered he said 
to the extent that a kid has a space maybe even their own 
room to study in to plan for the future is a very important 
thing said roldan 45 
he said he may use his 275000 award to help finance education 
for needy youths and maybe put some money away for college for 
his own children aged 11 and 12

irans acceptance of a truce in the war 
with iraq appears to be the work of hashemi rafsanjani who 
introduced a much less bellicose tone when he became military 
commander last month 
he hinted at a negotiated solution to the nearly 8yearold 
struggle and after the us navy shot down an iranian airliner 
july 3 even cautioned against violent retaliation 
rafsanjani has built personal power through his job as speaker 
of irans parliament the majlis 
on june 2 several iraqi military victories revolutionary 
patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini made him commanderinchief 
and he has emerged as the man most likely to hold temporal power 
after the death of khomeini who is 88 
rafsanjani 53 said on iranian television monday that khomeini 
who set the previous policy to reject a ceasefire made decided 
sunday to accept it 
his recent statements would suggest rafsanjani is a moderate 
but the word has little meaning in the murk of iranian politics 
where positions come and go like ghosts in a fog 
in a speech last month rafsanjani mentioned the possibility of 
nonmilitary solutions to the war but at friday prayers july 8 
he exhorted young men to go to the front to determine the fate of 
the iraqi imposedwar right there on the battlefield 
the first communique of his newly formed military general 
command said it was the duty of iranians to resist and hope for 
ultimate divine victory 
it said the goal was to mobilize all military and civilian 
potential and change the military balance in irans favor 
rafsanjani also had suggested however that it was time for 
iran to emerge from its international isolation 
as iran announced its acceptance monday of the yearold un 
security council truce resolution the general command said we 
once again urge the iranian people to man the war fronts to 
confront the enemies aggressive nature and foil their criminal 
acts 
earlier this month rafsanjani said on iranian television one 
of the wrong things we did in the revolutionary atmosphere was 
constantly to make enemies we pushed those who could have been 
neutral into hostility 
western diplomats said monday most iranians are weary of the war 
and the leadership may be able to explain the policy shift with 
relative ease but that iranians would be wrong to think ending the 
war will bring a quick return to economic health 
the economy is in a desolate state one diplomat based in 
tehran said recently twothirds of the countrys industrial 
capacity is idle with spare parts and trained personnel lacking 
it will take years 
since 1980 the year after khomeinis revolution overthrew the 
late shah mohammade reza pahlavi rafsanjani has dominated the 
parliament he has built support among the 350000 revolutionary 
guards corps which he briefly commanded and other power centers 
iranians call him kuseh the shark some say for the 
political ruthlessness and cunning that lie behind his smile and 
sly wit others say for his lack of facial hair revealing his 
mongolian ancestry in a nation of bearded men 
although khomeinis designated heir is ayatollah husseinali 
montazeri most political analysts believe rafsanjani will hold 
real power with one or two others after the patriarch dies 
khomeini supported his temperate response to the destruction of 
the airliner in which 290 people were killed with a message to 
montazeri who had urged thorough plans for a struggle against 
us political economic cultural and military targets 
while he is close to khomeini and considered the second most 
powerful man in iran rafsanjanis middlelevel clerical rank of 
hojatoleslam rules him out as the future walifaqih or supreme 
spiritual leader 
rafsanjani helped give the islamic revolution direction through 
the turmoil of its early days and his rise to prominence was rapid 
hes not brilliant as an organizer and he doesnt have 
original ideas but hes a manipulator and hes intelligent said 
abolhassan bani sadr the first iranian president after the 
revolution 
many western leaders see rafsanjani as the more acceptable face 
of the islamic revolution because he advocates links with the west 
that is not the result of less commitment to the revolution but 
because he believes iran can gain from such dealings 
he was at the center of the clandestine armsforhostages deal 
with the united states in 198586 and when it was uncovered 
montazeri and other rivals sought to discredit him 
word of the secret dealings with the great satan the 
united states was leaked to a beirut magazine by mehdi hashemi 
brotherinlaw of montazeris son 
displaying the political agility that has allowed him to survive 
often bloody infighting rafsanjani had mehdi hashemi arrested for 
treason murder and kidnapping thus discrediting montazeri 
hashemi and several associates were executed last september

iran on monday accepted a un resolution 
for a truce with iraq in the nearly 8yearold war that has cost an 
estimated 1 million lives on both sides its military command said 
however that its soldiers would stay at the front 
the united states cautiously welcomed the move saying it was 
unsure of the intentions of iran which has suffered a recent 
series of defeats iraq said its enemy made the decision for 
tactical reasons and not out of any desire for real and just 
peace 
hashemi rafsanjani parliament speaker and acting 
commanderinchief said the decision was made by the 88yearold 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who had set 
irans original policy of rejecting a truce 
security council resolution 598 of july 20 1987 calls for a 
ceasefire withdrawal of military forces to recognized borders 
prisoner exchange and an investigation to determine who started the 
nearly 8yearold war 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral said he was 
beginning consultations with both sides and a ceasefire could take 
effect within a week 
iraq agreed to the security council resolution long ago on 
condition iran also accepted it but until monday the iranians had 
said there could be no truce until iraq was condemned as the 
aggressor the iraqis invaded iran in september 1980 after several 
border skirmishes 
on sunday president saddam hussein of iraq urged iranian 
leaders to accept an honorable end to the conflict 
rafsanjani who was promoted to military commander last month 
and has set a less bellicose tone since then said in an interview 
on iranian television monday since the people of iran believe in 
imam khomeinis decisions and rely on him and the people in charge 
we hereby announce the decision to accept un security council 
resolution 598 
this decision is based on many reasons but since imam 
khomeini is aware of many political and military secrets he cannot 
give more explanations at the moment 
he said the decision was made for the benefit of the iranian 
nation and there is no sign of weakness in it 
referring to the july 3 downing of the iran air jetliner by the 
us navy that killed 290 people rafsanjani said we took it as 
a warning 
poisonous propaganda was trying to pretend that we were the 
war lovers and saddam hussein was the lover of peace he said 
also inside the country we have enemies who are trying to 
condemn us because of not accepting the ceasefire he said in a 
rare open admission by a top official of discord inside iran over 
the war 
but by approving the un resolution our fight has not 
ended rafsanjani added according to the imams order we will 
not have to fight on the war fronts for the moment while we wait to 
see the uns final decision 
as irans acceptance of the resolution was conveyed monday in a 
message to perez de cuellar a statement by rafsanjanis new 
military general command said we once again urge the iranian 
people to man the war fronts to confront the enemies aggressive 
nature and foil their criminal acts 
it praised the khomeinis great leadership and in a 
reference to the united states said the arrogant worlds sought 
to portray iraq as a peaceloving regime because it had 
accepted resolution 598 
a dispatch carried by baghdads official iraqi news agency said 
the iranian announcement was made for tactical reasons and not 
from a desire for real and just peace 
the reagan administration said it welcomed irans willingness to 
accept the un resolution 
in santa barbara calif president reagans spokesman marlin 
fitzwater also said i think we have to be cautious because 
us officials are unsure what irans intentions are 
fitzwater also refused to say how irans move would affect the 
american military presence in the persian gulf although he did say 
the united states has been prepared to end tanker escorts if peace 
came to the region 
a government spokesman in syria the only major arab backer of 
iran in the war said his nation expresses its satisfaction and 
welcomes the wise decision of the iranian leadership 
other arab nations reacted cautiously in jordan which has been 
a key supporter of iraq foreign minister taher masri pointed out 
there had been conflicting signals from iran the semiofficial 
kuwait news agency said the iranian move brings joy 
clovis maksoud the arab leagues ambassador to the united 
nations also welcomed the iranian move but noted that it was 
overdue 
several hours after the iranian general command statement was 
distributed by the official islamic republic news agency iraq said 
its helicopter gunships flew 61 sirties against iranian positions 
monday inflicting losses in men and equipment 
the iranian message to perez de cuellar released in new york 
said iran because of the importance it attaches to saving the 
lives of human beings and the establishment of justice and regional 
and international peace and security accepts security council 
resolution 598 
irans military command advocated a new policy to expose 
the aggressor and prevent the enemies of islam from taking 
the initiative on the international scene 
the announcement of the islamic republics new stands to un 
chief javier perez de cuellar is aimed at implementing this new 
policy it said 
khomeini made rafsanjani acting commanderinchief june 2 and 
rafsanjani has indicated iran might seek a negotiated end to the 
war 
irans military position has deteriorated in three months iraq 
has recaptured nearly all the territory it lost to iran in six 
years 
rafsanjani said in a speech june 15 we are not insisting on 
getting our rights on the battlefield we have defined nonmilitary 
solutions to the war 
tehrans diplomatic position also has moderated since the us 
navy shot an iranian airliner down july 3 in the persian gulf 
killing all 290 people aboard us officials said the cruiser uss 
vincennes mistook the airbus a300 for an iranian f14 fighter on an 
attack course 
in baghdad information minister nassif ltayyif jassem expressed 
reservations in the first official iraqi response to irans 
acceptance of resolution 598 
the iranian general commands statement did not explain the 
reasons behind irans new stand in terms of a desire for a real and 
just peace but in terms of tactical reasons he said he 
who wants peace does not have to call for massing troops on the 
front 
iraq rejected an earlier iranian assertion that both side had 
returned to the 1980 international borders 
iran is still occupying parts of iraqi territory here and 
there a defense ministry statement said it must withdraw or 
we will force the iranians to withdraw and suffer more casualties 
in addition to territorial losses iran suffered a psychological 
blow in the latest round of attacks on cities from feb 29 to april 
21 of this year in which hundreds of civilians were killed on both 
sides up to half tehrans 6 million people fled to the countryside 
to escape iraqi missiles 
iraq fired nearly 200 missiles into tehran and other cities 
during the exchange three times the number launched by iran

independent counsel james mckay concluded in a 
report released today that attorney general edwin meese iii 
probably willfully filed a false income tax return failed to pay 
taxes on time and broke a criminal conflictofinterest law 
but mckay said he had decided not to seek criminal charges 
against the attorney general because there is no evidence that 
mr meese acted from motivation for personal gain there is no 
evidence that he acted out of selfinterest 
in an 814page report mckay said meeses 1985 tax return did 
not declare some capital gains from the sale of securities and that 
meese did not pay income tax on his capital gains from those sales 
when he filed the return 
a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a reasonable 
doubt that mr meese violated a section of the internal revenue 
code by filing a materially false tax return said mckay who 
added that meese probably also violated a section of the internal 
revenue code for willfully failing to pay tax at the time 
required by law 
meese also probably violated a criminal conflictofinterest law 
in connection with his holdings of 14000 in regional bell 
telephone stock but the independent counsel who investigated meese 
for 14 months disclosed today that he had decided not to prosecute 
the case 
mckay said meese owned the stock in the regional bell companies 
in 1985 and 1986 when he set in motion a review process that led 
to a reversal of justice department policy mckay also found that 
meese participated in discussions of proposed legislation to shift 
regulatory responsibility for the breakup of atampt from a federal 
court and the justice department to the federal communications 
commission 
mckay said that a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond 
a reasonable doubt that mr meese violated a federal 
conflictofinterest law that law makes it a felony for a us 
official to participate personally and substantially in a 
particular matter in which he or his spouse has a financial 
interest 
mckay told reporters this afternoon the investigation had cost 
about 17 million as of the end of june and he added i feel 
confident we have not wasted any government funds any of the 
taxpayers money 
he said the decision to accuse meese of crimes without charging 
him was probably the toughest mental decision we had to make 
he said he decided that charges in such matters would not have been 
brought against an ordinary citizen and therefore should not be 
brought against meese he said there was no pattern of tax 
violation by meese or his wife and meese had not shown bad faith 
and had not deliberately lied 
president reagan is pleased that after extensive scrutiny the 
independent counsel did not charge the attorney general with any 
criminal wrongdoing presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
in santa barbara calif as he has said before the president 
feels ed meese has been an outstanding attorney general 
nathan lewin meeses attorney said he views mckays assertion 
that meese probably committed crimes as the actions of a hit and 
run driver its a very cheap shot 
lewin accused mckay in a news conference after the report was 
released of reaching inappropriate conclusions and of going beyond 
what any reasonable prosecutor would do he said however he 
was not accusing mckay of unethical conduct and considered him an 
honorable man 
as for the tax return meeses investment manager w franklyn 
chinn sold securities for meese and his wife ursula in may and 
june 1985 and deposited the proceeds of 54581 in the meeses 
account 
the meeses realized a net capital gain of 20706 from these 
sales they owed 3479 in taxes which was initially due on april 
15 1986 
the meeses were granted extensions for filing their return until 
oct 15 1986 
a week before the oct 15 deadline meese told his accountant 
john mckean that the securities had been sold in 1985 but meese 
did not identify the securities or tell the accountant what the 
sale proceeds were or what their cost had been facts necessary to 
calculate the capital gain 
according to mckay meese had not yet located or assembled that 
information 
mckean suggested to meese and meese agreed that the return be 
filed by the deadline without any reference to the securities sales 
and that an amended return disclosing the required information be 
filed as soon as possible 
mckay said that meese finally filed an amended tax return on 
feb 6 of this year declaring a capital gain on the securities 
sales of 14606 and that meese paid the tax due on that amount 
plus interest 
mckay noted that meese filed the amended return shortly after 
the scheduling of the grand jury appearances for the meeses 
accountants in connection with mckays criminal investigation of 
the matter 
mr meese had a duty to report the securities sales and to 
declare his capital gains income on his tax return filed oct 15 
1986 said mckay 
because that return did not disclose any information about the 
1985 securities sales it was materially false mckay declared 
it incorrectly stated the income and tax due without any 
notation or other reference explaining that those figures did not 
include any information about the securities sales said mckays 
report 
in regard to the phone stock mckays report said that 
congress has declared that it is a criminal offense for an 
officially personally and substantially to participate in a 
particular matter in which he knows he has a financial interest 
but mckay went on to say that congress did not seek to limit a 
prosecutors discretion in determining whether or not a probable 
violation of the law warrants actual prosecution 
mckay said that there is no substantial federal interest in 
prosecuting probable violations resulting from an officials 
participation in matters when a similar kind of participation 
was covered by waivers for periods both before and after the 
probable violations occurred 
mckay added that there was no evidence of deliberate 
circumvention of the waiver process concealment of the financial 
interest motivation for personal gain or effect on government 
decisionmaking 
when he was white house counselor meese obtained a waiver from 
the white house counsels office early in the reagan administration 
allowing him to participate in telecommunications matters despite 
his stock holdings in atampt 
in 1987 after he had became attorney general and met with 
executives of the regional bells and participated in the 
legislative initiative meese obtained another waiver from the 
white house counsels office this one permitted him to approve 
early in 1987 a reversal of justice department position concerning 
the regional bells meese endorsed a position urging a federal 
court judge to allow the bells to branch into new areas of business 
the independent counsel said that an argument could be made that 
prosecuting an attorney general would serve as a significant 
deterrent to other highranking public officials

<TEXT>
he said he had considered that argument and concluded that mr 
meeses particular position in government should not be the 
determining factor in the prosecutive decision in a case in which 
a prosecution is not otherwise warranted 
mckay also disclosed that meeses longtime friend e robert 
wallach who is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the 
wedtech scandal facilitated meeses refinancing of his mclean 
va home through the national bank of washington 
the 260000 mortgage loan appears to have been made at terms 
that were customary for the bank at that time for a loan of that 
size said mckay 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
circumstantial inferences may be drawn from the coincidence 
especially during the spring summer and fall of 1895 between mr 
meeses acceptance of things of value from mr wallach and mr 
meeses official acts that benefited mr wallach said mckay who 
noted 
during that 1985 time period while mr meese had a 
substantial potential liability to mr wallach for legal fees 
after mr wallach had arranged what was proving to be a profitable 
relationship between mr meese and mr chinn and while mr wallach 
was arranging for mrs meese to secure a job paying 40000 per 
year mr meese undertook unusual official activiites to aid mr 
wallachs efforts to further a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline 
project 
the independent counsel said there is some evidence to support 
a conclusion that mr meese accepted things of value from mr 
wallach when he should have been sensitive to the possibility that 
a part of mr wallachs motivation may have been to show 
appreciation for mr meeses official activities that benefited mr 
wallach 
if mr meese believed that mr wallach was motivated in part 
by such a consideration a gratuities violation would have 
occurred said mckay 
but the independent counsel concluded 
there is no direct evidence that mr meese accepted anything 
of value from mr wallach with the requisite state of mind for a 
gratuities violation the independent counsel has determined that 
the available evidence is insufficient to conclude that such a 
violation probably occurred 
in a printed rebuttal meeses lawyers said the attorney general 
committed no criminal tax offense when he authorized his accountant 
to file his 1985 tax return on the basis of available information 
meese took active steps to collect the needed information to 
determine captial gains and there is no basis for concluding that 
meese acted willfully and with specific intent to violate the law 
said his lawyers nathan lewin james rocap and niki kuckes 
at one point in the report mckay says that there are some 
notable coincidences in the timing of mr meeses acceptance of 
things of value directly or indirectly from mr wallach and some of 
the official acts done by mr meese that benefited mr wallach 
the kinds of favors that mr wallach did assisting his 
longtime friend with a legal problem suggesting an investment 
adviser and facilitating job opportunities for a family member 
are consistent with ordinary close friendship said meeses 
lawyers 
meeses lawyers say that mckay is incorrect in suggesting that 
meese should have been more sensitive to the possibility that part 
of wallachs motivation for his actions may have been to show 
appreciation for meeses official activities 
mckays investigation turned up several new elements in an 
incident in 1985 when howard and sondra bender head of a wealth 
washington real estate family provided 40000 for meeses wife 
ursula to be paid by the multiple sclerosis society where she had 
previously worked as a volunteer the donation coincided with 
efforts by a bender real estate partnership to renew a lucrative 
lease on office space for justice department agencies 
mckay revealed that meeses friend wallach brought mrs meeses 
desire for a paid job to the attention of the benders but mckay 
said he turned up no information that meese was aware of benders 
interest in the building or took any role in the lease renewal 
mckay also disclosed that as his grand jury looked into the 
matter in february 1988 bender loaned wallach 200000 secured by 
a note and a deed of trust to property owned by wallach and agreed 
to expand the loan to 500000 later if an additional deed were 
turned over 
in rebuttal benders attorneys said wallach said he needed the 
money for legal bills because the government had frozen his assets 
they added that the loan was disclosed to the us attorney in new 
york where wallach is under indictment for trying to peddle his 
influence with meese 
the mckay report also 
concluded there was no violation of federal law in meeses 
involvement in a private proposal to build a 1 billion pipeline 
for iraq and jordan but mckays report said his investigation had 
been hampered by a lack of testimony from key principles and 
described meeses action on at least one count as highly 
unusual 
the investigation focused on a memorandum from wallach that 
appeared to indicate that a secret payment might be paid to 
israels labor party by pipeline developers for a guarantee from 
israel not to harm the pipeline 
the report said it was highly unusual for meese to request 
that thennational security adviser robert macfarlane meet with 
wallach over a matter that was of commercial interest to wallach 
who had been retained by swissbased busnessman bruce rappaport to 
help with the project the pipeline as never built 
meeses attorneys in their response called the pipeline probe 
a mammothly expensive feckless venture which netted nothing 
this is probably the most poorly conceived illfounded and 
wasteful use of investigative resources in the history of american 
law enforcement the attorneys said 
said investigators had learned that chinn had maintained a 
meese account in hong kong purportedly for the purpose of trading 
in the hong kong loco london gold market 
mckay said that discovery coupled with questions raised when it 
was learned that chinn had transfered large sums of cash overseas 
through agents and foreign associates led to an expansion of the 
investigation 
he said the probe was handicapped when chinn and wallach refused 
to testify asserting their 5th amendment rights 
but in the end mckay said he had concluded that while mr 
chinns services to mr meese may have been unusual there is no 
substantial evidence to conclude that any benefit that was accepted 
in this regard by mr meese from mr chinn or mr wallach was an 
unlawful gratuity

the dutch foreign minister 
cut short a tour of this palestinian refugee camp monday after 
dozens of arab youths chanting antiisraeli slogans stoned 
journalists covering the visit 
foreign minister hans van den broek was in a camp clinic 200 
yards from the demonstration and was not hurt 
after his departure dozens of troops fired rubber bullets to 
disperse the youths who raised outlawed palestinian flags and 
pictures of plo chief yasser arafat 
the kalandia camp is located about six miles north of jerusalem 
in another development a 17yearold arab from the west bank 
village of beit sahour died monday after a large brick fell on his 
head as he passed by an army post hospital officials said 
arab reporters quoted witnesses as saying a soldier threw the 
brick at admon elias hilal army officials denied the charges 
saying an investigation showed part of the roofs guardrail 
collapsed and a brick fell to the ground 
elsewhere in the west bank israeli troops shot and wounded 
three palestinians in separate clashes hospital officials said 
a 29yearold arab died at jerusalems mukassad hospital of a 
bullet wound sustained in a july 10 clash with troops 
his death brought to 224 the number of palestinians killed since 
the dec 8 start of the arab uprising in the west bank and gaza 
strip according to united nations figures four israelis have also 
died 
palestinians throughout the occupied lands closed down shops and 
deserted the streets to observe a general strike in solidarity with 
arabs held in an israeli prison 
van den broek who is accompanying dutch prime minister ruud 
lubbers told residents of the kalandia camp that he and lubbers 
have urged israel to abide by the rule of international law when 
maintaining law in the territories 
israeli measures in quelling the uprising have included house 
demolitions and deportations 
the mother of two camp residents ordered deported by israel 
asked van den broek to intervene on her sons behalf the minister 
said he would look into the matter 
during the tour of the camp van den broek was thronged by 
residents some of whom chanted plo israel no a teenager

their close relations with israel to further the peace process 
and also show our israeli friends how we feel about the palestinian 
people 
he did not elaborate but in kalandia van den broek said that 
palestinians have a right to selfdetermination and that israel has 
a right to exist

attorney general edwin meese iii probably 
broke two tax laws and violated a criminal conflictofinterest 
statute but wont be charged with a crime independent counsel 
james mckay concluded in an 814page report unveiled to the public 
on monday 
an attorney for meese nathan lewin called the assertions a 
very cheap shot 
in a report which concluded his 14month investigation mckay 
wrote that a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a 
reasonable doubt that mr meese violated a section of the 
internal revenue code by filing a materially false tax return 
mckay added that meese probably also violated a section of the 
internal revenue code for willfully failing to pay tax at the 
time required by law 
meese announced july 5 that he will step down as attorney 
general later this month or in early august he said then that 
mckays report which he had not read at the time completely 
vindicated him the report originally was filed under seal that 
day with a threejudge court 
richard thornburgh named by president reagan to succeed meese 
has said he will pursue any evidence against meese wherever it may 
lead 
mckay said that the meeses failed to report a net capital gain 
of 20706 on the sale of 54581 in securities in 1985 
mckay noted that meese finally filed an amended return on feb 6 
of this year shortly after the scheduling of the grand jury 
appearances for the meeses accountants in connection with 
mckays criminal investigation of the matter 
at that time the meeses paid 2875 in overdue federal tax 
payments and interest with the amended return declaring a capital 
gain on the securities sales of 14606 mckay said however that 
meeses accountants had made an error in calculating the basis of 
atampt stock sold in 1985 under which some 1000 in additional tax 
was due the government on an added 6000 in capital gains 
the proceeds from the 1985 sales were invested for the meeses 
by the attorney generals financial manager w franklyn chinn who 
is currently under indictment for alleged racketeering in the 
wedtech scandal meese had been referred to chinn by meeses 
longtime friend e robert wallach who also figures prominently in 
the report 
mr meese had a duty to report the securities sales and to 
declare his capital gains income on his tax return filed oct 15 
1986 said mckay 
because that return did not disclose any information about the 
1985 securities sales it was materially false mckay declared 
mckay also disclosed that wallach who is under indictment for 
alleged racketeering in the wedtech scandal facilitated two loans 
to meese totalling 340000 
the independent counsel examined the transactions in trying to 
determine whether meese had accepted a bribe or a gratuity at 
wallachs behest meese intervened on behalf of the wedtech corp 
in 1981 resulting ultimately in the defense contractor being 
awarded a 32 million contract meese also assisted wallach in 
connection with a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project setting up 
a meeting between the san francisco lawyer and thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane 
lewin said he views mckays assertion that meese probably 
committed crimes as the actions of a hit and run driver its a 
very cheap shot 
lewin accused mckay in a news conference after the report was 
released of reaching inappropriate conclusions and of going beyond 
what any reasonable prosecutor would do 
president reagan is pleased that after extensive scrutiny the 
independent counsel did not charge the attorney general with any 
criminal wrongdoing presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
in santa barbara calif as he has said before the president 
feels ed meese has been an outstanding attorney general 
mckays report noted that under the policies of the internal 
revenue service and the department of justice a taxpayers efforts 
to bring himself into compliance with his obligations before an 
investigation of his affairs are taken into account in determining 
whether to bring criminal charges 
meese probably violated the conflictofinterest law in 
connection with his holdings of 14000 in regional bell telephone 
stock mckay said 
mckay said meese owned the stock in the regional bell companies 
in 1985 and 1986 when he set in motion a review process that led 
to a reversal of justice department policy mckay also found that 
meese participated in discussions of proposed legislation to shift 
regulatory responsibility for the breakup of atampt from a federal 
court and the justice department to the federal communications 
commission 
mckay said that a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond 
a reasonable doubt that mr meese violated a federal 
conflictofinterest law that law makes it a felony for a us 
official to participate personally and substantially in a 
particular matter in which he or his spouse has a financial 
interest 
mckay said he had decided not to seek criminal charges against 
the attorney general because there is no evidence that mr meese 
acted from motivation for personal gain there is no evidence 
that he acted out of selfinterest

president reagan has chosen the 
name freedom for the permanently manned space station being 
jointly developed by the united states canada europe and japan 
his spokesman said monday 
the name freedom was recommended by a team of nasa 
representatives and international partners white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
the yearning for freedom is a basic human emotion and freedom 
of the individual is a value shared by all nations that will work 
together to build and use the space station fitzwater said 
he said the name freedom is tied to reagans earliest 
statements about the space station program 
when the president announced his decision to build a space 
station in his january 1984 state of the union address he noted 
that he was inviting our friends and allies to join us so we can 
strengthen peace build prosperity and expand freedom for all who 
share our goals fitzwater said 
the space station will consist of three laboratory modules one 
each from the united states europe and japan and a habitat 
module that will accommodate a fulltime crew of eight canada will 
provide a mobile servicing center to help assemble and maintain the 
manned base 
the space station is to be launched aboard the space shuttle and 
assembled in orbit beginning in 1995 it will provide a versatile 
research laboratory for conducting science developing new 
technologies exploring the solar system and stimulating private 
business investment in space the white house statement said

the independent counsel said that an argument could be made that 
prosecuting an attorney general would serve as a significant 
deterrent to other highranking public officials 
he said he had considered that argument and concluded that mr 
meeses particular position in government should not be the 
determining factor in the prosecutive decision in a case in which 
a prosecution is not otherwise warranted 
in connection with his examination of whether meese accepted 
bribes or gratuities from wallach mckay found that in september 
1983 the san francisco lawyer introduced meese to jeffrey cohen 
board chairman of the national bank of commerce in washington 
the purpose of that introduction was to enable mr meese to 
obtain immediately an 80000 loan from mr cohens bank said 
mckay 
on the same day he filed a loan application meese received an 
unsecured personal loan from the bank for 80000 with the 
understanding it would be converted to a secured loan as soon as 
necessary paperwork was completed 
although mr wallachs efforts to facilitate the loan was a 
thing of value accepted by mr meese the loan itself appears to 
have been made on terms including a rate of interest customary 
for such loans by the bank at that time said mckay 
the independent counsel also disclosed that wallach facilitated 
meeses refinancing of his mclean va home through the national 
bank of washington 
the 260000 mortgage loan appears to have been made at terms 
that were customary for the bank at that time for a loan of that 
size said mckay 
circumstantial inferences may be drawn from the coincidence 
especially during the spring summer and fall of 1895 between mr 
meeses acceptance of things of value from mr wallach and mr 
meeses official acts that benefited mr wallach said mckay who 
noted 
during that 1985 time period while mr meese had a 
substantial potential liability to mr wallach for legal fees 
after mr wallach had arranged what was proving to be a profitable 
relationship between mr meese and mr chinn and while mr wallach 
was arranging for mrs meese to secure a job paying 40000 per 
year mr meese undertook unusual official activiites to aid mr 
wallachs efforts to further a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline 
project 
but the independent counsel concluded 
there is no direct evidence that mr meese accepted anything 
of value from mr wallach with the requisite state of mind for a 
gratuities violation the independent counsel has determined that 
the available evidence is insufficient to conclude that such a 
violation probably occurred 
mckays investigation turned up several new elements in an 
incident in 1985 when howard and sondra bender head of a wealth 
washington real estate family provided 40000 for meeses wife 
ursula to be paid by the multiple sclerosis society where she had 
previously worked as a volunteer the donation coincided with 
efforts by a bender real estate partnership to renew a lucrative 
lease on office space for justice department agencies 
mckay revealed that meeses friend wallach brought mrs meeses 
desire for a paid job to the attention of the benders but mckay 
said he turned up no information that meese was aware of benders 
interest in the building or took any role in the lease renewal 
mckay also 
disclosed that about the time his grand jury looked into the 
matter in february 1988 bender loaned wallach 200000 secured by 
a note and a deed of trust to property owned by wallach and agreed 
to expand the loan to 500000 later if an additional deed were 
turned over 
concluded there was no violation of federal law in meeses 
involvement in a private proposal to build a 1 billion pipeline 
for iraq and jordan but mckays report said his investigation had 
been hampered by a lack of testimony from key principles and 
described meeses action on at least one count as highly 
unusual

amid swarming delegates american flags and 
colorful banners sits a hightech newcomer to the democratic 
national convention floor poised to ensure the smoothest voting 
process ever 
computerized voting machines friendly to even the most fearful 
user are strategically placed on the omni floor and ready to tally 
delegation votes in a matter of seconds 
democrats say the aim is to maintain a wrinklefree convention 
and most importantly to save time 
we have only two hours of prime time now to work with says 
tony shorris democratic national committee spokesman and to 
vote in the traditional way takes about 35 minutes 
under the system customtailored by atampt for the convention 
state delegation chairmen need only touch a soft lightsensitive 
screen to record votes on platform and convention rules issues 
centralized computers tally the votes and display totals on a huge 
screen in the hall 
each state has its own terminal and a preprogrammed number of 
votes if the vote total recorded exceeds the number allocated the 
process is interrupted until the delegation chairman properly 
tallies his states votes 
the overall effect is a match to the futuristic image sought by 
the party 
hey were in a hightech society says rhode island state 
chairman joe paolino mike dukakis is hightech its something 
that goes along with it 
the whole theme is management says shorris the 
management of the convention and the management of the country 
part of management is the use of technology 
only in the cases of voting for presidential and vice 
presidential nominees will progress bow to tradition those votes 
will be handled via roll call on wednesday and thursday nights 
im glad the roll call is going to be traditional says 
paolino we need that kind of tradition 
while the system has won plenty of converts among top democratic 
circles there remain some who find the new system daunting 
delaware state chairman samuel shipley a twoconvention 
veteran says hes afraid hell be in trouble if i touch a 
button and is relying on another member of his delegation to man 
the voting terminal 
many of us arent mechanically inclined says shipley it 
would take me a week to learn to use the thing

a device used to test fetuses during 
highrisk pregnancies produces sound in the womb as intense as a 
jet and may be harmful university of florida researchers say 
in studies conducted on sheep the electronic testing device 
also used medically as an artificial larynx or voice box produced 
sound levels in the uterus as high as 135 decibels the approximate 
noise level of a jet airliner taking off or a machine gun firing at 
close range 
the findings do not apply to ultrasound devices routinely used 
during normal pregnancies which use a different range of 
frequencies said dr robert abrams a research professor in the 
department of obstetrics and gynecology 
abrams says it is not known how much of the artificial larnynx 
sound the fetus hears 
but he writes in the july issue of the american journal of 
obstetrics and gynecology that caution is recommended in 
administering the sound test until the effects of high noise levels 
on the fetus are better understood 
the fetal response test has become a popular method for 
monitoring fetal health during highrisk pregnancies it involves 
holding the device against the mothers abdomen the doctor can 
tell if the fetus is alive and well if it responds to the loud 
buzzing 
now that we have an idea of the volume of sound produced in 
the womb by the electronic larynx its easy to understand why the 
human fetus reacts as it does abrams said 
if the unborn child is healthy the test normally causes an 
accelerated heart rate a blinkstartle response and extreme body 
movements that persist for several minutes after the short 
stimulus he said 
the devices potential hazards surfaced during studies with 
sheep designed to find out how much sound outside the womb actually 
reaches the fetus 
researchers surgically implanted a special microphone near the 
ear of the fetuses in five ewes the device can pick up external 
sounds while suspended in the amniotic fluid encasing the embryo 
researchers then exposed the ewes to a variety of sounds at 
different frequencies and volumes and recorded the difference 
between the sounds outside and inside the womb

the state court of appeals has agreed to hear 
subway shooter bernhard goetzs apppeal of his weapons possession 
conviction an attorney said monday 
goetz had been scheduled to be resentenced monday but that 
proceeding was postponed pending the higher court action 
goetzs attorney mark baker said court of appeals judge joseph 
w bellacosa agreed to hear the appeal before aug 1 
the resentencing was necessary because a manhattan appeals 
court ruled last month that goetzs original sentence was illegal 
goetz 40 was convicted last summer of thirddegree illegal 
possession of a gun in the december 1984 shooting of four 
teenagers aboard a subway train 
goetz said he shot the youths because he believed they were 
trying to rob him they claimed they were panhandling 
goetz was sentenced in october to six months in jail a 5000 
fine 280 hours of community service five years probation and 
psychiatric counseling 
the appeals court let everything except the jail term stand 
ruling that if judge stephen crane was going to give goetz an 
indeterminate sentence it had to be onetothree years not six 
months or it said if he was going to sentence him under the 
states gun control law it had to be a definite one year term 
without probation 
goetzs lawyers have been fighting for the indeterminate 
sentence because due to a quirk in the law if given a year he 
would only have to serve two months 
baker reset sentencing for aug 22

seven people were sentenced in bucharest 
to terms ranging from 11 to 18 years in prison for involvement in a 
highlevel chemical storage scandal the state romanian news agency 
agerpres reported monday 
among those jailed was a representative of a liechtenstein firm 
the scandal first publicized last month led to the dismissal 
of six senior government officials including the minister of trade 
the head of the state planning office and the head of the general 
customs directorate 
agerpres said the verdict was handed down saturday at the end of 
a twoday trial at the bucharest city court it said the seven were 
found guilty of grave abuses and violations 
the news agency said more than 4000 tons of chemical and 
petrochemical wastes that were highly noxious for the 
populations health and the environment had entered the country 
illegally 
the scandal involves the kimika company of liechtenstein which 
was accused of storing the chemical industrial waste in the free 
port of sulina on romanias black sea coast 
the romanian foreign trade enterprise chimica reportedly 
concluded a contract with the liecthensteinbased firm for using 
the chemicals in romania 
according to agerpres the harshest sentence of 18 years in 
prison was handed down to hugo weinstein the kimika 
representative agerpres said the court concluded that weinstein 
had received a considerable amount of foreign currency from the 
foreign firm to conclude the contracts 
it was not clear from the agerpres report whether weinstein was 
a liechtenstein citizen and whether he was at the trial efforts to 
reach officials in bucharest for comment on the report proved 
unavailing 
the news agency said two former managers of the sulina port 
dumitru gavanescu and silviu nistor each was given 11 years and a 
third sulina exmanager mihai micu drew 13 years 
two exmanagers of the romanian foreign trade enterprise 
chimica ioan tetu and ion rupedeal each was sentenced to 12 
years virgil popescu also of chimica drew 14 years 
agerpres said the court concluded that the seven committed 
highly serious crimes by flagrantly violating the legal norms that 
forbid the bringingin of dangerous or harmful commodities apt to 
place public health and the environment in jeapordy 
it said the defendents can appeal 
the news agency said negative consequences of the abusive and 
illegal acts were prevented by efficient intervention of the 
state bodies

following are excerpts from the report of 
james mckay the independent counsel who investigated attorney 
general edwin meese iii 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the independent counsel has determined from the available 
evidence that a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a 
reasonable doubt that mr meese violated federal law by 
wilfully filing a materially false tax return and that mr meese 
violated federal law by wilfully failing to pay tax at the time 
required by law 
mckay said he wasnt recommending prosecution in part because 
mr meeses actions were a onetime failure to comply in full 
with his tax obligation they were not part of a pattern of 
disobedience to the tax laws 
based on the independent counsels careful review of mr 
meeses tax returns from 1981 through 1986 mr meese appears in 
all other respects to have complied with his tax obligations there 
is certainly no rule of law nor should there be that excuses an 
isolated violation of the tax laws however the absence of a 
pattern of noncompliance is a factor that weighs heavily in the 
taxpayers favor in the determination whether criminal penalties 
are the preferred remedy for offenses involving one item or 
one closely related group of items on one years tax returns 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
during the period investigated by the independent counsel mr 
meese preformed several official acts that benefited mr wallach 
these included acts that assisted wedtech and acts in furtherance 
of the aqaba pipeline project 
mr meeses official acts that benefited mr wallach began 
with his actions that assisted welbiltwedtech when he was 
counselor to the president in 1981 and 1982 mr meese facilitated 
welbilts efforts to obtain a contract to manufacture small engines 
for the army 
in 1985 mr meese took actions that substantially assisted 
mr wallach and others in connection with the proposed aqaba 
pipeline project 
but he concluded that the independent counsel has determined 
that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that mr meese 
committed any such offense under bribery and antigratuity laws 
the report notes meese admitted helping wallach and wedtech the 
firm he represented but it adds there is no substantial evidence 
that mr meese was motivated to take his actions by any 
consideration other than his friendship for mr wallach the 
evidence does not establish that he was even aware at that time of 
the nature or extent of mr wallachs prospective financial 
interest in the success of wedtech

if bill ashworth tells you he lives in a 
cave believe him 
ashworth is the groundskeeper for a fivebedroom home inside a 
limestone cave in the ozarks in north arkansas the home was built 
by denver businessman john hay who made his fortune selling tea 
and bought 240 acres around the beckham creek cave about five years 
ago 
the home features cascading fountains a blackandwhitetiled 
fred astaire room and multicolored lighting said ashworth 
hay has been trying to sell the home for 33 million for the 
past year but so far there have been no takers its been there 
for 250 million years and it isnt going anywhere hay said 
the cave constructed to allow hay to ride out a nuclear storm 
is equipped with 200 geiger counters a truck load of 
nitrogenpacked dried food and a hydroelectric generator a real 
estate brochure says the home was specifically designed to 
withstand a nuclear war and provide maximum protection against 
radiation fallout and nuclear winter 
ashworth who has lived in the cave since 1983 and has heard 
more than one fred flintstone joke said the cave has some unique 
attributes its the perfect escape from summertime heat at a 
naturally cool yearround temperature of 64 degrees it induces 
hibernationquality sleep and the moisture is good for your skin 
but there are drawbacks its dark theres no tv reception and 
it tends to get kind of damp in the spring hay said

starting oct 1 doctors at military hospitals 
may not perform abortions unless the life of the mother is in 
danger even if the patient pays for the operation according to a 
memorandum obtained monday 
the june 21 memo signed by dr william mayer assistant defense 
secretary for health affairs ended the practice under which for 
the past nine years doctors have been able to perform socalled 
prepaid abortions at military medical treatment facilities 
in certain countries in which quality medical care may not be 
locally available 
doctors have been barred since 1979 from performing abortions 
paid for by the government unless the life of the mother is 
endangered 
mayers memo said that the informal practice of performing 
socalled prepaid abortions in very limited circumstances does 
not violate the legal prohibition 
but the memo changed the policy noting that it might suggest 
insensitivity to the spirit of the congressionally enacted policy 
of withholding government involvement in the provision of 
abortions 
the policy is that the performance of prepaid abortions in 
military treatment faclities is not authorized effective oct 
1 1988 the memo said 
the number of abortions performed in military facilities dropped 
sharply in 1980 after congress passed laws barring the expenditure 
of federal funds for unrestricted abortions according a pentagon 
audit released last november 
the number dropped from 10829 in 1977 and 9800 in 1978 to 304 
in 1979 and 88 in 1980 in 1985 the most recent year for which 
figures were available the number was 48

the total acreage of commercial vegetables for 
harvest this summer is up from a year ago but heat and drought are 
taking a toll of some of the crop yields including peas grown for 
freezing and canning an agriculture department report said monday 
prospective acreage for seven fresh market vegetables was 
estimated at 272100 acres down fractionally from 272790 a year 
ago the report said carrots and sweet corn declined while other 
crops increased those included broccoli cauliflower celery 
lettuce and tomatoes 
the total for five major vegetables for processing was 135 
million acres under contract to processors a 2 percent increase 
from 1987 increases were reported for snap beans cucumbers for 
pickles and tomatoes but there are fewer acres of sweet corn and 
green peas 
drought and heat have stressed a number of the crops that have 
not been irrigated the report said 
for example in the category of sweet corn for fresh market 
sale the report said that drought and heat have hurt the crop in 
new jersey pennsylvania ohio and michigan in california 
however sweet corn has made good progress after being slowed 
somewhat by unseasonably cool weather 
in new jersey the tomato crop declined due to drought and 
yields will be affected severely if the dry weather continues 
looking at processing vegetables the canned and frozen kind 
that consumer will see at stores next winter the report said hot 
dry weather has hurt yields of cucumbers used for making pickles 
and there is increased interest this year in fall planted 
cucumbers for processing 
production of green peas for processing is down 32 percent 
from last year based on reports from processors the report 
said hot dry weather has reduced the crop expectation to 
299000 tons compared with 437000 tons last year and nearly 
415000 tons the year before 
drought in the northcentral states has cut the pea crop 
drastically the report said 
minnesota yields dropped 45 percent as heat during bloom and 
filling devastated the crop the report said wisconsin 
processors report yields at half last years level atlantic coast 
states held good moisture supplies during the spring and are 
harvesting generally better pea crops than last year

arkansas produces more rice than 
any other state but fields could go dry in the next century 
because of wasteful water use experts said monday 
oversized agricultural pumps and inadequate planning are the 
problem which could wreck arkansas 3 billion annual farm economy 
if action isnt taken said ronnie murphy deputy state chief of 
the us soil conservation service 
arkansas produced 40 percent of the nations rice last year 
earning 422 million from 118 million acres said ewell welch 
director of the arkansas farm bureaus rice division 
if current trends continue there may be onethird of the 
grand prairie by the year 2010 that just wont have water 
available murphy said 
arkansas farmers and agriculture officials from more than a 
halfdozen humid states those normally receiving more than 20 
inches of rain a year are gathered this week for the national 
water management expo 
elsewhere officials in lexington ky say the bluegrass area 
is beginning to be a burden for the kentucky river which has 
provided water for more than 400000 people for years 
and the minnesota department of natural resources is 
investigating the summers first water interference complaint filed 
by a man who said he cant get water in his home when his neighbor 
is irrigating his crops 
farm water woes are getting more attention from nonfarmers 
because of the long drought in 26 eastern arkansas counties 
studied by the soil conservation service some were nearly a foot 
below normal rainfall although recent rain has helped said john 
macleod a forecaster at the national weather service 
i dont want to paint a picture of gloom and doom because 
there are answers and alternatives such as diverting surface 
water and achieving greater efficiency murphy said 
one arkansas county rice farmer who pumped 57 inches of water 
got a smaller crop than a neighbor using only 36 inches 
its a matter of the farmer not putting the proper amount of 
water on his crop at the proper time murphy said he just 
pumped too much with a regular set schedule and his pump was too 
big this is a common problem they dont wait until the crop 
needs water 
during the last four years the level of water available to pump 
from beneath the regions fertile soil has gone down by 100 feet 
murphy said 
in kentucky the rivers flow has been less than 10 percent of 
normal for this time of year as low as at any time since the 1930 
drought 
at times this summer the water has stopped flowing over some of 
the 14 kentucky river locks and dams because of this communities 
along the river have instituted mandatory conservation measures 
mandatory conservation would be a blessing to gerald lewerenz 
of st paul who believes his neighbor gary flowers is depleting 
an aquifer used by about two dozen families flowers has irrigated 
nightly for two months showering 600 gallons a minute on 130 acres 
of corn and soybeans 
lewerenz said he cant use his faucets toilet bathtub and 
washing machine when flowers is watering 
when hes not irrigating we never have any problems 
lewerenz said 
but flowers says the irrigation is necessary to save his crops

at least until the end of july the defense department said in an 
announcement 
rear adm william m fogarty flew to the persian gulf on july 4

the air force is challenging a proposed fine 
of 102500 for alleged violations associated with a 1986 spill of 
radioactive powder at an ohio military base officials said monday 
the fine was proposed by the nuclear regulatory commission last 
month for what the agency said was willful failure to report the 
spill at wrightpatterson air force base near dayton within 24 
hours and for the internal exposure of an individual to the powder 
the air force denies that it violated any of the nrc 
regulations in the handling of this matter said the air force 
response to the nrc 
air force spokeswoman june green said the response cites 
disagreement among nrc workers themselves as to the true nature of 
the reporting requirement 
weve requested that the proposed penalty be reduced or 
remitted dropped said ms green 
the failure to report violation is responsible for 100000 
of the total proposed fine nrc officials have said it is the first 
time the agency has proposed a fine against a military organization 
no one was injured in the spill of americium241 but a 
radiological safety officer at the base said tests showed he 
inhaled a small quantity of the powder 
the nrc said the spill occurred on sept 18 1986 and was not 
reported to the nrc until sept 26 at which time it was described 
as leakage from lowlevel radioactive waste drums and not as a 
significant spill of americium

iraq looked warily at war foe irans 
acceptance monday of a un truce resolution its information 
minister said iran was agreeing for tactical reasons and not 
out of any desire for a real and just peace 
other states in the persian gulf also reacted cautiously to 
irans announcement which followed a string of iraqi battlefield 
victories tehrans only major arab ally syria praised the 
decision 
iraqis interviewed on the street in baghdad also were guarded in 
their reactions while expressing hope that the war now nearly 
eight years old will end 
in iraqs first official reaction to irans announcement it was 
accepting un security council resolution 598 information 
minister nassif ltayyif jassem was quoted as saying iraq had 
reservations 
the iranian general commands statement did not explain the 
reasons behind irans new stand in terms of a desire for a real and 
just peace but mentioned the circumstances and reasons for their 
latest position in terms of tactical reasons he said in 
statements reported by the official iraqi news agency 
jassem appeared to be referring to a portion of the statement 
which said the arrogant worlds a reference to the united 
states had sought to portray iraq as a peaceloving regime 
because of baghdads acceptance of the july 1987 un ceasefire 
resolution 
irans announcement in a letter to un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar changed its position of rejecting the 
resolution until iraq was blamed for starting the conflict in 
september 1980 
the official syrian arab news agency quoted an unidentified 
government spokesman as saying syria expresses its satisfaction 
and welcomes the wise decision of the iranian leadership 
in jordan foreign minister taher masri pointed out conflicting 
signals from iran 
he called the ceasefire decision a bit surprising because 
only a few days ago the majlis iranian parliament passed a 
resolution calling for top priority for the continuation of the war 
over all other issues 
saudi arabia and other gulf states did not issue immediate 
official comment 
whatever it is the iranian acceptance of the un 
resolution brings joy declared the semiofficial kuwait news 
agency 
the development also means that iran has chosen the wise 
alternative which calls for coexistence in peace with its 
neighbors the agency said 
people in kuwait the arab state closest to the battlefront 
wished each other mabrouk or congratulations after hearing 
the news 
in baghdad mohammed abdul kader a 52yearold taxi driver who 
has three sons at the front said i pray to god that the 
iranian statement is true and ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is 
serious about ending this tragic war 
we are both moslem nations and it is in our interest that this 
bloodletting be stopped 
khomeini is irans spiritual and revolutionary leader 
the reagan administration applauded irans acceptance of the 
un resolution but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
cautioned that ending the war is not going to occur overnight 
he refused to say what impact a successful truce might have on us 
military strategy in the gulf 
irans announcement caught the us navy in the gulf by 
surprise officers said they would take a wait and see position 
until us authorities verified it as official 
holy cats youve got to be kidding exclaimed an officer 
aboard the navys gulfbased command ship coronado when he was 
informed of the iranian announcement by telephone 
about 17 us warships now are in the gulf and about 10 more 
outside 
the us ambassador to bahrain sam h zakhem said its 
beautiful news its time for rejoicing 
britain welcomed the move and pledged full support for un 
efforts for a ceasefire the foreign office said 
the 23nation arab leagues ambassador to the united nations 
clovis maksoud also praised the move and said it was long overdue 
the representative of the palestine liberation organization in 
kuwait awni batash hailed irans decision as good news and 
called for directing both the iraqi and iranian forces against 
israel 
in jerusalem israeli foreign minister shimon peres expressed 
concern over the potential threat an idle iraqi army could pose to 
israel if the iraniraq war ends 
iraq has built a very large army the question is whether 
it will turn to rehabilitating its country or be tempted to 
recapture its standing in the arab world by attacking israel 
peres said on israel radio 
the soviet news agency tass reported briefly on the developments 
in the middle east without official comment 
the soviet union is among the european powers with a naval 
presence in the gulf others included britain france and italy

a union trying to organize downtown janitors said 
monday it is suspending its picketing of selected social events 
associated with the democratic convention in a truce arranged by 
party chairman paul kirk 
john sweeney president of the service employees international 
union announced the pause in its campaign after kirk 
telephoned him sunday night relaying a message that atlanta 
architect and developer john portman had expressed a new 
willingness to negotiate 
we do not have a settlement sweeney said but the service 
employees is taking a pause we will know soon whether portman will 
deliver on his promise to recognize the union and negotiate 
the union had focused on portmans peachtree center properties 
as its initial target in trying to unionize some 1500 janitors in 
56 downtown atlanta office buildings the center is where many of 
the private receptions associated with the convention are being 
held 
on sunday it picketed portmans atlanta apparel mart asking 
democrats not to attend a brunch inside for which the gannett co 
and usa today were hosts 
last friday the union picketed the marriott marquis hotel which 
is partly owned by portman prompting abctv to move its good 
morning america show this week to another hotel 
kirk and atlanta mayor andrew young had been acting as mediators 
between the two sides for more than a month trying to head off a 
visible confrontation that might disrupt the convention 
but both went ahead with plans to attend as special guests a 
dinner portman gave at his home sunday night for people who had 
contributed 100000 or more to the democratic party as an act 
of good faith sweeney said the union did not carry out its 
planned demonstration at portmans home

the reagan administration on monday 
applauded irans acceptance of a un resolution demanding a 
ceasefire in the war with iraq but took a waitandsee stand on 
whether to lower americas military profile in the persian gulf 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said us officials 
dont have a reading with any real definition on irans 
intentions and cautioned that ending an 8yearold war is not 
going to occur overnight 
officials also downplayed suggestions that irans action could 
be good news for americans held hostage in lebanon by proiranian 
forces we dont see any connection on that said state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley in washington fitzwater 
noted there have not been direct discussions recently between 
the us and iranian governments on the hostage issue 
fitzwater said that the us navys mistaken attack on an iran 
air a300 passenger jet with 290 people on board may have been a 
factor in irans decision in the sense that the united states 
subsequently reiterated its longterm security committment to the 
region during the un security council debate on the july 3 
disaster 
fitzwater briefing reporters while president reagan commenced a 
weeklong vacation at his mountaintop ranch near here refused to 
say directly what impact a successful ceasefire would have on us 
military strategy in the gulf 
but in terms of our escorting tankers and our recent 
deployment of military forces there he said we have always 
said that as hostilities end and as the war ends we were willing 
to consider a withdrawal 
fitzwater noted however that the united states has had a 
military presence in the gulf for some 40 years saying our 
policy has remained firm in that area and we would anticipate 
continuing that 
although fitzwater noted that un ambassador vernon walters 
confirmed irans acceptance of security council resolution 598 with 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar earlier monday the 
spokesman said well just have to wait and see how a cessation 
of hostilities can be brought about 
in washington mrs oakley was asked if the united states 
believed the iranian decision could have any bearing on the 
american hostages being held in lebanon we dont see any 
connection on that she replied i think that were looking at 
this breakthrough today as the first step toward ending the 
iraniraq war 
irans leaders conveyed tehrans embrace of the resolution to 
perez de cuellar in a message which said that country wanted an end 
to hostilities that took into account the interests of security 
on the basis of justice according to the official islamic 
republic news agency 
however iran also said that it will not withdraw its troops 
from its borders and called on iranians to prepare to thwart 
further iraqi attacks 
a key element of the un ceasefire resolution requires the 
warring parties to immediately adopt stop shooting and to withdraw 
to internationally recognized borders 
fitzwater said the us response to irans latest move depends 
upon what their definition is of accepting the resolution and 
said we have to look into tehrans intentions 
more than a million people have been lost in the protracted 
iraniraq war and the united states has been working behind the 
scenes to build pressure on iran to accept the un ceasefire 
resolution 
fitzwater emphasized that the issue is not really timing here 
the issue is making it happen so we will proceed slowly in the 
sense of trying to make sure its real and substantial and does 
indeed bring an end to the conflict there 
the spokesman said the united states is willing to be a party 
to anything that might help the peace process our performance and 
involvement will be measured against that ultimate objective 
bringing an end to the war 
and the un has the lead here fitzwater said 
in a formal statement delivered by fitzwater here and by mrs 
oakley in washington the administration said the united states 
welcomes irans formal acceptance of united nations security 
council resolution 598 as well as iraqs president saddam 
husseins reaffirmation yesterday of iraqs acceptance of the 
resolution 
this major breakthrough is an important first step toward the 
outcome that we and all members of the security council have sought 
for the last year the statement said it opens the way for an 
end to the 8yearold tragic war and restoration of stability in a 
troubled region of the world 
we call upon iran and iraq to cooperate urgently with united 
nations secretary general perez de cuellar and the security council 
to ensure the earliest possible implementation of resolution 598 in 
all its aspects 
fitzwater said that while there certainly is a lot that we 
dont know at this time one has to believe that the recent 
losses that iran has experienced at the hand of iraq has been a 
point theyve had to consider 
he also said that undoubtedly our presence in the gulf has 
been a factor and we certainly hope that it has been a factor 
moving both parties toward accepting the ceasefire resolution

the kremlin decreed monday that a region involved 
in a sometimes violent ethnic dispute will remain part of 
azerbaijan and activists in adjoining armenia said 200000 troops 
patrolled yerevan armenias capital 
the action is likely to cause more unrest among armenians who 
want the caucasus mountain region of nagornokarabakh made part of 
their republic because most of its people are ethnic armenians 
tass the official news agency said the 30plus members of the 
presidium of the supreme soviet reached a unanimous decision after 
a special session of about eight hours 
nagornokarabakh once was part of armenia but was assigned to 
azerbaijan in 1923 
mofsis gorgisyan an outspoken supporter of making 
nagornokarabakh part of armenia said in yerevan that the 
staterun media there had not reported the decision 
he said security forces patrolling the city of 11 million had 
grown to about 200000 over the previous 24 hours indicating 
authorities expected a strong reaction 
i knew earlier what the decision would be from the number of 
troops here i knew there would be no compromise gorgisyan told 
the associated press by telephone 
a woman who answered the telephone at the hotel yerevan on the 
central square said the armenian version of the national television 
news program vremya reported the presidium had met but said its 
decision would not be announced until tuesday night 
all is calm here because our people dont know anything 
said the clerk who would not give her name 
an announcer for the vremya broadcast received in moscow read 
the fourparagraph tass announcement early in the program 
the presidium of the supreme soviet of the ussr confirmed 
today that nagornokarabakh belongs to azerbaijan tass announced 
after the special session 
vremya is broadcast at 9 pm in all soviet time zones the 
presidium decision was announced shortly after 8 pm in moscow or 
9 pm in yerevan so the tass report may not have been available 
to the local television service in time for the nightly news in 
armenia 
the territorial legislature of nagornokarabakh voted july 12 
for transfer to armenia of the region which is an enclave in 
azerbaijan the azerbaijan leadership quickly rejected the 
decision setting the stage for mondays resolution of the deadlock 
by the executive body of the national parliament 
organizers of the annexation appeal have characterized the issue 
as a test of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and 
willingness to redress wrongs committed by past kremlin leaderships 
this is awful declared koryun nagapetyan an armenian 
artist who organized moscow demonstrations in support of 
annexation this will be the end of soviet power 
armenians account for at least three quarters of the 160000 
population of nagornokarabakh a region about the size of 
delaware the armenian population claims it has suffered neglect 
and discrimination at the hands of its azerbaijani government 
the presidiums decision gives the last official word to the 
dispute the body also made provision for measures that would 
ensure the regions real autonomy as well as unconditional 
fulfillment of a comprehensive program for its social economic and 
cultural development tass said 
gorbachev was among the national and republic officials who 
addressed the presidium gathering according to tass but few 
details of his speech were reported in the initial announcement 
tass said gorbachev characterized the issue as one of great 
political importance and said it was vital to deal with the 
annexation question calmly 
president andrei a gromyko opened the session with an appeal to 
residents of the troubled caucasus region to rise above emotion 
and let the issue be resolved within the framework of the soviet 
constitution 
that document guarantees citizens the right to 
selfdetermination but also allows individual republic leaderships 
to veto territorial decisions 
excerpts of speakers comments to the presidium were carried by 
tass like most highlevel party and government gatherings 
meetings of the presidium are closed to the press and public 
most of the presidium members quoted criticized strikes and 
demonstrations that have disrupted the regions economy since the 
nagornokarabakh issue came to the forefront early this year 
disturbances began in nagornokarabakh early this year and 
spread to yerevan in late february culminating in street 
demonstrations in which as many as a million of the republics 34 
million residents took part 
gorbachev appealed for calm feb 26 but after the strife 
tapered off in yerevan rioting broke out in the azerbaijani port of 
sumgait and 32 people were killed 26 of them armenians 
the communist partry decided to invest millions of rubles in 
improvements to housing schools and cultural offerings in the 
region to appease the armenian majority but the campaign for 
annexation grew 
the presidiums decision has repercussions for national groups 
throughout the soviet union that have shown signs of discontent 
with the central government including the baltic peoples and 
crimean tatars

intention of conveying messages of good will here in the country 
there appears to be no climate in the country for the release 
of mandela she told a news conference 
mandela leader of the outlawed african national congress has 
been in prison for 26 years he is serving a life term for sabotage 
and conspiracy to overthrow the whiterule government 
stoffel van der merwe the information minister said on 
staterun television monday night the government does not see its 
way clear to free mandela at this stage 
speaking in afrikaans the language of the white afrikaners who 
control the government he said the mandela case is reviewed 
regularly 
joseph n garba of nigeria head of the un special committee 
against apartheid said in new york how many more black south 
africans will serve undefined jail terms before the world 
stands up to proclaim that enough is enough 
celebrations protests and church services marking mandelas 
birthday monday were held over the past few days in countries 
around the world numerous foreign governments issued statements 
calling for the black leaders release

must ask for permission to see other inmates 
we have no explanation whatsoever why he is kept alone she 
said standing in front of a pile of 50000 birthday letters from 
foreign supporters and a 20foot poster of mandelas face 
mandela and his wife last week turned down a government offer of

the anc at its lusaka zambia headquarters sent a birthday message 
that mandelas youngest daughter zindzi read to the news 
conference in defiance of emergency restrictions 
his life symbolizes our peoples burning desire for freedom 
tambo said of mandela his imprisonment is the imprisonment of 
the whole south african nation 
the progovernment beeld an afrikaans newspaper said in an 
editorial monday that there would never be a better time to release 
mandela 
do we really want to imprint into our history that we let an 
old man die in jail while there was the opportunity to negotiate 
with him on the aspirations of his people the newspaper said 
most of south africas 26 million blacks regard mandela as the 
embodiemnt of black resistance to apartheid even though they have 
never seen him or heard him speak it is illegal to publish current 
pictures of him or quote his words

richards hometown of waco gave permission for quotes from her 
letter to be used in the monday night keynote speech at the 
democratic national convention but bill cryer ms richards press 
secretary said the permission was conditioned on anonymity 
she is like your neighbor she doesnt want a bunch of tv 
trucks out in her yard she doesnt want the publicity cryer 
said

from the leave it to beaver days of her youth she is an 
administrator at a mental retardation facility and her husband is a

jesse jackson on monday promised disciplined 
floor fights on the partys platform which he warned his 
delegates they may lose as he discussed the future after his 1988 
presidential campaign ends at this weeks democratic national 
convention 
only hours before the opening session of the convention jackson 
rallied his delegates with a stirring speech and some tough 
admonitions 
he also told them to gather again friday after the convention to 
plot their role in the fall campaign 
this is the first time since jamestown va that weve had 
the right to take to the floor any issue of our interest the 
first time the first time the first time in 400 years 
the preacher told more than 2000 delegates and supporters at his 
headquarters hotel 
we cant lose we came in a winner lets enhance our winning 
by discipline jackson added when the lights come on tonight 
our foreparents will be crying from their graves 
when jackson delegates are faced with media interviews on the 
convention floor they should follow my lead reflect my 
spirit attitude and discipline he said 
over and over again he led the delegates in a chant 
discipline details hope 
jackson mentioned democratic nomineetobe michael dukakis in 
positive tones but did not issue a rally cry for the fall 
instead he phrased it in terms of his supporters being part of the 
fall campaign and of the party at all levels 
jackson said his forces already had won major battles on the 
party platform that will come up for a vote during tuesdays 
convention session mentioning in particular its designation of 
south africa as a terrorist state 
but there is unfinished business he said mentioning budget 
planks and a plank calling for a no first use of nuclear 
weapons policy 
its not right to be in the seats on the floor tonight and not 
in the budget next january jackson told his delegates 
but he warned that they may and probably will lose to the 
dukakis forces who have the numbers to control the convention floor 
if you negotiate away your self respect you lose before you 
get to the floor we can afford to lose a vote we cannot afford to 
lose our selfrespect jackson said 
to those who ask where the fireworks will be between dukakis and 
jackson he said we did not come here for fireworks we came 
here for noble works 
jackson told a news conference of foreign reporters that he and 
dukakis did not discuss the platform at their monday morning 
meeting 
instead they dealt with their relationship some focus on our 
campaign for the fall and jacksons role in that campaign and 
some focus on the dnc he said referring to the democratic 
national committee 
jackson told his delegates and supporters that he wanted them 
all back in the room for a meeting friday the day after the 
convention ends to talk about where the movement goes and what 
they will do in the fall campaign 
the platform was one of four items he detailed as his agenda for 
the future beyond 1988 
a second apparently was a detail of his agreement with dukakis 
struck at the monday morning meeting 
when the democratic national committee meets on friday it 
will be more reflective of the new democratic party he said 
twentyfive atlarge members of the dnc will be appointed friday 
and apparently jackson supporters will receive some of those seats 
another part of jacksons future plans is a political action 
committee which he calls keep hope alive pac 
and the fourth point on his agenda was a statebystate effort 
to enact onsite electionday registration and wipe out closing the 
registration books 30 days before the voting 
in another hint of the future jackson said proudly we 
negotiated new rules for 1992 
at the news conference with foreign reporters jackson said he 
hoped irans announced acceptance of a cease fire in its war with 
iraq would be a positive sign to gain the opportunity of freeing 
the american hostages

an independent counsels conclusion that edwin 
meese iii probably broke a conflictofinterest law undermines the 
attorney generals claim the prosecutors report vindicated him 
sen carl levin dmich said monday 
the findings i believe are devastating to mr meese to his 
claim he has been ethical levin chairman of a senate 
subcommittee that investigated the attorney generals involvement 
in the wedtech scandal told reporters here 
how anyone other than ed meese could claim that this report 
vindicates him is beyond me levin said after independent counsel 
james c mckays 814page report of the 14month meese 
investigation was released in washington 
mckay concluded that the attorney general probably willfully 
filed a false income tax return that omitted mention of capital 
gains earnings on the sale of the meeses stock in baby bell 
companies created after the breakup of atampt 
the independent counsel also found that meese broke a federal 
ethics law by initiating a review of antitrust policy on the 
telecommunications industry while he and his wife ursula owned 
the telephone stock 
levin who was attending the democratic national convention 
said he wouldnt secondguess mckays decision not to prosecute 
meese even though the independent counsel concluded there was 
evidence of criminal wrongdoing 
noting he had fought too hard for the independent counsel 
law that was recently upheld by the supreme court levin said he 
wouldnt say anything to undermine the independence of the 
independent counsel 
his decision not to prosecute although he found evidence very 
damaging to mr meese is something within his jurisdiction and we 
accept it levin said 
i am satisfied there is insufficient evidence of wrongdoing to 
prosecute otherwise the independent counsel would have 
prosecuted the senator added 
mckay said he decided not to press criminal charges because 
there is no evidence that mr meese acted from motivation for 
personal gain there is no evidence that he acted out of 
selfinterest 
meese announced plans to resign the day mckay completed his 
investigation by filing the report with a special court 
the attorney general who had not read the report when he 
commented said he was vindicated because no criminal charges were 
brought against him 
levin one of meeses most outspoken critics on capitol hill 
said he would ask the office of government ethics to review mckays 
report to determine if the attorney general violated a presidential 
order to avoid any appearance of ethical conflicts 
although meese is leaving office at months end we need an 
office of government ethics judgment as to whether mr meeses 
activities actually constituted a violation of the executive order 
and other standards of ethics 
its important that standards be set for future attorneys 
general levin said 
such an investigation is needed because the administration has 
been lax in general on the standards it sets for ethics meese is 
but a part of that levin said 
president reagan has been too tolerant of the ethical lapses of 
officials in his administration expressing only regret when they 
resigned under a cloud or were convicted of criminal wrongdoing 
levin said 
there should be a sense of outrage on the part of the 
president they have betrayed levin said 
levins senate governmental affairs oversight subcommittee 
concluded that meeses intervention helped the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp get a lucrative defense contract meeses longtime 
friend e bob wallach was representing wedtech at the time 
mckays report supported that conclusion which meese and his 
lawyers have steadfastly disputed 
there is a direct conflict between what meese has been saying 
about his role in wedtech and what the independent counsel found 
today levin said

the transportation department on monday gave 
ryan air service once the largest commuter airline in alaska the 
goahead to resume operations pending another safety review by the 
federal aviation administration 
ryan air service which flew to 70 communities and was an 
important transportation link in western alaska was ordered 
grounded last january after the faa found numerous safety 
violations 
the airline filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws last 
february 
after the faa action the transportation department lifted 
ryans operating certificate citing its poor safety record as well 
as management and financial problems 
ryan air has had 12 crashes in the last eight years including 
nine accidents in the last three years a ryan air aircraft that 
crashed near homer alaska killing 18 people last november was 
believed to have been overloaded 
the transportation department said that a series of management 
changes including actions to separate the airlines daytoday 
operations from the ryan family as well as a restructuring of the 
companys finances led to the decision to restore the operating 
certificate 
the faa meanwhile said that it would not allow ryan to resume 
flights until the agency completes a further review of the 
airlines planned operations and compliance with safety 
regulations the review will include inspections of ryans ground 
facilities and a check of pilot records 
the department said its order restoring the airline its 
certificate to operate would not go into effect until the faa 
review is completed 
in its order the department noted that ryan air service which 
is based in anchorage has had a troubled compliance history 
marked by numerous accidents and violations of federal rules 
but the department said its concerns about ryans past 
management problems have been eased by recent actions taken by the 
airline including the selection of a trustee and new board of 
directors as well as changes in key personnel running the airline 
furthermore said the department arrangements for new lines of 
credit and a reduction in fleet size and operations indicate that 
the airline now has adequate financial resources to resume 
operations

a 15yearold girl attending her first national 
political convention announced monday she will seek a seat in the 
us senate in the year 2006 to represent a state that does not yet 
exist 
meta jones launched her campaign to represent the state of new 
columbia when and if the nations capital ever gets full voting 
representation in the senate 
ms jones said she has begun an 18year campaign because she has 
learned as the captain of her junior high school crosscountry 
track team that it doesnt matter if one runner is born with the 
gift of strength and speed it takes teamwork and endurance to 
accomplish anything 
the constitution requires senators to be at least 30 years old 
one reason i began my campaign was to call attention to the 
blatant injustice of taxation without representation this is 
definitely exhibited in the dc statehood case said the 
energetic ms jones who is running as a candidate of the dc 
statehood party 
she said she was enraged by recent house and senate votes 
supporting repeal of the requirement that city workers must live 
within the district of columbia 
two other issues that will be a focus for ms jones campaign 
are drugtrafficking and homelessness 
saying that part of the problem with drugtrafficking is 
idleness and ignorance ms jones suggests establishing teen 
centers throughout the district to serve as headquarters of a 
network that would get the message across to teens about the 
detrimental effect drugs have not just on the abusers but on the 
entire community 
the democratic platform calls for statehood for the district of 
columbia currently the district has just one nonvoting delegate 
to the house of representatives

independent counsel james mckay and attorney 
general edwin meese iii exchanged accusations across the same 
podium monday but neither said he would back up his allegations 
with action 
mckay repeated assertions in his 814report that meese committed 
three felonies and a misdemeanor but said he would not file charges 
meese appearing at a news conference minutes after mckay had 
left the same national press club hall said he was outraged 
and appalled at mckays report and would fire any justice 
department lawyer who filed such a document but meese declined to 
say whether he would attempt to seek any redress against mckay 
the conclusion of mckays 17 million investigation was 
bittersweet for the attorney general who has announced he will 
resign at the end of the month now that he believes he is 
vindicated 
he said the fact that mckay is not filing charges exonerates him 
and will allow him to ask the federal government to pay his legal 
fees which a lawyer said were approaching 250000 six months ago 
but the accusations from mckay violated all principles of 
fairness and decency meese said 
meeses chief laywer nathan lewin at at third press club news 
conference after the report was issued accused mckay of hit and 
run and said the accusations against meese were a cheap shot 
mckay said meese probably committed felonies in filing a false 
tax return that omitted some income before the return was amended 
and in dealing with two separate matters that might affect the 
telephone industry while holding onto stock in a telephone company 
he said meese also committed a misdemeanor in failing to file a tax 
return on time 
in addition mckay accused meese both in the report and at the 
news conference of insensitivity in dealings as a government 
official with his close friend e robert wallach 
but the prosecutor declined to respond to questions about 
whether meese should be disbarred or whether he was relieved that 
meese has submitted his resignation 
mckay defended the high cost of the investigation saying i 
didnt spend it personally i feel confident we have not wasted 
any government funds any of the taxpayers money 
asked how he would respond to a lawsuit from meese if one is 
filed he said ive been sued before 
but neither meese nor his lawyers said they would file a suit 
against mckay and lawyer lewin said that although he considered 
mckays actions unreasonable he said he would not call his actions 
unethical and thought he was an honorable man 
meese said he would not discuss any actions he might take 
im outraged at the tarnishing of our system of justice that 
has gone on this afternoon and with the filing of the report of the 
independent counsel meese said 
he said all of his actions had been taken legally ethically 
and properly and any implication by the independent counsel that i 
have in any way violated any law is absolutely false 
meese accused mckay of making the accusations in an attempt to 
justify what he said was a lengthy expensive and fruitless 
investigation

democrats broke a 25year streak of squabbling on 
monday by seating more than 4000 delegates and adopting major 
rules without dissent to open their nominating convention on a rare 
note of harmony 
thats the first sign of unity and unanimity in this party and 
were on the move democratic chairman paul kirk told the opening 
convention session as a parade of speakers congratulated delegates 
for not engaging in political fratricide 
each resolution each matter of business before us was 
adopted without dissenting vote said kathy vick chairwoman of 
the rules committee 
we had 24 disagreements and we resolved every one of those 
disagreements before we had a meeting credentials committee 
chairman leroy irvis said 
democrats always have disputes said rep pat schroeder 
dcolo a credentials cochairwomanthat says to me that while 
we had differences being democrats we knew in 1988 the important 
differences were between democrats and the continuation of the 
reagan proposals which we cannot stand 
negotiators for michael dukakis and jesse jackson reached 
agreement weeks ago to allow the convention to open in harmony 
the delegates also chose house speaker jim wright of texas to 
serve as convention chairman 
the rules and credentials committees ratified the deals last 
month and adoption by the full convention never was in doubt 
opposing campaigns have often carried their battles to the 
convention hall as they sought to disqualify each others delegate 
slates for one rules infraction or another 
there has been a challenge every time said jim carey staff 
director of the credentials committee which certifies who can cast 
votes as delegates on the floor of the convention this is the 
first time that there havent been any challenges in a quarter of a 
century 
dukakis came to the convention with enough delegates to win the 
nomination plus a 600delegate cushion that allowed him to give in 
to jackson demands for added representation in the indiana and 
kansas delegations 
however dukakis biggest concession to jackson was in allowing 
a rewrite of the partys delegate selection rules for 1992 to make 
the process more closely conform to the popular will expressed at 
the primaries and caucuses 
specifically the new rules will eliminate the directelection 
and bonus primaries which had the effect of awarding delegates 
on a winnertakemore basis 
essentially dukakis decided to abolish the rules that he used 
to great advantage in capturing the democratic presidential 
nomination 
those systems in states such as new jersey pennsylvania and 
massachusetts allowed dukakis to rack up wide delegate margins 
giving him the lead he needed to clinch the nomination on the last 
day of the primary season 
in the new jersey primary for example jackson received nearly 
onethird of the votes but got only 9 delegates while dukakis won 
100 delegates on his 64 percent showing at the polls 
another change for 1992 will be a dramatic reduction in the 
number of super delegates 
the 1988 convention set aside 643 seats for politicians or party 
leaders who became delegates automatically because of the offices 
they held four years from now that will be reduced to 394 
these super delegates are free to support whomever they like 
dukakis wound up with more than 10 times as many as jackson 
the makeup of the democratic national committee also will be 
affected by new rules although state parties are not required to 
comply with the new provisions each state complying with the new 
rule which calls for allocating dnc members in much the same way 
as national convention delegates would be rewarded with an 
additional member on the dnc

police wielded batons against 
hundreds of brickhurling rioters monday to clear the last major 
stronghold of squatters in the city once known for its vibrant 
counterculture of illegal dwellers 
the 300 riot police met fierce resistance when they appeared in 
their armored vans shortly after dawn monday to clear the 
conradstraat a complex of four former portside military warehouses 
that had been taken over by squatters three years ago 
scores of sympathetic antiestablishment demonstrators had 
massed in an adjacent vacant lot sunday night in anticipation of 
the previously announced eviction they set fire to hastily erected 
barricades and hurled mounds of brokenup paving stones when police 
arrived 
rioters drove back police repeatedly but were cleared from the 
area after more than two hours 
the fires spread to the fourstory brick buildings of the 
squatter complex 
at least five rioters were arrested for disorderly conduct and 
two policemen were injured according to police 
the police in helmets and carrying shields chased the 
demonstrators from the area rather than arresting most of them 
fireboats and firetrucks doused the fires heavy equipment later 
began demolishing the warehouses which will be replaced by 
lowincome housing 
the squatter communities were spawned by a housing shortage 
during the 1960s the police evictions have evolved into a mode of 
antiestablishment protest 
the rioters monday came from outside the conradstraat squatter 
community according to squatters 
conradstraat which has become wellknown in amsterdam for its 
artists studios and businesses had become a fixture in the 
portside community 
outside agitators were expelled from the conradstraat complex 
sunday night to prevent violence said one occupant a 27yearold 
sculptor who identified himself only as alex 
on monday most of the approximately 140 occupants who lived or 
worked in the conradstraat had abandoned the complex 
im not glad to leave said another occupant who identified 
herself only as annette 42 she said and her 7yearold twin 
daughters had lived in the complex for two years drawing welfare 
payments 
annette said she plans to find another place to live in isolated 
squatter houses still existing in amsterdam

a federal magistrate ordered on monday 
that the government unseal three search warrants and other 
documents in connection with its massive defense procurement 
investigation but allowed 10 days for an appeal of the decision 
the documents pertain to the governments investigation of a 
senior air force procurement officer and two private consultants 
all of whose homes were searched as part of the investigation into 
fraud in the defense industry 
us magistrate james kenkel directed that both the warrants 
used to search the three homes and the inventory of items taken by 
authorities be made public 
the very scope of this investigation has overriding and 
broad public interest the judge said suggesting that the public 
would be better served if news stories on the subject be based on 
the legal documents instead of rumor 
judge kenkel said the more sensitive affidavits used to support 
the request for the warrants could remain sealed another 45 days 
the request to unseal the documents were made in a petition 
filed by the washington post which argued that a month already had 
passed since the documents were put under seal and there has been 
considerable public interest in the investigation 
federal prosecutors heading the investigation argued however 
that disclosure of information contained in the documents would 
hinder their continuing investigations 
the documents including the inventory list of items taken by 
police would give a broad outline of what the government is 
looking for what the government has found and more important what 
the government doesnt have argued joseph j aronica assistant 
us attorney for the eastern district where the probe is centered 
he suggested that other targets of the investigation could use 
the information to fashion future testimony or to destroy documents 
but kenkel said he wasnt convinced by assertions by aronica 
that the federal investigation would be harmed suggesting that 
other targets of the probe likely already know that they might be 
implicated 
the documents ordered unsealed pertain to victor cohen deputy 
assistant secretary of the air force in charge of buying tactical 
command control and communications systems william sanda a 
defense industry consultant and richard seelmeyer the operator of 
an air charter service and former congressional staffer involved in 
defense appropriations 
aronica said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the 
decision which requires the unsealing of the search warrants and 
inventory documents within 10 days if no appeal is filed 
the washington post had sought immediate release of the 
affidavits as well barbara percival the newspapers attorney 
said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the verdict as 
it pertains to the affidavits

sen lloyd bentsen worked monday to win over 
delegates skeptical of him as a vice presidential candidate by 
playing down his differences with liberal michael dukakis and 
urging party unity for a victory in november 
the texas senator also took time out to join house speaker jim 
wright in sending to president reagan the bill requiring businesses 
to give workers advance notice of plant closings reagan has 
promised to veto it 
launching a minicampaign among state delegations at the 
democratic national convention bentsen was received warmly 
disappointment among jesse jacksons supporters over bentsens 
selection by dukakis may have eased after jackson dukakis and 
bentsen held a unity press conference 
were going to face a tough fight in november of 1988 
bentsen said standing alongside the two other party leaders but 
with this kind of unity and the motivational work of rev jackson 
and the leadership of michael dukakis im convinced were going 
to win a great victory in november 
bentsen received hearty applause from a caucus of hispanic 
democrats especially when he exhorted them in spanish to give it 
the gas 
bentsen told the group that he was born and reared on the rio 
grande and was committed to improving health care education and 
job opportunity for hispanics across the country 
hispanics a major voting bloc in states representing 71 percent 
of the votes to win the electoral college can make the 
difference and carry this for mike dukakis he said 
meanwhile bentsen spokesman jack devore vehemently denied that 
a mailgram sent to bentsens senate campaign supporters was an 
attempt to distance himself in that election from his ties to 
dukakis 
in the mailgram bentsen asked conservative texas supporter to 
back his senate reelection campaign regardless of your 
commitments in the presidential race 
he knew there would be misunderstanding about being on both 
these ballots devore said 
under texas law opponent rep beau boulter would automatically 
be elected if bentsen dropped out of the senate race devore said 
bentsen wants a special election to fill his seat if he is elected 
vice president 
asked whether the mailgram was an example of competing interests 
of the candidate devore said how is it in conflict absolutely 
not 
at an early morning meeting of the new jersey delegation 
bentsen was greeted by an ovation but also some jackson placards 
when he saw the ohio crowd afterward he received sustained 
applause 
i just left a meeting with gov dukakis and jesse jackson and 
we have put it all together he declared 
he also took a little ribbing from sen john glenn who clearly 
was his home states favorite for the numbertwo slot 
somehow the name bentsen didnt get spelled quite right on 
some of these bumper stickers said glenn holding up and giving 
to bentsen a dukakisglenn sticker he told bentsen he expected 
to see it attached to the texans car on capitol hill 
bentsen throughout the day repeated themes on which theres no 
disagreement between the dukakis and bentsen camps more money for 
infant care and education and the need for trade legislation and 
the plant closing bill 
bentsen joined with dukakis house speaker wright and senate 
majority leader robert byrd at a ceremony to send reagan the plant 
closing bill recently completed by congress 
the measure requires that companies with 100 or more workers 
give 60 days notice before closing a plant or laying off large 
numbers of workers 
it was originally a provision in the trade bill reagan vetoed 
earlier this year and the president said it was a key reason for 
his disapproval 
but congress then passed a separate plant closing bill by more 
than the twothirds majority of both houses that would be needed to 
override a presidential veto 
byrd and wright a fellow texan praised bentsen who as senate 
finance committee chairman shepherded the trade bill through the 
senate and was instrumental in the plant closing legislation 
bentsen said the republicans have really chosen themselves a 
loser on this one by opposing the bill 
it is the kind of bill we wont have to send to michael 
dukakis twice said byrd of west virginia 
senator byrd not only wont have to send bills like this to me 
twice im going to be proposing them dukakis promised 
dukakis praised the measure as not just a plant closing law 
but a job saving law 
this is opportunity at its best this is what the american 
success story is all about dukakis said

winstonsalem nc ap a man whose family had tried to have 
him committed was charged monday with murder for allegedly taking 
pot shots at motorists as he roamed his neighborhood killing four 
people and wounding five authorities said 
the 12minute spree ended late sunday after deputies returned 
the gunmans fire critically wounding him forsyth county sheriff 
preston oldham said the man was expected to survive he said 
two firstdegree murder warrants were issued for michael charles 
hayes 24 of clemmons and other charges were expected the 
sheriff said 
as to motive at this time we have no idea oldham said 
no one can answer that other than the suspect 
hayes stepfather garis edwards said family members tried to 
have him committed to a mental hospital satuday after he broke one 
of his hands beating a wall hospital workers who treated his 
injured hand declined to commit him edwards said and the 
sheriffs office said the commitment could wait until monday 
it seems to me monday was a little bit late edwards said 
the sheriffs office had no immediate comment on edwards statement 
hayes had been living at a small moped shop he operated 
officials said he was real paranoid one of the most paranoid 
people ive ever seen said a neighbor stan parks whose family 
huddled on the floor as two shots struck their house he was 
inferring like everybody was out to get him but no one here in the 
neighborhood had ever complained about him 
he added however that neighbors didnt consider hayes to be 
dangerous even though he frequently shot a gun in a large wooded 
field behind the shop he always treated me respectfully parks 
said 
an officer at the scene monday who would not give his name 
said the gunman took pot luck shooting at any car driving 
through the neighborhood three people were found dead in their 
cars near the shop and a fourth died at a hospital one of the 
victims was a 16yearold girl 
one of the wounded james g boyd said he and a friend were 
returning from a golf game when they stopped at an intersection 
he came right up to the passenger window with a rifle and shot 
pointblank i didnt have time to duck and it hit me in the right 
thigh said boyd who was treated at a local hospital and 
released 
he came up to the truck pretty quick boyd said in a 
telephone interview i guess we were at the wrong place at the 
wrong time 
police got their first call at 1132 pm sunday oldham said 
two patrol cars were hit by bullets when officers drove to the 
shop and deputies returned fire no deputies were injured 
deputies had responded to a disturbance call in the area 
saturday and had advised hayes family on involuntary commitment 
proceedings for mental institutions oldham said he refused to 
give details but said no charges were filed 
sheriffs officer lj vann declined to comment monday night on 
the stepfathers charge that the family had been told to wait until 
monday to commit hayes 
we cannot verify or deny those statements said vann adding 
that any further comment would have to come from department 
officials who were not immediately available 
bonnie morell a spokesman for the state division of mental 
health in raleigh said north carolina law allows anyone who 
believes a person is mentally ill and dangerous to petition a 
magistrate for involuntary commitment 
the magistrate can then order the person taken into custody for 
an evaluation ms morell said depending on the results of the 
initial evaluation the person is released or sent to an 
institution for a more extensive evaluation 
hayes wife was nine months pregnant and had left him within the 
last two weeks said a friend who only give his name as luther he 
and several other of hayes friends were outside the moped shop 
monday afternoon 
the last time i saw him was two weeks ago and he was on top of 
the world luther said 
oldham said investigators had been unable to interview hayes 
because of his injuries 
roger rollman a spokesman for north carolina baptist hospital 
said hayes was in critical condition monday with gunshot wounds to 
the groin leg and back 
one of the wounded was in critical condition with a neck wound 
one was in intensive care one was in satisfactory condition one 
was in stable condition and one was treated and released 
oldham identified the dead as thomas walter nicholson 24 of 
winstonsalem crystal susan cantrell 16 of winstonsalem 
melinda yvonne hayes 21 of lexington not related to the man who 
was charged and ronald lee hull 32 of winstonsalem

ruling by judge benito llanes to extradite samuel miara and alicia 
castillo de miara to argentina to face charges of falsifying public

flight delays which have forced thousands of 
tourists to camp out in airports eased monday but officials called 
for changes to combat an expected summer of congestion 
airport officials said the situation improved following the 
settlement last wednesday of a greek air traffic controllers 
strike and because only one out of three unions joined a french 
controllers strike 
about 1000 people on mediterraneanbound flights spent the 
night at londons gatwick airport sunday down from 4000 on the 
airports most crowded nights last week airport spokesman jennifer 
johnston said 
some flights are being delayed fifteen minutes some a couple 
of hours but there are only a handful of long delays its not 
looking too bad at all she said 
manchesters ringway airport in northern england where flights 
were delayed up to 48 hours last week was experiencing 10hour 
delays monday at glasgow airport scotlands main holiday airport 
12hour delays were reported 
although british airports normally experience long delays in 
july and august due to the large numbers of britons who travel to 
southern europe for vacations last weeks delays were made worse 
by the greek controllers strike 
robert mccrindle a lawmaker for the governng conservative 
party on sunday blamed the civil aviation authority for the 
delays and called for restrictions on night traffic to be lifted 
at gatwick the worlds busiest charter airport 
the director of the londonbased air transport users committee 
a consumer advocacy group monday echoed mccrindles call for night 
flights at gatwick 
the good of the many must override the interests of the few 
said richard botwood 
the chairman of the civil aviation authority christopher 
tugendhat denied charges of caa complacency and blamed last weeks 
problems on a lack of intereuropean cooperation 
if all air traffic controllers in europe and all air traffic 
control systems had been working with the same efficiency and 
dedication last week as ours have this position would not have 
arisen he said

the newborn found abandoned in a jetliner 
restroom will remain in county custody at least until friday a 
juvenile court commissioner ruled monday rejecting the fathers 
effort to obtain custody 
the parents of 5dayold alyssa frances locasto louis and 
christina locasto of new york city attended the closed hearing but 
declined to talk with reporters christina locasto 24 has pleaded 
innocent to a felony charge of child endangerment 
vicki yeley louis locastos lawyer said the couple decided 
over the weekend to remain together and that decision was one 
reason why juvenile court commissioner patricia bresee decided 
against placing the child in her fathers custody 
mr locasto is very much in love with his little daughter 
yeley said he is also very much in love with his wife the 
family has made a decision to stay together they are determined to 
remain united 
the commissioner asked both locastos and a courtappointed 
attorney representing the baby gerry hilliard to return to court 
friday after the san mateo county department of social services 
compiles a report on possible homes for alyssa 
until then the couple will be allowed to visit their infant 
daughter under the countys supervision 
mrs locasto is accused of delivering the baby in the bathroom 
of a san franciscobound united airlines jet shortly before takeoff 
from newark nj last week and leaving the child under the sink 
wrapped in a bloody towel 
she was released from custody after posting 50000 as bail if 
convicted she faces up to six years in prison 
the locastos who have been married since 1986 had planned to 
vacation in california with their other two children when the 
incident occurred 
the infant 8 pounds 9 ounces at birth will remain in a foster 
home until at least friday

mateo 15 miles south of san francisco where she was taken after a 
custodian found her on board the plane she is under the 
supervision of the san mateo county child protective services 
hilliard said alyssa appears to be a normal 5dayold 
suffering no ill effects from what occurred despite spending six 
hours in the restroom 
hilliard asked bresee to keep alyssa in the custody of the 
department of social services for the time being but said he was 
unsure what position he would take on friday when the report would 
be presented

vice president george bush drew 46 percent 
support to 45 percent for michael dukakis in a national public 
opinion poll taken on the eve of the democratic national 
convention abc news reported monday 
the abc survey of 458 registered voters showed no immediate help 
to massachusetts gov dukakis from his choice of sen lloyd bentsen 
of texas as his running mate most respondents were aware of the 
choice but were unfamiliar with bentsen 
the oneday poll conducted sunday had a smaller sample than most 
national surveys and thus a higher margin of error plus or minus 
five points other poll results this month have ranged from a dead 
heat to an 11point dukakis lead 
abc noted that it was bushs first numerical lead in the 
networks polls since september a usa todaycable news network 
survey july 610 had it 47 percent for bush and 44 percent for 
dukakis also a tie statistically 
almost threequarters in the abc poll said they did not know 
enough about bentsen to be able to give an opinion of him and 
nearly as many said his selection would have little impact on their 
vote 
it was the first national poll since bentsens selection two 
new polls in bentsens home state showed the ticket drawing even 
with bush there earlier dukakis alone trailed badly in most texas 
polls 
a strong majority in the abc poll 68 percent said they 
believed the democratic ticket would be helped by jesse jacksons 
enthusiastic support but another measure indicated that jacksons 
influence could be slight while 30 percent said they would be more 
likely to support a candidate he endorsed 27 percent said they 
would be less likely 
just 35 percent said they expected jackson to work 
enthusiastically for dukakis while 46 percent expected him to 
support the ticket reluctantly and 12 percent expected him to 
remain on the sidelines the poll however was completed before 
dukakis and jackson met monday and pledged cooperation 
respondents were split on what role jackson had earned as well 
as on what role he likely will play this year a third said he 
deserves to play a major role in determining the partys future 
direction this year a third said he deserved some role and 22 
percent chose only a small role 
in the presidential horse race the poll found dukakis losing 
ground with independents moving from a 4444 split last week to a 
3552 disadvantage 
it also said dukakis favorableunfavorable rating had moved 
slightly from 5923 last week to 5624 bushs unfavorable rating 
remained higher but improved a bit from 41 percent to 36 percent 
the poll also indicated a narrowing of the gender gap while 
dukakis still led bush among women it was by a 9 point gap half 
that of the abc poll earlier in july

ammunition which poses no threat to shipping

the un secretarygeneral held talks with 
iraqi and iranian diplomats on a ceasefire in the persian gulf war 
after iran announced its acceptance of a truce earlier monday in a 
surprise policy reversal 
irans announcement was widely seen as a breakthrough toward 
ending the war which has claimed an estimated 1 million lives 
since it began in september 1980 the tehran government battered 
by a series of recent military defeats said it will accept the 
un truce resolution without condition 
iran informed un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar of 
its decision in a letter from president ali khamenei late sunday 
night 
the letter cited the us downing of an iranian airliner with 
290 people aboard on july 3 as a major reason for irans sudden 
welcoming the un olive branch 
if im lucky i may have a ceasefire in a week to 10 days 
perez de cuellar told a news conference 
i intend to start my consultations to begin to set up a 
dday for the implementation for the resolution he said 
he announced he would begin discussions at once with the 
ambassadors from iran and iraq on the security council resolution 
598 which was adopted july 20 1987 the resolution demands an 
immediate ceasefire in the iraniraq war followed by a troop 
withdrawal 
it also calls for a prisoner exchange an impartial commission 
to determine responsibility for the conflict and a comprehensive 
peace plan 
the measure authorizes the secretarygeneral to set up an 
impartial body to determine which side started the war 
perez de cuellar later met separately with ambassadors mohammad 
jaafar mahallati or iran and ismat t kittani of iraq no word 
emerged as to results 
perez de cuellar said he would assemble a 10member team and 
another force of at least 250 un military observers to monitor 
the ceasefire and troop withdrawal he said he would send a second 
team to both countries at the end of the week to work on an early 
prisoner exchange 
the secretarygeneral called the us downing of the iranian 
airliner a catalyst in prompting irans decision 
iraqs information minister nassif l jassem said iran 
appeared to be accepting the resolution for tactical reasons 
and not out of any desire for a real and just peace 
khameneis letter citing the airliner downing said the war is 
engulfing innocent civilians 
in this context we have decided to officially declare that 
the islamic republic of iran because of the importance it 
attaches to saving the lives of human beings and the establishment 
of justice and regional and international peace and security 
accepts the un resolution it said 
the counselor of the iraqi un mission mudhafar a alamin 
told reporters the significance of it really is that its 
about time that iran realized there should be an end to the war 
with no victors and no vanquished 
iran should seize the opportunity and make peace 
britains un ambassador sir crispen tickell told reporters 
its far too soon to celebrate we made a step forward in that 
letter and i hope the secretarygeneral now will be able to advance 
to something that brings this horrible war to an end 
iraq had said earlier that it would accept the un resolution 
only if iran also did so but iran held back demanding that iraq 
be branded the aggressor as a condition to any peace settlement 
with its acceptance iran appears to have backed away from 
seeking the condemnation of iraq as the price for a ceasefire 
i dont see any conditions any preconditions in this 
letter perez de cuellar said 
the resolution is a peace plan he said and it covers all 
aspects it is fully implemented i think it means an end of the 
conflict 
the announcement came hours before the security council was to 
reconvene monday to discuss the us downing of the airliner iran 
was unable to collect enough votes to condemn washington and the 
council adjourned monday without a vote the security council was 
to discuss the issue tuesday 
perez de cuellar also noted that iraqi president saddam hussein 
said over the weekend that iraq would not retain iranian territory 
taken in the war 
he also said withdrawal of us and other warships from the 
persian gulf was not part of a peace plan and said he cannot order 
ships to withdraw 
but he said that with a ceasefire in place all countries will 
have to contribute to an atmosphere of detente 
asked if a troop withdrawal would take place in the near future 
perez de ceullar said we must first obtain that the parties 
accept an immediate ceasefire 
perez de cuellar said he was a little surprised by the 
timing of the iranian announcement but that he and un 
officials were impressed with iranian foreign minister aliakbar 
velayatis restraint in his meetings last week 
last week velayati addressed the security council and gave a 
detailed account of the airliner tragedy and called for the 
security council to condemn the us action 
vice president george bush defended us policy and said the 
plane was shot down in selfdefense because the crew thought it was 
an iranian f14 but he emphasized the need for peace and called on 
iran to accept resolution 598 and end the war which led to us 
presence in the gulf

deportation to the united states of juan ramon matta who was 
wanted in the united states on drug trafficking charges and for

administration agent enrique camarena 
the honduran constitution forbids the deportation of honduran 
nationals 
demonstrators burned the us consulate and us information 
service office in the capital to protest mattas deportation and 
the us military presence in honduras the violence prompted the 
government to temporarily impose a state of emergency restricting

the military chief of 
nicaraguas rebel movement col enrique bermudez was elected 
overwhelmingly monday to the political directorate of the exile 
nicaraguan resistance assembly 
he overcame criticism within the usbacked rebels known as 
contras that giving political power to a military man would taint 
the movements democratic image 
the 56yearold professional soldier a former colonel in the 
nicaraguan national guard under the late dictator anastasio somoza 
was elected to the sevenmember directorate by an overwhelmingly 
majority of 442 
three assembly members abstained and five were absent when the 
vote was taken on the second day of the assemblys threeday 
meeting in this caribbean capital 
bermudez was unopposed as an independent candidate and needed 
only a simple majority of 28 to secure a oneyear term on the 
miamibased political directorate 
to enthusiastic applause from assembly delegates bermudez 
pledged to unify the exile movement which has been fractured by 
internal feuding and has been struggling to stay financially afloat 
since the us congress halted military aid to the contras last 
february 
today more than ever i offer my spirit and goodwill to 
strengthen our movement bermudez said to our marxistlenist 
enemy we promise a hard battle 
under the assemblys laborious voting procedure assembly 
members are called one by one to cast secret ballots polling 
continued into the night for the other six directorate seats 
critics of the charismatic colonel said bermudez was bent on 
assuming both military and political control of the contras a 
charge he denied 
although all seven members of the directorate have equal power 
under assembly rules senior director adolfo calero was widely 
regarded as the movements de facto political head 
calero was elected to one of the seven postions later monday 
night over challenger fernando aguero rocha 3616 the remaining 
two delegates simply voted no against calero 
calero has said he will try to work with bermudez if it becomes 
necessary 
the five earlier directors of the assembly were made up of 
exiles representing political business and labor groups in 
nicaragua all sought reelection two seats on the directorate 
were vacant 
a former official of the assembly earlier monday said one 
possible compromise was that bermudez would keep his title as 
military commander and become a quasidefense minister for the 
traditionally allcivilian directorate representing only the 
interests of the military 
nicaragua now is ruled by a leftist sandinista government 
somoza the last of a family dynasty was overthrown in july 1979 
by the sandinista revolution 
a ceasefire has been observed in nicaragua since april with 
occasional violations 
pedro joaquin chamorro one of the two directors opposed to 
bermudez said talk of making him a defense minister was a mask 
for his attempt to take total control of the directorate 
i am concerned for the overall image of the movement 
chamorro said its a totally antidemocratic situation 
chamorro and calero tried to strip bermudez of his military 
command when he fired six regional commanders in nicaragua in april 
for lack of discipline they were outvoted by directors aristides 
sanchez alfredo cesar and azucena ferrey 
bermudez insisted he was trying to reorganize and unify the 
resistance movement denied any desire for personal power and said 
he sought only to give political voice to the guerrillas fighting 
in nicaragua 
sanchez the colonels closest ally on the directorate 
dismissed suggestions that it was incompatible for a movement 
seeking democracy in nicaragua to have a military man as its leader 
the said the 7yearold war against president daniel ortegas 
government is an armed struggle for democracy and he does not 
think bermudez would taint the resistance movements image the 
image is always good if the cause is legitimate he said

tashima issued a partial ruling from the bench after a hearing 
on a lawsuit against a new government law banning sexually oriented 
telephone messages the law bans both indecent and obscene messages 
the suit filed in june by sable communications of california 
challenges the law as being overly broad and vague harming free 
speech and failing to provide the least restrictive way to keep 
children from reaching such services 
sable communications an affiliate of new yorkbased carlin 
communications inc is one of the countrys largest dialaporn 
providers 
pending the outcome here and another lawsuit in new york the 
government had agreed to delay enforcing the law until july 25 
said robert chesnut an attorney for the department of justice the 
law was to take effect july 1 
sable attorney richard simon declined to comment after mondays 
hearing except to note that the first part of tashimas ruling was 
in his clients favor 
tashima said he would rule on the second part of sables 
challenge by the end of the week 
the law applies only to interstate dialaporn calls and those 
in the district of columbia 
the federal communications commission deems material 
indecent if it depicts or describes sexual or excretory organs 
or activities in a patently offensive way 
the commission applying a supreme court test considers 
material to be obscene if it depicts sexual acts in a patently 
offensive way appeals to the prurient interest of an average 
person and lacks serious literary artistic political or 
scientific value 
the challenged law does not distinguish between live and 
recorded phone communications it does not appear to apply to 
partyline services it provides for both criminal and civil 
prosecution and carries penalties of up to 100000 for each day of 
violation and imprisonment of up to six months 
dialaporn is estimated to produce about 54 million a year in 
revenue for providers and phone companies according to the 
information industry bulletin

the anglican church worldwide is 
under serious threat from an unholy conflict over women priests 
and bishops archbishop of canterbury robert runcie said monday 
runcie spiritual head of the church of england and leader of 
the worlds 70 million anglicans said a real threat to unity 
remains whether anglican bishops decide to support oppose or just 
evade the issue 
there are real and serious threats to our unity and communion 
and i do not underestimate them he told 525 anglican bishops 
from 164 countries in a keynote speech 
the bishops assembled in canterbury for the lambeth conference 
heard the speech on the first working day of their threeweek 
meeting in a specially converted gymnasium at the university of 
kent 
i hope it wont dominate this conference but we need to 
recognize that our unity is threatened over the ordination of women 
to the priesthood and episcopate in whatever we ultimately decide 
to do the archbishop said reading an 18page speech titled 
the nature of the unity we seek 
previous doctrinal struggles throughout church history had 
always been resolved however bitter the fight was runcie said 
and yet in and through such unholy conflict the church 
eventually and never without difficulty came to a common mind 
conflict can be destructive it can also be creative we are 
not here to avoid conflict but to redeem it at the heart of our 
faith is a cross and not as in some religions an eternal calm 
a minority of the 27 selfgoverning anglican churches including 
the 25 million us episcopalians canada new zealand and brazil 
have admitted women to the priesthood since 1977 
womens ordination overshadows the conference because the us 
episcopal church is preparing to appoint the first woman bishop and 
many bishops say they cannot accept that 
the conference held every 10 years has no legislative power 
among anglicans but as the senior consultative body it is highly 
influential 
the 1978 lambeth conference resolved that anglican churches 
should respect each others decisions effectively postponing a 
decision on women priests 
runcie said the message from the anglican communion at local 
level around the world was still strong and enthusiastic 
the anglican comunion was not about to dissolve he said 
recalling that he told the policymaking general synod of the 
church of england it is a little early to be taking the covers 
off the lifeboats and abandoning ship

the guardian liberal on dukakis 
it is extraordinarily hard to explain why michael dukakis has 
come so far so fast hes efficient and inoffensive to be sure 
but he comes in the new demography of american politics from 
entirely the wrong part of the country 
he has no broad appeal no wells of emotion to tap his 
evolving economic policies in many respects come straight out of 
the bush barrel the democratic unity hes put together huge 
stroke of luck stems mainly from the final primaries when it was 
him or jesse jackson 
now though he has to begin defining why america and not 
just the poor old democratic party needs change and that will 
be far harder to do because for the majority the good times 
continue to roll

lloyd bentsen is a moderate rather conservative senator he 
has a long and outstanding legislative trajectory his knowledge

selection george bush depends on the southern voters to reach 
victory in november and because of that bentsens contribution

the 40th democratic national convention opened 
monday as the first smokeless political convention in history it 
was also one of the few that began without a single fight over 
delegates or rules strictly not in the democratic tradition 
but there was from keynote speaker ann richards the kind of 
speech democrats love heroes and villains 
her villains ronald reagan who for eight straight years 
has pretended to us that he cannot hear our questions over the 
helicopter noise george bush who hasnt displayed the 
slightest interest in anything we care about 
and the heroes we want leaders like jesse jackson a 
leader and teacher who can open our hearts and our minds and stir 
our very souls and michael dukakis whose calm hides an 
impatience to unify this country and get on with the future 
the convention opened with cheers for defeated politicians a 
prolonged chant the first time jackson was mentioned a rousing 
cheer for geraldine ferraro the losing democratic vice 
presidential candidate in 1984 
and jimmy carter the president who came from this state was 
given a prime time slot to deliver his speech four years ago he 
was slipped in during the kiddiemovie tv hours when only hardcore 
political junkies were watching 
the convention was less than a half hour old getting routine 
business out of the way when jackson was mentioned 
jesse jesse jesse went the chant 
it happened when another black man speaker leroy irvis of the 
pennsylvania house of representatives told the convention that for 
the first time in a quarter century no credential fights preceded 
the convention 
i am proud to be a democrat he said i am proud because 
my party my democratic party recognized that women had the right 
to high office as well as men and we nominated a woman i am proud 
that the democratric party has seen the first serious contention by 
a black man 
said irvis one day there will be a democratic man or woman 
who will go to the white house and be president of the united 
states of america 
party chairman paul kirk announced that there would be no 
smoking in the hall so far has politics come from the smokefilled 
rooms that used to dominate the craft that there was not a single 
audible groan 
one of the early introductions was for dorothy bush the 
71yearold secretary of the democratic party who called the roll 
at conventions since 1944 
she was introduced as the grand old lady of the democratic 
party 
her first roll call at this her 12th convention gave the 56 
delegations a chance to cheer for their own states and to raise 
redwhiteand blue dukakis posters 
the american samoa delegation held up signs saying malofa 
and malo two ways of saying hello the women in the 
delegation wore puletasi two piece native dresses 
in the california delegation ed begley jr the goofy surgeon 
of televisions st elsewhere said he found his first convention a 
lot better than being on tv

michael dukakis declared monday he hoped the 
democratic national convention would provide a reflection of a 
party that has its act together 
dukakis was interviewed by television networks in his hotel less 
than a mile from the hall where the democrats opened their 
convention 
the presidential nomineetobe watched the opening on television 
and telephoned keynote speaker ann richards texas state treasurer 
to congratulate her on a great speech 
according to press secretary dayton duncan dukakis told mrs 
richards what am i going to say on thursday you said it all 
dukakis will deliver his acceptance speech on thursday 
he repeatedly emphasized his belief that the convention would 
showcase a united party 
weve got 4000 very happy delegates at this convention 
tonight he told nbc 
he acknowledged in an abc interview that when the fight for the 
nomination began he couldnt have predicted he would emerge the 
winner 
i dont think anyone who starts this long marathon knows he 
can cross the finish line in first place he said 
asked what sort of image he hoped the convention would project 
dukakis said strong united progressive fiscally responsible 
a reflection of a party that has its act together 
earlier in the day dukakis paid his respects to former 
president jimmy carter and also met with congressional leaders and 
promised the nation would have a president and congress that work 
together 
after a brief midafternoon appearance at the carter presidential 
center dukakis returned to his hotel to work on the speech he will 
deliver thursday night when he accepts the presidential nomination 
the massachusetts governor said he had no plans to appear at the 
convention hall prior to the final night 
after a meeting that lasted nearly three hours dukakis and 
rival jesse jackson emerged to deliver a strong signal that the 
party convention would reflect dukakiss goal of party unity 
dukakis said he wanted jackson to play a major role in this 
campaign jackson also talked unity and said he had no plans to 
challenge the selection of texas sen lloyd bentsen for the vice 
presidential nomination 
after his session with jackson dukakis joined house speaker jim 
wright of texas and senate majority leader robert c byrd of west 
virginia for a ceremony highlighting their support of legislation 
that would require companies to give workers and communities 60 
days notice before shutting down plants 
president reagan cited the plantclosing legislation as the 
principal reason he vetoed a trade bill last spring 
the democraticcontrolled congress now has separated the 
plantclosing bill from the trade legislation and passed it 
overwhelmingly 
dukakis joined wright and byrd for a conventionsite ceremony in 
which the congressional leaders signed the bill preparatory to 
sending it to the white house where reagan is considered likely to 
veto it again 
its the kind of bill we wont have to send to mike dukakis 
twice said byrd 
you not only will not have to be sending bills like this to me 
twice responded dukakis im going to be proposing them with 
you were going to have a president and congress that work 
together 
what youre seeing today is only a small sample of things to 
come he said 
at a luncheon at the carter center where the guests included 
many former democratic cabinet officials and presidential aides 
dukakis said my vocation is public service and i am proud of 
it 
he said if elected president he would bring a commitment to 
public service back to washington dc an attitude he contrasted 
with what he called the reagan administrations contempt for 
public service and public enterprise

texas treasurer ann richards in a highly 
personal keynote address told the democratic national convention 
on monday night that the reagan administration had turned americas 
working class into the forgotten class we can do better she 
said 
ms richards recounted a letter from a lorena texas mother of 
three who said her family income of 50000 a year makes life a 
constant fiscal challenge 
were the people you see every day in the grocery store ms 
richards said quoting from the unidentified womans letter we 
obey the laws pay our taxes and fly our flag on holidays 
we plod along trying to make it better for ourselves and our 
children and our parents we arent vocal anymore i think maybe 
were too tired the woman wrote i believe people like us have 
been forgotten in america 
ms richards said the woman was right 
of course you believe youre forgotten because you have been 
this republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of a 
puzzle that cant fit together theyve tried to put us in 
compartments and separate us from each other their political 
theory is divide and conquer she said 
no wonder we feel isolated confused we want answers and 
their response is that something is wrong with you ms richards 
added well nothings wrong with you that you cant fix in 
november 
when it comes right down to it this election is a contest 
between those who are satisfied with what they have and those who 
know we can do better she said thats what this election is 
all about 
using her trademark rapier wit she singled out vice president 
george bush the probable gop presidential nominee 
for eight straight years george bush hasnt displayed the 
slightest interest in anything we care about and now that he is 
after a job that he cant get appointed to hes like columbus 
discovering america hes found child care hes found education 
she said 
poor george he cant help it he was born with a silver foot 
in his mouth ms richards said 
she received a big laugh with her opening line when she chided 
bushs claim that he is a texan he claims a houston hotel suite as 
his legal residence 
i am delighted to be here with you this evening because after 
listening to george bush all these years i figured you needed to 
know what a real texas accent sounds like said the waco texas 
native who speaks with a sureenough texas drawl 
i want to announce to this nation that in a little more than 
100 days the 
reaganmeesedeavernofzigerpoindexternorthweinbergerwattgorsuchlavellest 
ockmanhaigborknoriegageoge bushera will be over she said to 
sustained applause from the democrats 
dukakis who watched the speech on television telephoned ms 
richards to congratulate her on a great speech 
according to press secretaqry dayton duncan dukakis told mrs 
richards what am i going to say on thursday you said it all 
dukakis will deliver his acceptance speech on thursday 
new york gov mario cuomo whose keynote address four years ago 
propelled him to national prominence also had high praise for ms 
richards effort 
i think it was like lighting a fuse for these democrats 
cuomo said from the nbc anchor booth where he watched the address 
theyre ready to go 
ms richards had high praise for michael dukakis to whom she is 
committed and for runnerup jesse jackson 
she said jackson can open our hearts and our minds and stir 
our very souls hes taught us that we are as good as our capacity 
for caring 
she touted dukakis as a man who knows that this country is on 
the edge of a great new era 
behind his calm theres an impatience to unify this country 
and get on with the future ms richards said 
and she praised texas sen lloyd bentsen dukakis designated 
running mate as someone who understands america from the barrio 
to the board room 
ms richards also carried through on her promise to note the 
importance of letting a woman make the keynote address she noted 
that former us rep barbara jordan another texan was the 
keynote speaker in 1976 
two women in 160 years is about par for the course but if you 
give us a chance we can perform after all ginger rogers did 
everything that fred astaire did she just did it backwards in high 
heels ms richards said 
ms richards a 54yearold divorced mother of four grown 
children spoke of being a grandmother and of wanting to tell her 
granddaughter lily how very lucky she is that for all our 
differences were still the greatest nation on this good earth 
i just hope like her grandparents and her great grandparents 
before that lily goes on to raise her kids with the promise that 
echoes in homes across america that we can do better

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said monday that americas refusal to pay its full share of un 
dues is crippling the efforts of the united nations 
earlier monday the world body learned that iran unconditionally 
accepted a security council resolution demanding a ceasefire in 
the persian gulf war and a negotiated settlement a step that the 
united states had urged upon tehran 
it was evident that the united states looks to the united 
nations for action on a very wide range of international matters 
perez de cuellar told reporters 
today they have one more reason for expecting assistance from 
the united nations for being grateful to the united nations for 
the way in which the un security council and the office of the 
secretarygeneral worked for the outcome of today 
last friday the secretarygeneral traveled to washington to 
meet president reagan vice president and republican presidential 
candidate george bush and other senior officials 
i did not receive assurances that the administration is 
prepared to return to full funding said perez de cuellar nor 
to send to the us congress the letter of determination required 
by the latter for the early release of 44 million which had been 
approved as part of the united states 1987 contribution 
the united nations assessed america dues of almost 215 million 
in 1988 onefourth of the world bodys regular budget which 
excludes special peacekeeping costs 
the reagan administration decided to pay only 144 million 
however and has so far released only 100 million 
under a us congressional budget amendment the administration 
must certify to congress its satisfaction with three key issues at 
the united nations for the remaining 44 million to be released 
the united states has been seeking a greater voice in the united 
nations budget process and a 15 percent cut in staffing at the 
united nations it also wants more soviet civil servants put on 
permanent rather than shortterm un contracts so they will be 
independent of moscows policies 
the president said that the us recognizes its obligations to 
the un but that further progress on reform at the united 
nations was necessary to meet the concerns of congress which the 
administration shares white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said friday 
perez de cuellar said monday this is a matter of considerable 
disappointment since the full and punctual payment of assessed 
contributions is a legal obligation under the charter and the 
uns financial crisis is caused largely by the united states 
underpayment is crippling the function of the organization as a 
whole 
americas unpaid bills to the united nations due to withheld 
funds and underpayment of assessed dues total almost 467 million 
accounting for the great majority of the united nations total cash 
shortfall of 647 million on june 30 according to the latest 
published budget document 
perez de cuellar has said the world body would be unable to meet 
its payroll and would have to shut down unless its financial crisis 
is overcome

jesse jackson said monday he will intensify his 
efforts to help free the american hostages held in lebanon in light 
of promising signals from the announcement of ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war 
ive been making overtures in the last month im going to 
intensify them now and renew an appeal to syria to help renew 
an appeal to lebanon renew an appeal to iran to try to get the 
american hostages returned jackson said in an abctv news 
interview from the omni arena where the democratic national 
convention is under way 
ive talked for example to several middle eastern 
ambassadors today jackson said later in a cbs news interview 
i shall reach out to lebanon and syria and to other people i know 
in the region 
hopefully we can seize this moment to make a breakthrough to 
make a very basic appeal to religious and political leaders to try 
to gain the freedom of us hostages held in lebanon he added 
jackson did not elaborate further on actions he was taking in 
the past he has said he was putting the word out through the 
contacts he has in the region 
at a news conference earlier in the day jackson had mentioned 
that iran announced its acceptance of a truce in te war and said 
he would hope that would be a positive sign to gain the 
opportunity of freeing the american hostages 
jackson has said that while he does not know where the hostages 
are he has contacts in the middle east who might be able to make 
such an appeal 
the hostages are believed to be held by radical lebanese groups 
who have links to iran 
irans announcement was widely seen as a breakthrough toward 
ending the war which has claimed an estimated 1 million lives 
since it began in september 1980 the tehran government battered 
by a series of recent military defeats said it will accept without 
condition the truce resolution developed by the united nations

asianamericans are better paid and better 
educated than american whites but a report by government civil 
rights experts is reluctant to declare an asian success story 
and insists that discrimination still exists 
presentation of the 289page study to the us commission on 
civil rights which had ordered it prompted concern over its 
impact one commissioner mary frances berry of the university of 
pennsylvania said it might lead to more discrimination when the 
public realizes how much more asians are earning 
six of the seven commissioners voted friday to hold off on 
adopting the document as an official government report until more 
outside experts can review and interpret it 
the study billed as the first comprehensive look at the incomes 
of nearly 4 million asianamerican residents shows that 
nativeborn american families with chinese ancestry earn 50 percent 
more than families in which both husband and wife are white and 
korean and japanese families earn 46 percent and 44 percent more 
respectively 
but some asianamerican ethnic groups are not faring so well

broke two tax laws and twice violated a criminal 
conflictofinterest statute but wont be charged with a crime 
independent counsel james mckay concluded in an 814page report 
unveiled to the public on monday 
meese reacted at a news conference by declaring he was outraged 
and appalled by mckays findings saying that if justice department 
lawyers had issued such a document theyd be fired 
in a report which concluded his 14month investigation mckay 
wrote that a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a 
reasonable doubt that mr meese violated a section of the 
internal revenue code by filing a materially false tax return 
mckay added that meese probably also violated a section of the 
internal revenue code for willfully failing to pay tax at the

former nazi officers and soldiers 
still get together regularly in west germany and government 
officials can do little to stop them 
officials say they check on such meetings only if they detect 
concrete signs of extremist rightwing tendencies 
gatherings of exnazis range from yearly reunions of former ss 
officers to meetings of regular army veterans many of whom once 
belonged to the nazi party 
other gatherings on formal occasions draw old battle comrades 
the funeral in duesseldorf for a former aide to adolf hitler 
for example drew about 100 exmembers of the nazis waffen ss the 
newspaper welt am sonntag reported 
many of the former ss men at the funeral july 8 wore the 
insignia of an ss veterans group and draped the casket of the 
former hitler aide richard schulzekossens with wreaths bearing 
tributes from several former ss units the newspaper said 
afterwards the former ss men now mainly in their 70s and 80s 
went out for coffee and talked about their health welt am sonntag 
said 
we dont approve of it but attending a funeral isnt 
illegal said interior ministry spokesman roland bachmeier 
such a gathering does not in fact pose much danger to 
society he added referring to the relatively small numbers of 
west germans involved with extreme rightwing organizations 
the total number of rightwing extremists is 25200 in this 
nation of 615 million people according to interior ministry 
statistics released in may 
while it is illegal in west germany to display nazi symbols and 
propaganda and known neonazi groups are banned war veterans 
groups are legal 
unless we have concrete proof that a veterans group is 
involved in illegal activities it is allowed to meet bachmeier 
said 
if we suspect that a group has rightwing extremist 
tendencies we keep a very close eye on it 
one of the most hotly protested reunions was one held by 
hundreds of waffen ss veterans in the bavarian alps town of 
nesselwang in may 1985 
the reunion held just before president reagans visit to a 
military cemetary in bitburg where 49 waffen ss members are buried 
drew protests from church groups labor union groups and angry 
citizens 
both the nesselwang gathering and the duesseldorf funeral 
according to welt am sonntag included members of a veterans 
organization with many former ss members known as hiag an acronym 
for mutual aid society 
the ss or schutzstaffel was an elite military guard of the 
nazi party the waffen ss was the fighting branch of the guard 
which also ran concentration camps and massacred civilians 
many west germans however say they are outraged that such 
meetings are allowed they maintain that nazi propaganda is spread 
at many if not all reunion meetings even if it is not done in a 
manner blatant enough to qualify as illegal 
they spread propaganda that glorifies the war and even many of 
hitlers goals said kurt faller spokesman for the 
communistoriented league of antifascists 
young people attend these meetings too and get the idea that 
what went on wasnt really so bad he said its a scandal that 
theyre allowed to meet 
however organized protests at reunion sites have led some 
veterans groups to act with more discretion in recent years 
faller said 
organized protests at reunion sites have led them to be more 
secretive about when and where they hold their meetings 
protesters have included outraged citizens roman catholic and 
protestant church groups labor unions and members of liberal 
political parties in addition to league of antifascists faller

marcus aurelius is flat on his back his noble horse 
riderless but the ancient roman emperor seems to be taking the 
indignity in stride as a good stoic philosopher should 
much more so than his caretaker of the last 7 years alessandra 
melucco who has directed the restoration of the 1800yearold 
gilded bronze statue since its removal in 1981 from the center of 
the campidoglio romes municipal square crowning the capitoline 
hill 
no pictures please of marcus lying down orders melucco 
marcus doesnt want to be seen that way 
that way finds the emperor atop a pair of planks his legs 
attached to pulleys and his mount a few yards away in a workroom 
of romes central restoration institute at san michele a former 
monastery across the tiber river from city hall 
by summers end the challenging restoration of rider and horse 
which have become a kind of symbol of romes eternalness 
should be complete 
but it looks as if the famous pair wont last much longer let 
alone an eternity if they reclaim their perch atop their marble 
pedestal designed by michelangelo in the heart of campidoglio 
square also the work of the renaissance master 
if worst fears come true the emperor who ruled from 161 to 181 
ad wont even be able to remount his horse 
the ages have taken their toll especially the 20th century 
with its corrosive automobile pollution and unsettling traffic 
vibrations 
deciding where the statue will wind up is like writing a 
prescription for a sick man who has had a heart attack says 
anna sommella director of archaeology for the capitoline museums 
which overlook the square 
he can decide to live for only a short time but be like 
everybody else and go outside or he can decide he wants to last as 
long as possible 
to last as long as possible she explained would mean shelter 
in a museum for marcus aurelius away from pollution and other 
disagreeable aspects of romes outdoors 
the city council will make the final decision after considering 
the opinion of the restoration institute and museum personnel 
sommella said 
while the question is officially still open the prescription 
seems all but written marcus aurelius and his steed believed to 
be cast in 176 ad appear destined for indoor life with a copy 
taking their place in the square 
the top contender for the statue is the senatorial palace 
another capitoline hill architectual treasure 
restorers began work in the spring of 1987 with lasers scalpels 
and brushes after three years of testing and a long pause for fund 
raising an insurance company paid more than half of the 825000 
cost 
melucco the restoration director says the operation has turned 
up several problems that weigh on the statues longevity 
for example in 1836 a thenillustrious group of rome 
archaeologists decided the statue was leaning and poured a mixture 
of metals into one of the horses legs to steady it 
instead it made it worse and we found the metals could not be 
removed melucco said 
three of the mounts legs touch ground but the fourth curves 
gracefully in the air historians believe that until at least the 
12th or 13th century that fourth leg rested upon another statue 
whose fate is unknown 
moving marcus around didnt help either pope paul iii ordered 
the monument moved to the campidoglio in 1538 from the area of the 
lateran palace which had been a papal residence 
technicians are now testing to see how much stress the horse can 
take to determine if marcus aurelius can eventually get back in the 
saddle 
legend has it that when the equestrian statues gilding 
disappears rome will cease to exist 
the gilding still shines on the faces of both rider and mount 
as well as around the imperial togas collar and horses saddle 
but melucco says that only specks of that gold is the original 
gilding 
other coats were put on over time sometimes just a dab here and 
there and the various ages of the gilding complicate the task of 
preservation 
tests also indicate that one out of every three days in rome is 
too humid for the monuments wellbeing varying daily temperatures 
also could shorten the statues longevity 
the delicate interaction of bronze and gold have posed a sofar 
unsolved challenge to concoct a coating to protect the 
masterpiece from outdoor fpollution after restoration 
even though we see no hope now to put it back melucco said 
we hope there will be the technology eventually and the will and 
the environmental conditions to put it back 
in the meantime she added perhaps seeing a copy instead of a 
masterpiece in the city square will serve as a reminder that our 
people havent met the needs of masterpieces assaulted by 
pollution

a thing so common as a match has become a 
coveted item in shanghai 
for more than a month now one cant find matches grumbled 
zhou dachang a retired economics professor 
its because the governments price reform program is sending 
prices up and people are hoarding things whose prices they think 
will go up 
one shanghai woman told the china daily the official newspaper 
that shed bought up enough matches to last 20 years 
the hoarding of everything from matches to fertilizer as prices 
and black marketeering increase dramatically has tormented shoppers 
as the growthminded communist leadership shakes up a price system 
unchanged for nearly four decades 
zhou said this past spring saw a run on cotton in shanghai 
chinas biggest city with 12 million people because of a false 
rumor that its price was going up 
match prices did go up however from 2 fen less than one us 
cent a box to 3 fen but the cost of wood rose faster and many 
small factories closed match production dropped and hoarding began 
since the communists took over in 1949 the state has set most 
prices often at subsidized artificially low levels after deng 
xiaoping took over as the senior leader in 1978 the government 
began to experiment with raising some prices and decontrolling 
others 
this year it accelerated the program sharply raising prices on 
a wide range of goods from matches to toothpaste to pork chinas 
favorite meat 
prices of decontrolled items such as freemarket fruits and 
vegetables also snowballed this year sometimes 20 to 30 percent 
bananas for example cost about 1 yuan 27 cents a pound in 
beijing up from about 080 yuan last fall 
leaders say the increases will stimulate production by 
increasing returns to farmers and factories as china dismantles 
its state planning mechanism they say prices must fluctuate with 
supply and demand in order to cue factories to increase or decrease 
output 
if it does not take the step of price reform china will not 
be able to reach developednation status by the middle of the next 
century leader deng recently admonished 
but the reform has created confusion and anger 
we are thankful to deng xiaoping for boosting salaries but 
remember mao tsetung for not raising prices goes a popular 
ditty 
food price increases have been the most unpopular statestore 
prices for pork eggs vegetables and sugar were raised 30 to 60 
percent in may and june in shanghai beijing and other large cities 
overall retail prices rose 11 percent nationwide in the first 
three months of the year and the secondquarter figure is likely 
to be higher in large cities the rate of increase has varied from 
13 to 19 percent this year 
more serious are market distortions and profiteering triggered 
by raising some prices and not others increases in raw material 
prices often outstrip those for finished products forcing 
factories to shift production or close 
sudden price changes have had an exaggerated impact farmers cut 
pig production last year because the price was too low creating a 
pork shortage the government raised the price and now signs point 
to a possible glut 
price gouging is widespread many private vendors have raised 
prices more than approved and pocketed the difference 
but many official prices are still too low highdemand items 
such as televisions often dont reach the stores because they sell 
out on the black market where prices more accurately reflect 
supply and demand the state sells scarce raw materials cheaply 
but often corrupt factory managers resell them at twice the price 
i earn two yuan 54 cents a day and have to use this to eat 
and buy clothes and raise two children its hard said a woman 
factory worker shopping for vegetables most urban chinese fare 
better the average income is 100 yuan 27 a month 
local governments have ordered employers to give their workers 
monthly subsidies of 10 yuan 270 to compensate for the food 
price increases but officials acknowledge that inflation could 
erode income gains 
the danger is that previously strong public support for dengs 
shift from a planned economy to an incentivedriven one also will 
erode endangering chinas goal of doubling production by the year 
2000 
nonetheless top officials appear determined 
we can only go forward we cannot retreat communist party 
chief zhao ziyang said recently 
foreign experts say that chinas price problems seem much less 
serious than those of many developing countries 
this country has lived in the luxury of not going 
anyplace said one western diplomat but now they want to go 
someplace and one of the things they have to live with is 
uncertainty and inflation

while east germany has a high standard of living 
compared with other soviet bloc countries the wait for a new car 
runs 11 years and communist leaders have been acknowledging 
shortages of consumer goods 
a growth spurt in the late 1960s and early 1970s made east 
germanys living standard no 1 in eastern europe now experts 
say czechoslovakia shares the top honors 
lines of 20 to 30 people are common to buy fresh fruit and 
vegetables in east berlin and such produce often is virtually 
impossible to find outside major cities 
getting a home telephone can be a major challenge in east 
germany just as it is in other parts of eastern europe the 
communist party sets guidelines for telephone installations which 
give preference to people of sociopolitical importance 
average east germans are quick to point out the tiers of 
privileged classes within their nation 
the party leadership has everything they want said a 
40yearold east berlin house painter who asked anonymity 
he worked in the homes of party leaders he said and they 
shop from the neckermann catalog west germanys leading mailorder 
house and have philips tv sets they even have their own hospital 
in east berlin 
more than 90 percent of all east german households have a 
washing machine and television but the demand for better quality 
products is growing 
despite a big housing construction program getting an apartment 
can take years for citizens forcing many young married couples to 
live with relatives 
but compared with other soviet bloc countries housing is one 
of many areas where east germans are relatively well off 
west berlins diw german institute for economic research said in 
a new study at 66 million the number of housing units in east 
germany is almost as high as the number of households 
the ratio is less favorable in other countries particularly 
in the soviet union where a large number of families still live in 
what is known as communual accommodations in which each family has 
a room to itself but has to share kitchen and bathroom diw adds 
new housing units average a relatively spacious 96 square yards 
in east germany 
slightly more than 40 percent of east german houses and 
apartments are in private hands with half of them occupied by the 
owners and the other half rented out at statecontrolled low rents 
the institute says the private owners receive the rent income 
east german workers lead the east bloc in monthly income the 
institute says meat consumtion is the highest in east germany 207 
pounds a year per capita the soviets are last with 133 pounds 
according to the latest figures available for 1984 
last years economic growth rate as measured in national 
income was 36 percent the lowest this decade and far short of 
the 45 percent goal 
heavy state subsidies help keep apartment rent and public 
transportation costs low thus allowing families to spend more 
money on household items 
east germany has been successful with a comprehensive preventive 
medicine program but there have been signs of discontent within 
the socialized medicine system 
east german sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
that anywhere from 2000 to 3000 of the nations 40000 physicians 
are seeking permission to emigrate to west germany 
the dissatisfaction caused in large part by low salaries 
provided by the state even sparked an appeal from east berlins 
lutheran bishop gottfried forck last spring appealing to their 
humanitarian responsibility he asked the doctors to stay 
the west german newsmagazine der spiegel recently reported 
many doctors are simply fed up with shortages sloppiness and 
corruption in the socialized medicine system above all in the 
provision of medicines 
east german communist party officials also have been 
acknowledging difficulties for consumers in guarded terms 
kurt hager a member of the ruling politburo told the communist 
party central committee in berlin for several types of products 
the need is currently greater than industry can produce 
hager said the shortages included clothing furniture radios 
and even cosmetic products 
like the soviet union east germany has an alcoholism problem 
societywide and of the first rank as friedhelm merrchel an 
expert with the lutheran church described it six percent of the 
adult population are alcoholics he said and alcohol plays a part 
in 70 percent of divorces

berlin ap east germany or more correctly the german 
democratic republic was formed on oct 7 1949 in the zone 
controlled by the soviets after the allies victory in world war ii 
beginning in 1952 the east germans constructed heavily 
fortified borders to halt the flow of millions of refugees to the 
west the berlin wall built in 1961 cut off the last major escape 
route 
here at a glance are some of the other facts about east germany 
population 166 million 
size 41610 square miles about the size of virginia

per capita income 8000 1984 
sources of income about 80 percent comes from industry 
including chemicals plastics cars and electronic products 
textile and steel the largest trading partners are the soviet 
union along with neighbors czechoslovakia and west germany the

editors note since her onewoman show without you im 
nothing opened offbroadway in march sandra bernhard has at 
last tasted the stardom she dreamed about as an insecure little 
girl in arizona critics praise her brilliant monologues of fantasy 
and pop cultural commentary nightlife columnists dog her thats 
just for openers

ive got to order says sandra bernhard 
yanking off her sunglasses i was just at a luncheon where they 
served some weird seafood thing she rolls her eyes im 
allergic to scallops 
at the back of the diner she parks her spindly 5 10 frame 
on a bench seat she juts an uncovered leg across it and orders 
iced tea to drown the effects of this steamy manhattan afternoon 
the waiter brings the tea and extra ice pronto hes not dealing 
with just another woman in a muscle shirt this is sandra the 
fearless sandra the raunchy sandra the only guest who can make 
david letterman blush 
her star has shot skyward during frequent appearances on late 
nite where shes convincingly feigned pregnancy and fought with 
a chimp brown eyes flashing and reddish hair radiating out like 
brain waves moussed together she stalks the host teases him with 
nasty innuendoes then works him over with industrialstrength lips 
yet at the eye of hurricane sandra theres an insecure 
starstruck little girl from arizona this part of her isnt 
noticeable right away 
growing up i was selfconscious about being skinny about my 
lips everything she says so she escaped to sandraland her 
fantasy world full of pretty stars and starlets dreamed up during 
and mixed with a typical babyboom upbringing its where her 
dreams and sense of humor feed on each other until she regurgitates 
them as art 
lately her travels through sandraland have taken her on the 
yellow brick road to success since her onewoman show without 
you im nothing opened offbroadway in march shes been a 
fixture in the new york press now nobodys billing her as david 
lettermans anything critics praise her brilliant monologues of 
fantasy and pop cultural commentary nightlife columnists dog her 
through downtown forays 
success has unfortunately led to severe interview burnout 
she refuses to talk about her early struggling days as a 
manicurist oh she pleads its old news if shes 
called a standup comic one more time shell spit venom you 
cant call my show standup comedy its somewhere between humorous 
theater and rock n roll 
hot and bothered bernhard heads back to sandraland a question 
about her favorite time period provides the catalyst the 
forties she says and her eyes flash there was a sense of 
glamour and excitement that i feel is lacking now a smile sticks 
on her face she sounds excited it wouldve been great to be 
friends with vivien leigh and bette davis and katharine hepburn 
bye sandra is there a number where we can reach you and 
marilyn i wouldve been a really good friend of marilyn monroe we 
couldve had a lot of laughs she couldve called me any time day 
or night and just talked 
i wouldve been aware of what her neuroses were how she was 
looking for something from men that she never got growing up and i 
wouldve made her be funny about it or been funny with her about 
it i wouldnt just say oh poor marilyn youre such a victim 
i would say kick his butt dump him 
real life in bernhards case began in flint mich 33 years 
ago my fathers a proctologist she says in her show my 
mothers an abstract artist thats how i view the world all 
true she spent her teen years in scottsdale ariz then after 
high school graduation in 1973 followed in her three older 
brothers footsteps to an israeli kibbutz where she worked for 
eight months 
i was scared to leave home but i wanted to get out of 
there says bernhard who never exactly fit into scottsdales 
suburban mold i had this weird kind of dichotomy of feeling 
really competent and at the same time feeling really scared of what 
people were thinking of me 
she demanded approval and got it by performing an addiction to 
the spotlight took hold early it was my second nature to be 
dramatic or funny or entertaining she says in school i was 
always sitting outside the door because id talk out of turn 
they should encourage kids to talk out of turn its the only 
time they make any sense

so what better way to make a living than by talking upon her 
return from israel she headed to los angeles to kick off her 
comedy career there she served time in a posh beverly hills salon 
as a manicurist it was weird she says kind of trashy why 
not 
she spent almost a decade on her feet in comedy clubs and 
gained a following at las comedy store in 1983 came the big 
break director martin scorsese cast her as a rich neurotic who was 
involved in the kidnapping of jerry lewis in the king of comedy 
i dont like comedy clubs says bernhard comedy is a very 
schlocky kind of outlet for performers the king of comedy 
took her away from all that and provided her with her first 
appearance with letterman an old friend from the comedy store 
eventually she put together without you im nothing backed 
by a band she sings rock n roll dims the lights and turns her 
flashlight on the audience reads an airplane menu from 
firstclass shares some of her favorite fantasies and winds it all 
up by shedding a mink coat and singing little red corvette in a 
bra and panties 
were going to film the show she says and intercut it 
with all these witnesses a la reds where people create this 
myth about me and my career 
she wants to cast among others mary tyler moore lily tomlin 
and madonna who told bernhard she loved being mentioned in the 
show bernhard shares a postnuclear fantasy where only the 
strongest have survived tina turner is with us of course and 
tattered madonna roams the streets alone people in the know like 
it when i talk about them says bernhard 
madonna liked it so much that she and bernhard have become 
friends these two and costarlet jennifer dirty dancing grey 
have become so palsy that michael musto nightlife columnist for 
the village voice dubbed them the witches of eastvillage 
delightfully so 
such associations bring sandraland closer and closer to reality 
and make bernhard a bonafide star at last 
fame is immortal says bernhard when people reach that 
level of success they have a certain immortality thats very 
appealing its a private club 
dont get her wrong though i make fun of celebrities when 
being famous is the only thing theyre about its not just about 
that with me i dont really belong in their world and theres 
only a select group of people there that i want to be a part of 
accompanying the stardom has to be another unique point of view and 
intelligence and style otherwise whats the exchange im 
fabulous youre fabulous 
if bernhard has only just consummated her relationship with the 
seductress called stardom then a veritable orgy awaits her this 
august harper and row will publish her story collection 
confessions of a pretty lady in the fall shell appear in 
nicholas roegs film track 29 as a libidinous nurse 
she also hopes to move her offbroadway show to los angeles 
where she can drive a car and indulge her fascination with 
ambulances in new york she says they just pass you on the 
street 
when i pass an intersection in los angeles and see flashing 
lights she writes in confessions the first thing i want 
to do is slow down to see if anyone was hurt 
will someone be lying there next to a disfigured warped 
motorcycle barely clinging to life bleeding praying lost in 
another world i want to see things that i would never want to have 
happen to anyone i love 
in la shell continue her live performances while rewriting 
her screenplay called it came from poland which she plans to 
star in as a cynical writer writing screenplays is a bit of a 
drag shes discovered ill stick to books essays short 
stories theyre more enjoyable 
one new york writer who said bernhard is merely obsessed with 
fame and fortune is taking a verbal beating in without you im 
nothing because of it true in sandraland shes always been a 
star but a star because the things i say are so unique and so 
inherently mine that nobody else could do what i do she 
explains and that is whats happening 
the idea of running into madonna after a nuclear holocaust is 
a pretty funny idea i dont think too many people have had that 
fantasy

thirtyfive years after an armistice 
ended the korean war tensions on the divided peninsula remain high 
and conditions for another war are still there 
the war of 195053 left both nations in devastation and more 
than 1 million soldiers and civilians dead or wounded the united 
states committed 57 million soldiers sailors and airmen to the 
korean war under the banner of the united nations and 33629 of 
them died in battle 
today hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops of both 
sides face each other along the 150mile demilitarized zone in 
virtually the same positions they held the day the armistice was 
signed july 27 1953 
prowestern south korea and communist north korea each insists 
it is the only legitimate government and both struggle now for 
supremacy on the 600mile peninsula 
reuniting korea is the goal of both governments but each calls 
the other puppets the south of the americans and the north of the 
soviets 
technically the north and the south are still at war while an 
armistice ended the fighting in 1953 no peace treaty has been 
signed the two nations have no ties the demilitarized zone which 
divides them at the 38th parallel is sealed and they have no links 
except for a single hotline 
the two sides have been engaged in frequent clashes since 1953 
but so far they have avoided another war few signs point to an 
end however to one of the worlds most dangerous power struggles 
president roh taewoo of south korea called on july 7 for an end 
to confrontation and the opening of peaceful ties he proposed 
trade political and cultural links to lead to eventual 
reunification 
we should be able to find a breakthrough toward a lasting 
peace and unification on the korean peninsula which is still 
fraught with the danger of war roh said 
north korea ridiculed rohs plan and said it was not worth 
considering the north also refused to even accept a letter from 
the south on july 15 calling for student exchange visits 
rohs proposals were similar to other iniatives by the south and 
there was little sign the new ones would lead to a breakthrough 
three rounds of talks between the two nations since 1971 on 
reducing tensions and building ties collapsed 
both want to reunite the peninsula but neither is willing to 
abandon its political system or renounce its claims to be the sole 
government of korea 
south korea achieved a major political and diplomatic victory 
over the north by becoming the site for the 1988 olympic games 
starting in september the south makes little secret of the fact 
that it sees the games as international recognition of its claim to 
be the true korean government 
the olympics will mark a critical turning point for seoul to 
achieve permanent superiority over pyongyang the official korean 
development institute of seoul said in a report pyongyang is north 
koreas capital 
north korea furious over seouls olympics accomplishment plans 
to boycott the games unless it can be the cohost olympic 
authorities have refused and the norths hopes of a major boycott 
by its communist allies collapsed when the soviet union and china 
entered the games 
the korean peninsula was divided by soviet and us forces that 
ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war ii efforts 
to reunite failed and rival governments were formed in 1948 the 
north invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean war 
in addition to the united states 15 other nations sent troops 
to help south korea during the war and today 42000 us troops 
remain in the country 
memories of the war haunt both nations and fuel mutual mistrust 
the korean war made unification an impossible task said 
choi janksok a south korean political analyst tensions between 
the two koreas have never been reduced 
south korean cities hold monthly air raid drills men serve in 
militias or civil defense units until they are 50 years old and 
army units on maneuvers are a common sight seoul is dotted with 
gun emplacements disguised as flower beds and fortifications ring 
the city which is within artillery range of north korea 
north korea has repeatedly attacked the south including a 1983 
bombing against former president chun doohwan and his cabinet that 
killed 16 people 
the north was implicated in the bombing nov 29 of a south 
korean airliner with the loss of all 115 people aboard as part of 
attempts to disrupt the olympics 
north korea is one of the most regimented police states in the 
world with the government controlling almost every aspect of life 
the country is virtually closed to foreigners 
its supreme leader 75yearold kim il sung has built up a huge 
personality cult that portrays him as a sort of marxist god people 
are drilled from childhood to revere him as the great leader 
kim who has been in power since 1945 started the korean war 
and observers say unification is impossible while he rules the 
north 
nothing has changed in the north and as a matter of fact the 
situation in the north is getting worse said professor rhee 
chongik of south koreas chongju university 
north korea with a population of just 20 million has the sixth 
largest army in the world with 800000 troops and as many as 5 
million in reserve it has a 3to1 lead in jets aircraft tanks 
and other weapons but much of its weaponry is old and one third of 
its planes are of korean war vintage according to western 
estimates 
north korea hobbled by bureaucracy also has seen its economy 
fall into chaos huge resources are swallowed up by the army life 
in the north is spartan and there are reports of food shortages 
the balance of power has changed in recent years as the souths 
soaring economy has turned it into a growing asian power the 
south with a population of 41 million has outstripped the north 
at almost every level 
seouls increasingly powerful military with 650000 men and 3 
million reserves has a technological lead that outweighs the 
norths numerical superiority analysts say south korean leaders 
say they will be able to do without us military aid by the late 
1990s 
the roh government which took office in february has pledged 
to end decades of authoritarian rule in the south and a major 
political liberalization has been the result the government says 
it is building a democratic system that will end south koreas 
internal divisions 
some political leaders intellectuals and others say the reforms 
must include a major effort to end the confrontation with the north 
as the united states deals with the soviet union we can deal 
with north korea with a careful and sincere attitude said 
opposition leader kim daejung 
reunification has been freely debated in the south as the 
government lifted controls that had made the subject taboo south 
koreans want reunification but not if it means communist rule 
peace advocates hope better relations between the superpowers 
can ease the confrontation 
it would be exceedingly difficult for north korea to resist 
the trend of the times and insist on keeping its doors hermetically 
sealed said analyst kim youngwon

editors note if delegates to the republican national 
convention want to blow off some nonpolitical steam theyll be in 
the right place steamy new orleans as practiced as any city in 
the land in diverting visitors from serious business at hand 
heres a lively preview of what theyll find 
</TEXT>

elephants they say never forget so it is 
presumed enough republicans will remember to show up on the right 
night for the george bush nominating rites 
but as another saying goes way down yonder in new orleans one 
never knows do one 
conventions in the big easy are notorious for record 
registrations and abysmal attendance the question being how do you 
keep em corralled for a quorum after theyve seen bourbon street 
delegate roundups were something of a problem at the 1964 
republican convention in san francisco another city notable for 
its varied lures 
now in the city that care forgot as new orleans fancies 
itself lifesized cutout posters and bawling barkers in the french 
quarter tout an erotic array of strippers french orgies women 
wrestlers a la mat mud or jello plus dixieland jazz blaring from 
the doorways as background music for the break dancers drawing 
crowds and coins in the street and remaining open long after the 
nights final gavel for the delectation of the delegates some of 
the sleaziest bars and best restaurants in the world 
care didnt entirely forget the city in the wake of the 
louisiana oil bust the hard times that fell upon the city gave its 
leaders a triple incentive to land a convention that means a 
sizable infusion of dollars into the local economy 
in view of new orleans diverse attractions maybe its just as 
well that the 90000 seats in the superdome are color coordinated 
in a unique camouflage that makes this enormous venue of three 
super bowls the sugar bowl basketballs final four a papal 
audience the saints and tulane football and every kind of circus 
and rodeo always seem filled 
actually the republicans will occupy less than half of the arena 
when the curtain rises or drops actually aug l5 on the start 
of their fourday national party convention 
it costs 30000 each time to hang the 1 million 9story high 
3ton blue curtain across the length of the football field to 
divide the superdome into a conventionsized hall seating about 
31000 
this figure does not include the tv and radio broadcasters 
looking down from the four super sky boxes and 46 private suites 
perched beneath the 10acre foam rubber roof nor the l000 print 
journalists with telephones and laptop word processors up on the 
70footlong 30foot high podium 
mondays opening session is presidents night when ronald 
reagan makes his emotional hail and farewell appeal for unity 
behind the new standard bearer then is seen no more at the 
convention 
its hard to outshine a president so like ike in 1960 he 
feels he should not hang around says convention manager bill 
phillips relaying the word from the white house 
phillips managing his first national convention and also the 
first ever held in new orleans sums up his job as anticipating 
what ifs 
what if a hurricane happens the convention meets at the height 
of the hurricane season on the gulf coast what if a major fire 
breaks out in the hotel district like the sixalarmer that 
devastated the historic cabildo next door to the st louis 
cathedral a few weeks ago 
what if sudden summer storms off lake pontchartrain flood the 
streets will the 2277 delegates and as many alternates wade 
through 
what if the heat and humidity outdo what is suffocatingly normal 
for new orleans in august 
even though most of the allocated 20000 hotel rooms are within 
walking distance of the superdome the organizers have lined up 
8000 rental cars and 200 airconditioned buses to hurry 
conventioneers out of the heat 
in addition to insuring that the sessions get under way in time 
for the 6 oclock evening news and close with time for analysis on 
the 11 oclock news and that the band doesnt play my old 
kentucky home when the delegate from tennessee approaches the 
microphone and seeing that vice president bush and whoever aspires 
to succeed him are properly showcased for tv by 1 million worth of 
new lighting effects phillips and his staff have a few other items 
on their work sheets 
such as finding 10000 volunteers to act as guides ushers 
interpreters messengers envelope stuffers and another healthy 
100 to blow up 100000 balloons 
organizers also have been advised by zeke segal who served as 
cbs bureau chief at a dozen of these quadrennial conclaves to lay 
their hands on as many toilet chains as can be found in support 
of press credentials 
press credentials are the numberone souvenir segal told an 
allday seminar devoted to convention planning people walk up 
and rip em off your neck it doesnt matter if youre dan rather 
or the kid who runs the coffee we found the only solution was to 
hang them on real toilet chains like you find in a hardware store 
as for don fowler his counterpart at the democratic convention 
in atlanta phillips worst what if nightmare conjures up the 
democratic convention of 1968 in chicago unlikely as any reprise 
seems in the 80s all our planning comes down to avoiding that 
scene phillips says

the ultramodern superdome which glows in the night at the edge 
of the historic district like a giant set of dentures disgorged in 
a mardi gras debauch loomed large in attracting the convention 
the site selection committee was equally impressed by the citys 
proven cool in handling huge crowds with what peggy wilson the 
only republican on the city council calls goodnatured aplomb 
this is not a demonstrating city people here tend to be 
laidback says assistant police superintendent ray holman who 
specializes in planning for special events like mardi gras the 
1984 worlds fair the popes visit last september and the 1981 
rolling stones concert that drew 87500 to the superdome 
demonstrators wont be penned up on the other side of canal 
street or out on the lakefront theyll have access to the 
delegates holman says divulging a game plan honed by his two 
decades of experience at crowd control frustrated demonstrators 
can become a mob well treat them with dignity and respect 
horse and foot patrols will prowl every alley and corridor 
of the crimepocked french quarter until 4 am and if theres 
any delegates still wandering around after that well see that 
they get back to their hotels 
while atlanta put its most modern foot forward rather than its 
antebellum past for the democrats overwhelmingly democratic new 
orleans flaunted to the site selection committee the rich and rowdy 
history that has made tourism the citys numberone industry 
for delegates at downtime jam sessions of aging dixieland 
musicians will evoke the storied past of storyville and the lacy 
wroughtiron balconies of the vieux carre the old quarter seem to 
whisper still the sensuous secrets of the creole culture that adds 
spice to the night life and the cuisine 
the tourist promenade along the downtown bend of the 
mississippi past the old banana wharfs and molasses sheds 
reverberates with the howling hiss of steam calliopes and the 
deepthroated bellow of steamboat whistles from paddlewheelers 
taking on sightseers behind the old jackson brewery which is 
enjoying a new life as a boutique mall the st charles trolley 
the nations longestrunning streetcar line sways along the 
crescent of the river out to the greek revival mansions of the 
garden district black funeral bands such as the olympia brass 
band stomping out the legacy of louis armstrong kid ory and 
jellyroll morton with swaying parasols and wailing clarinets greet 
the pope presidents and foreign dignitaries at the airport 
in new orleans nostalgia is a necessary nostrum its past is a 
placebo for the painful present since the louisiana oil bust 
times have been hard in the big easy the city has yet to recover 
from the 1986 summer of short cash when 1200 city employees 
lost their jobs and the rest went on a fourday week faced with a 
30 million budget deficit city hall shut its doors every friday 
new orleans sparkles from its 30 million worlds fair face 
lift but beyond the flowers blooming in the charming courtyards 
and along the neutral ground of streets arched with live oaks lurk 
chronic unemployment and economic decay in a city of 600000 
people more than 10000 houses are for sale 
new hotels tower above canal street but more department stores 
and luxury shops are being boarded up so at times tourists seem to 
encounter only other tourists along what is billed as the nations 
broadest boulevard 
river traffic is way down reflecting farm foreclosures in the 
grain belt as well as the collapse of upstream petrochemical 
plants there has been a promising upturn in port tonnage due to 
improved foreign trade but the state legislature also in a deep 
budget bind is threatening further cuts in municipal aid 
new orleans desperately wanted the gop convention with its 
estimated 138 million boost to the economy civic leaders wooed 
the ninemember site selection committee like the ravishing 
plantation belle in a frances parkinson keyes romance 
cajun chef paul prudhomme whipped up a 17course banquet for the 
search committee at the home of lawyer darryl berger local 
boosters somehow laid their hands on 18 tickets to a saintsredskin 
game so site selectors could attend with their spouses 
when the committee moved on to the other nine cities under final 
consideration they were pursued by 700 love letters from the 
business community and a barrage of lagniappe little reminder 
gifts like samples of louisiana hot sauce pralines gumbo and 
mardi gras king cakes 
oilman patrick taylor who spearheaded the painful and still 
unfinished job of prying 5 million from the merchants to offset 
the citys expenses in hosting the convention stressed the long 
term benefits to the local economy 
we got a chance to turn this city around and give it a 
boost he tells everyone he meets hat in hand therell be 
more corporate leaders and foreign bigwigs in town than at any 
other time in our history detroit got new factories and is still 
riding the wave of the 1980 gop convention if all goes well 
theres every hope well get the democrats in 92 
peggy wilson among other convention gogetters welcomes the 
exposure new orleans will receive from having the today show 
good morning america ted koppel and all the network anchors 
orginate from here 
thats not to mention the money thousands of media types will 
spend on rentals services drivers clerical help and postsession 
relaxation 
but for those who dream the opening gavel will signify instant 
economic recovery cbs veteran segal had a jolting wakeup call 
the days of the big expense accounts are over he 
regretfully informed the seminar dan rather and tom brokaw may 
be dining at antoines the rest will be sending out for pizzas

everybody knows that jackie robinson was the 
first black big league baseball player most everyone knows sandra 
day oconnor was the first woman to sit on the us supreme court 
but what does the name steve newman do for you 
well he was the first man to walk all alone around the world 
and there are many other individuals who did something first 
people who had their warholian 15 minutes of fame sometimes of a 
dubious nature sometimes revolutionary sometimes profoundly 
forgettable 
newman of bethel ohio took four years for his global stroll 
and he got more than 15 minutes of fame out of it 
andy warhol was wrong says newman who completed his trek 
in 1987 if i wanted to be boring i could live on this for the 
rest of my life it is not a 15minute thing he says he got a 
100000 advance for a book 
he also gets requests for three or four speeches a week at 
1000 a throw which he says is like being paid for being marco 
polo 
less of a saga is the achievement of fred muermann of chetek 
wis who very quietly grew a cornstalk 22 feet and 3 inches high 
said by the guinness book of world records to be the tallest ever

the first nun to become a mayor of an american city was sister 
carolyn farrell a sister of charity bvm she was elected to the 
city council in dubuque iowa in 1977 and became mayor in 1980 
she didnt mind the todo but the roman catholic church minded 
clerics seeking public office and she didnt run for reelection 
carolyn as most people call her says the name recognition she 
achieved helped her pursue her goals for social change 
basically im still an activist and a feminist says the 
52yearold nun who has been in the convent for 33 years 
this september she is going to the hubert humphrey institute of 
public policy at the university of minnesota for seminars on 
reflective leadership leadership in spirituality and ethics and 
women in leadership 
hightech biogenetic and space firsts cluster thickly in the 
past two or three decades but lowertech triumphs havent lost 
their allure 
the pilots of the voyager jeana yeager and dick rutan made 
history in 1986 when they flew around the world in the first 
nonstop flight without refueling dec 1423 the rigors of the 
preparation unfueled a romance between the pilots they parted as 
friends 
kanellos kannellopoulos very nearly recreated the myth of 
daedalus when the reallife greek a cycling champ flew farther 
than anyone else in a human powered plane last april 23 by 
pedaling the 72pound aircraft on a 74mile flight from crete to 
santorini and crashing into the sea just 10 yards offshore 
kanelloppoulos broke earlier records of 372 miles and 225 miles 
newmans ultra lowtech feat doggedly putting one foot in front 
of the other drew some appropriately primitive adventures 
he was attacked in morocco he says by a man with a scar 
running down the side of his face and one eyeball missing 
i hadnt seen the movie but i did a crocodile dundee i 
pulled out a bigger knife and he ran says newman bandits also

down to 19 cents a mile compared he notes to a spacecrafts

eva shain may agree that andy warhols sense of time was wrong 
back in 1977 she became the first woman to judge a world 
heavyweight championship fight muhammed ali vs ernie shavers 
shes still in the business although her expertise was not needed 
she was a judge at the 91second world heavyweight fight between 
mike tyson and michael spinks 
she says she still gets calls about her headlinemaking 1977 
appointment it was a surprise to her i thought i was doing the 
undercard it wasnt until i got there that i found out i was doing 
the championship fight

he would consider the stunt for the family 
powner recalls that his wife now deceased had second thoughts 
but they went ahead they were paid he remembers about 600 
actually there was only one bottle of whiskey we only had a 
few drinks but there were lots of books and we read a lot he

when they came out they went on to appear on television shows of 
the time who do you trust the dave garroway show the 
henry morgan show

editors note ever since its founding in 1949 east germanys 
communist leadership has marched to the tune piped in the kremlin 
when the melody changed with mikhail gorbachevs reforms the aging 
chieftains developed a political defense despite increasing 
pressures at home but their era may be ending

facing mounting dissent at home and pressure for 
reforms similar to the soviet unions the aging leadership of east 
germany is clinging to power as the nation nears its 40th birthday 
economic troubles have been aggravating chronic shortages of 
consumer goods while young people are demanding the freedoms they 
see on west german television broadcast over the border 
down with the berlin wall down with the berlin wall young 
east germans shouted in one recent protest east german police 
quickly moved in and broke up the demonstration of more than 5000 
people 
communist leader erich honecker the man who built that wall in 
1961 at the direction of communist party chief walter ulbricht 
turns 76 in august he and his septuagenarian deputies are holding 
onto the power some of them gained shortly after the country was 
formed in the soviet image in 1949 
in the soviet union the stalinist repression of those days has 
given way to mikhail gorbachevs crusade for perestroika and 
glasnost restructuring and openness and young east germans lately 
have taken to gathering near the wall with cries of gorby 
gorby 
but east germanys leadership has emphasized that it does not 
intend to change course 
honecker is a fossil and still shows the characteristics of 
his era says guenther buch of the allgerman institute the bonn 
governments research branch that keeps tabs on east german 
developments the old officials are clinging to their jobs 
the aging leaders in the nation of 166 million people include 
honecker a member of the ruling politburo since 1958 and head 
of the communist party since 1971 
premier willi stoph 73 a politburo member since 1953 
erich mielke the 80yearold head of the state police has 
been a central committee member for 38 years 
deputy premier alfred neumann is 78 and a politburo member 
since 1958 
in all 46 of the 160 members of the partys central committee 
have been there more than 20 years the party is officially known 
as the socialist unity party sed 
the sed isnt thinking of change but they are under 
pressure says buch certainly the honecker era is heading 
toward an end 
buch looks for a gradual handover of power shortly before the 
next communist party congress expected in 1991 the succession 
remains a matter of much speculation one name frequently mentioned 
is that of egon krenz the 51yearold politburo member who since 
1983 has been in charge of youth sports and security 
honecker himself has pledged to stick to the course east germany 
has followed for nearly two decades perestroika he said last 
june originated in the soviet unions internal needs they 
wanted to break open a certain incrustation of the economic life 
east germany he said intends to follow the proven way 
party leaders note that the country already has made some 
significant changes in the economic structure 
in the mid1960s the east germans introduced a new economic 
system that eased some central planning controls and allowed 
factories to make profits if they were reinvested in operations or 
redistributed to workers as bonuses after several years of growth 
that put it at the head of the soviet bloc however the economy 
showed signs of slowing in the late 1970s 
the german institute for economics research says last years 
economic growth rate of 36 percent measured in terms of national 
income fell significantly short of the target of 45 percent set 
by economic planners it was east germanys second lowest this 
decade 
a harsh winter last year and a drought this spring are hurting 
agriculture which employs about 980000 people 
shortage was the dominating feature in the economic area 
said the west berlinbased institute especially hardhit are 
consumer goods outside major cities 
public dissent threatened to boil over earlier this year when 
scores of east germans were arrested in crackdowns 
young people grouped under the protection of the lutheran church 
have been clamoring for more freedom especially the chance to 
travel abroad the may day parade on may 1 brought out an 
unprecedented number of security agents to prevent disturbances 
travel restrictions were eased temporarily 
after the june disturbances near the berlin wall east german 
security agents roughed up two west german television crews 
that prompted the west berlin morgenpost newspaper to suggest 
that the actions were a governmentorganized attack and not an 
onthespot decision the paper wondered whether erich honecker 
hasnt been overridden by comrades who see his course as being too 
soft 
while the speculation continues the lutheran church in east 
germany keeps up its pressure more than 80 percent of the 
population is lutheran and the church remains a vital force in this 
communist nation 
we have to start recognizing what is not right and then we 
have to go about starting to live in a new way the rev joachim 
gauck a lutheran leader in the northern region of mecklenburg 
told a church convention last june

a college coed allergic to peanuts dropped 
dead after eating chili at a restauarant unaware it contained the 
nuts 
a 57yearold man died after he was stung repeatedly while 
trying to trap a swarm of bees he was so allergic that one or two 
stings would have killed him 
a chronic alcoholic knew he was allergic to shellfish but ate 
crab salad in a latenight refrigerator raid he passed out and 
died before help arrived 
the deaths were due to anaphylaxis the most severe allergic 
reaction 
but underlying that none of the victims carried the stimulant 
epinephrine which counteracts anaphylaxis if injected immediately 
when symptoms start 
new studies indicate that many people prone to anaphylaxis dont 
carry epinephrine injection kits at all times even though it can 
save their lives and kits are easily available by prescription for 
5 to 30 
if you had an episode of anaphylaxis youre likely to have 
another said dr bruce wolf a nashville tenn allergist 
because this reaction can be fatal you need to have 
epinephrine 
anaphylaxis can kill by causing shock a heart and 
breathstopping sudden loss of blood pressure or by swelling 
victims throats so they suffocate 
epinephrine maintains blood pressure and decreases swelling it 
also fights less deadly symptoms including hives flushing 
itching headache runny nose asthma and shortness of breath 
sneezing anxiety uterine or stomach cramps nausea vomiting 
diarrhea abdominal bloating and fainting 
dr deborah birx an allergist at walter reed army medical 
center in washington dc suffered anaphylaxis aboard an airplane 
after eating kiwi fruit while flying to an allergists convention 
in california 
first my heart started racing then i felt lightheaded thats 
when i started feeling terrified then i had difficulty swallowing 
and felt that if i swallowed i wouldnt be able to breathe again 
flight attendants had epinephrine on board but it didnt fully 
stop her allergic reaction so the plane made an emergency landing 
in omaha neb where birxs reaction finally abated at a hospital 
each year anaphylaxis kills up to 50 americans stung by bees 
yellowjackets wasps hornets or fire ants about 1000 allergic to 
penicillin and another 1000 allergic to dyes injected during 
certain xray procedures said dr michael a kaliner chief of the 
allergic diseases section at the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases 
in addition dr john yunginger of the mayo clinic estimated 
anaphylaxis annually kills five to eight americans allergic to 
nuts shellfish eggs seeds and other foods although less than a 
dozen deaths have been documented 
other causes are food additives like sulfites allergy shots 
snake venom animal bites extreme doses of pollen blood products 
and drugs among those are antibiotics and heart medications 
vaccines vitamins hydrocortisone anesthetics and aspirin 
acetaminophen codeine and other painkillers 
nearly 200000 hospitalized patients a year suffer 
medicineinduced anaphylaxis and 50000 more are hospitalized 
because of reactions according to the american academy of allergy 
and immunology kaliner believes that is high 
he said the most common cause is exercise though no deaths are 
known 
kaliner estimated that one in 2500 to one in 10000 
anaphylactic episodes are fatal dr tim sullivan head of allergy 
and immunology at the university of texas southwestern medical 
center contended that those figures include mild allergic 
reactions he doesnt consider anaphylaxis sullivan said up to 10 
percent of people hospitalized with severe anaphylaxis die 
the anaphylaxis deaths of the coed and the alcoholic were among 
eight foodinduced deaths studied by yunginger and his colleagues 
in no case was epinephrine administered before or immediately 
after onset of symptoms they reported to the american academy of 
allergy and immunology the beesting victim also didnt carry 
epinephrine authorities said 
wolf and dr phil lieberman another tennessee allergist 
surveyed 89 allergic patients who had suffered anaphylaxis and 
found that among those who responded only 50 percent kept 
epinephrine with them despite being warned to do so patients 
either forget or ignore these admonitions 
patricia hutcheson and colleagues at st louis university 
medical center surveyed 76 patients with insectsting anaphylaxis 
who were treated with epinephrine in hospital emergency rooms 
we found that 82 percent had not received any advice on the 
avoidance of insects 71 percent had not received a prescription 
for an epinephrine kit and 44 percent did not receive advice to 
consult an allergist she wrote more effort must be made 
toward educating emergency room personnel about preventive 
measures 
kaliner said epinephrine kits should be carried by anyone who 
has had an anaphylactic episode but not by everyone with 
allergies they also should be carried by those prone to severe 
asthma attacks and those allergic to sulfites peanuts and 
shellfish said dr ronald simon an allergist at the university of 
california san diegos scripps clinic and research foundation 
kaliner said people who might need epinephrine should carry one 
kit and keep one each in the home car and office those whose 
throats swell during anaphylaxis should carry an epinephrine 
inhaler to avoid suffocating 
the simplest to use of the kits is the epipen a preloaded 
pushbutton syringe that looks like a fountain pen and costs 20 to 
30 the anakit 17 to 22 is a preloaded conventional syringe 
finally you can buy glass ampules of epinephrine for about 5 and 
load your own 20 to 50cent syringe 
epinephrine speeds the heart and can cause heart attack or 
failure or deadly abnormal heart rhythms in people with heart 
disease kaliner said these people should inject half the normal 
dose if they suffer anaphylaxis 
his advice to people prone to anaphylaxis is simple if 
symptoms begin take both an antihistamine preferably in quickly 
absorbed liquid form and epinephrine then get yourself to a 
hospital

learn about your allergies consult a boardcertified allergist 
and undergo appropriate tests then avoid whatever causes the 
allergies exercise insect stings medicines foods and dyes 
injected for certain xray procedures are the most common causes of 
severe allergic reactions 
avoid unproven allergy tests and treatments including 
cytotoxic testing urine injections and sublingual provocation 
and neutralization said dr michael kaliner of the national

aspirin the medicinecabinet marvel that eases 
pain lowers fevers and prevents heart attacks may also conquer a 
form of senility 
new research that is still unpublished and must be confirmed by 
larger studies suggests that aspirin can stop and even reverse 
the ravages of tiny blood clots inside the head 
dr john s meyer of baylor college of medicine in houston says 
hes seen apparent improvement over time when aspirin is given to 
elderly people who have suffered multiple small strokes 
these people have whats called multiinfarct dementia repeated 
disruptions in blood flow kill parts of their brains and they 
become confused and lose their memory and other intellectual 
faculties 
by far the biggest cause of dementia in the elderly is 
alzheimers disease it accounts for about 50 percent of the cases 
and theres no sign that aspirin helps that however about 30 
percent of elderly senility cases result from multiinfarct 
dementia or a combination of that and alzheimers 
in these people an aspirin a day seems to hold off the ravages 
of senility or even bring back lost mental assets says meyer who 
presented his evidence earlier this year at an american heart 
association stroke conference 
the public should be aware that dementia is not a hopeless 
disease he said 
in a test on 70 elderly patients half got an aspirin a day 
while the rest did not otherwise the two groups were identical 
after three years it was quite apparent that the 
aspirintreated group did significantly better said meyer we 
stopped the study for ethical reasons it wasnt fair to go on with 
it 
there were four times as many deaths in the untreated patients 
and significant differences in their mental conditions it is 
considered unethical to continue withholding from people a 
treatment that seems overwhelmingly advantageous 
meyer regularly administered iq tests as a way of judging the 
subjects mental fitness over the three years the scores of the 
aspirin group improved about 18 percent while those of the 
untreated people fell 5 percent 
tests also showed that blood flow inside the brain increased 
among aspirin patients but worsened in the others 
in general the aspirin seemed to stabilize the disease or even 
reverse it some elderly people became well enough that their 
spouses could care for them at home others were able to drive 
again or even go back to work 
meyer recommends that people have their relatives evaluated to 
see if their mental problems are caused by alzheimers or 
multiinfarct dementia and if strokes are the cause he believes 
they should be put on daily aspirin 
other doctors seem intrigued by the evidence of another use for 
aspirin 
if it prevents stroke that may be a clear reason for using 
it in people with multiinfarct dementia said dr thomas r 
price of the university of maryland 
most strokes occur when a blood clot sticks in one of the 
arteries that carries blood to the brain when its lifeline is cut 
off this way some of the brain dies aspirin works by making blood 
less likely to clot which seems to prevent the small strokes from 
occurring 
dr michael harrison of middlesex hospital in london said there 
may be a logical explanation for the improvement aspirin seems to 
cause the drug may stop pieces of clots from breaking away in the 
large arteries and getting stuck in the small blood vessels that 
feed the brain if so damaged brain tissue might heal if it isnt 
continually assaulted by new little strokes

william barklow has been eavesdropping 
on a 25millionyearold conversation nobody fully understands 
using modern techniques in an effort to solve the mystery of the 
loons 
we know very little about them said barklow a framingham 
state college biology professor who has spent more than 14 years 
studying the elusive member of the duck family we dont know how 
long they live we dont know how many there are theres a lot of 
unanswered questions 
barklow travels the northern new england woods from spring until 
winter recording the calls of male loons female loons are silent 
he theorizes that loons have a system of communication which 
includes the yodel and the laugh the latter a warning to 
flee from danger 
the recorded yodels believed to be signals of aggression are 
converted to voice prints to track and identify the loons which 
are difficult to catch and band since they spend virtually their 
whole lives on water 
in this way there is no intrusion if you band a loon you 
must catch it this way they are not disturbed barklow said 
adding that only a few naturalists use voice patterns to track 
animals 
since each male loons call is slightly different he can match 
the voice prints to make identifications one loon he tracked has 
been returning to a northern maine lake for 9 years after 
wintering in the atlantic ocean 
in addition to helping determine lifespan and numbers the voice 
patterns could give insights into behavior and the effects of 
chemical contamination he said they are very sensitive to human 
development in some cases theyve been chased by boats on lakes 
they really like to be left undisturbed 
the four species of loons range around the world in northern 
latitudes they are plentiful in the arctic but threatened in the 
southern edge of their habitat such as maine and central new 
hampshire said barklow who has tracked loons as far south as 
walden pond in massachusetts 
barklow has put out pleas from new england to alaska for 
recordings of yodels and is studying two baby loons in new 
hampshire to determine how the calls are learned all this takes 
a very long time he said 
meanwhile the reclusive loons have become quite a sensation 
barklow said theres something very haunting and ethereal about 
the calls 
an album of calls he recorded in the 1970s has sold nearly 
90000 copies calls also have been used in a production by the san 
francisco ballet the film on golden pond and an upcoming 
movie the far north by sam shepard

los angeles anaphylaxis a potentially deadly allergic

fatremoval surgery and the need for 
garments that cinch and shape new body contours has transformed an 
abandoned grocery store into a bustling factory in this rural 
minnesota town 
its not a fad said bonnie pina owner and 
secretarytreasurer of pina productions the largest employer in 
this western minnesota town of 152 its something theres a call 
for all the time 
the 15 jobs the plant has brought to this community hit hard by 
the farming crisis and most recently the drought have played an 
important role in the local economy 
the company also makes a variety of medical garments for people 
who have had abdominal surgery facelifts and other operations but 
its girdles used to compress and reshape bodies following 
liposuction a method by which fat cells are sucked from the body 
are the companys hottest seller pina said 
everybody was really excited when it opened and made 
comments about how good it was to see cars on the street again 
said linda wall the factorys manager and pinas sister it had 
gotten quiet here for a while 
unless the drought ends soon its probably going to be real 
important wall said 
pina who founded the carrollton texasbased company in 1984 
said she decided to open the plant in danvers because she grew up 
here and knew people in the area had a strong work ethic 
rural people are real stable and you dont have the turnover 
you have elsewhere she said in a telephone interview 
she said she purchased the 80yearold former grocery last 
spring for 3600 with the help of local loans and grants the 
company didnt show a profit last year because of the purchase and 
training costs but pina said she expects to see a very good 
return this year 
the walls of the oneroom sewing shop located in a 
weatherbeaten building on the towns main street are lined with 
spools of thread material and pictures of the minnesota twins 
baseball players 
pat ostby a pina productions employee since the danvers 
facility opened last summer hadnt worked outside her home for 26 
years but said she couldnt pass up the opportunity to work in her 
own backyard 
whats happened to our rural communities is were dying 
said ostby whose husband operates a nearby dairy farm to have 
something like this come along can really build us up again 
production for the garments peaks in the spring just before 
bikini season and just before the holidays in the fall pina 
said 
cosmetic surgery such as liposuction is on the upswing said 
pina because the babyboom generation is approaching 40 and 
starting to sag 
liposuction candidates typically are in the higher income 
bracket as the typical suction job runs anywhere from 1000 to 
more than 5000 
pina described the instrument used in liposuction as similar to 
a vacuum cleaner the compression garments are needed to reshape 
the body speed the healing process and control blood clotting she 
said 
society as a whole has become so vain about appearances 
pina said 
the compression garments which are applied immediately after 
surgery must be made with a great deal of precision because a seam 
in the wrong spot can leave a permanent mark in the patients skin 
pina said the garments made of spandexnylon generally are not 
taken off for six weeks 
use of a wrong garment or a faulty seam can mar someone for 
life she said the compression garment serves as a kind of 
second skin 
they need that constant pressure to put the fat cells and 
muscles back together again she said 
the most frequently used garment to tighten suctioned buttocks 
or thighs resembles a skintone longlegged girdle the socalled 
compression girdle has a 4inch elastic band at the waist and runs 
down to just above the knee versions are made for both men and 
women 
the company also produces wraps for other parts of the body 
including the rib cage chin neck and arms 
before compression garments became popular doctors wrapped 
patients in large bandages but they were not as effective pina 
said 
in addition to its danvers plant pina productions also employs 
eight in carrollton said pina who owns the company with her 
husband albert pina all of the research and development 
marketing and sales are conducted through the texas office but 
most of the sewing is done in minnesota 
the garments are turned over to wholesalers who sell them 
mainly to plastic surgery clinics and hospitals she said 
pina said she is considering expanding as soon as she is 
confident they can handle the increased workload 
our possibilities are endless she said

yen 
the dollars rise followed similar movement in overseas markets 
a bank of tokyo foreign exchange dealer said the us currency 
closed at 13545 yen in new york last friday 
fridays announcement that the us trade deficit rose slightly 
in may to 109 billion far less than the 12 billion expected by 
market players in tokyo boosted the us currency said the 
dealer who spoke on the condition he not be identified 
the market responded favorably to the news that the us trade 
balance moved in the direction of improvement the dealer said 
a finance ministry official told a private meeting of ministry 
officials and a japanese businessmens organization the present 
exchange movements reflect sustained improvement in the us trade 
balance and us economic growth and price stability 
its not necessary to worry about these levels as they are 
still within a range that represents stability the unidentified 
official was quoted as saying by a representative of the 
organization 
a bank of tokyo dealer said the 138 yenlevel would be the 
danger zone at which the bank of japan may intervene if the 
pace of the dollars rise is too quick 
traders said the central bank did not interfere in the market to 
support the yen 
the stock market weakened despite predictions by traders last 
week that export issues especially electricals could surge with a 
higher dollar 
generally there was little activity said hitomi sakano of 
nomura securities japans largest brokerage with the high 
dollar bond prices fell and investors stayed on the sidelines 
although there was limited trading in steels and electricals she 
said 
several banks including daiichi kangyo and sumitomo were 
suspended early in the session due to an excess of selling orders 
traders said that although the firmer dollar helped electricals 
and some other exporters the higher dollar also reignited fears of 
rising interest rates 
the whole thing was interestrate fear related and of course 
all the interest ratesensitive stocks took a beating one trader 
said 
volume in the first section was estimated at 11 billion shares 
down by nearly half from 20 billion shares friday

britains commercial banks heeding a signal from 
the bank of england on monday announced a halfpoint increase in 
their base lending rate to 105 percent 
the increase in the benchmark lending rate was the sixth 
halfpoint since early june when the rate stood at 75 percent 
the rate was last increased july 4 
the rate increases reflect the governments desire to curb 
inflation 
the bank of england signaled the rise by announcing it was 
raising its own money market rates 
midland bank plc barclays bank plc national westminster bank 
plc and lloyds bank plc responded by announcing increases in their 
rate 
corporate borrowers can obtain loans at 1 percentage point above 
the base rate 
the pound fell rather than rose on the latest increase 
because the market was disappointed that the central bank did not 
signal a full point increase in base rates dealers said 
the pound was trading at 16580 after the central banks 
signal down from 16620 just before 
britains annual rate rose to 46 percent in june from 42 
percent in the previous month the government reported thursday 
other recent british economic reports have indicated a rekindling 
of inflation 
the dollars recent rally and a simultaneous decline in the 
british pound have given the government room to increase interest 
rates to curb consumer spending without fear of pushing the pound 
up far enough to hurt british exports and corporate earnings 
the bank of england said the rise in rates represents a 
further tightening of monetary conditions but declined to specify 
what economic developments had triggered the move 
a treasury official who was not identified in accordance with 
british custom said this rise continues the process of tightening 
of policy that has taken place since the beginning of june since 
then he stressed base rates had risen by a full 3 points and so 
there has been significant tightening

july soybeans plunged more than 1 a bushel within minutes of 
the opening 
the national weather service had predicted a week of hot dry 
weather in the corn belt in its forecasts issued last week but 
todays private forecasts called for rain today and tuesday in the 
region followed by relatively cool temperatures through thursday 
i think people are sensing the drought pattern may be 
breaking up feltes said no one knows for certain but weve 
bought some important time for the 50 percent of the corn crop that 
has not yet pollinated and certainly for the soybeans which could 
approach yields that are above what the markets been trading 
prices on most grain and soybean contracts plunged their 
permissable limits at the opening but the contracts for july 
delivery on which limits have been removed pending their

as japans economic influence spreads around the 
world computers are tackling the job of translating japanese 
documents and spoken words into english and other languages 
translating can be an expensive and timeconsuming task for many 
japanese companies especially those whose products are primarily 
aimed at foreign markets 
one answer says fujitsu a major computer manufacturer is its 
computeraided translation system first marketed in 1984 and now 
being upgraded 
in every company piles of documents are just waiting to be 
translated shigeru sato a director at fujitsu laboratory said 
a need is felt to speed up information exchanges on a global 
basis 
sato said fujitsus 30000 automatic translation system or 
atlas can translate japanese documents into english about 30 
percent faster than average human translators 
we are hoping to increase the efficiency of translation up to 
50 percent in three years said hiroshi uchida a systems 
engineer for fujitsu 
if that improvement is achieved said john mackin a manager at 
fujitsus documentation department which uses the atlas system 
we can get rid of the bottom half of lowquality translators 
that will increase the quality of translation drastically while 
cutting costs 
sato said fujitsu also has developed a verbal translation system 
that translates spoken japanese into english and vice versa 
the system is a combination of atlas and a voice recognition 
system if the latter recognizes a sentence in japanese it 
converts the sentence into written japanese and sends it to the 
atlas which translates it to english and a voicing system reads 
the sentence in a synthetic voice 
sato acknowledged however that many difficulties lie ahead 
before a complete computer translation system is achieved 
the most difficult part was setting up a sufficient 
dictionary he said the dictionary requires not only word by 
word translation but also syntax semantics and context 
translation he said 
for example he said the dictionary has to be able to 
differentiate such sentences as i saw a bird with a telescope 
and i saw a bird with a ring 
the two may have the same grammatical structure but a 
different usage sato said 
structural differences between japanese and english also pose a 
variety of problems sato said 
in japanese he said sentences seldom have a subject and 
still can be understood however english sentences must have a 
subject 
also japanese sentences are often vague about singularity and 
plurality of nouns which must be stated clearly in english he 
said 
the atlas system at this stage of development does not help 
reduce the number of translators companies need because it takes 
highly trained translators to use atlas correctly said mackin 
under the guidance and sponsorship of the ministry of 
international trade and industry eight japanese computer 
manufacturers including fujitsu ltd nec corp hitachi ltd and 
toshiba corp are jointly developing a complete dictionary system 
that contains 200000 words in both japanese and english plus 
100000 special words 
the ministry is investing 105 billion in the sixyear project 
sato said 
fujitsus sato said his company is the worlds leader in 
computeraided translation and the only prospective rival at this 
point would be hitachi 
he said fujitsu has delivered to japanese customers about 100 
units of its atlas system while hitachi toshiba and nec have sold 
only 10 units altogether 
he also said us and european companies are behind fujitsu in 
this field because of less demand for japaneseenglish translation 
of documents and instruction manuals in the united states and 
europe

in a twist on the bellevue stratford hotels 
1954 motto old in grace new in face the current owners of 
the historic building say they are going for new in grace old in 
face when the grand dame of broad street reopens later this year 
richard rubin amp co bought the bellevue in 1978 for 85 million 
and is spending 100 million to convert the famous hotel into a 
multipleuse building housing a luxury hotel offices restaurants 
shops and a sports club 
since last july construction workers have gutted much of the 
interior in an effort to restore the grace and opulence of the 
84yearold structure 
restoring the tattered reputation of the bellevue may be more 
difficult the hotel became linked to legionnaires disease after 
hosting an american legion convention in 1976 and officials have 
been trying to shake the indignity ever since 
four months after that july convention 150 people fell ill and 
29 people died from the mysterious ailment the hotel was closed 
since then two different management companies have tried and 
failed to revive the hotel which closed again in 1986 
rubin company officials and the hotels new management cunard 
hotels amp resorts hope that changing the hotel into a multipleuse 
building will also change the bellevues fortunes 
rubin corporate director of marketing judy morse said that the 
real estate company decided to combine the hotel with a list of 
renters that will include ralph laurenpolo the sporting club and 
lewis gilman amp kynett a philadelphia advertising agency morse 
said 70 percent of the building has been leased 
only the 12th through 19th floors will be occupied by the hotel 
floors 2 through 11 will be offices and the remaining space will 
be devoted to shops and restaurants 
guests will pay 170 a night for one of 170 rooms in the new 
hotel atop the bellevue the rooms include a television vcr 
and a telephone with two lines in the bedroom and a minitv and a 
second telephone in the bathroom 
hotel manager michael duffell said he hopes to reach a 75 
percent occupancy rate which will present a friendly personable 
yet exclusive atmosphere for the guests 
duffell has 31 years of experience to draw on which include 
managing the ritz hotel in london and controller of the royal 
palaces of king hussein of jordan 
while the bellevue may have new tenants one former employee 
said the hotel will retain its sense of history and tradition john 
t ryan who has worked at the hotel since 1952 and was catering 
services manager when the bellevue closed two years ago said the 
hotel is part of the citys social life 
everyone who was of importance came to the bellevue over the 
years ryan said families presidents from teddy roosevelt to 
ronald reagan and celebrities came to the bellevue for bar 
mitzvahs weddings proms national political party conventions 
society balls and union meetings 
mark twain and jp morgan stayed and harry s truman got word 
of his nomination by the democrats in the hunt room off the right 
corner of the lobby 
the hotel is not a hotel ryan said its a historic 
institution 
the bellevue hotel with more than 1000 guest rooms was built 
in 1904 at a cost of 8 million by george c boldt a prussian 
immigrant who entered the hotel business in 1881 boldt was hired 
by the astor family to run the waldorf astoria in new york in 1898 
four years later he decided to open a hotel in philadelphia 
boldt had his hotel designed in french renaissance style thomas 
edison designed the lighting fixtures suites were decorated in 
colonial french italian and greek furnishings to suit the taste 
of each guest as boldt wanted his hotel to be the most 
magnificant in the united states if not the world no matter what 
the cost 
on opening day the hotels 700 employees and 50 cooks served 
4200 meals and poured 7000 drinks 
decades later when the hotel hosted the american legion 
convention manager william chadwick predicted the hotel would 
never recover this story could mutilate the good name of the 
bellevue stratford he said 
the hotels occupancy rate dropped to 3 percent former 
phildelphia mayor frank rizzo even suggested razing the bellevue 
and building a new hotel one not contaminated by scandal but 
after a twoyear worldwide search a new owner rubin was 
found to buy the building 
today rubin and cunard officials remain touchy about the 
hotels association with legionnaires disease they point out that 
since the virulent 1976 outbreak in philadelphia the disease has 
been found all over the country and in northern europe as well 
the developers believe the buildings transformation will help 
put the issue to rest once and for all ms morse said she has 
turned away several requests for retail and office space hotel 
manager duffell expects the academy of musics annual ball to 
return to the bellevue as the hotels first event after reopening 
in december 
and jan l pollard sales and marketing director for the new 
hotel said she has received a letter requesting room for a new 
years eve party in 1999 
charles licata of voorhees nj told ms pollard that he met 
and married his wife at the bellevue in addition theyve sailed 
on the cunard companys luxury liners which include the queen 
elizabeth 2 
so naturally when planning to usher in the new millenium he 
thought of the bellevue 
i was always taught to plan in advance he wrote

during the deregulated financial orgy of 
the early 1980s that left many texas banks in ruins executives at 
the conservative laredo national bank turned their backs on the 
binge 
in a manner unfashionable at the time the bank remained 
cautious and planned for longterm growth 
now with more than 1 billion in assets it is the largest 
independent bank in the state operating in a border community 
where 13 percent of the people are out of work 
here amidst all of the problems that texas is having here is 
a bank doing well on the mexican border observed alex 
sheshunoff president of an austinbased consulting firm that bears 
his name 
laredo is equidistant about 150 miles from san antonio 
texas to the north the industrial center of monterrey nuevo 
leon mexico to the south and the deepwater port of corpus 
christi texas to the east 
max mandel chairman of the institution founded in 1892 credits 
the banks success to a simple formula we felt we wanted to 
stick to our knitting he said we wanted to stick to things 
that we knew local real estate importexport loans and 
lowrisk investments 
the bank also dealt with people it could get to know weve 
offended some people when we refused to take their money because we 
could not verify their character president gary jacobs said 
other texas institutions were not so prudent and overextended 
themselves by investing in risky real estate schemes fiftytwo 
banks failed in 1987 40 more failed the first six months of this 
year 
people were just getting too excited said mandel who has 
been with the bank since 1950 it was an unreal situation we saw 
the handwriting on the wall and pulled back 
laredos restraint is evident in its financial statements lnb 
had 113 billion on deposit at the end of june but only 274 
million or 24 percent was loaned out 
texas banks the same size or larger had loaned a median of 874 
percent of their deposits at the end of 1987 according to alex 
sheshunoff amp co 
lnbs assets at the end of june totaled just under 122 
billion with investments weighted heavily toward lowrisk albeit 
lowerproducing areas such as treasury bills and us securities 
bank president jacobs attributes lnbs stability to its control 
by a few families who rarely sell any of the stock it maintains a 
smalltown philosophy that sounds anachronistic and almost corny in 
an age of dealmaking 
we have always felt a tremendous obligation that when people 
deposit money in a financial institution in your financial 
institution that they are trusting you with their money and you 
should always be able to give it back to them jacobs said 
thats a very simplistic philosophy but theres an old 
banking proverb that i read somewhere bankers should always spend 
more time with depositors than with borrowers 
jacobs said the bank maintains a liquidity that would allow it 
to pay off all depositors within a day or two if it had to 
since its a bank thats controlled by a few families and 
since its not publicly traded and seeking to pyramid its value on 
the stock exchange its perhaps been easier for us to maintain a 
consistent philosophy jacobs said much like the japanese 
take a longer view we have been able to take a longer view of 
things than many banks 
when the economy is strong it takes more risk than during hard 
times when it focuses its money on lowrisk areas that bring small 
returns 
for the past few years weve really sacrificed earnings 
jacobs said 
deregulation beginning in the late 1970s and continuing into 
this decade left banks too free to do themselves in when texas 
oil and real estate markets collapsed jacobs said 
bankers particularly in houston and dallas understood energy 
loans and could have survived had they not moved recklessly into 
real estate speculation which they did not understand he said 
jacobs and mandel said merger mania also brought some of the 
larger holding companies down as they drained the life out of 
smaller banks they acquired 
instead of growing the banks more slowly with legitimate 
deposit growth from their primary markets markets they understood 
they would go out and buy growth jacobs said a dallas bank 
would go out and buy an el paso bank a san angelo bank and then go 
find these little pockets of profitability to keep stock analysts 
happy 
mandel said the 1982 collapse of the mexican peso and a few 
problem loans in mexico also were sobering experiences for lnb and 
probably kept it from taking more risk than it might have 
laredosstill struggling retail sector has kept loan demand

prices finished lower monday on the london stock 
exchange but analysts blamed it on technical factors in the market 
rather than on increases in some key lending rates 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index fell 122 
points or 07 percent to 18493 
trading volume fell to 3664 million shares from fridays 5915 
million shares 
dealers said the stock market largely ignored a halfpoint rise 
in the commercial banks base rate to 105 percent because the move 
already had been factored into trading 
several dealers attributed the decline in stock prices to the 
fact that a handful of 100share index stocks began trading 
exdividend which means friday was the last day buyers could 
buy the stocks and still receive their next dividends that 
encouraged selling on monday the dealers said 
the bank of england raised its own money market rates on monday 
and commercial banks later followed suit by boosting their base 
lending rates 
analysts remain divided over how high rates will eventually 
rise but few doubt that further increases are on the way possibly 
as soon as midweek 
people are now asking where the next step is and i have to say 
it the base rate isnt going lower said roger charlesworth 
senior dealer at chase manhattan securities in london

operating rates at american factories mines 
and utilities rose in june to 831 percent the third consecutive 
monthly increase and the highest level in more than eight years 
the government said today 
the federal reserve board said the 02 percentage point rise 
from the may level put operating rates at their highest levels 
since march 1980 when industry operated at 837 percent of 
capacity 
it was the seventh increase in nine months operating rates rose 
by 02 percentage points in april and 03 percentage points in may 
rising operating rates if unchecked are considered by analysts 
to represent a threat of inflation the concern is that if 
companies have difficulty meeting demand prices will rise 
the june level of 831 percent was 28 percentage points higher 
than a year ago but still well below the 85 percent overall 
operating rate that economists say clearly signals inflation 
however the mix of operating rates in the federal reserve 
report may ease inflation fears somewhat 
the operating rate at manufacturing plants held steady at 832 
percent a 01 percentage point increase to 817 percent at plants 
making durable goods big ticket items expected to last three 
or more years was offset by a 02 percentage point decline to 
852 percent at plants making nondurable goods 
the operating rates in a number of industries where capacity is 
tightest dropped petroleum products from 855 percent in may to 
845 percent in june textiles from 918 percent in april to 907 
percent in may the latest month available and rubber and 
plastics from 881 percent in april to 873 percent in may 
the rate at paper plants increased by 01 percentage point to 
950 percent in may but that was below the 97 percent peak last 
december the rate at chemical plants rose 02 percentage points to 
862 percent in may 
economists say surging sales of us goods abroad in response 
to the devaluation of the dollar over the past three years have 
been responsible for pushing operating rates higher however so 
far growth in domestic demand has slowed enough to accommodate 
production for export 
the operating rate in the mining industry which includes oil 
drilling rose from 814 percent to 821 percent in june 
at utilities the june rate jumped 20 percentage points to 818 
percent electric utilities which increased output to keep air 
conditioners going during the heat wave had an operating rate of 
854 percent up 26 percentage points over may 
among steelmakers and other metals manufacturing the rate was 
down 02 percentage points to 872 percent in june manufacturers 
of motor vehicles and parts reported a june drop of 03 percentage 
points to 834 percent the decline followed three steep increases 
from the 768 percent rate in february

united airlines has offered its pilots a 
fiveyear contract that may be attractive enough to persuade them 
to abandon their 4 billion bid to buy the airline industry 
analysts said monday 
the pilots will have to withdraw their buyout offer before 
negotiations get serious said kevin murphy airline analyst 
for morgan stanley amp co of new york 
the proposed contract requires no wage concessions by the 5500 
pilots and offers pay raises to recently hired pilots according to 
a report in mondays editions of the chicago tribune 
the pilots buyout offer of 110 per share in cash would require 
pilots to make substantial concessions including a 10year 25 
percent pay cut 
what the pilots have designed as part of their takeover plan 
is draconian givebacks said edward starkman an analyst in new 
york with painewebber inc i cant imagine theyd be too thrilled 
with it and they havent been 
pilots of other airlines including eastern and pan am agreed 
to wage cuts of up to 20 percent in their most recent contracts 
said candace browning an analyst with wertheim schroeder amp co in 
new york 
in light of the buyout bid and in light of what other airlines 
are asking for it seems like a very attractive offer ms 
browning said 
neither the airline nor the pilots union the united master 
executive council of the air line pilots association would comment 
on the contract proposal or the ongoing negotiations the previous 
pact expired in april said union spokesman hank krakowski 
krakowksi said the contract proposal was not connected with the 
pilots buyout offer formally known as an employee stock ownership 
plan 
it just happens that we have contract negotiations going on 
concurrent with the esop effort he said theyre two separate 
subjects completely 
uniteds reported proposal for a 5year freeze on the salaries 
of senior pilots and a cumulative 10 percent raise for about 1100 
pilots hired since 1985 is in line with alpas longstanding demand 
that airlines do away with twoscale wage systems starkman said 
annual salares for united pilots range from 21600 for a 
firstyear boeing 727 flight engineer to 152000 for a boeing 747 
captain 
uniteds proposal also calls for an 8 percent increase in pilot 
productivity the tribune reported in return united pledged to 
remain committed to the airline business and to provide more 
opportunity for promotions through expansion the newspaper said 
united has had a prickly relationship with its pilots since a 
29day pilot strike in 1985 
the pilots offer to buy the airline hinges on the outcome of 
their lawsuit challenging antitakeover provisions in uniteds 
contract with the international association of machinists 
murphy said the proposal was the first specific package 
presented at the bargaining table since contract negotiations began 
in february he said he expected no concrete results from 
negotiations before the end of the year

robert m bass group on monday began a 
sweetened 19 billion tender offer for macmillan inc just days 
after winning a court victory against the publishers 
reorganization plan 
the texasbased bass group said it will pay 75ashare a share 
in cash for the macmillan shares it does not already own bass 
controls about 99 percent of the publishers 259 million 
outstanding common shares 
in a letter outlining details of its offer to the macmillan 
board the bass group said it planned to keep macmillan in one 
piece and has no plans to dispose of any part of the company or 
merge it with any other enterprise 
the tender offer represents the second time bass has improved 
its bid for new yorkbased macmillan until monday bass had a 
73ashare bid on the table 
a macmillan spokeswoman said the company had no comment on the 
tender offer 
the offer comes just days after the bass group won a key legal 
victory in halting macmillans defensive restructuring plan the 
publisher unveiled the plan after bass first discussed the 
possibility of a takeover at 64 a share in may 
last week a delaware chancery court judge issued a preliminary 
injunction preventing macmillan from proceeding with the 
restructuring which included payment of a special dividend and 
splitting the company into two separate publicly traded entities 
publishing and information services 
the bass group had said it would go ahead with the tender offer 
if it won the preliminary injunction macmillan which rejected 
each of basss overtures said last week it would appeal the ruling 
to the delaware supreme court 
in afternoon trading monday on the new york stock exchange 
macmillan was up 75 cents to 7887 after jumping 412 on 
friday the stock was one of the 10 most actively traded issues on 
the exchange 
there has been considerable speculation macmillan would seek a 
white knight or friendly suitor to help it fend off bass the 
fact that macmillans stock has risen beyond basss offering price 
is a further indication wall street is looking for another bidder 
in addition to its plans to keep macmillan independent bass 
said in the letter to directors that it wants to retain the 
publishers operating management because they have done an 
excellent job working largely independently of the corporate 
officers albeit under their general direction 
the letter said bass would design an incentive plan to 
retain operating management as far as corporate officers are 
concerned a bass source noted that the group generally retains the 
top brass 
the letter said bass would discuss a similar incentive plan with 
key corporate executives 
the bass offer for all of macmillans outstanding shares it does 
not already own is scheduled to expire at midnight edt aug 12 
unless extended it is conditioned upon macmillan refraining from 
any restructuring plan

additional taxes plus interest from atlantic richfield co for 
windfall profits on alaskan oil the company announced monday

financially pressed airline which has imposed 35 million in pay 
cuts on the teamsters under federal labor rules 
leaders of the union which represents around 4500 reservation 
clerks baggage handlers and other ground staff at pan am have 
threatened to strike the carrier under the same rules but so far 
have not done so 
of the five unions at pan am only the teamsters and flight 
attendants have not accepted pay cuts and other labor concessions 
that management says are needed to get the airline back on its feet 
the election friday of william j mccarthy as the new national 
teamsters president replacing the late jackie presser raised hope 
at pan am that the union might soften its position said pan am 
sources who agreed to discuss the situation only if not quoted by 
name 
but william genoese director of the teamsters airline 
division said his unions new leadership would not lessen its 
resolve to battle pan am 
mccarthy is feisty and hes going to fight pan am 
toothandnail genoese said hes my kind of guy 
some observers expect mccarthy who led a rump movement among 
teamster vice presidents against a new nationwide trucking contract 
to shake up the nations largest union his election by the 
teamsters general executive board came just two weeks after the 
justice department filed suit to seize control of the unions 
affairs claiming its leadership has been controlled by organized 
crime for more than 30 years 
i think the entire teamster organization is going to be 
different with mr mccarthy as the head of it said william a 
krupman a new yorkbased labor lawyer who advises management i 
think youre going to see a lot of changes 
pan ams biggest union the transport workers announced friday 
that it would join the pilots and flight engineers in agreeing to 
labor concessions in return for the unions agreement to freeze 
wages pan am withdrew its threat to sell a large portion of its 
assets 
the agreement with the transport workers which also includes 
workrule concessions would save the airline around 81 million 
over the next three years according to both the union and pan am 
it must still be ratified by the union membership 
last spring the pilots and flight engineers agreed to pay cuts 
and concessions totaling about 240 million over three years 
the airlines management says it needs around 540 million in 
labor cost savings over that period to turn itself around in 
addition to the 35 million in wage reductions imposed on the 
teamsters pan am is seeking 90 million in pay cuts from its 
flight attendants 
repeated phone calls seeking comment from representatives of the 
flight attendants were not returned

the drought is blasting sales through 
the roof for tennessee well drillers who are hiring extra help and 
extending hours to meet the demand officials said monday 
many of the additional customers are farmers who need irrigation 
wells drilled deeper and others are homeowners afraid 
droughtinspired water restrictions will leave their pools ponds 
lawns and gardens high and dry 
id say water well sales have probably increased tenfold since 
two years ago which is pretty significant said gil jackson 
owner of jackson enterprises inc in lebanon people are scared 
we try to put the farmer who needs to water his stock before the 
person who wants to fill his swimming pool 
jacksons company has drilled an average eight new wells per 
week since this years dry spring before that the company was 
lucky to get two or three requests for new wells each month he 
said 
officials of other companies throughout the state reported 
similar increases the extra business means some customers have to 
wait up to four weeks said kenneth casey coowner of caseys well 
drilling inc in jonesborough 
max campbell owner of campbell well drilling inc in mckenzie 
said he hired three extra people and is keeping the business open 
seven days a week jackson said hes hired four extra workers 
were busy theres no doubt the drought has had a whole lot 
to do with it campbell said weve had a lot of calls from 
arkansas and missouri the drillers there have just gotten behind 
and the farmers there cant get their irrigation wells drilled fast 
enough 
george eatherly owner of george eatherly drilling co in 
lebanon said his business has doubled in the last two months 
peoples wells are going dry the cities dont want them on 
city water he said 
jackson said the industry was lackluster before the drought 
for all practical purposes the business had died it was an 
industry that wasnt needed anymore because the city water systems 
had been extensively developed in our area he said now with 
water restrictions people in the cities are beginning to want 
wells drilled again where people have had city water for 20 years 
they want water to water their lawns and fill their swimming 
pools its a different demand

gambling that oil prices will rise the canadian 
government signed a landmark agreement with five oil companies 
monday for the 7 billion development of the hibernia oil field off 
newfoundland 
prime minister brian mulroney flew to st johns newfoundland 
to announce that the federal government will contribute 830 
million in grants and up to 13 billion in loan guarantees for the 
giant project 
this is a day for rejoicing for the people of newfoundland and 
labrador and an important day for all canadians mulroney said 
hibernia is by far and away the largest capital investment in the 
history of atlantic canada 
he said the project could break the cycle of federal dependency 
in canadas poorest province it means bringing quality jobs into 
newfoundland rather than people moving away from home in search of 
work he said 
but the conservative prime minister who is getting ready to 
call a general election to seek a second term acknowledged that 
hibernia is a gamble world oil prices now hovering around 15 a 
barrel need to pass the 20 mark to make the project pay 
if certainty of results and the elimination of risks had been 
required in advance canadas first prime minister sir john a 
macdonald would never have proceeded with the great endeavors which 
bound canada together mulroney said 
while his faith in the project may win votes in the maritime 
provinces of the east mulroney may face questions in other regions 
of the country over such a massive expenditure 
hibernia was discovered in the north atlantic 185 miles east of 
st johns in 1979 falling oil prices and years of arguing between 
the federal and provincial governments over offshore rights led to 
repeated delays the political fight was settled in 1985 when 
newfoundland won the right to offshore royalties 
it will still be six years before construction is completed and 
the project will then have about 20 years of productive life 
the consortium developing the field is led by mobil oil canada 
ltd of calgary and includes gulf canada petrocanada chevron 
canada resources ltd and columbia gas system of delaware 
the companies demanded concessions from the federal and 
provincial governments before signing the agreement because it 
would now cost more to get the oil out of the atlantic than 
refineries would receive for it 
hibernia will create 1100 permanent jobs over its 20 years of 
production and about 1400 jobs during the construction phase 
newfoundland premier brian peckford said it will start an 
economic revival that will give island natives a choice other than 
poverty or emigration 
the province has an unemployment rate of 17 percent the highest 
in canada and its economy is overdependent on dwindling fish 
stocks around its coast 
as part of the deal construction of the hibernia drilling 
platform will be done entirely in comebychance newfoundland 
the province will waive its 12percent sales tax on building 
materials during the construction phase and reduce it to 4 percent 
once hibernia enters production payment of its 16percent 
corporate income tax is open to further negotiation 
the federal government will get 10 percent of net revenues and 
estimates a return of 19 billion to 39 billion over two decades 
through taxes and royalties 
newfoundland a cosigner of the agreement will phase in 
royalties starting at 1 percent and projects revenues of 21 
billion to 42 billion 
hibernia is estimated to contain at least 525 million barrels of 
oil and should produce an average 110000 barrels a day during peak 
production about 7 percent of canadas projected demand by the end 
of the century 
largescale development in the western provinces made canada 
selfsufficient in oil and natural gas but landbased reserves are 
running low causing companies to look at offshore reserves in the 
atlantic and arctic as well as the tar sands of alberta

unexpectedly heavy weekend rains in the droughtstricken midwest 
sent grain and soybean futures plummeting monday on the chicago 
board of trade and analysts predicted prices would again fall their 
allowable limits on tuesday 
on other markets livestock and meat futures were broadly mixed 
in reaction to the plunging grain prices sugar prices fell energy 
futures soared precious metals advanced and stockindex futures 
retreated 
the weekend showers in the farm belt should help stressed 
soybean plants recover and halt the deterioration of the corn crop 
which is nearing the end of its critical pollination phase 
analysts said 
soybeans for july delivery skidded more than 109 a bushel one 
of the steepest oneday soybean price declines in the exchanges 
history july corn plunged 30 cents a bushel prices for other corn 
and soybean contracts fell their respective limits of 15 cents and 
45 cents a bushel 
rich feltes director of commodities research for refco inc a 
large chicagobased trading firm called the price plunge a 
train wreck and the biggest weather shocker of the summer 
rain also fell monday in parts of the farm belt and more was 
forecast for tuesday temperatures in the wake of the cold front 
were expected to remain below the 90 and 100degree readings that 
baked the midwest last week 
i think people are sensing the drought pattern may be 
breaking up feltes said no one knows for certain but weve 
bought some important time for the 50 percent of the corn crop that 
has not yet pollinated and certainly for the soybeans which could 
approach yields that are above what the markets been trading 
the national weather service issued a 6to10day outlook after 
the markets closed calling for abovenormal temperatures and 
normal to belownormal rainfall in the midwest during the first 
five days of next week 
soybeans will enter their most critical growing stage next week 
when the pods now forming on the plants begin filling with beans 
analysts said 
the soybean market has generally been more sensitive to weather 
changes this season than the grains because the relatively small 
stockpile of soybeans raises the threat of a shortage if yields are 
substantially reduced 
wheat settled 13 cents to 19 cents lower with july at 369 a 
bushel corn was 15 cents to 30 cents lower with july at 303 a 
bushel oats were 15 cents to 24 cents lower with july at 287 a 
bushel soybeans were 45 cents to 109 lower with july at 885 a 
bushel 
cattle futures finished widely mixed and pork futures were 
sharply lower all in reaction to the falling grain prices 
analysts said 
as grain prices rose during the past three months livestock 
traders sold contracts for summer and fall deliveries while bidding 
up prices for 1989 deliveries on the theory that rising feed costs 
would force livestock producers to sell more animals thereby 
reducing the size of their breeding herds 
with the sudden drop in grain prices traders took the opposite 
tack 
live cattle settled 148 cents lower to 93 cent higher with 
august at 6505 cents a pound feeder cattle were 40 cent to the 
limit 150 cents higher with august at 7625 cents a pound hogs 
were 05 cent to the limit 150 cents lower with july at 4617 
cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 75 cent to the limit 2 
cents lower with july at 3655 cents a pound 
sugar futures prices dropped sharply in sympathy with soybeans 
sugar for october delivery on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange settled 62 cent lower at 1461 cents a pound 
some energy futures soared their limits on the new york 
mercantile exchange in response to news that iran would accept a 
un resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire to its nearly 
8yearold war with iraq iraq already has accepted the resolution 
peace between the persian gulf countries could increase the 
chances for a united opec effort to reduce crude oil production 
analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 60 cents to 92 cents 
higher with august at 1570 a barrel heating oil was 195 cents 
to 215 cents higher with august at 4327 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 138 cents to 2 cents higher with august at 5111 
cents a gallon 
precious metals prices fell on new yorks commodity exchange in 
response to the falling grain prices the stronger dollar and 
rising interest rates analysts said 
gold settled 240 to 250 lower with august at 43880 a troy 
ounce silver was 16 cents to 165 cents lower with july at 715 a 
troy ounce 
on the chicago mercantile exchange the contract for september 
delivery of the standard amp poors 500 index settled 50 point lower 
at 27230

the dollar finished weaker against most key 
foreign currencies monday hurt by aggressive centralbank selling 
and a possible breakthrough in the iraniraq war 
gold prices also fell republic national bank of new york quoted 
bullion at 43750 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt down from 440 
friday 
currency brokers said the central banks of the united states 
west germany and britain intervened actively in the foreign 
exchange markets selling dollars to deflate the currencys rising 
value 
some said the federal reserve sold dollars at least three times 
during the day the fed and other central banks do not comment on 
their intervention activities 
even as the dollar was coming down they would sell more 
dollars said zlatko glamuzina chief foreign exchange dealer at 
the banco di sicilias new york branch 
i think its not so much to stop the dollar from going higher 
as to slow the rise glamuzina said they just dont want the 
speculation to get out of hand 
the central bank action came against a background of growing 
attraction for the dollar which has risen to the highest levels 
since early last year 
a higher dollar attracts more foreign capital to the united 
states and raises demand for domestic stocks and bonds but some 
us economists fear that a rapidly appreciating dollar could 
reverse the nations slowly improving balance of trade by making 
american exports more expensive and imports cheaper 
traders said irans unconditional agreement to a un ceasefire 
proposal in its eightyearold war with iraq also weakened the 
dollar which historically has been a safehaven currency during 
times of unrest 
in tokyo the dollar rose 175 yen to a closing 13515 yen but 
later in london it was quoted lower at 13475 yen by the time 
trading ended in new york the dollar traded at 13451 yen down 
from 13545 yen friday 
the british pound rose in london to 16693 vs 16635 late 
friday in new york the pound fetched 16745 up from 16605 
friday 
other late dollar rates in new york vs late friday 18749 west 
german marks down from 18815 15565 swiss francs down from 
15588 12065 canadian dollars down from 12101 63445 french 
francs up from 63385 and 138800 italian lire down from 
139163 
other late dollar rates in europe vs late friday 18823 marks 
up from 18780 15625 swiss francs up from 15555 63415 french 
francs up from 63285 21130 dutch guilders down from 21150 
139050 italian lire up from 138725 12095 canadian dollars 
down from 12117 
the price of gold which like the dollar often is considered a 
safehaven investment during politically tense periods fell on the 
persian gulf news 
on the new york commodity exchange gold for current delivery 
fell 240 a troy ounce to 43780 earlier in london gold fell to 
43625 from 43840 late friday in zurich the price was 435 down 
from 439 and in hong kong it was 440 down from 44186 
silver was quoted in london at 713 a troy ounce down from

brazil will pay the back interest due on 
its huge foreign debt if it gets a 500 million shortterm bridge 
loan from foreign government treasuries the finance ministry 
said monday 
finance minister mailson da nobrega is in europe negotiating the 
loan with western official creditors and an announcement was 
expected by weeks end ministry spokesman geraldo moura told the 
associated press 
if brazil gets the loan the government will use its 
hardcurrency reserves to complete the interest due for june and 
july moura said he said the total due was about 1 billion 
brazils foreign debt is put at 121 billion the largest in the 
developing world 
the financial press here said the payments could include august 
interest and total 18 billion but moura said talks only involved 
arrears for june and july 
nobrega in a speech to the brazilian chamber of commerce in 
london said brazil was close to lining up a 500 million 
shortterm loan from the bank of international settlements to tide 
the nation over until an international monetary fund loan is made 
later this year 
nobrega left london late monday for paris where he was to meet 
with french bankers before journeying to rome and frankfurt 
there is no use denying the difficulties the brazilian economy 
is facing now nobrega said in his speech but i can assure you 
the government is trying to correct the imbalances of the economy 
and to normalize the relations with brazilian creditors 
brazils currency reserves are a closely guarded secret in 
march they were calculated at some 39 billion but are believed to 
be higher now bolstered by healthy trade surpluses averaging more 
than 18 billion a month 
brazil has not fully paid all the interest it owes for 1987 but 
those arrears are dealt with in a 62 billion rescheduling package 
that nobrega is touring world financial centers to promote 
in june brazil reached an agreement with private foreign 
creditors for 52 billion in loans this year and in 1989 the 
government is to pay back the money in 12 years with a fiveyear 
grace period 
brazil also agreed to repay 17 billion of the principal or 
actual amount owed in three installments between 1991 and 1993 
about 70 billion of the total debt is owed to hundreds of 
foreign private banks in early 1987 brazil stopped paying interest 
on that part of the debt but lifted the moratorium at the end of 
the year

company announced 
mgmua officials wouldnt discuss richs plans and he didnt 
immediately respond to a telephone request for comment 
silbert 45 a lawyer and adviser to las vegas nev investor 
kerkorian had been president and chief operating officer since 
october 1986 silbert said richs departure wasnt the result of 
plans to split mgmua into its original parts metrogoldwynmayer 
and united artists 
its absolutely unrelated silbert said of richs 
resignation weve known about it for some time 
rich who is in his late 60s took the helm of united artists 
corp in april 1986 hours after resigning from lorimar 
productions which he helped found 17 years before 
with cofounder merv adelson the bluntlyspoken former ad man 
built lorimar into a television powerhouse in part on the success 
of dallas tvs first primetime soap opera and its spinoffs 
rich left lorimar six months after the company agreed to the 
merger that formed the present lorimar telepictures corp 
richs resignation from mgmua came exactly one week after the 
company announced that mgm the former metrogoldwynmayer would 
be spun off from mgmua into a separate publicly held company with 
kerkorian as a major shareholder the split is scheduled to be 
completed in the fall 
rich joined united artists as chairman and chief executive in 
the midst of a complicated series of transactions in which 
kerkorian broke mgmua into its components sold off mgms 
3000title film library and production lot then rejoined the 
companies 
the latest transaction will divide the companies again but 
leave kerkorian a majority shareholder in united artists and 40 
percent owner of mgm the new metrogoldwynmayer and united 
artists also will share the film distribution system of the present 
mgmua 
mgm takes with it the roaring lion logo a movie and tv 
production system and a small library of movies made since 1986 
including the oscarwinning moonstruck 
united artists will be a movie and tv production company with a 
950title movie library including the rocky and pink

ford motor co is recalling 27757 1988 
lincoln continentals to correct wiring and gear shift problems and 
about 16000 198687 trucks to check emissions levels the 
automaker said monday 
three fires were reported but no injuries or accidents were 
attributed to the wiring problems in the continentals ford 
spokesman chuck snearly said owners will be notified by mail and 
alterations will be made at the companys expense ford said 
dealers will correct one of the wiring problems by installing 
heat resistant fiberglas tape around a wiring harness located in 
the engine compartment 
the tape must be installed to insulate a nylon shield that 
covers the harness which could melt drip onto the exhaust 
manifold and cause an engine fire john p king parts and service 
engineering office manager said in a statement 
most of the cars also will have a new ignition switch and 
certain ignition circuit electrical wiring and connectors 
installed ford said the ignition switch wiring in the cars can 
lose electrical contact under heavy use according to the automaker 
loss of electrical contact could cause turn signals the radio 
and the heater and air conditioner to malfunction king said it 
also could affect braking 
transmission gear shift cables also will be replaced in most of 
the continentals to prevent the cables from breaking and resulting 
in a false gear reading on the instrument panel 
ford also said it plans to voluntarily recall about 16000 
198687 fseries and bseries and 1986 cseries trucks with gross 
vehicle weight ratings of 14000 or higher to assure acceptable 
evaporative emissions levels the affected trucks are equipped with 
61liter fourbarrel carburetor and 70liter fourbarrel 
carburetor engines

a reorganization plan for ah robins co moved 
close to confirmation monday but the federal judge overseeing the 
case said the plan must include a provision giving the court 
authority to oversee a trust fund for dalkon shield claimants 
the plan would set up a nearly 25 billion trust fund to 
satisfy claims by women who allege they were injured by using the 
dalkon shield intruterine birthcontrol device and provides for a 
32 billion buyout of the 122yearold company by the american 
home products corp 
i certainly want to confirm this plan us district judge 
robert r merhige said 
but he said he and us bankruptcy judge blackwell n shelley 
who are supervising robins bankruptcy reorganization cannot 
confirm the plan without a provision ensuring court protection of 
the 25 billion fund 
merhige gave attorneys a week to submit briefs on the proposed 
revision 
lawyers for robins indicated they would accept the modification 
but mark ellenberg a lawyer for the dalkon shield claimants 
committee said he was concerned that such a provision would create 
new and troubling legal obligations 
earlier in the hearing lawyers for robins said an overwhelming 
percentage of stockholders and dalkon shield claimants have 
approved the reorganization plan which could end the companys 
nearly threeyear bankruptcy proceedings 
dennis drebsky an attorney for the pharmaceutical company said 
about 95 percent of the 141094 dalkon shield claimants who sent in 
ballots voted in favor of the plan 
he said more than 99 percent of the 19 million robins common 
stockholders who voted backed the plan as were all other classes 
of creditors 
the new yorkbased american home products also would pay robins 
creditors in full 
drebsky and murray drabkin who represents the dalkon shield 
claimants committee that speaks for claimants in the case urged 
approval of the plan during a federal court hearing 
drabkin said the plan provides a just and fair resolution of 
the case 
while it is not an ideal solution drabkin said it meets the 
claimants requirements for the possibility of independent claims 
resolutions and the certainty of money being available for awards 
but another lawyer representing several hundred dalkon shield 
claimants said the trust fund would be inadequate attorney ralph 
pittle also said more claimants would have voted against the plan 
if they had been better informed ballots were mailed to creditors 
in april and had to be returned by july 11 
pittle said the plan was difficult for claimants to understand 
especially since many of them do not have lawyers 
testimony by robins witnesses focused on the companys decision 
to merge with american home products rather than to liquidate 
robins assets pittle challenged the companys accounting 
suggesting that more money would have been available for claimants 
if the company had been sold 
if merhige and shelley approve the plan parties will have 30 
days to appeal before a final confirmation order is issued 
payments to claimants from a 100 million cash fund set up by 
robins will begin 30 days after merhiges approval regardless of 
whether any appeals are filed 
lawyers for robins also revealed monday that the company will 
pay 27 million plus interest to satisfy internal revenue service 
claims the irs had sought 62 million in disputed back taxes from 
the company unrelated to the bankruptcy proceedings 
robins filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in august 1985 
after paying about 530 million to settle 9500 of 15000 lawsuits 
stemming from its sale of the iud about 45 million of which were 
distributed in this country and abroad in the early 1970s 
the reorganization plan calls for the claimants to receive 
payments from robins american home products and aetna casualty and 
surety co which carried liability insurance on the dalkon shield

as ford motor co moves toward becoming one 
global company it is selecting suppliers who can serve it 
worldwide giving them longterm contracts and phasing out others 
fords purchasing director said monday 
but steven roberts said the move to a single international 
corporation from a conglomeration of regional ones did not mean 
that traditional north american suppliers would be shut out in 
favor of european or asian suppliers 
he said major suppliers in the united states already operate in 
europe and asia as well unlike general motors corp and to a 
lesser extent chrysler corp ford does not intend to move much of 
its internal partsmaking work to outside suppliers or drastically 
reduce the number of outside suppliers it uses roberts said 
but ford has decided to stop doing business with suppliers who 
it judges unworthy of its q1 quality award by 1990 ford began 
using the q1 system to rate suppliers in the united states in 1981 
and in europe in 1987 
most suppliers with international operations who have received 
the award have been awarded longterm contracts usually in the 
fiveyear range and similar contracts are being negotiated with 
suppliers ford believes will be eligible for the award in six 
months roberts said 
by 1990 all ford suppliers will have longterm contracts and 
the shortterm contracts of those who do not meet ford standards 
should have expired he said 
about 50 percent of the parts money ford spends already goes to 
q1 suppliers through longterm contracts roberts said the 
complete conversion by 1990 will shrink fords supplier base 
somewhat he added 
in north america ford has used suppliers in 2100 locations 
since the mid1980s after shrinking its base from 3500 supplier 
locations in 1980 
the changes in fords supplier strategy are part of its 
evolution into a global company in which all responsibility for 
individual products or a group of parts will be assigned to a 
particular ford operation that will serve the entire company 
eliminating duplication from country to country 
ford spends about 60 percent of its revenue on parts and 
supplies that go into making cars about 55 percent of its supply 
spending goes to its 200 largest suppliers 
automakers worldwide are moving toward closer relationships with 
suppliers bringing them in as soon as a new product is conceived 
and requiring them to shoulder a larger part of capital costs 
engineering design and inventory management

italys fiat auto spa has decided not to reenter 
the us market with its fiat lineup but will seek to boost the 
image and presence of its alfa romeo models its chairman said 
monday 
alfa romeo is introducing its first new car since fiat acquired 
the luxurysports car maker a year ago 
vittorio ghidella said fiat expects to sell 10000 of the new 
alfa model the 164 during its first year on the us market as a 
1990 model and will aim to sell 40000 to 50000 of the expensive 
sports cars here eventually 
the new 164 will cost less than 50000 ghidella said 
declining to give more specific details 
fiat will follow the 164 with the next alfa romeo spyder 
twoseater when it is introduced he said 
ghidella said he decided to pull the fiat line out of the united 
states several years ago because of the strength of japanese 
competition in the smallcar arena he has no plans to export any 
fiat or lancia cars to this country 
japanese imports are limited in europe and ghidella said he 
hopes the execution of the european common market agreement in 
1992 which will elimiante trade barriers between 12 european 
nations will continue limits on japanese imports to europe 
regardless of whether the cars are built in japan or the united 
states 
ghidella said that despite the practice in the united states of 
differentiating cars by their nation of manufacture he believes 
cars should be distinguished for trade purposes by the national 
origin of each automaker 
he also said he preferred that his company export its cars to 
other nations rather than set up farflung assembly plants except 
in nations that forbid the imports 
fiat retreated from the united states partly because of its 
reputation as a poorquality car ghidella said fiat wants to 
strengthen alfa romeos image and sales in the united states to 
help repair the image of the parent company and to give it some of 
the panache of its new subsidiary 
the fiat line holds 62 percent of the car market in italy and 
158 percent of the total european market ninety percent of 
fiatline sales are concentrated in europe 
ghidella also is chairman of ferrari and of alfa romeolancia 
all owned by the fiat parent company he was detroit to address the 
fiveday automotive news world congress a gathering of auto 
industry executives analysts and suppliers
