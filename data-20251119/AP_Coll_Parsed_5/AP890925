rep roy p dyson said monday he has made 
mistakes in judgment while in office and that his former top 
aide who committed suicide had improperly pocketed campaign funds 
the fiveterm democrat from maryland also said he was returning 
18000 in campaign contributions made by officials connected to a 
defense contractor 
dyson said his former top aide and campaign manager tom pappas 
improperly pocketed nearly 7300 in campaign funds pappas wrote 
7275 in checks to other dyson staff members and told them to give 
him the cash dyson said 
i must accept ultimate responsibility for these errors in 
judgment because tom pappas was my campaign manager dyson said 
i was not aware that tom was writing checks to staff members and 
asking them to cash those checks and return the cash to him 
pappas committed suicide in may 1988 by jumping from a new york 
hotel following newspaper reports that were highly critical of his 
management of dysons congressional office 
the apparent violations will be reported to the federal 
elections commission dyson said 
dyson also said he would return 18000 in campaign 
contributions received from officials connected to unisys corp 
one of several defense contractors under investigation by the us 
justice department for suspected violations of contract procurement 
regulations 
he said was returning the money because individual guilty pleas 
entered as a result of the investigation point to a systematic 
attempt on the part of unisys to circumvent the federal laws 
governing campaign contributions said dyson who sits on a house 
subcommittee with repsonsibility for approving the pentagon budget 
mistakes were made by my staff i have made mistakes of 
judgment dyson added i regret the controversy these matters 
have caused but i want the people of maryland to know that these 
were mistakes of the head not of the heart

the united states and the soviet union are the 
only two nations to acknowledge having chemical weapons although 
up to a dozen including libya and iran are thought to have the 
grisly substances or the ability to make them experts said monday 
president bush addressing the un general assembly proclaimed 
his readiness to destroy 80 percent of us chemical weapon stores 
if moscow agrees to the same stockpile level and urged other 
nations to sign a multilateral pact to ban them entirely 
bush however did not suspend production of new us chemical 
weapons and his offer did not appear to go beyond legislation 
passed by congress requiring the government to destroy old chemical 
weapons stocks by 1997 
bush said more than 20 nations have these weapons or the ability 
to mkake them there was no immediate explanation of why his 
estimate was higher than those offered by the experts 
the presidents proposal might focus international attention 
on chemical weapons and lead to a multilateral treaty said lee 
feinstein of the arms control association a disarmament lobby in 
washington 
but it may instead produce a ussoviet deal on chemical 
weapons and divert attention from production by other countries he 
said 
private analysts believe the united states has 30000 tons of 
chemical weapons the soviets have said they have no more than 
50000 
delegates to the 40nation conference on disarmament ended their 
most recent meeting in geneva last month without any clear idea of 
when it would be possible to conclude a global ban on chemical 
weapons 
the conference which meets again in november is stalled on the 
issue of how to monitor the production of chemical weapons which 
experts say can be made in factories similar to those that make 
fertilizer or other compounds 
the problem we have is that nobody has determined how to 
monitor it in an effectively verifiable way because chemical 
weapons can be made in just about any kind of chemical plant 
gen colin powell said earlier this year before he was nominated 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
also in dispute are the size of chemical weapons stockpiles and 
even the number of countries that have them 
us intelligence officials have said that libya is building the 
worlds largest chemical weapons plant at rabta libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi has said the factory is designed to produce 
pharmaceuticals 
in 1984 the united nations concluded that iraq had used lethal 
chemical agents against kurds along the iraniraq border although 
iraq has not admitted it 
other nations thought able to make their own chemical weapons 
are burma china iran israel libya north korea syria taiwan 
and probably egypt said elisa harris a scholar who closely tracks 
the issue at the brookings institution in washington 
the size of the us and soviet stockpiles is not publicly 
known although those two governments last weekend signed an 
agreement to exchange and verify data on their chemical arsenals 
including the right to onsight inspection 
the united states has disclosed what type of weapons it has and 
where they are stored but not the size of the stockpiles the arms 
control association estimated the size of the us stock at about 
30000 tons 
in 1987 the us government after an 18year moratorium began 
to manufacture a new generation of binary chemical weapons 
which consist of two toxic substances that become lethal when mixed 
together 
congress also has ordered the destruction by 1997 of 90 percent 
of stockpiles of older us chemical weapons stored at 11 sites in 
the united states and in west germany 
work began on aug 31 at the toole army depot in the utah desert 
to destroy 42 percent of the us stockpile consisting of nerve 
and mustard gas blistering agents that were used in world war i 
similar facilities were being studied at other storage sites to 
destroy the remainder 
the us stockpile also consists of the nerve agents sarin and 
vx and other substances according to the government 
the soviet union suspended chemical weapon production on dec 
26 1987 seven months after the united states resumed production 
kremlin spokesmen giving the firstever soviet figures on chemical 
weapon stockpiles said they contained no more than 50000 tons 
of chemical warfare agents 
us estimates of soviet stockpiles have ranged from 30000 to 
50000 tons 
in october 1987 the soviets announced that their stockpile 
consisted of the nerve agents sarion soman vx two mustard 
blistering agents and one irritant

if the premiere of saturday night with connie 
chung is typical of things to come it might be wise for cbs news 
to turn it into a docudrama anthology series and let cbs 
entertainment produce it 
the show spent half its opening hour saturday dramatizing the 
life of a fiery early civil rights pioneer in montgomery ala the 
rev vernon johns played by james earl jones that half was a 
fairly good docudrama 
but this is supposed to be a news series even though this ones 
closing credits cited a soloist jazzman david sanborn who 
played the shows bluesy theme music 
it is not a good sign for a journalism show to have a news amp 
blues saxaphonist but this efforts first 30 minutes were not a 
good sign either 
they made one fear that this series produced by andrew lack 
producer of the departed west 57th series may prove just a 
training ground for tv news producers who hope to someday make tv 
movies 
entitled gods bad boy saturdays debut dramatization set 
in 1949 featured seven actors a group of black townsfolk as 
extras in johns church the dexter avenue baptist church and 
white extras as hostile policemen 
by david bradley and kenneth king the recreation 
sporadically included brief interviews in the manner of the movie 
reds with seven people who knew the late minister they 
included his daughter toni johns anderson and atlanta mayor 
andrew young 
there was an eighth interviewee historian taylor branch the 
first chapter of his pulitzer prizewinning book on the civil 
rights movement parting the waters was the basis for the 
dramatization 
the dramatization in which johns strongly and loudly spoke out 
against murder of blacks by whites and urged his middleclass 
congregation to stand up for black civil rights was woefully weak 
in journalistic basics 
even chung who has a reputation as a good reporter exhibited 
this flaw in her nonacting role as anchor 
she prefaced one scene by saying how a series of brutal 
murders of blacks by the police in the spring of 1949 led johns 
to preach a sermon that would threaten the uneasy calm between 
the races in montgomery 
but she cited no examples of any murders by police she only 
said that a white man got up off his front porch and shot and 
killed a black man who was running by the killers explanation 
she said was this if he was running he must have done 
something 
she didnt say if the white man was charged with anything let 
alone tried 
in the docudrama johns in saying that a lot of people doing 
the killing of blacks are the police at least cited two cases 
they were found to be he scornfully noted justifiable 
homicide 
but he named only one policemen while naming all the victims it 
made you wonder if any of the names were real 
in another scene he was called boy by a white man 
identified only as a commonwealths attorney in mongtomery no 
name was given another white official in a succeeding scene is 
identified only as judge jones 
in yet another scene johns daughter in an offcamera 
interview excerpt that accompanied the onscreen drama said that 
as i recall a black girl had been raped i think it was by six 
policemen 
youd think there be might be a question at this shocking point 
whether what she said actually happened and whether any policemen 
were charged but there was no question 
on the bright side the shows second half was an interesting 
panel discussion where sparks occasionally flew between the rev 
jesse jackson and montgomery mayor emory folmar the latter a white 
man 
for the record chung told viewers that next saturday will bring 
jane fonda talking for the first time on television about her 
separation from tom hayden and about her newest roles both 
onscreen and off 
it can be assumed that fonda will play herself

the norwegian national opera tried to bring 
19th century arias to the masses this weekend with a drivein 
performance many viewers mostly on foot found opera loud but 
hard to see 
a 225squarefoot movie screen dangled from a crane above oslos 
youngstorget marketplace for what was billed as the worlds first 
drivein opera 
broadcast images of the operas live saturday night performance 
from its regular theater were dim but stacks of loudspeakers 
blasted the normally quiet city center with crisp arias 
it started as a crazy notion but we went ahead anyway said 
state opera spokesman terje baskerud it was inspired by us 
drivein movies which are unknown in norway he said 
we want people to know that opera can be fun baskerud said 
of choosing one act from the 19th century comedy the barber of 
seville for the experiment 
the opera hoped 1950s americana will help it shed a highbrow 
image and appeal to a broader public through the free one night 
drivein sponsors paid the 28000 cost 
several operas in the us and elsewhere asked to be kept 
informed of the results baskerud said 
drivein movie theaters are as foreign to most norwegians as 
opera police estimated there was room for 250 cars in the 
closedoff marketplace about 70 cars parked many facing away from 
screen 
unsure of drivein etiquette one lady asked if she was 
allowed to get out of her car said baskerud 
most of the roughly 1300 people who passed through the square 
came on foot often leading dogs or carrying children a core of 
about 300 stayed through the 90minute first act politely 
applauding the screen 
some sat in chairs lined up on a trucks cargo bed nearby 
limousine passengers sipped champagne 
the second act proved too dark for television and plans to have 
waitresses on rollerskates serve hamburgers also proved impossible 
baskerud said 
its wonderful said lillian ingerbretsen 48 an opera fan 
the screen was dark but now people will buy tickets to a 
performance just to see what it is really like she said 
baskerud admitted picture problems but said sound was perfect 
and thats what counts next time we will have a performance 
lighted for television 
morten kristoffersen 16 who paused looked and walked on 
said great idea but its hard to see i dont think ill be 
going to the opera anytime soon 
but baskerud said ticket sales to regular performances boomed 
during the drivein the opera founded in 1957 already averages 
90 percent bookings for 200 shows a year in its home a cramped 
former movie theater he said 
the 1119tickets for the premiere had been sold out yet when 
the curtain rose in the opera house many seats were empty 
more than a third of the ticket holders stayed outside to 
watch the drivein then came in for the second act he said 
the italianlanguage performance of rossinis barber of 
seville first performed in 1816 was directed by michael hampe 
of the cologne opera and conducted by italian carlo felice 
cillareo 
iziar martinez galdos a spanish resident of norway sang the 
female lead rosina the scottish operas neill archer sang count 
almaviva and norways trond halstein moe performed figaro with 
support from the operas other 26 singers 42member chorus and

outside the battered metal doors of intermediate 
school 117 in east harlem crack vials litter the pavement and row 
after row of tenements stand empty and graffitiscarred 
but inside is what president bush has called the single most 
promising idea in education an idea certain to be high on the 
agenda at the education summit this week between bush and the 
nations governors in charlottesville va 
the idea is choice the belief as espoused by bush and 
others that if parents are allowed to choose the best public 
schools for their children the resulting competition would compel 
schools everywhere to improve 
minnesota iowa and arkansas have already adopted open 
enrollment plans permitting parents to choose among schools 
throughout those states many other states offer more limited 
choice options aimed at gifted students or youngsters with academic 
problems that only certain districts can handle scores of local 
districts have offered magnet and alternative programs for years 
a gallup education survey in august found americans support the 
principle of school choice by a 6031 margin with 9 percent saying 
they werent sure 
minnesotas plan voluntary for two years became mandatory this 
fall for districts with at least 1000 students in iowa a law 
signed this year gives students the right to apply to any school in 
the state they must stick with their choice for at least four 
years 
arkansas this year passed a comprehensive open enrollment law 
permitting students aged 5 through 18 to choose schools across 
district lines as long as there is room and as long as it doesnt 
upset desegregation efforts 
but advocates say no place offers better proof than east harlem 
that choices benefits can extend even to urban americas neediest 
in 1972 district 4 ranked last among new york citys 32 school 
districts in reading and math achievement only 15 percent read at 
or above grade level 
with federal and private funds thensuperintendent anthony 
alvarado gradually broke up or replaced existing schools in the 
district with magnet schools and alternative schools within 
schools small enough to give students individual attention and 
academically attractive enough to draw pupils from all over the 
city 
some are selective like the gifted programs or the school for 
the performing arts others take nearly all comers 
the district has weathered some recent problems last december 
superintendent carlos medina was suspended on allegations he and 
fellow board members funneled district money into a secret bank 
account and used it for trips food liquor and improper loans 
and citywide school budget cuts may force reductions this year 
in some of the districts innovative magnet programs said 
assistant superintendent john falco 
still everyone agrees the district has been transformed for the 
better by the bracing effects of competition 
even keith geiger president of the national education 
association which has given only qualified support to the idea of 
choice calls district 4 choice at its very best 
today reading scores of district 4s 14000 pupils rank 16th in 
the city and 65 percent read at grade level or higher pupils can 
choose among 23 alternative schools specializing in such areas as 
science and humanities performing arts and environmental science 
choice has also meant that poor programs which no longer attract 
students dont last a school specializing in maritime science was 
closed about three years ago falco said it reopened recently with 
a new director 
is 117 was once a failing impersonal middle school bulging 
with more than 2000 students it now houses four academies or 
schools within schools each occupying one floor and each with only 
about 200 pupils there is a gifted and talented program the 
harbor school for the performing arts the career academy 
which helps poorly prepared students take a seemingly outlandish 
goal such as becoming a lawyer and plan how to attain it and the 
key school with classes of no more than 18 students and 
intensive instruction for youngsters with emotional difficulties 
most pupils come from east harlem but the magnet schools are so 
appealing that this oncedowntrodden district is drawing students 
of all races and economic circumstances from every corner of the 
city 
nearly 200 children from around the city applied for 70 places 
in the entering class of the harbor school this year says 
assistant director harold roth 
fourthgrader chenoa rommereim takes a car pool each day from 
the bronx to attend is 117s gifted program she is one of the 
estimated 1525 percent nonminority students in district 4 magnet 
programs falco said 
even staunch supporters of choice note its limitations district 
4 has shunned choice for elementary schools falco said because at 
that early age its more important for parents and children to 
maintain neighborhood ties 
sy fliegel an early architect of choice in district 4 recently 
wrote that choice worked in east harlem because it came gradually 
one school at a time and successful programs were kept small its 
far better to have parents clamoring for a few excellent programs 
than to offer lots of poor choices 
when i hear about a school district deciding to become a 
complete choice system in one blow i worry fliegel wrote 
and as the bush education summit approaches educators here 
greet their fame with a mix of pride and frustration 
some worry that district 4s accomplishments are being used to 
demonstrate that choice alone without additional money will fix 
the nations schools few here believe that choice is an 
educational cureall 
in the final analysis the folks in washington seem to be 
saying federal dollars arent necessary whats needed is to have 
more schools like that one said phil batton a computer and 
spanish teacher who has been at is 117 for 24 years 
i have two feelings said maria bonet director of northview 
tech a magnet school on east 116th street specializing in 
computers and writing its very positive that people are 
noticing us let them notice but send us more money

it may not spark a revolution in 
mens wear in ethiopia but for the first time in years government 
officials are being allowed to shed their uniforms 
a senior official said sunday that government employees have 
been told they may dispense with their khaki uniforms in favor of 
civilian garb in their offices and at ceremonial occasions 
the twopiece uniforms had been mandatory for employees of the 
military government the ruling party and governmentowned 
industries since 1985 
ethiopian television viewers were surprised to see members of 
the government delegation to recent talks with eritrean rebels in 
atlanta dressed in suits and ties a fashion long frowned on by the 
military men who seized control of the country in 1974

three decades ago a west german 
politician said german reunification was a sleeping lioness 
that would awake one day with a mighty roar 
now there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand 
to create a giant political and economic machine that could 
dominate europe 
reunification is coming closer but i cant say whether it 
will take 10 15 or 20 years says west german conservative 
lawmaker eduard lintner we have the impression that things are 
much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago 
the daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing east german 
leader erich honeckers hardline communist rule for the capitalist 
west has revived international interest in the debate 
once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream the idea of german 
reunification has gotten a public nod from president bush and 
something short of a categorical no from president mikhail s 
gorbachev of the soviet union 
the idea makes east german leaders virtually apopletic 
if there were a free choice under the present circumstances in 
the german democratic republic east germany certainly 80 percent 
to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the 
federal republic of germany added the 44yearold lintner in an 
associated press interview 
the west german constitution calls for a united germany but it 
has not been a paramount concern of the west germans in the years 
since the ruins of nazi germany were divided into east and west at 
the end of world war ii 
full national reunification would completey rework the postwar 
european order mapped out by the conquering allies it is a 
prospect that creates unease in britain and france and in poland 
in the east bloc 
londons prestigious sunday times on sept 10 mapped out a 
possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in europe 
honeckers death and further westernization of poland and hungary 
moscow unilaterally abolishes the warsaw pact after guarantees 
from poland and hungary they will not join other alliances the 
times futuristic view continued west germany withdraws from 
nato and a referendum in both east and west germany votes for 
reunification and neutrality 
that sort of talk is being heard more and more as moscow loosens 
its hold on the east bloc and countries like the soviet union 
poland and hungary explore democratic reforms 
the implications of pulling down the berlin wall and other 
barriers to link the two german states are enormous and for many 
ominous 
as much of western europe heads towards its own unification in 
1992 the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further 
to the german side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people 
611 million west germans and 166 million east germans 
west germany is already europes largest exporting nation and 
despite its many flaws east germanys economy is the envy of many 
soviet bloc neighbors 
a unified germany could become the political focal point of a 
continent already in flux as democratic movements sweep parts of 
the soviet bloc 
older generations recall eerie echoes of nazi dictator adolf 
hitlers boasting that he had brought about the unity of the 
german nation 
eva kulesza head of research for the soviet union and eastern 
europe at the french institute of international relations says she 
believes that as far as public opinion there is new sort of 
mistrust toward germany 
this new fear of germany is linked to german economic trends 
germany is much stronger much more dynamic than france she 
added 
since west germany and east germany are at the front lines of 
two competing alliances any signs for eventual reunification would 
have to come from washington and moscow 
during a news conference last week in montana bush said that 
reunification is a matter for the germans to decide 
but he added if that reunification was worked out between 
the germanys i do not think we should view that as bad for western 
interests 
for his part gorbachev evaded the issue during a news 
conference in bonn in june saying only the situation in europe 
today was determined by historical realities 
outside germany political leaders and commentators have been 
sharply divided on the issue 
in thinking about the german question we ought not to be 
governed by old prejudices and outofdate assumptions wrote 
commentator peter jenkins in londons the independent the cold 
war was conducted in the name of freedom and today if the coming 
of freedom to east germany brings a desire for unity which finds 
its echo in the federal republic we ought not to be opposed 
willy brandt the social democrat who sought greater ties to the 
east as chancellor in the 1970s said german unity doesnt 
necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a 
hypothesis that cannot be excluded 
as talk grows in the west the positions against reunification 
almost seem to harden in east germany as people leave the country 
in nearrecord numbers more than 100000 east germans are expected 
to resettle in west germany this year leaving a gaping hole in the 
communist nations work force 
little is likely to change in east germany as long as the 
77yearold honecker and his aging comrades stay in power 
during a september 1987 visit to bonn honecker called respect 
for europes present borders a basic condition of peace 
socialism and capitalism cant be any more united than fire 
and water honecker added on the issue of reunification 
there are virtually no indications that honeckers successors 
will be inclined to democratic reforms let alone joining the 
capitalist west 
the calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear 
among some leaders of the polish solidarity movement in the 
country that suffered some of the nazis most brutal savagery 
after all the abnormal situation of the german nation 
overshadows the whole of polishgerman relations member of 
parliament adam michnik wrote on monday in the prosolidarity daily 
newspaper gazeta wyborcza which he edits 
the renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly 
prophetic words of reinhold maier a prominent west german state 
governor who later went on to head the centrist free democratic 
party 
reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness 
tired and weak indecisive people in west germany are trying not to 
disturb her sleep maier predicted in 1955 the lioness will 
one day wake up blink snap her her tail and start to roar 
still many in both east and west still agree with the 1967 quip 
by nobel prizewinning french author francois mauriac i love 
germany so much im delighted that there are two of them

the man who was captain of the tanker 
exxon valdez when it caused the nations worst oil spill now 
divides his time between lobstering on long island sound and 
meeting with lawyers preparing his defense 
joseph hazelwood has refused interviews since the accident but 
his attorneys agreed to talk to the associated press and describe 
the captains life as he awaits trial in alaska the trial is 
scheduled for oct 30 
hazelwood feels terrible about the tragic accident said 
michael chalos a prominent admiralty attorney who represents 
hazelwood 
hazelwood 42 was fired by exxon a few days after his tanker 
struck a reef in alaskas prince william sound on march 24 ripping 
its hull and releasing nearly 11 millions gallons of crude oil 
hazelwood is saddened chalos says by the environmental damage 
the harm to wildlife and the hardship it caused fishermen and 
others 
he loves alaska and had seriously considered two job offers 
there before the accident according to chalos 
chalos and another hazelwood attorney thomas russo outlined 
their clients account of the accident 
they contend the accident was the result of the failure of third 
mate gregory cousins or helmsman robert kagan or both to properly 
carry out hazelwoods orders 
they assert that hazelwood was not drunk when the accident 
occurred and said not one witness testified at the national 
transportation safety board hearings that hazelwood was intoxicated 
his blood alcohol level was tested about 10 hours after the 
grounding and found to be 0061 percent 50 percent higher than the 
legal limit for a seaman operating a vessel he has had a history 
of alcohol abuse and has lost drivers licenses in two states 
because of intoxication 
the attorneys said hazelwood had moved his ship out of shipping 
lanes to maneuver around ice they said he told cousins to bring 
the tanker back into the lanes and went to his cabin to do paper 
work but the return to the shipping lanes was delayed and cousins 
directions to set the rudder to clear the reef were not carried out 
hazelwood now faces up to 12 years in prison and 150000 fines 
if convicted of the criminal charges of reckless conduct which 
resulted in the spill 
he has a very positive outlook on life although he is 
apprehensive about the upcoming trial said chalos a schoolmate 
of hazelwoods at new york maritime college at fort schuyler 
he hopes the people of alaska havent prejudged him on the 
inaccurate reports theyve read in the newspapers and seen on 
television he said 
in the meantime hazelwood has faded into a quiet life at home 
in the treelined community of huntington on the north shore of 
long island about 50 miles from manhattan he his wife suzanne 
and their 13yearold daughter alison have kept pretty much to 
themselves occasionally inviting friends and family over for a 
barbecue 
his spirits are good he has received hundreds of letters from 
alaska and around the world many of them from children the 
letters have become more supportive in recent months 
to relax he enjoys sailing his 16foot catamaran he also is an 
avid reader and history buff devouring any book on the sea he is 
said to be an expert on a famous seafarer capt james cook who

theres really nothing new under the collar 
despite what may have been written about the latest in necktie 
knots 
delos hinze says he was surprised to read a newspaper story that 
touted as innovation the idea of tying a windsor knot by starting 
with the cravat insideout 
the shelby knot has caught the eye of the national press since 
being praised by a milwaukee television newsman 
ive been tying it that way for 35 years hinze said it 
just bothered me 
the novelty was supposed to have been proven by its absence from 
a reference guide from the national neckwear association of america 
called getting knotted 188 knots for necks 
but hinze dug up a booklet he got from a milwaukee clothing 
store in the 1950s and there it was on page 6 
the booklet from johnnie walkers clothing calls it a reverse 
halfwindsor 
the stores still around but the present staff isnt interested 
in laying claim to the knot 
i dont think people care too much about how they tie a tie 
said david kodner johnnie walkers vice president 
im left handed said his store manager argil zirbel so 
ive always tied it this way

more than 450 years after the church tried 
galileo galilei for heresy pope john paul ii came to the 
astronomers hometown and pronounced the words many pisans have 
longed to hear 
galileo was right and the church was wrong 
the pope had previously said the inquisition erred in condemning 
galileo for teaching that the earth revolves around the sun but 
his statements during a weekend trip to this tuscan city were 
viewed by its citizens as galileos official rehabilitation 
speaking sunday at the university of pisa where galileo studied 
and taught in the late 1500s john paul said he wanted to recall 
some of the schools illustrious alumni above all the very 
great galileo 
shortly after his arrival in pisa on friday night the pope 
stood on a bridge over the arno river illuminated by flickering 
candles and declared 
how can one not recall the name of that great man who was born 
here and from here took the first steps toward immortal fame 
galileo galilei whose scientific work imprudently opposed at 
the beginning is now recognized by all as an essential step in the 
methodology of research and in general on the path toward the 
knowledge of the world of nature 
born in 1564 galileo originally aroused antagonism when as a 
professor at the university from 1589 to 1592 he initiated 
experiments on the laws of bodies in motion which contradicted the 
accepted teachings of aristotle 
but he was most widely known for his support of the copernicus 
system which taught that the sun is the central body and the earth 
and the other planets revolve around it 
that defied the churchheld belief that the earth was the center 
of the universe 
in 1616 the church denounced the copernicus system as dangerous 
to faith summoned galileo to rome and warned him not to uphold or 
teach it 
but he published a book supporting the theory in 1632 the next 
year he was summoned to rome tried by the inquisition and forced 
to abjure his beliefs galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment 
which was later changed to house arrest he died in 1642 near 
florence 
john paul has often spoken out on galileos behalf 
in 1979 less than a year after his election as pope he urged 
the international scientific community to examine the galileo case 
saying he hoped it would help remove the diffidence that still 
prevents fruitful harmony between science and faith and between 
the church and the world 
john paul appointed a vatican commission in 1979 to study the 
case five years later the pontifical academy of sciences issued 
documents from secret vatican archives including details of the 
inquisition proceedings which uphold galileo 
in his speech at the university on sunday the pope did not 
address the galileo case specifically but he noted that religious 
faith and science have often been at odds throughout the centuries 
john paul warned of potential moral and ethical abuses of modern 
science but said faith and research are not incompatible 
the church trusts promotes and encourages your task he 
said

former hud secretary samuel r pierce faces a 
daunting legal and public relations challenge when he appears 
tuesday before a house subcommittee investigating his old agency 
say lawyers who have helped many witnesses cope with 
sometimeshostile congressional inquiries 
potential pitfalls even for the most blameless witness range 
from bad publicity to a perjury indictment 
its a very difficult forum said washington lawyer abbe 
david lowell there are fewer rules to protect witnesses than in 
a court or even a grand jury the power structure is very 
onesided 
pierce has been subpoenaed by the house government operations 
subcommittee to testify about alleged influencepeddling and 
mismanagement at the department of housing and urban development 
an agency he ran for eight years 
paul l perito one of pierces lawyers has questioned the 
subcommittees fairness and complained that there is not enough 
time to prepare pierce to testify 
while not disclosing specific strategies perito said i 
assure you i am not going to let my client get kicked around 
perito said the house panel seems to have made up its mind 
that my client was involved in some wrongdoing despite the fact 
there is not a shred of evidence to support such a finding 
in light of this i must consider every viable and reasonable 
professional option perito said 
the associated press asked expert lawyers what advice they would 
give to pierce their advice 
listen to the questions and limit any answer to what you know 
to be the facts do not be afraid of qualifying any answer 
anticipate what might be asked and focus on the facts known 
about those issues 
be prepared to tell your story in a clear concise and 
consistent way 
be aware of potential criminal charges and of your right to 
invoke the fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination 
be aware of the news media attention your appearance will 
generate 
the subcommittee is expected to question pierce about his role 
in a number of controversial agency decisions to provide funding 
for projects supported by wellconnected republicans 
to some degree its like preparing for any testimony said 
james hamilton a washington lawyer who 16 years ago served as 
assistant chief counsel of the senate committee investigating the 
watergate scandal but there are peculiarities of the forum with 
which you must deal 
justin simon another washington lawyer who has represented 
congressional witnesses noted that pierces legal team already has 
laid a foundation for the former cabinet officers refusal to 
cooperate with the house panel 
only in rare circumstances would it be advisable for an 
individual who has potential criminal exposure to testify he 
said 
by maintaining that congress is not allowing enough time to 
determine whether their client has a criminal problem it becomes 
very reasonable for a witness to rely on his fifth amendment right 
even if convinced he did nothing wrong simon said 
if pierce invokes his right not to answer the panels questions 
simon added he has to bite the bullet and take the adverse 
publicity it may raise the specter although in theory it should 
not that the guy has something to hide 
late friday pierce exercised his right under house rules for 
any subpoenaed witness to have all news media cameras and 
microphones banned from the hearing room simon said that if he 
were advising pierce he too would have advocated that move 
another option is testifying in executive session with the 
public excluded but that tack is subject to the subcommittees 
discretion 
its important for a witness lawyer to know the rules of the 
particular committee said hamilton for example can the 
witness make an opening statement 
lowell said the paucity of ground rules forces a witness lawyer 
to be more aggressive 
attorneys like brendan sullivan who was often combative when 
representing oliver north during testimony before a congressional 
committee about the irancontra affair often have to depend on 
the strength of their will to protect their clients lowell said 
simon agreed noting that in congress unlike in court there 
are very few restrictions on what are viewed as relevant questions 
almost anything is relevant in this forum 
the experts said pierce if he chooses to testify faces a 
thorny problem the threat of being accused of perjury if his 
memory fails him or he falls into what simon called the common trap 
of remembering things in a way that reflects favorably on you 
and if his testimony disagrees with that of another witness 
its a matter of who is believed simon said

central americas shifting political landscape 
has produced a more tolerant us attitude toward nicaraguas 
leftist government and deepening hostility toward some contra 
rebels who once enjoyed redcarpet access here according to us 
and rebel sources 
the changed attitude toward the sandinista government has been 
subtle compared with the mutual recriminations and fingerpointing 
that now characterize the relationship between the state department 
and some elements of nicaraguas exiled opposition 
by deemphasizing military pressure against the sandinista 
government the united states has moved away from the 
confrontational policies of the reagan administration and is now 
pursuing peaceful but guarded coexistence 
the shift has embittered some contras no one in the 
resistance trusts the state department says bosco matamoros a 
rebel spokesman who is closely allied with veteran contra leader 
adolfo calero 
calero was once a regular visitor to the white house and the 
state department during the reagan years but nowadays is treated 
almost as an outcast by the bush administration 
matamoros maintains that the state department has refused even 
to answer rebel correspondence while abandoning the reagan 
administration policy of avoiding all substantive contact with 
sandinista leaders when a congressional delegation met recently 
with president daniel ortega a top state department official 
participated 
amid the ongoing debate over when the contras should disband 
matamoros said the state department seems more interested than 
the sandinistas in demobilizing the resistance 
one continuing source of concern for the administration is 
soviet bloc military aid for the sandinistas estimated at 350 
million for the first eight months of this year 
the administration view is that the contra leadership mantle has 
passed from miamibased civilians to battlehardened contra field 
commanders who have risen through the ranks and are far more 
qualified to represent the armed opposition to the sandinistas 
officials talk disdainfully of the us taxpayerfinanced contra 
bureaucracy which has operated for years in miami matamoros 
accused state department officials of grossly exaggerating the size 
of the contras paid staff 
by turning its back on contra civilian leaders who have refused 
to return to the region and by favoring the emerging military 
commanders within the resistance matamoros says the bush 
administration is tacitly advocating a military coup despite its 
stated preference for civilian supremacy 
the administrations twin objectives for nicaragua are to 
support the internal opposition there as the country gears up for 
national elections and to keep the armed resistance intact until 
after the feb 25 balloting 
the bulk of the rebel force is based at camps along the honduran 
border living off ussupplied humanitarian assistance 
central american presidents have called for the demobilization 
of the rebels by dec 5 but the bush administration regards that 
deadline as irrelevant because the presidents also said that any 
such process must be voluntary 
the administration believes that the presence of rebel forces 
along the border serves as an incentive for the sandinistas to 
fulfill their promise of a free and fair election 
at the same time the bush administration is trying to devise a 
way to assist nicaraguas fledgling democratic process without 
providing direct support to the campaign of the principal 
opposition candidate violeta chamorro meanwhile the 
administration seems willing to live with a sandinista victory 
provided the process is reasonably honest 
calero likens the more permissive us attitude toward the 
sandinistas to the appeasement policies that led to world war ii 
rather than pressing for military assistance secretary of 
state james a baker joked about relocating the contras to his 
texas ranch calero has written 
such an attitude he said could deprive nicaragua of democracy 
while damaging us security interests in region

lawmakers thrashing out a fiscal 1990 defense 
plan are looking toward senate action on a military spending bill 
to help break the impasse over president bushs budget request for 
strategic weapons 
house and senate conferees meeting behind closed doors on 
authorization legislation have made no progress on resolving their 
differences over funding levels for star wars landbased nuclear 
missiles and the b2 stealth bomber 
complaints rather than agreement have emerged after three 
weeks of negotiations 
the senate still hasnt learned to do math said rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo one of the house conferees they 
want everything and take it off somebody elses budget 
the thing is going nowhere rep john kasich rohio 
another house conferee said friday 
sen james exon dneb said the house came to the negotiations 
with a series of votes that were all over the lot they both 
accepted and rejected every strategic program 
this is one of the most difficult ones conferences ive ever 
been in he added 
initially the house and senate were far apart on the major 
strategic programs 
on star wars the senate approved 45 billion a slight cut in 
bushs request of 49 billion the house adopted a budget of 31 
billion for the missile shield 
on the multiplewarhead railgarrison mx missile the senate 
endorsed bushs request of 11 billion for the mx and 100 million 
for the midgetman the house cut 502 million from the mx program 
and eliminated all money for the midgetman 
the senate made a modest cut of 300 million in bushs 47 
billion proposal for the stealth bomber the batwinged aircraft 
that at a cost of 530 million a copy has caused sticker shock the 
house limited production of the radarevading plane to four over 
the next two years half of what the administration requested 
last week the house presented a revised proposal that restored 
the mx money left out the midgetman and called for the chambers 
lower funding total on star wars according to congressional 
sources the senate rejected the plan 
a counterproposal that left the original senate bill relatively 
intact was quickly turned down by the house 
setting the tone for future housesenate negotiations on 
strategic weapons will be senate action scheduled to get under way 
today on a 2882 billion military spending bill the senate 
appropriations committee approved about 37 billion for the 
pentagons star wars program which amounts to last years level 
plus inflation 
senate republicans are expected to introduce amendments to raise 
the funding level for star wars formally known as the strategic 
defense initiative to at least something closer to the 
authorization total but their efforts may have been hurt by a 
statement from the administration released friday 
the office of management and budget complained about the 
restrictive language the appropriations committee put into the bill 
which requires that 820 million of the 37 billion be used for 
research on laser and particle beams 
sen bennett johnston dla sponsor of the amendment 
expressed concerns that the administration will sacrifice longterm 
research on directed energy weapons in favor of a quick deployment 
along the lines of the socalled brilliant pebbles scheme 
favored by many in the administration 
in its statement the administration urged restoration of the 
requested funding levels and removal of the restrictive sdi 
language but unlike a previous statement on the house 
appropriations legislation there was no veto threat 
that will be a key test vote exon said once the senate 
speaks on that issue it puts into cement what the figure would be 
and the hope according to exon is that a decision on star wars 
will trigger a chain reaction of agreement on the other strategic 
programs 
once the sdi number is resolved others will not easily fall in 
place but likely will he said

the commander of the local army 
garrison knows the guerrillas will be back 
they have attacked this mudbrick town a few miles from a major 
air base three times this year but have not taken it after each 
foray they evaporate into the hills or surrounding villages 
it is a tactic repeated throughout most of the country 
they are not so near as they were before but i dont know 
exactly where they are col mobine nurzi told reporters flown to 
shindand this month to refute guerrilla claims of capturing it 
he said at least 100 guerrillas were killed in the latest 
weeklong assault on shindand about 425 miles southwest of the 
capital city of kabul and about 90 miles east of the border with 
iran where some guerrillas are based 
but one soldier told reporters they really pounded us before 
withdrawing how do we know how many were killed 
after the soviets withdrew their troops in february the 
usbacked guerrillas were predicting their easy capture of 
provincial centers like jalalabad if not kabul itself 
now seven months later their military campaigns remain 
primarily the hitandrun attacks that successfully drove the 
soviets out 
but guerrilla tactics are not going to win the guerrillas a 
civil war against the kabul government or even much leverage at the 
bargaining table 
and the fatigue with the war rampant in the civilian population 
after 10 years of fighting and 1 million deaths is also infecting 
the mujahedeen guerrillas or islamic holy warriors 
the mujahedeen have the capacity to harass the kabul 
government but they are not going to win the war said an asian 
diplomat speaking on condition on anonymity 
the average commander the average fighter is tired said 
one un official there is battle fatigue there is no doubt 
yet the war wears on and the mujahedeen control most of the 
countryside 
pilots on the runway in the southern city of kandahar fearing 
guerrilla rockets taxi at 100 mph 
troops at the last checkpoint in north kabul before the salang 
highway the supply lifeline from the soviet union report it was 
recently closed by guerrilla attacks for a few hours on several 
occassions 
there is constant lowlevel combat that occasionally flares into 
fullscale battles 
at the daily press briefings the government spokesman reports a 
litany of sweeping and mopping up operations throughout the 
provinces bordering pakistan where most of the mujahedeen are 
headquartered 
the repetition indicates the mujahedeen cannot be swept away but 
that the government is confident they can be kept at bay for the 
most part 
despite the attempts of the extremists the situation in the 
country is by and large calm president najib recently told a 
group of foreign visitors 
he referred with bravado to the massive supply convoy that just 
arrived in kandahar such a convoy rarely could exist even in the 
presence of the soviet troops 
but weeks of conflicting reports about when the 1000 or so 
vehicles would arrive indicated it had run into trouble 
mahmoud baryalai the first deputy prime minister in charge of 
supplies said earlier that the group of trucks was bogged down by 
guerrilla rocket fire on the last 90 miles before kandahar 
it was not constant he said but prevented moving ahead 
the mujahedeen claimed to have knocked out 110 trucks while the 
government said it lost three trucks and a tank it said a years 
supply of ammunition got through 
the convoy apparently veered off hundreds of miles into the 
desert to avoid the attacks eventually taking more than three 
weeks to cover the 360 miles from the town of torgundi on the 
soviet border 
while sporadic attacks can interrupt supply routes the 
guerrillas have been unable to take a major town 
a concerted attack on khost about 24 miles from the pakistani 
border threatened the city briefly late last month but diplomats 
said the mujahedeen lacked the sustained supply routes needed to 
overcome government forces surrounded by dense minefields and tanks 
it is difficult for the mujahedeen to capture anything said 
another asian diplomat in kabul they were trained as a guerrilla 
force and they are trained to make conventional attacks they lack 
heavy artillery air support 
the government uses both heavily dawn in kabul is punctuated by 
outgoing scud and other missiles spotting scud trails at night is 
a favorite activity at diplomatic parties 
the scuds with a range of 180 miles are used against mujahedeen 
positions along the border 
to knock out guerrilla positions around kabul frog7 missiles 
with a range of about 48 miles were deployed late last month 
the continental hotel where most foreigners stay shakes daily 
from a nearby missile battery 
the mujahedeen leaders in pakistan have so far refused 
negotiations but there are only six weeks left before winter 
weather sets in and most military activity stops because mountain 
trails are impassable 
said one ambassador quoting a visiting englishman during the 
wars of the last century the only time the afghans are at peace 
is when they are fighting

as a caricature the entomologist is often 
portrayed as a wispy bespectacled man wearing tropical shorts and 
pith helmet chasing exotic butterflies with a longhandled net 
sure some of them do things like that but many others perform 
painstaking work that nonentomologists would see as sheer drudgery 
the meticulous slow work of scientists 
they save us a lot of grief says henry becker iii an 
information specialist in the agriculture departments main science 
agency the agricultural research service they certainly make 
life easier for us by studying these insects the good ones as well 
as the bad ones 
becker in a recent telephone interview from his beltsville 
md office is one of those attending a twoday conference in 
washington on tuesday and wednesday that will commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of the entomological society of america 
entomologists are intense about their experiments he said for 
example when they observe a parasite lay eggs in a destructive 
beetle for example its like theyre watching their kids do a 
virtuoso concert they really get excited 
but some entomological research is so plodding such as 
categorizing and cataloging insects becker said but yet 
theyre very very interested in what theyre doing 
todays society dates from the founding in 1889 of the american 
association of economic entomologists and the 1906 beginning of 
the entomological society of america the two were merged adopting 
the latters name in 1953 
the society a nonprofit educational group says it is the 
largest international association of entomologists with more than 
8700 members 
becker who claims his only experience with entomology is 
swatting flies and spraying cockroaches said the society hopes 
for an attendance of around 350 at its centennial symposium this 
week some members from britain canada and australia are expected 
to attend the sessions held at the smithsonian institution 
julius j menn associate deputy area director for the plant 
sciences institute at usdas research center in beltsville said 
the symposium is unique in that it is directed at an intended 
audience of decision makers who are not familiar with 
entomology 
menn said the sessions will be geared to legislators federal 
and state officials industrial representatives news media and 
other nonentomological persons 
allen l steinhauer head of the university of marylands 
department of entomology college park said more than 15 
authorities on all aspects of insectrelated research worldwide 
are on the program 
a few of the program highlights provided by the society which 
calls itself esa illustrate what steinhauer meant 
in the first session carroll m williams of harvard university 
will talk about unraveling the secrets of insect life williams 
is a pioneer researcher of insect development biology 
he developed several novel techniques for performing surgery 
on insects the society said one which uses carbon dioxide 
anesthesia was adopted the world over 
thomas eisner cornell university is the worlds leading 
authority on insect defenses and communication his topic is the 
insect as a chemist describing the ingenious ways insects use 
odors poisons plants and disguises to repel or injure a predator 
societies insect and human is the topic of edward o 
wilson harvard university who is called the father of modern 
sociobiology and is an expert on ants he says biological laws are 
the basis of social behavior among ants and humans wilson won a 
pulitzer prize for general nonfiction in 1979 for on human 
nature about the influence of genetically determined pattens of 
human behavior 
other sessions will include talks on entomology in the 
developing world insects in agriculture the impacts of insects on 
public health applying biotechnology to entomology and policies 
for the future 
looking ahead donald l mclean of the university of vermont 
will describe entomology in the 21st century he is an expert on 
the relationship between several insects and the diseases they 
cause on many important crops

the agriculture department has a hotline for 
foliage watchers 
stanley krugman director of timber management research for the 
departments forest service said the hotline carries a recorded 
message featuring areas of especially beautiful fall color as 
they occur in national forests throughout the united states 
the hotline began operation on sept 15 and will continue 
through the fall season he said the number is 202 4753780 
krugman said some pockets of fall color are occurring earlier 
than usual this year which could be due to unusual temperatures 
moisture or drought 
where i live in northern virginia the wet spring and early 
summer followed by almost droughtlike conditions in august have 
triggered some early fall color especially at the higher 
elevations he said 
but most color changes are caused by the longer nights and 
shorter days 
most people think frost plays a major role in the beautiful 
colors krugman said cooler weather can be a factor but color 
changes are primarily brought on by the increasing hours of 
darkness that accompany the fall season 
many of the vivid colors are in the leaves yearround but are 
hidden by dominant green color during the summer months as autumn 
approaches the chlorophylls which produce the green as sunlight 
is used to produce plant food decrease and the other pigments are 
apparent 
new england is famed for its foliage splendor but krugman said 
there are opportunities for viewing magnificent colors in most of 
the states michigan alone offers 65 species of trees that produce 
color more than any other state he said 
the rocky mountains offer the splendor of the quaking aspen and 
the pacific northwest has the western larch which krugman said is 
an unusual deciduous conifer whose needles turn yellow and drop 
from the tree

a good number of soviet military caps have 
been added to the collection of adm william j crowe chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff and a swordwielding statue of mother 
russia stands guard on his pentagon desk 
but the nations premier military leader says that despite the 
new spirit of ussoviet cooperation hes helped foster america 
must be aware that soviet military power has not abated 
the same thing we feared for years is essentially still 
there the admiral observed in an hourlong interview looking 
back over his 43 years in active duty 
this week marks the end of crowes fouryear tenure as chairman 
and principal military advisor to the president president bush is 
scheduled to attend a last salute to crowe on friday at the us 
naval academy in annapolis md the admirals alma mater 
army gen colin powell was confirmed by the senate last week to 
succeed crowe on oct 1 at 52 powell is the youngest person and 
first black to hold the post 
much has changed during his time in the military the admiral 
noted 
when i came to the naval academy you never heard of lasers 
you never heard of nuclear power you never heard of missiles you 
never heard of pantyhose you never heard of vcrs and you didnt 
have very sophisticated deodorants crowe said the last item in 
particular he said with a laugh has made an amazing improvement 
in the quality of life aboard navy ships 
the admirals job switch comes as crowe has put in motion some 
of the most extensive militarytomilitary exchanges with the 
soviets since the two nations were allies in world war ii 
crowe also has overseen the introduction of congressionally 
ordered reforms that made him the leader of the chiefs of the 
nations military services not just their spokesman 
the 64yearold admiral spent 10 days in the soviet union in 
june and hosted a visit to the united states last year by his 
soviet counterpart marshal sergei akhromeyev 
the admiral whose speech still bears a twang from his oklahoma 
roots adopted an affectionate tone when he spoke of his 
counterpart 
ive become very friendly with marshal akhromeyev ive 
enjoyed my association with him my talks with him his wisdom and 
his feeling for his country the admiral said the two men intend 
to continue their contacts even after he leaves office he added 
crowe was able to see military facilities that had been barred 
to westerners for years he visited sites that drove home the 
soviets huge losses in world war ii such as the massive statue 
that marks the lengthy battle with the nazis for stalingrad a 
turning point in the war 
thats the memorial mother russia crowe said as he 
pointed to the replica figure on his desk the sternlooking woman 
holding high a saber is exhorting her sons to rise in the defense 
of their homeland its so big you can see it for miles crowe 
recalled 
the admiral said his outstanding impression from the exchange is 
that people in both nations enjoy a lot in common they want to 
live in peace they want their families to be better off they want 
their children to have a better life than they did 
but the chairman noted that despite soviet president mikhail 
gorbachevs touted military budget cuts and troop and tank 
withdrawals very little has changed theyve just put it in 
different places 
asked about the dramatic reforms attempted by gorbachev crowe 
said he thinks the superpower is in flux economically socially 
politically and securitywise 
they dont know what theyre doin theyve got a vision 
but they dont know how to engineer it theyre feeling their way 
as they go crowe said 
this has led to frustrations and uncertainty including doubts 
about how long gorbachev and his supporters can continue to be 
solidly entrenched in power when his goals are not achieved 
my instincts tell me that we exaggerate this problem 
crowe said adding that he also believes americans exaggerate 
their power 
he hastened to add however that this is a characteristic of 
all militaries you exaggerate the other fellows power and 
underestimate your own 
while crowe was the object of some criticism earlier this year 
for saying that he does not view the soviets as an enemy the 
chairman said he stands by that statement but he emphasized that 
he continues to view the soviet union as a potential adversary 
the admiral said he likes to quote a general who says america 
shouldnt teach its military to have an enemy but to know whats 
worth livin for whats worth dyin for whats worth fightin for 
in this country 
if we cant perform a function unless we have an enemy and 
somebody to hate then were in pretty bad shape the admiral 
said

private groups hosted events last year at 
blair house without paying the government for use of the 
presidential guest house according to a state department report 
critical of the facilitys management 
the report prepared by the departments inspector general late 
last year also says a number of blair house employees had not 
undergone security background investigations notwithstanding the 
fact that the united states governments most important guests are 
lodged in it and sensitive meetings take place there 
a copy of the report which was released in january was 
obtained by the associated press under the freedom of information 
act 
kathleen mullen executive director of the state departments 
office of protocol said many recommendations in the 12page report 
have been put into place security checks for instance were 
finished before the final draft of the report was released she 
said 
those without clearances included the curators assistant three 
management personnel and 49 contract employees who worked only 
during official visits the report said 
additionally some contract maintenance employees who were 
supposed to have an escort in blair house were seen walking 
unescorted in the building the report said 
blair house which consists of four connected town houses on 
pennsylvania avenue across from the white house traditionally has 
been managed by the state department under the chief of protocol 
an associate department curator who is in charge of arts and 
antiques at the historic 115room house also works there 
blair house was closed for restoration between 1982 and 
mid1988 the first foreign visitor to stay in the refurbished 
house came in september 1988 
anthony quainton the deputy inspector general who wrote the 
report said several nonofficial groups some of which included 
donors to the restoration project have hosted events at blair 
house 
the chief of protocol approved the events under the proper 
guidelines but the groups were not charged for use of the building 
because of a loophole created by the departments legal adviser 
quainton recommended establishing firm procedures for 
reservations billing and payment by private sources 
selwa roosevelt chief of protocol in the reagan administration 
said that when the house was reopened the blair house restoration 
fund the private charitable organization established to channel 
gifts to blair house was allowed to host a series of events to 
give everyone who participated a chance to see this wonderful 
project 
other than groups arranged by the fund no private organizations 
were allowed to use the house 
the fund raised about 5 million for the 13 million blair house 
restoration some 4 million of the privately raised money paid for 
furniture draperies carpets and upholstery 
quainton suggested a number of changes to ensure the 
hotelcummuseum be maintained properly and operate smoothly in 
1989 when as many as 30 official visits from foreign dignitaries 
were expected and beyond 
quainton reported that 
extreme tension arose between the blair house managers who 
sought to run a firstclass hotel and the departments 
associate curator who emphasized the museum nature of the 
facility 
housekeeping decisions down to questions of dusting and 
silver polishing techniques have become contentious the report 
said 
clement conger the departments curator said the problems 
stemmed from personality conflicts between blair house managers and 
the former associate curator who has resigned 
blair house is leanly staffed at periods of full activity 
at such times management will be running an exclusive 30bed 
hotel catering state dinners and luncheons and providing routine 
meals valet and personal services to highranking delegations 
between guests the house is used by top government officials 
usually for official functions 
procurement procedures were haphazard at best the report 
said a relatively inexperienced and untrained junior employee 
with no background in financial management handled most 
government expenditures private money raised to support blair 
house was comingled with government funds and one account had 
been reduced to 5 
the report recommended appointment of a financial manager 
consolidation of budget accounts and an increase in the amount of 
money allocated to blair house to ensure it is properly maintained

this city has lost one of its most effective 
soldiers in the war on drugs and it hardly noticed 
a drug traffickers bullet that pierced the throat of rafael 
orelle pazo in july ended the 13year career of one of miamis most 
productive undercover informants drug enforcement officials said 
this week 
orelle a 44yearold cuban immigrant who never had a formal 
education began undercover operations that resulted in hundreds of 
arrests and removed at least a ton of cocaine from the streets 
officials said 
no one worked like rafael said peter sarron a drug 
enforcement administration agent who worked with orelle daily for 
the past five years 
orelle died without fanfare but his life offered an unusual 
glimpse into the methods of drug enforcement 
dea agents said the risky activities of people like orelle are 
the only way to penetrate smugglers shadowy networks 
he was an inspiration to the dea said spokesman lynn 
wheeler he knew the danger was there but he still came through 
with all this information day after day year after year 
the agency agreed to rare interviews on the subject because 
officials considered orelle a cut above other informants 
quite often the people who assist us in narcotics cases are 
not pillars of the community said dea spokesman john fernandes 
describing orelle as an exception he was just a concerned 
citizen 
a short balding man who walked with a limp after being stricken 
with polio as an infant orelle had to wear a weightlifting belt to 
support his bad back and considerable paunch 
born in poverty and unable to read or write orelle eventually 
would make more than 50000 a year supplying information 
his undercover career began in 1976 when he was hired to lay 
tile in the home of a major marijuana trafficker and saw piles of 
cash and a roomsize safe being installed under the garage 
he came to the dea and offered his services said coral 
gables lt harold hopkin we gave him 500 
after police seized 23 tons of pot and sent the trafficker to 
prison orelle found regular work with miamiarea police and 
federal agents 
according to court records orelle didnt always operate on the 
right side of the law 
in 1967 when he was struggling to find construction work to pay 
his rent he was charged in a dozen burglaries orelle pleaded 
innocent by reason of insanity and spent a year in a mental 
hospital 
in 1979 orelle and another informant were caught impersonating 
police officers and offering to fix the case of an accused drug 
trafficker for 7000 
orelle pleaded guilty to a lesser theft charge and was paroled 
state prosecutors told police they no longer considered him a 
trustworthy informant effectively blackballing him from dade 
county courts 
but because of his value we began working with him again 
said the deas sarron 
during the past five years the period for which records were 
available orelle initiated about 50 cases leading to 150 arrests 
thanks to his efforts agents seized about 2 million in cash 3 
million in property tons of marijuana more than 1000 kilos of 
cocaine and a quartermillion illegal sedatives 
but orelles identity became more known among dealers in miamis 
latin community each time he testified in court 
it always amazed a lot of us that he stayed alive so long 
said jerome sanford a public defender who first met orelle in 
1977 when sanford was a prosecutor 
it all caught up with him july 14 
working with sarron and dea agent kevin stephens orelle posed 
as a dealer wanting to buy 20 kilos of cocaine from jose peralta 
an accused smuggler 
before they could discuss prices peralta and a gunman octavio 
sanchez fired a spray of bullets authorities said a slug 
matching sanchez gun hit orelle in the throat said prosecutor 
michael cornely 
orelle bled to death 
sanchez peralta and his alleged getaway driver have been jailed 
and face firstdegree murder and cocainetrafficking charges 
isabelle orelle the informants 43yearold widow says her 
three teenage children remain fiercely proud of their father 
her 16yearold son wants to be a dea agent when he grows up 
im trying to get his mind off it mrs orelle said i 
tell him im going to live the rest of my life in fear and your 
wife and kids will be the same you can do something about drugs in 
other ways

the lines already are drawn and they dont 
give beleaguered parents a lot of hope that the education summit 
between president bush and the nations governors will produce more 
than the familiar political posturing over the need to improve 
schools 
well in advance of wednesdays opening of the twoday summit 
the white house was emphasizing the need for leadership and 
new ideas new york gov mario cuomo and many of his 
counterparts were responding send money 
the likelihood is that it will take a lot of both to upgrade 
schools 
most americans agree that education is too important to be left 
to educators now the charlottesville va summit will focus 
attention on whether politicians are up to the task 
the most optimistic prospect is that the president his cabinet 
and the governors will sit down and have a serious exchange of 
ideas as the officials at the table who are the closest to the 
problem the governors can give the president plenty of examples of 
what works and what doesnt 
they have experience finding the improvements that can be made 
within the context of strained budgets 
the white house also is emphasizing the fact this is only the 
third time in history a president has convened a summit with the 
nations governors the first took place in 1908 when theodore 
roosevelt summoned the governors to discuss ways to preserve 
natural resources twentyfive years later franklin d roosevelt 
convened a summit to discuss ways to deal with the depression 
by stressing the historic significance of the meeting white 
house aides and governors hope the meeting will mobilize public 
support for strong action to improve schools 
most americans still believe that when we talk about a crisis 
in education we are talking about someone elses kid in some other 
school said gov thomas kean of new jersey a republican who has 
been in the forefront of educational reform 
if the presidential summit can turn that attitude around and 
highlight the need for a national focus on education that will be 
a major achievement said kean 
it may take more than a twoday summit to change that attitude 
at a time when the issue of drugs dwarfs all other concerns 
drugs are so dominant in terms of the agenda im not sure any 
of the other things pop up said pollster peter hart im not 
sure the public is going to pay attention 
while skeptical of the prospects that the summit can grab a 
share of public attention from drugs hart said its as good a way 
as any to try 
it certainly makes the issue a lot more important he said 
but if the elements are present for a successful meeting so too 
are they present for a session dominated by politicking 
the president finds it hard to resist his read my lips 
rhetoric on spending and taxes drawing lines that dont 
necessarily permit consideration of a proposals merits 
arguing with congressional democrats over differing proposals to 
combat drug abuse bush told a news conference in montana last 
week theres a certain frustration level when we come out with a 
sound program and two answers come out spend more and raise 
taxes 
the democrats often leave the impression they are obsessed with 
a need to define themselves and their role in dealing with national 
problems 
not invited to the economic summit were the democrats who 
control congress they responded by announcing six national goals 
for educational excellence 
bush wants to be known as the education president but sen 
edward m kennedy dmass said we intend to do all we can to 
see that this congress matches him by becoming the education 
congress 
the structure of the summit was designed by the white house and 
is geared to assure that the president is the dominant figure the 
only formal sessions open for press coverage will be bush speeches 
its a format that has governors uneasy and looking for ways to 
make their views known the result could be a circus atmosphere as 
governors mingle with the press corps and invite questions 
no one is predicting the summit will produce any quick answers 
or even an agenda for progress in education what all sides appear 
to want is a meeting that will energize federal and state officials 
to work together in the future with an awareness that their bosses 
are committed to accomplishing something

when they put up a 300ton egyptian obelisk in 
st peters square more than 400 years ago it was such a delicate 
operation that pope sixtus v pronounced a sentence of death in 
advance against anyone who let out a peep as it was pulled from the 
ground 
the normally noisy roman crowd was silent as the winches creaked 
and 140 horses panted then things began to slip and the whole 
project was in danger including the 2800yearold obelisk 
the voice of an italian sailor broke the silence 
throw water on the ropes he yelled 
they did ropes tightened around the capstans and the obelisk 
began to rise again it is still there not only was the obelisk 
saved and the sailor reprieved but his village got the exclusive 
right to sell palm fronds in the square on palm sunday 
that was the story told by richard wallace professor of art 
history at wellesley college who helped select work for the show 
called italian etchers of the renaissance and baroque it 
opened sunday at the national gallery of art to begin the fall 
season wallace said he believed the village still enjoys its 
privilege 
one of the etchings natale bonifacios moving the vatican 
obelisk does not exactly prove the story but it does show the 
huge engineering job in tiny detail horses strain workmen help 
there were 800 of them and one seated on the tip of the obelisk 
guides the most important rope 
the exhibit has 135 etchings made between 1520 and 1700 
some of the etchers were also famous painters like michelangelo 
caravaggio claude lorrain luca giordano annibale caracci and 
salvatore rosa others are little known even to specialists 
bonifacio is not believed to have done any paintings 
wallace explained to reporters that etching was one of the first 
ways of making art available in many copies 20 to 50 from each 
copper plate it was also a handy way for poor artists to make 
money 
many of the plates are still in rome in the storehouse called 
the calcografia wallace said that until the 1970s employees 
there for a small fee would print a fresh but greatly inferior 
copy from selected plates he added that for an even smaller fee 
they would leave off the stamp certifying it as a late copy so an 
unscrupulous purchaser could sell it to an inexperienced collector 
as an original 
then a new director stopped the practice 
before etching became popular some artists made engravings by 
cutting a metal plate with a metal tool but an etcher could just 
draw with a needle on a soft covering like paint called a 
ground which was spread over the plate then he or she would 
let acid eat into the metal through the lines that the needle had 
drawn the grooves could then hold ink for printing 
ive done both wallace said etching is easier than 
penandink drawing especially with a quill pen engraving is like 
plowing etching is like ice skating

the jacaranda petals went limp with 
water a buddhist monk gave the yellow flower a quick shake and the 
prayer service began 
chants filled the vault of ashes hands clasped in front of him 
pun samaly bowed three times for the soul of his mother 
a khmer rouge guerrilla attack killed her in july while she was 
on a trip to her native village 
samaly joined by brothers sisters neighbors his wife and 
daughter gathered over the weekend in a riverside pagoda to 
commemorate her death 
i only hope the death like the one suffered by my mother can 
stop in this country samaly said speaking in french as he sat 
on a straw mat facing a small silver urn that held his mothers 
ashes 
but all we little people can really do is pray 
in cambodia the last two weeks in september are called the 
phumben a buddhist holiday to remember the dead throughout this 
predominantly buddhist nation of 8 million families flock to 
pagodas to burn joss sticks bow chant and sit for the souls of 
their ancestors 
but many too are praying not just for the past but also for 
the future said kah ramh an elderly monk at the pagoda this 
is an important time we are facing now 
this year the festival for the dead coincides with the announced 
withdrawal of the last 26000 of vietnams soldiers from cambodia 
vietnam invaded its neighbor almost 11 years ago ousting the 
ultraradical khmer rouge government and replacing it with a 
prohanoi regime 
vietnam says it lost 55000 soldiers in their battles with the 
khmer rouge cambodia says it lost 20000 
now with the vietnamese saying their last soldier will be out 
by tuesday many cambodians are worried that their country will 
again slide into civil war 
already there are reports of fierce fighting on the thai border 
and the government is acknowledging that khmer rouge forces hold 
some territory 
on sunday when the samalys prayed the pagoda was packed 
today it was deserted as hundreds of troop trucks carrying 
vietnamese soldiers rumbled by 
we must always remember the old woman samaly said one of 
her neighbors during the prayers any of us could have died like 
her we must never forget 
an elderly nun sitting among the samaly clan lit some incense 
and a sweet smell hung low in the air cool and wet in the 
underground darkness 
the vault of ashes used to be filled with the urns of hundreds 
of cambodians but during the khmer rouge rule from 1975 to 1978 it 
like all the other pagodas in cambodia was cleared out and used as 
a warehouse 
now the small wood and glass cases are slowly being graced 
again with the mementos of the dead a photograph and a candle a 
lithograph and a flower 
during the khmer rouge regime all monks were defrocked and 
thousands were killed when the provietnamese government was 
installed it brought buddhism back but persecution continued 
pagodas were taxed by the state and only men over 55 could 
become monks only in the past year has the government allowed its 
people to actively return to the practice of buddhism 
since mid1988 staterun radio has been broadcasting buddhist 
prayers state leaders including prime minister hun sen have 
appeared at buddhist ceremonies and the age restriction on entering 
the buddhist clergy has been lowered to 10 
still the government appears firmly committed to keeping 
buddhism a staterun religion its aim is to prevent a return of 
the 1950s when pagodas and buddhist schools served as the 
wellspring of progressive and revolutionary political thought 
the state and religion are not separated tep vong 
cambodias top buddhist was quoted recently as saying 
another factor working against a buddhist resurgence is an 
apparent lack of interest in religion among cambodias youth 
youthful giggles broke out during the samaly clans prayers 
none of the children knew the chants and the three teenagers 
present refused to follow along 
tea somaly grandson of the deceased said his father pun had 
forced him to come 
on sunday i usually go to the video parlor to see a hong kong 
movie said the 15yearold i like the action and kung fu 
he said he also was worried about the future of his country but 
didnt think prayers would help 
what can that do he asked it just wastes time 
outside on the pagoda grounds hundreds of cambodians knelt in 
prayer to pay tribute to the dead jacaranda petals scattered in 
the wind 
we put these in the khmer rouge guns when they came into the 
city in 1975 said an old monk holding a flower these people 
are praying we dont have to do that again

congress will review the navys investigation 
into the explosion aboard the uss iowa in light of reports of 
improper experiments with the ships guns says senate majority 
leader george mitchell 
mitchell who appeared sunday on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley was asked whether he thought there was a coverup by 
the navy which concluded gunners mate clayton hartwig most 
probably sabotaged a 16inch gun he was loading 
im unable to make that judgment mitchell said but based 
upon the reports weve seen there will undoubtedly be a 
congressional inquiry into the matter to attempt to determine if 
possible what did happen and how well done the investigation and 
report were 
hartwig and 46 mates in the ships second turret died in the 
april 19 explosion which occurred during firing practice

thousands of rural communities would lose 
their only source of public transportation if congress decides the 
dallasbased transit company must equip every bus with a wheelchair 
lift says greyhound lines inc 
advocates for the handicapped however say greyhound is 
exaggerating the costs of compliance with the americans with 
disabilities act to shift attention away from the real issue that 
the handicapped are largely denied access to public transportation 
under the senateapproved legislation greyhound the only 
national intercity bus company would have six years from enactment 
to make its buses accessible to the handicapped including those in 
wheelchairs 
greyhound interprets that as a mandate for a lift in every bus 
although the legislation is not that specific 
hearings are under way in the house on a version of the bill 
which could pass before the end of the year 
greyhound estimates the minimal annual costs of compliance at 
30 million to 40 million a bullet to the heart of a company 
that lost 17 million last year and expects to make 5 million to 
10 million this year says fred g currey chairman and chief 
executive officer 
but ellen daly a legislative analyst with the presidents 
committee on employment of people with disabilities said that when 
transit companies are asked to accommodate the disabled there 
has always been an inflation on costs

the case of a psychologist charged with helping 
to hide a 5yearold from a mother who allegedly neglected the boy 
is raising ethical questions for professionals who treat abused 
children experts say 
dennis m harrison who has testified in prominent child custody 
cases across the nation was charged sept 18 with three counts of 
conspiracy to harbor or hide travis lee meriweather of lexington 
park 
travis has been missing since a july 1987 visit to his father in 
hinton okla authorities believe hes being held by his father 
somewhere 
harrison the boys grandfather and a physician who has 
examined him claim the father was justified in vanishing with 
travis because he was virtually starved while in the care of his 
mother 
some child abuse specialists say they are troubled by the 
governments seizing of evidence handwritten notes and a 
telephone bill for a call to hinton from harrisons office and 
home 
the records seizure and harrisons arrest could have a 
chilling effect on medical professionals who treat abused 
children said dr eli newberger director of the family 
development study at childrens hospital and an assistant professor 
of pediatrics at harvard medical school 
to have confidential knowledge about a client seized by the 
state threatens the entire therapeutic enterprise said jon 
conte an associate professor of social work at the university of 
chicago 
harrison called his arrest an outrage 
this sends an ominous message to health professionals who try 
to help troubled kids from broken homes that they are standing on 
shaky shaky legal ground said harrison who is free on his 
recognizance and faces trial feb 7 
but d anne emery a st marys county prosecutor said she has 
evidence that harrison saw travis at least twice knowing that state 
and federal warrants had been issued for the boy and his father 
this is a situation where somebody who doesnt like the 
outcome of the court order just takes the law into their own hands 
and does whatever he wants it makes the very foundation of our 
legal system ineffective she said 
the boys grandfather leroy meriweather of hinton okla said 
travis had grown increasingly thin while living with his mother 
terry treadway 27 
the baby had a bloated belly like those starving babies you 
see on television in india and his hair was just falling out of his 
head when it was brushed he said 
treadway won custody when she divorced her husband michael lee 
meriweather in oklahoma in 1985 she moved to maryland and agreed 
to let travis spend a week each month with his father 
weve done just about everything we can do to find him and im 
all torn up inside she said in an interview 
dr donna cosby an oklahoma city pediatrician who examined 
travis in 1986 and 1987 said he appeared to be underweight 
he would systematically lose up to a half a pound every time 
he visited his mother and gain it back when he was with his dad 
calories at that age are crucial to brain development and kids 
just cant afford to have their weight bounce back and forth like 
that she said 
treadway said travis was perfectly healthy in her care 
kids are kids and some of them dont have the figures that 
adults might expect them to have she said 
harrison 43 has testified on behalf of dr elizabeth morgan a 
washington dc plastic surgeon who has been in jail for hiding 
her 7yearold daughter hilary from the courts since 1987 morgan 
has alleged that the childs father dr eric foretich sexually 
abused the child a claim foretich denies

in this region where apple trees line the 
golf courses and an apple is the city symbol growers are worried 
that depressed prices threaten their economic survival 
with supplies expected to be lower elsewhere growers here hoped 
the 107 billion apples hanging from trees in the verdant valleys 
of central washington would get top prices this fall as the 
industry recovers from the alar scare 
instead wholesale prices have declined since sept 1 
its terribly disappointing and does not bode well for the 
industry said grower chuck peters 
according to the governments market news service the top grade 
of washington red delicious apples was selling for 12 to 14 per 
42pound box on sept 18 down from around 20 per box in early 
september 
last year the same grade sold for 26 to 28 per box 
we have yet to get our crop off the trees and the price is 
beaten down to a price level equivalent to the worst times of 
alar complained grower jim clements of selah 
he referred to widespread consumer concern over growers use of 
the chemical alar after a private health group publicized studies 
linking alar byproducts with cancer 
some think rising supply is the reason for the low wholesale 
prices 
washington is sending a record number of apples to supermarkets 
this year boosting the size of the national apple crop by 7 
percent over last year 
because most apples are bought on longterm contracts wholesale 
price changes take time to show up in markets 
we would expect lower consumer prices than last year said 
kathy means spokeswoman for the produce marketing association a 
fresh produce trade group based in newark del 
the industry is trying to bury the alar issue and little if 
any of the chemical was used on the 1989 crop 
uniroyal chemical co removed the chemical from the market 
earlier this year as the us food and drug administration moved to 
examine the issue 
washington state instituted a program requiring farmers to apply 
for special permits to use alar a growth regulator 
none did and an extensive state testing program so far has 
found alar only in traces that indicate carryover from previous 
years spraying 
the industry was heartened by record consumer demand for apples 
all summer and the washington apple commission has said its 
polling shows alar is not a major issue 
there is a lot of reason for optimism said charles st 
john commission spokesman 
washington normally produces about half the nations supermarket 
apples but weather problems in the midwest and new england should 
boost the states share this season 
apples are a big business in washington where 4500 growers 
produce a crop worth 800 million per year that doesnt include 
hundreds of millions of dollars in additional sales by apple juice 
and apple sauce makers based in the state 
the national crop forecast calls for 230 million boxes 7 
percent above last year with 132 million boxes destined for 
supermarkets and the rest for processors of that washington will 
produce about 107 million boxes of which a record 75 million are 
for supermarkets 
they will be purchased by consumers who eat an average of 20 
pounds of apples per year 
new york and michigan are the secondlargest apple producers 
each with 7 percent of the crop 
many washington growers are counting on the 1989 crop to save 
them after two consecutive years of poor crops 
dwight holloway a grower from wapato said he lost 500000 in 
1987 a crop that was damaged by weather and 200000 last year 
it costs growers about 950 to grow pick pack and ship a box 
of apples 
if we have another 19871988 an awful large percentage of us 
have to fold up and walk away holloway said

highest in a month 
the dollar closed at 14295 yen down 205 yen from fridays 
close of 14500 yen after opening moderately lower at 14447 yen 
the currency ranged between 1422014450 yen it was the lowest 
closing for the us currency against the yen since aug 30 when it 
closed at 14286 yen 
on the stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which gained 2627 points friday added 18892 points 054 
percent closing at 3496071 
it was the nikkeis highest close since aug 22 when it closed 
at 3511435 
currency dealers said the dollar was pushed back by a joint 
dollarselling intervention during morning tokyo trading by the 
bank of japan and the federal reserve bank of new york 
it seems that the joint intervention shows that monetary 
authorities are carrying out what they were saying in the 
statements issued by the weekend meeting of the group of seven 
industrialized countries in washington said a source close to the 
bank of japan the nations central bank speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the bank of japan alone was reported to have sold an estimated 
1 billion in the us currency to press it down the amount of 
intervention by the us central bank was not immediately known 
the bank of japan ordinarily does not comment on its market 
policy 
finance ministers participating in the g7 meeting said in a 
statement said the recent rise of the dollar could adversely 
affect prospects for the world economy and agreed to cooperate in 
foreign exchange markets to check the dollars strength 
the g7 comprises japan the united states west germany 
britain france italy and canada 
osamu seto a dealer with mitsui bank said the joint market 
intervention in the tokyo market worked well to help the dollar 
down but he said the g7 pledge for close cooperation in exchange 
markets was not enough to stem the dollars upward pressure 
in the longterm perspective the dollars underlying 
bullishness will not be erased by means of market intervention 
currently the only way to curb the exchange rates seto said 
securities dealers said the market responded favorably to the 
yens appreciation against the dollar shares were bought broadly

nominated by acclamation to run for 
reelection president daniel ortega predicted that he would win in 
another defeat for washington supplier of the contra rebels who 
fought his leftist government 
we will win ortega told a cheering convention of the ruling 
leftist sandinista national liberation front that nominated him and 
running mate sergio ramirez on sunday night 
ortega 44 who led the sandinistas to power with the 1979 
overthrow of dictator anastasio somoza had been expected to win 
the nomination 
a sandinista electoral victory next year ortega said in an 
acceptance speech will be one more defeat the united states is 
going to have to accept they will have to reach an understanding 
with nicaragua after the defeat they are going to suffer they have 
no other choice 
the united states has been helping the contras short for 
counterrevolutionaries since 1981 for the past year such 
assistance has been limited to nonlethal aid greatly reducing 
their effectiveness as a fighting force 
except for a brief visit to managua by a state department 
official two weeks ago the united states has refused any high 
level contact with the sandinistas to discuss pending issues since 
it broke off talks five years ago 
at a meeting last month ortega and the presidents of el 
salvador honduras guatemala and costa rica formally agreed to 
disband the contras by dec 8 as part of an overall plan to end 
conflicts in central america 
in exchange ortega moved national elections originally 
scheduled for 1991 to feb 25 and promised that opposition 
candidates will be allowed to campaign free of harassment with a 
free press and that the balloting will be honest 
both the bush administration and rebel leaders however say 
they want to maintain the contra force intact until after the 
election to make sure the sandinistas keep their promise 
ortegas challenger will be violeta barrios de chamorro 
publisher of la prensa nicaraguas only opposition newspaper she 
is being fielded by a 14party coalition which the united states 
has been considering how to aid 
the convention representing a wide spectrum of society also 
chose 90 candidates for the national assembly the singlechamber 
legislature and mayors for the nations 145 cities and towns 
an economic boycott together with the contra war and government 
mismanagement have completely stagnated nicaraguas economy now

bodies of victims from the bombing of a french 
dc10 over niger have arrived in the french capital and 
investigators said the bomb was likely planted in the jets forward 
cargo hold 
very probable traces of an explosion were in fact concentrated 
in one of the cargo compartments situated at the front of the 
plane said robert paillasse head of an investigative commission 
from france niger and chad 
it is certain that there was an explosive substance he said 
sunday in an interview with french radio rtl from niger 
all 171 people aboard uta flight 772 were killed when it 
exploded 30000 feet over southcentral niger in northwest africa 
on tuesday the flight was en route from the congo to paris after a 
stopover in ndjamena chad 
about 40 bodies arrived at le bourget airport sunday aboard a 
dc8 cargo plane and were taken immediately to the paris morgue for 
identification and autopsy the foreign ministry said in a 
statement 
autopsies should indicate whether the passengers and crew 
inhaled gases that would provide clues about what explosive blew 
the plane apart less than an hour after its takeoff from ndjamena 
paillase also said laboratory tests had begun on debris shipped 
to paris to determine on the basis of the traces of combustion 
which explosive material was involved 
the transport ministry said saturday that evidence from the 
crash site and analysis of the flight data and cockpit voice 
recorders left no doubt that an explosion caused the disaster 
authorities have been unwilling to speculate about who might 
have placed a bomb aboard the flight but appear to be treating 
with great skepticism the claims of responsibility issued so far 
a previously unknown group calling itself the secret chadian 
resistance sent statements to western news agencies in beirut on 
saturday claiming to have bombed the flight as part of a struggle 
for the complete withdrawal of all military colonial forces from 
africa 
france maintains about 1600 soldiers in chad deployed to help 
the former french colony in its long war with libya although chad 
and libya have promised to end their dispute peacefully libya has 
continued to call for withdrawal of all french troops from the 
country 
calls to uta several hours after the plane was bombed and to a 
western news agency in london the following day claimed 
responsibility on behalf of islamic jihad 
islamic jihad is one of the names used by shiite moslem 
extremists believed holding several western hostages in lebanon 
but that group customarily makes its statements in writing 
accompanied by photographs of its hostages to prove their 
authenticity 
french news reports have underscored the similarity between the 
uta crash and the december bombing of a pan am flight over 
lockerbie scotland 
in the pan am bombing one prominent theory is that the popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command a 
palestinian splinter group placed a sophisticated bomb in a 
radiocassette player checked as baggage in frankfurt designed to 
explode following a stopover in london 
the french news accounts have speculated that a similar bomb 
could have been placed in the baggage compartment of the uta flight 
in brazzaville congo designed to explode only after the plane 
stopped in ndjamena and took off again

its highest level in a month 
the dollars decline followed a weekend meeting at which the 
monetary authorities of seven major industrial nations agreed to 
act to check the us currencys recent rise 
the dollar closed at 14295 yen down 205 yen from fridays 
close of 14500 yen it opened at 14447 yen and ranged between 
14220 yen and 14450 yen the dollars close was its lowest since 
14235 yen on aug 23 
currency dealers said both the bank of japan and the us 
federal reserve bank had been heavily selling dollars 
it seems that the joint intervention shows that monetary 
authorities are carrying out what they said in the statements 
issued at the weekend meeting in washington said a source close to 
the bank of japan the nations central bank speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the bank of japan alone was estimated to have sold 1 billion in 
heavy trading that amounted to 13319 billion currency dealers 
said the amount of intervention by the us central bank was not 
immediately known 
the bank of japan ordinarily does not comment on its activities 
in the exchange market 
finance ministers at the washington meeting said in a statement 
that the recent rise of the dollar could adversely affect 
prospects for the world economy and agreed to cooperate in 
foreign exchange markets to curb the dollars strength 
the ministers were from the group of seven japan the 
united states west germany britain france italy and canada 
on the stock market the longawaited strengthening of the yen 
encouraged investors to buy shares the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues the exchanges main index rose 18892 points or 
054 percent closing at 3496071 it was the nikkeis highest 
close since 3511435 on aug 22 
securities dealers said shares were bought broadly in small lots 
the market was waiting for an opportunity to turn bullish and 
it seems as though the dollars sudden weakening became a very good 
one said a dealer at a major brokerage speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
but some dealers said institutional investors have not yet fully 
joined in the buying despite the generally bullish market sentiment

a huge welcome back ceremony for the 
crew that crashlanded a crippled united dc10 here two months ago 
left the pilot with a bittersweet feeling 
although 184 survived the july 19 crash of united airlines 
flight 232 112 died capt al haynes has been hesitant to accept 
praise for his skillful landing of the plane whose hydraulic 
system had been ruined by a midair mechanical failure 
on sunday about 40000 people jammed sioux gateway airport for 
an air show and ceremony to honor haynes his crew and those on the 
ground who helped survivors 
it was a little mixed emotions for about five minutes as i 
wondered how i was going to react haynes said after the event 
it only lasted for a couple of minutes and then i knew i was 
going to be all right 
were kind of overwhelmed by it he added we didnt 
expect this kind of attention they are unbelievable they are just 
great 
crew members dudley dvorak and william record along with united 
training pilot dennis fitch also were on hand with two of the men 
still wearing casts from the fiery crash 
along with haynes they have been credited with an extraordinary 
achievement in guiding the airliner to land after its no 2 engine 
blew apart severing hydraulic lines that controlled the aircrafts 
flight 
with no procedure for such a circumstance the crew had to 
improvise a response 
haynes said he spent much of the day touring hospitals to thank 
doctors and nurses 
we got reacquainted with them and they could kind of see that 
their work did some good because people are back together said 
haynes 
haynes has been on medical leave since the crash but said he 
hopes to return to the air nov 1 
gov terry branstad presented the crew with citations and small 
plaques and said iowa national guard officials and workers were 
responsible for the swift and effective response 
your calm action saved lives and helped people cope with a 
dire emergency branstad said you are a special group of 
people

during the past two weeks a survey found 
the average national price of gasoline rose 031 cents to 
10943 a gallon for the week ended sept 22 according to the 
lundberg survey 
a competitive endofsummer market forced retailers to hold 
prices down even though wholesale prices were increasing said 
trilby lundberg director of the biweekly survey of 12000 stations 
but during the past two weeks the wholesale rises have been 
great enough to force retailers to increase pump prices she said 
sunday she forecast the trend would continue into the fall but 
its difficult to do during a time of decreased demand 
average nationwide prices per gallon at selfservice pumps 
which account for more than 80 percent of all sales were 9825 
cents for regular unleaded 11531 for premium unleaded and 9722 
cents for regular leaded 
for fullservice the averages were 12721 for regular

syrian artillery fired 80 shells into 
pine woods in the countrys christian enclave today violating a 
2dayold arab league ceasefire during which more than 1 million 
refugees returned to the capital 
police reported no casualties in the 45minute barrage on the 
thinly populated area near the mountain resort town of beit meri 
10 miles northeast of beirut 
some of the shells exploded less than a mile from the hilltop 
bustan hotel where arab league mediator lakhdar alibrahimi was 
staying the sudden barrage ended at 745 am said a police 
spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
christian forces led by gen michel aoun did not respond to the 
syrian shellfire the spokesman reported there were no immediate 
reports of casualties 
it was the first serious violation of the ceasefire since it 
took hold saturday evening after six months of fighting between the 
syrians and christians that by police count has killed 929 people 
and wounded 2741 
there was no official explanation for the barrage on the 
forested mountain slopes which appeared to have been deliberately 
targeted because few people live there 
an informed moslem source said it was a syrian message to aoun 
that the truce could fall apart if the christian media does not 
stop its campaign against the syrians 
ibrahimi deputy secretarygeneral of the 22member arab league 
was scheduled to preside later today over a meeting of a security 
committee made up of officials of several lebanese factions to 
assess efforts to consolidate the truce 
it was called more than a week ago by the king fahd of saudi 
arabia king hassan ii of morocco and president chadli bendjedid of 
algeria who form an arab league committee assigned to end 
lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the syrians have 40000 troops in lebanon they entered the 
country in 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate but aoun 
has charged they abrogated that mandate by openly siding with the 
moslems 
a member of the security committee speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it will also discuss ways of monitoring and 
blocking shipments of weapons and ammunition to the warring 
factions 
the committee comprises representatives of aouns christian army 
command the rival prosyrian moslem army command of maj gen sami 
khatib and the three principal militias in lebanon the rightwing 
christian lebanese forces the shiite moslem amal and the druse 
moslem progressive socialist party 
beirut took the brunt of the savage shelling by both sides since 
march 8 forcing all but 150000 of the capitals 15 million 
population to flee to safer areas 
moslem housewife hoda makkouk returned to her thirdfloor 
apartment in the bourj abu haidar district of moslem west beirut 
sunday evening with her husband and two children 
i was so happy to be back home i just couldnt sleep said 
mrs makkouk she and her family spent four months living with 
relatives and friends in the chouf mountains southeast of beirut 
all the windows have been blown out by the shelling i spent 
the whole night cleaning the apartment but im not tired she 
said 
as beirutis began picking up the pieces of their shattered 
lives the citys 11 daily newspapers published advertisements from 
schools announcing that they will resume classes early next month 
educational institutes in and around beirut closed in march 
shortly after the fighting broke out

albert a marks jr who brought the 
miss america pageant to television fired bert parks as host and 
dethroned vanessa williams because of nude photos has died at age 
76 
marks who directed the pageant for 35 years before his 
retirement in 1987 died sunday of complications from a heart 
attack he suffered sept 11 a few days before this years finals 
marks and investment broker worked tirelessly and without pay 
on the contest at first to boost his citys image and then out of 
love of the pageant said his successor leonard c horn 
he not only helped make a major contribution to atlantic city 
but gave an opportunity for thousands of young women across the 
country to receive scholarship assistance horn said 
though officially retired from the pageant marks offered advice 
this year 
the day before his heart attack he visited pageant staff and 
contestants and posed for photos with some of them including miss 
america 1971 phyllis george a cohost of this years show 
affable to most but acerbic to those he perceived a threat to 
the show marks tightly held the reigns in a sometimes bumpy road 
to the runway 
he had a capacity for making quick decisions and never looking 
back said horn who knew marks for 25 years 
marks joined the pageant as an unpaid volunteer in 1952 his job 
that year was to escort marilyn monroe to and from a float she rode 
in the contests annual boardwalk parade 
she wasnt able to get onto the float because of her tight 
dress he recalled last year so i had to give her a push by 
the derriere to get her up 
marks went on to serve as director for 35 years the last 25 as 
chairman 
marks brought the show to television in 1954 
he defended the pageant against criticism from the womens 
liberation movement the national association for the advancement 
of colored people labor organizations and some who consider miss 
america an outdated symbol 
in the late 1960s he suggested scuttling the swimsuit 
competition for sports clothes but he abandoned the proposal in 
the face of objections from state pageant committees 
in january 1980 marks decided against renewing parks contract 
marks said he sent a letter to parks home in hollywood fla 
to notify him but parks was staying at his home in connecticut for 
the holidays and didnt find out he was fired until until he was 
questioned an associated press reporter 
parks didnt immediately return a call sunday but his wife 
annette said she and her husband felt a terrible loss with 
marks death 
in 1982 marks dropped the trademark there she is song in a 
dispute with songwriter bernie wayne he allowed the songs return 
in 1985 
the biggest scandal was in 1984 when a magazine published nude 
photographs of miss america vanessa williams 
miss williams the first black to win the rhinestonestudded 
crown also became the first to be forced into giving it up miss 
new jersey 1984 suzette charles served the rest of miss williams 
reign 
mary ann mobley miss america 1959 and wife of parks successor 
gary collins remembered marks this way he weathered all the 
controversy that came up and the miss america pageant got 
stronger she said thats the mark of the man

sunday over state radio

a block party organized by neighbors fed up 
with drug dealers ended in a gun battle between gang members and 
soldiers from a nearby army base some of whom were called in as 
reinforcements 
no one was hurt in the fight saturday night although it lasted 
30 minutes and involved about 20 shooters about 300 rounds of 
ammunition were fired smashing windows and damaging parked cars 
police and witnesses said sunday 
police arrested two alleged gang members on previous warrants 
and confiscated several weapons from the soldiers 
the party was given by army staff sgt bill foulk of the 2nd 
ranger battalion at fort lewis south of tacoma to rally residents 
who have been trying to rid the hilltop district neighborhood of 
crack dealers authorities said 
some of the soldiers from foulks battalion were invited to the 
party as guests and bodyguards base spokesman capt martin j 
eckert said 
foulk called in reinforcements after alleged gang members 
attacked the party with shotguns and handguns witnesses and police 
said 
ten soldiers were involved in the shootout eckert said police 
sgt mike miller said up to 15 rangers may have been involved 
miller said 40 to 55 people were at the party when six to 10 
gang members surrounded foulks house and began firing 
gang members were throwing things at the house they started 
threatening the people over here with burning the house down and 
were going to fire up after dark and this kind of thing foulk 
said 
thats when i decided to call back to the battalion and get a 
hold of any available ranger that i could and ask him to come out 
and provide reinforcements said foulk 
eckert said fort lewis officials will wait for a full police 
report before determining if any action should be taken against the 
rangers the weapons used by the soldiers were their personal arms 
he said 
police said two semiautomatic rifles a shotgun eight automatic 
handguns and a revolver were recovered from the soldiers 
some residents complained that tensions had been building all 
afternoon and said it took police 30 minutes to arrive after they 
were called 
police spokesman mark mann said he was frustrated that residents 
had not called earlier 
there is a fine line between selfdefense and vigilantism 
right now we made no arrests because we think its classified as 
selfdefense but thats subject to a prosecutors review mann 
said 
renae hartlett accused the soldiers of provoking violence by 
making a show of force in the neighborhood and accusing some 
residents of involvement in drugs 
they was pointing those guns at us and saying they were going 
to move us out of the neighborhood she said hartlett and other 
black residents of the integrated neighborhood said they saw racist 
overtones to the confrontation 
foulk who is white said some rangers were carrying handguns 
but denied that were brandished before the gunbattle 
this had nothing to do with race added shirley luckett a 
black woman who was at the party

residents took forecasters at their word 
when they warned of hurricane hugos fury and the low number of 
deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy 
respect authorities said 
the storm which caused billions in damage claimed 17 lives in 
south carolina and only two were in the charleston area which 
bore the brunt of hugos 135 mph winds 
we just feel very thankful about that said mayor joseph p 
riley jr several thousands of people who were in the shelters 
and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were 
potential victims of injury and death 
riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the 
hurricane as it spun toward charleston and heeding evacuation 
warnings 
the last big storm to hit south carolina was hurricane david in 
1979 which hit the coast after pounding southern florida 
since then several big storms have threatened but veered away 
and officials were worried that charlestonians wouldnt heed hugos 
warnings 
weve had so many close calls said gary garnet a 
meteorologist with the national weather service 
but this storm was very very strong he said this time 
they realized it 
glen ellis a red cross official estimated that 18000 
residents in charleston and the three surrounding counties headed 
for shelters 
tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up 
interstate 26 toward columbia 
mayor john bourne of north charleston where there apparently

peter halls production of orpheus 
descending by tennessee williams is a firstrate revival of a 
secondrate play 
the drama which opened sunday at broadways neil simon theater 
was brought here as a vehicle for vanessa redgrave who scored a 
huge personal triumph with it in london last season 
miss redgrave is often riveting but the real hero of the 
evening is hall who directs williams overwritten overwrought and 
oversexed fandango with the commitment of a true believer 
orpheus isnt the glass menagerie a streetcar named 
desire or even cat on a hot tin roof but youd never realize 
it from halls fidelity to this overripe material he revels in its 
excessive poetry and nonrealistic structure the director uses 
sound effects music lighting and even bizarre makeup for some of 
the characters to underscore williams often obvious points about 
good and evil carnality and purity 
the play set in a small unnamed southern town intertwines the 
tales of lady torrence miss redgrave the bitter wife of a dry 
goods store owner and val xavier a young drifter she hires to 
work in the store 
the two are kindred spirits longing to be free from the ties of 
this terrible little town where bigotry hatred and even murder are 
everyday occurrences lady the daughter of an italian bootlegger 
killed by local klansmen yearns for something better than her 
loveless marriage to a dying husband val who used to sing in 
little clubs and bars along the mississippi is a modernday 
orpheus now hes striving to be a model of rectitude after a life 
of booze and women like orpheus attempting to save eurydice val 
eventually tries to rescue lady from an unhappy life 
heavyhanded symbolism saturates the play and there is a great 
deal of talk about little birds who never stop flying and if they 
do they die fig trees that supposedly are barren but finally bear 
fruit and vals guitar which becomes a symbol of everything that 
is good and pure about his life and the only thing he really loves 
miss redgrave plays lady with an odd italian accent that sounds 
unnaturally upper class but the rest of her portrait is 
convincing her performance is earthy and intelligent an odd 
combination that works well against kevin andersons val 
val is the plays most problematic character an obvious plot 
device but anderson makes him into a credible human being he also 
projects a sexy scruffiness that brings some truth to the physical 
relationship between val and lady 
there is a wonderful moment at the opening of the play when 
beulah binnings one of the towns bigoted biddies spins out 
ladys past history to the audience in what amounts to a soliloquy 
her speech is the best written scene in the play and actress 
sloane shelton seizes it with a ferocity that is spellbinding 
the play also is populated by a collection of stock williams 
characters crazy almost gothic creatures who in the hands of 
lesser actors would verge on parody 
anne twomey wearing white pancake makeup and heavy mascara that 
makes her look like anthony newley in stop the world i want to 
get off offers a compelling variation on the standard williams 
woman with loose morals but a strong sense of right and wrong and 
tammy grimes after a shaky start really becomes a batty religious 
fanatic who has visions and attempts to save val from his past as 
well as his future 
other finely etched characterizations are offered by brad 
sullivan as ladys cancerriddled husband marcia lewis as his 
malevolent nurse and bette henritze peg small and patti allison 
as a greek chorus of smalltown gossips 
orpheus descending has an interesting history it began life 
in 1940 as battle of angels which was to have been williams 
broadway debut but the play which starred miriam hopkins died in 
boston and didnt make it to new york until 17 years later with 
maureen stapleton anna magnani and marlon brando starred in the 
1960 film version which was called the fugitive kind 
this production doesnt reclaim orpheus descending as a lost 
masterpiece but it makes a persuasive case for another look at the 
lesser works in the large williams canon despite the excesses of 
the writing there is pleasure to be found in miss redgrave the 
other cast members and halls unerring direction 
other reviews 
frank rich of the new york times called the fusion of vanessa 
redgrave and tennessee williams an artistic explosion that was 
bound to happen williams and redgrave are brilliant theater 
artists who run at life bravely openly he wrote but rich 
said the supporting cast was inadequate whether through 
miscasting or underrehearsing 
what a splendid start to the season clive barnes said in 
the new york post he called redgraves acting in the play 
atrocious but oddly and unerringly accurate and called 
the event a broadway occasion not to be missed 
miscast overdirected exhaustingly overacted the latest 
incarnation of orpheus descending is a profound disappointment

set for herself on the 22mile swim 
as in each of her previous swims this year ms keith used only 
the butterfly stroke she was believed to be the first person to 
swim between the island and mainland using only the butterfly

six miles shy of cabrillo beach after flailing in a powerful 
current 
she made saturdays swim in 14 hours 53 minutes and 26 seconds 
ms keith cracked jokes about sharks and dodged ship traffic

storefront checkcashing businesses in americas 
inner cities are helping to launder billions of dollars to drug 
dealers in south america and asia according to a published report 
thousands of the small shops also defraud legitimate customers 
who want to transmit money often recent immigrants with relatives 
in their home countries by diverting the funds the new york 
times said in todays editions 
the magnitude of the problem is huge said jill m 
considine superintendent of banks in new york and chairwoman of 
the conference of state bank supervisors 
the most serious problems are in california florida new york 
and texas state banking regulators told the times 
the increase in the number of moneytransmitting stores 
corresponds to the rapid growth in the illegal drug industry and to 
efforts by legitimate banks to comply with a federal law that 
requires the reporting of deposits of more than 10000 
typically a storefront operation takes drug profits sometimes 
packed in suitcases and deposits the money in a legitimate bank 
sometimes under the name of a fictitious corporation from the 
bank the money is electronically transferred to another bank 
leaving no trace of the real depositors identity 
the legitimate banks report the names of the corporations to the 
government so the drug dealerss identities dont show up in any 
records 
a small percentage of the moneytransmitting stores are licensed 
and regulated but the majority are illegal unlicensed and 
unregulated the paper said 
in the new york area alone the paper said bank regulators have 
identified more than 130 illegal money transmitters the state has 
issued licenses to 35 companies more than half of them issued in 
the last year the times said

president bush is preparing to 
challenge the soviet union to match the united states in making 
cuts of more than 50 percent in chemical weapon stockpiles as a 
step toward abolishing them administration sources say 
bush planned to make the proposal today in new york in his first 
presidential speech before the 44th session of the un general 
assembly secretary of state james a baker iii said the initiative 
would move the world closer to a ban on chemical weapons 
bush brushed aside reporters questions about his speech when he 
went for a brisk early morning jog prior to departing for new york 
city 
baker appearing on nbctvs today program said bush would 
propose significant reductions in chemical weapons that will 
improve the chances significantly of curbing their use 
administration sources in new york said sunday night that bush 
would tell the united nations he is prepared to slash us chemical 
weapons stockpiles by more than 50 percent provided the soviet 
union makes similar reductions 
bush also planned to suggest sanctions against other countries 
which proceed with chemical weapons production the sources said 
baker informed soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of 
the presidents intention in their talks over the weekend in 
jackson hole wyo there the two sides agreed on a twostage 
ussoviet program to exchange information about their chemical 
weapons and to inspect each others plants and arsenals 
the president who served as un ambassador in 19711972 also 
planned today to call for international cooperation on drugs 
terrorism and the environment 
bush also was expected to salute steps toward democratic reforms 
made in eastern europe latin america and africa and he was to 
offer support for economic restructuring and reforms in the soviet 
union expressing confidence in the goals set out by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev officials said 
the proposal regarding chemical weapons was described by one 
official insisting on anonymity as a new initiative to move 
forward in elimination of chemical weapons to reduce stockpiles 
and generally try to give a new impetus to a total ban 
bush today also was meeting in new york with un secretary 
general javier perez de cuellar and he was to meet with brazils 
president jose sarney israeli finance minister shimon peres 
guatemalan president vinicio cerezo venezuelan president carlos 
andres perez and bolivian president jaime paz zamora 
bush planned to host a lunch for nato allies and with his wife 
barbara also was visiting the metropolitan museum of art for a 
diplomatic reception and dinner 
the united states and soviet union are the only nations that 
admit to having chemical weapons however us analysts estimate 
two dozen countries actually have the weapons or the capacity to 
produce them 
the president has been concerned for a number of years about 
the horrors of chemical weapons said brent scowcroft the 
presidents national security adviser 
he made a major presentation to the un conference in 1984 on 
the possibility of banning chemical weapons and he will have some 
proposals tomorrow to advance that issue scowcroft said sunday 
on the nbc show meet the press 
as ronald reagans vice president bush twice had to cast the 
deciding vote to break a tie in the senate for continued production 
of chemical weapons on one occasion reagan called bushs elderly 
mother dorothy to explain why he had instructed her son to take 
an action that she disapproved of 
the final version of the speech was completed sunday 
we added a couple of things bush told reporters sunday 
during a futile fishing excursion bush who arrived friday at his 
vacation home in kennebunkport spent much of each day playing golf 
and fishing even in a driving rainstorm 
baker and shevardnadze signed an agreement to exchange data on 
chemical weapons by the end of the year and allow visits by 
inspectors of the other side to stockpiles and plants by june 30 
in a second phase there would be more intensive onsite 
inspections of the submitted data 
among an array of other accords they also reached agreement on 
the broad principles for verifying limits on strategic forces and 
nuclear tests 
in a major development the soviets said they would drop their 
demand that the united states abandon work on its star wars missile 
defense program before concluding a treaty curbing longrange 
missiles bombers and submarines

the bush administration is setting next years 
superpower summit meeting as the target for completion of a treaty 
to slash longrange nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent 
to lay the groundwork and also hasten an accord on troops and 
tanks in europe secretary of state james a baker iii probably 
will meet with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze twice before 
the summit an official said 
baker would go to the soviet union sometime between november and 
january and shevardnadze would come to the united states 
afterward a senior us official said sunday night 
shevardnadze and baker who just finished two days of productive 
talks in jackson hole wyo are known to be considering locations 
other than moscow for the next meeting 
baker on the nbctv today program this morning declined to 
predict whether the treaty would be finished by the time of the 
summit meeting which he said probably would be in late spring 
if you ask me will we have a start strategic arms reduction 
talks agreement i cant tell you that we will baker said 
a soviet decision not to let a dispute over spacebased defenses 
stand in the way is expected to improve chances of completing a 
strategic weapons treaty 
but baker said sunday on cbstvs face the nation program 
we are not home yet by a long shot 
among the unsettled issues are procedures for verifying 
compliance with cuts in bombers missiles and submarines 
but baker said the soviet decision to deal separately with its 
objections to the us star wars program was a major achievement 
what i think you see here is an exercise of political wil by 
the leadership on both sides the soviet union and the united 
states to move us forward across the broad range of our arms 
control agenda baker said 
later on a us air force jet to new york for the opening of 
the un general assembly a senior us official said a strategic 
arms reduction treaty may be ready at the summit 
if we cant get to a start agreement certainly a summit will 
move it forward or should said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
baker said the success of his meeting with the soviet foreign 
minister should silence congressional critics and dampen their 
appetite for unilateral arms cuts 
despite progress in the jackson hole talks to cut strategic 
conventional and chemical weapons baker said the soviet union was 
still a military threat 
i think it would be quite naive for the united states to talk 
about unilateral reductions of its strategic arsenal baker said

the next storm here may be in the state 
capitol or in court when outraged property owners fight back 
against a law prohibiting some people from rebuilding their 
devastated beachfront homes 
even as the toll of hurricane hugo was tallied over the weekend 
debate erupted anew over south carolinas beachfront management 
act which is designed to prevent erosion and overdevelopment of 
the states evershifting coastline 
under the act certain beachfront buildings cannot be rebuilt if 
they are more than twothirds damaged a provision that would 
apply to many of the homes that were blown down by hugo 
even before the hurricane decisions were pending on three 
lawsuits challenging the act now hugo may prompt a reassessment of 
the states hard line on rebuilding 
on saturday state rep kenneth corbett of myrtle beach asked 
gov carroll campbell to call a special legislative session to 
consider revising the law campbell said he would consider the 
request 
meanwhile the permit administrator of the coastal council 
steve moore said a blanket permit might be issued to allow people 
to repair homes that are less than twothirds damaged 
for now the owners are under the rules of the law which took 
effect in july 1988 at the time many lawmakers and 
environmentalists hailed the act as a solution to degradation of 
the states beachfronts especially along the popular grand strand 
resort area that runs from georgetown to north myrtle beach 
the bill was opposed by those in banking real estate and 
tourism as well as by several beachfront landowners 
in general the beachfront management act sets three lines of 
demarcation for shore construction 
no new construction within 20 feet of the actual or estimated 
dune line 
buildings from the dune line to 20 feet back can be repaired 
with approval from the south carolina coastal council if they are 
less than twothirds destroyed if twothirds of a building needs 
to be rebuilt it is termed destroyed and cannot be rebuilt 
no building of 5000 square feet or larger can be built between 
the water and a line where beach erosion can be estimated to reach 
in 40 years 
with its 135 mph winds and powerful tidal surge hugo virtually 
destroyed most oceanfront property from folly beach to surfside 
beach and caused extensive erosion elsewhere along south 
carolinas 187mile coast 
patty scarafile owner of an oceanfront home on the heavily 
damaged isle of palms 12 miles southeast of charleston said the 
beachfront law was a great concern and she believed residents would 
press for revisions 
i think most people havent even had a chance to see what the 
condition of their property is she said 
the real problem here is we have people whose homes are 
destroyed or partially destroyed said richard davis executive 
vice president of the association of realtors i dont think any 
law we have on the books right now can properly address this 
decisions on three lawsuits filed by hilton head island 
residents challenging the constitutionality of the law are pending 
in us district court in charleston earlier this year the state 
lost another lawsuit charging it illegally took land without 
compensation from an isle of palms property owner who was unable 
to build on his two beachfront lots because of the law 
an appeal of the 12 million judgment is pending 
despite the unusual circumstances created by hurricane hugo a 
state coastal council member said the 18member council would have 
to wait for legislative action before making exceptions to the law 
i assume what we would have to do as a council is adhere to 
the law until such time changes can be made said sen herbert 
fielding of charleston a council member were to administer the 
law and we cant change it unless the legislature as a whole 
changes it

underground leaders of the palestinian uprising 
today denounced egypts peace proposals and urged palestinians to 
pursue their rebellion against israeli rule 
israels two rival governing parties meanwhile moved toward 
compromise on the egyptian plan officials suggested further talks 
with egypt before pursuing a controversial proposal for 
israelipalestinian talks 
in the occupied gaza strip masked assailants killed a 
35yearold arab health worker with an ax claiming he collaborated 
with israel arab reports said the army said it was investigating 
sayed muhsen who was attacked in a un clinic in gazas rafah 
district became the 120th palestinian slain by fellow arabs on 
such allegations since the start of the 21month uprising he was 
the fifth killed in rafah this week the army confirmed the slaying 
and said police were investigating the circumstances 
israel television said plo chief yasser arafat has moved to 
prevent more attacks on suspected collaborators by dispatching a 
letter to activists in gaza this week urging them to stop slaying 
fellow arabs 
the latest underground leaflet the 46th issued since the 
uprising began on dec 8 1987 called for the continuation of 
our intefadeh uprising with lots of awareness and alertness 
the leaflet issued today criticized egypts president hosni 
mubarak for proposing a new peace initiative earlier this month 
at the same time as the enemy was increasing oppression of our 
people 
there is no chance we can accept the 10 egyptian points unless 
they include the obviousness and necessity for plo participation in 
the political process on an equal footing with other parties the 
leaflet added 
mubaraks plan does not specifically mention the plo 
it also criticized the egyptian plan for failing to specify that 
negotiations lead to formation of a palestinian state in the west 
bank and gaza strip a main goal of the palestine liberation 
organization 
mubaraks plan supports israels proposal to hold elections in 
the occupied lands to chose palestinian delegates for talks with 
israel about an interim solution of selfrule 
the egyptian plan has been rejected by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir because it demands that israel accept the usbacked 
principle of trading territory for peace and allow east jerusalem 
arabs to vote in the elections 
shamir and his rightwing likud bloc also reject egypts 
proposal to put together a 10member palestinian delegation for 
preparatory talks with israel that would include two palestinians 
deported from the occupied territories 
the idea is a compromise with the plo which wants diaspora 
palestinians involved in the talks shamir claims it would let the 
plo into negotiations through the back door 
but the leftleaning labor party likuds partner in the 
coaltion cabinet wants israel to accept both the plan and proposed 
delegation as a way to break an impasse in peace efforts 
a showdown has been postponed until oct 4 when the egyptian 
proposals are scheduled for a formal vote by the decisionmaking 
inner cabinet 
one idea broached by labor officials was to circumvent the 
palestinian delegation plan by suggesting preliminary talks with 
the egyptians before any negotiations with palestinians

thousands of vietnamese soldiers 
bade farewell to phnom penh today leaving behind citizens worried 
that the dreaded khmer rouge is already taking advantage of hanois 
pullout with new assaults 
hundreds of army vehicles including artillery and tanks paraded 
in front of the royal palace as a band played a song celebrating 
the solidarity between vietnam and cambodia 
several thousand people including cambodian soldiers and 
schoolchildren lined the streets waving flags in yet another 
governmentorganized ceremony marking what vietnam says is the 
withdrawal of its final 26000 troops 
heng samrin president of the vietnameseinstalled government 
thanked the commanders of departing vietnamese units 479 and 979 
twelve buddhist monks in saffron robes chanted blessings 
cambodian and vietnamese commanders embraced and were presented 
flowers from women in traditional costumes 
after the brief ceremony the soldiers headed east for the 
vietnamese border on narrow highway no 1 that was a main route 
vietnamese forces used to invade cambodia in late 1978 and end 
nearly four years of khmer rouge rule in which hundreds of 
thousands died 
after an overnight rest the soldiers were to cross from svey 
rieng province to vietnams tay ninh province supposedly ending 
hanois involvement in the stalemated war against the khmer rouge 
and two other guerrilla groups other units were to return home by 
the mekong river and the gulf of thailand 
the guerrillas have called the sixday troop movement a fake 
but the khmer rouge has beseiged the gemrich western town of 
pailin in recent months evidently to take advantage of a 
vietnamese retreat from the thai border area 
the khmer rouge claimed today it had captured the ratanamondol 
district seat at sdau township on route 10 which links the town of 
battambang with pailin 
on its radio station the voice of the national army of 
democratic kampuchea the khmer rouge called the area a major 
strategic position whose task is to defend battambang town from the 
south a transcript of the radio report was seen in bangkok 
battambang is about 160 miles northwest of phnom penh 
the defense minister gen tea banh has acknowledged the 
guerrillas have seized territory around pailin but says it remains 
under phnom penh control 
phnom penhs best division the 196th was defending pailin 
against some 3000 guerrillas of elite khmer rouge divisions 415 
and 320 said khieu kanharith a prominent newspaper editor who 
recently visited the front 
khieu said the khmer rouge were raining 800 to 2000 shells 
daily he said the guerrillas trucked in ammunition from a short 
distance while phnom penh forces were supplied from bases 75 miles 
away 
since 1979 only soldiers have lived in pailin he said in an 
interview 
the battle has intensified concern in the country over whether 
the army of the vietnaminstalled phnom penh government can handle 
the guerrillas alone 
some phnom penh residents have been stocking rice anticipating 
the guerrillas will cut off supplies to the city cambodian 
officials said some senior government officials have been saving 
money and gold in case they need to flee abroad western aid 
officials say 
already many vietnamese civilians including entire villages of 
fishermen reportedly have fled back home 
the khmer rouge toppled the usbacked lon nol government in 
april 1975 and immediately drove the people of phnom penh into the 
countryside at gunpoint attempting to turn cambodia into a 
primitive agrarian commune they created slave labor camps that 
became mass graves 
on sunday phnom penhs prime minister hun sen urged the main 
noncommunist resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk to break 
with the khmer rouge and return home 
sihanouks hands have been soaked in blood by the alliance 
he said 
hun sen called on china thailand and other countries to keep 
what he said were pledges to stop military aid to the guerrillas 
once the vietnamese have left 
we have clearly seen that our enemy has prepared all 
eventualities for civil war he told a news conference the 
scope of the war will depend on the attitude of foreign countries 
in a statement issued in bangkok sihanouk said today he would 
only take part in future peace talks if they are held within an 
international framework 
he rejected absolutely any negotiations with hun sen and said a 
report on the voice of america radio station that he had agreed to 
bilateral talks does not correspond with reality 
thailand has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in its 
territory while china has armed them 
the soviet ambassador rashit khamidouline has said his 
government is continuing arms supplies to phnom penh but not 
increasing them as vietnam retreats 
hun sen confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have just agreed 
to resume peace talks 
but he said he would not back off from his demand that any 
settlement must include dismantling the khmer rouge army and 
political organization 
talks in paris failed in july after hun sen rejected guerrilla 
demands that the khmer rouge be included in a transitional 
government

afghan rebels have closed a critical 
supply route between kabul and the warbattered eastern city of 
jalalabad a guerrilla group said today 
about 1000 fighters overran four government posts sunday along 
the strategic 75mile road near sarobi 30 miles east of kabul 
said masoud khalili a spokesman for the powerful jamiatiislami 
guerrilla group 
earlier this year jalalabad was the scene of the bloodiest 
fighting in the rebels 11yearold war to topple successive 
communist governments in kabul 
jalalabad located 45 miles west of the pakistan border was 
seen as a test of guerrilla strength following februarys 
withdrawal of about 103000 soviet soldiers from afghanistan 
but government troops dug in despite initial successes 
particularly at the key communist garrison town of samarkhel near 
jalalabad the guerrillas were stopped at the heavily fortified 
city limits 
guerrilla fighters have closed the kabuljalalabad highway 
periodically but have been unable to keep it closed beyond a few 
weeks the guerrillas weapons supply will decide how long the 
latest blockade lasts khalili said 
khalili also said guerrillas still block the key salang highway 
a critical supply route between kabul and the soviet union 
reportedly closed in midseptember 
the united states has sent millions of dollars in military 
hardware and humanitarian assistance to the guerrillas in the past 
decade the rebels who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic 
holy warriors also are bankrolled by saudi arabia and other 
arab states

china lodged a protest with the french government 
today for allowing prodemocracy chinese dissidents to meet in 
paris and form a group dedicated to ending communism in their 
homeland 
it is indeed a rare case in international relations that the 
government of a country brazenly supports activities on its 
territory by a handful of foreigners aimed at opposing and 
subverting the government of a foreign country the foreign 
ministry said in a statement 
the statement came after a meeting between a ministry official 
and french ambassador to china charles malo in which china 
expressed its profound indignation to france 
chinas sharp response followed a threeday inaugural meeting in 
paris of the federation of democracy in china during the meeting 
prodemocracy delegates from 15 countries elected dissident 
political scientist yan jiaqi and student activist wuer kaixi as 
chairman and vice chairman of the new group 
the federation is to be based in paris 
yan wuer and other leading participants in the organization 
including computer entrepreneur wan runnan and prominent economist 
chen yizi fled china after the june 34 military crackdown on the 
democracy movement and are wanted by the chinese government on 
charges of counterrevolutionary activities 
their purpose in setting up the socalled front federation 
for democracy in china is to overthrow the chinese government and 
subvert the socialist peoples republic of china allowing them to 
do so on french territory means that the french government connives 
at and supports their antichinese government activities the 
ministry said 
the abovementioned action by the french government is a 
brutal trample on the principles of mutual respect for each others 
sovereignty and mutual noninterference in each others internal 
affairs 
the statement said the french government should rein in at the 
brink of the precipice and truly abide by the norms governing 
statetostate relations 
if not it said france would be responsible for further damage 
to sinofrench relations 
relations between paris and beijing already were badly strained 
by frances criticism of the june crackdown france has in effect 
frozen highlevel diplomatic contacts and joined other western 
nations in urging china to respect the human rights of students and 
others calling for democratic reform

four days after hurricane hugo hit 
residents of this oncepicturesque barrier island began getting 
their first look today at a snakeinfested shambles that has been 
cut off from the mainland 
two boats normally used for tours to fort sumter loaded 380 
people and left in a driving rain this morning from mount pleasant 
for the isle of palms residents were allowed to take one suitcase 
to bring back belongings and were expected to be able to spend 
only 90 minutes at their homes before the boats returned 
the boats hired by the city of isle of palms were to ferry 
people all day 
people carried sheets of plastic to cover holes in their 
ceilings and brought backpacks suitcases and cat carriers hoping 
to find pets left behind 
nikki brownell who said she lived on the island all her 54 
years said the trip today would allow her to begin planning the 
rest of her life 
ill know where i stand and where things stand and what 
arangments have to be made she said its been terrible its 
very bad for your mind it makes you very apprehensive not 
knowing 
only two people per household were allowed on the boats and 
nonresidents were banned 
officials refused to allow an insurance claims adjuster from 
aetna life and casualty co tom greaney from hartford conn to 
go although he said two homeowners were policyholders 
we tell people to take an inventory of their damaged 
belongings so we can get to work on their claims these people 
havent had a chance to go out and do that greaney said and 
were disappointed that theres going to be a lot of secondary 
damage because of this rain 
kay robinson a national weather service meteorologist in 
columbia said today there was an 80 percent chance of rain through 
tonight and a 60 percent chance for storms tuesday 
its going to make it harder to accomplish anything going to 
make everything a little more miserable he said 
tom buchanan a policeman in the resort town of about 2000 
said damage on the island is widespread and so are the snakes 
what i have seen is total devastation buchanan said ive 
never seen snakes as big as ive seen in the past few days every 
time we pick up a board 
construction was to begin today on a pontoon bridge linking isle 
of palms and adjacent sullivans island to the mainland the 
pontoon which would temporarily replace the twisted ben sawyer 
bridge should take at least two weeks repairs to the sawyer 
bridge could take six months said engineer herman snyder of the 
state highway department 
the neighboring islands located 15 miles from charleston and 
home to about 6000 people have been under martial law since the 
hurricane because of heavy damage and fears that residents could 
get hurt working on homes with no way to get medical attention 
like many others sullivans island resident peter greim took a 
small boat to the island to check out his house 
i ran to my house he said my house was structurally ok 
it had parts of other houses in the yard trees are down 
everywhere 
fiftyfive to 65 percent of the homes on the isle of palms are 
unsafe propane gas is leaking and the roads are littered with 
downed power lines and debris arnold said many homes are standing 
on just one or two stilts 
last night we just sat here and listened and we could hear 
them falling and breaking its a very unsafe situation arnold 
said 
at a meeting sunday mayor carmen bunch had implored people not 
to try to reach the island on their own 
were going to build the island back weve got to stop the 
anarchy thats been talked about were not going to let anyone 
take over the city by force she said 
on saturday night acting deputy chief james meade quit when ms 
bunch turned down his plan to allow residents to return 
several people have been arrested for looting officials said 
and there is a danger to boaters from submerged boats appliances 
and debris in the surrounding waterways

judges threatened to strike unless they 
receive more protection from cocaine traffickers and a 
congressional leader called today for the government to begin 
negotiating with the drug barons 
three bombs exploded sunday night at banks in the capital but 
caused no injuries the blasts are among more than 100 attacks that 
have killed at least six people and injured 130 since the 
governments war on drugs began aug 18 
the president of the house of representatives norberto morales 
said today he favors a peaceful settlement with the traffickers 
we have to open a way toward this initiative because we are 
bleeding to death and our economy as in ruins morales said in 
a live interview with the radio chain caracol 
the mayor of medellin juan gomez also said in a caracol 
interview today that after this war is over and there are many 
dead and destruction we are going to end up at the negotating 
table talking with the drug traffickers 
the dialogue would be christian because it would avoid many 
deaths he said 
a contender for the presidential nomination for the ruling 
liberal party ernesto samper said in an interview published in 
the bogota daily la republica today that if the governments war 
against the traffickers fails the road left is legalization of 
drugs 
samper is a strong front runner for his partys nomination for 
the presidential elections next march 
at the bogota daily el espectador editor juan guillermo cano 
said in a signed column sunday that colombias congressmen are 
cowards for not joining the fight against the drug traffickers 
in reference to stories in colombian newspapers recently that 
some colombian congressmen have been denied visas to the united 
states because of links to drug traffickers cano said 
we have finally hit bottom hitting bottom we will know how 
many parliamentarians are aligned with the easy money 
canos father guillermo cano then publisher of the paper was 
assassinated by drug traffickers in 1987 on sept 2 a car bomb 
with an estimated 500 pounds of dynamite exploded causing heavy 
damage to the el espectador building 
judicial union officials were to meet today with acting justice 
minister carlos lemos simmonds to discuss security which they say 
should include bulletproof cars and vests guards with metal 
detectors at their offices and other security measures 
we dont see any will on the part of the government to 
increase security for our lives antonio suarez nino president 
of the national association of judicial employees said sunday in a 
communique 
monica de greiff who resigned as justice minister last week 
after being threatened by drug traffickers said she was promised 
19 million in extra us aid earlier this month to protect judges 
the union said it has heard nothing since about the aid 
colombian judges say that in the meantime many of them earn so 
little that they are forced to take a bus to work despite cocaine 
barons threats to kill 10 judges for each suspected trafficker 
extradited to the united states 
since 1981 about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been 
killed and judges this year have repeatedly walked off the job or 
threatened to strike over a lack of security 
the national association of judicial employees says 1600 of the 
countrys 5000 judges have been threatened with death in the last 
12 months 
so far just one such suspect has been extradited to the united 
states since president virgilio barco decreed emergency powers last 
month in declaring war on the drug bosses the army said sunday 
that it had captured another carlos gomez zapata who is wanted on 
drug trafficking charges in florida 
barco on wednesday begins his trip to the united states in 
addition to a meeting with bush on thursday he is expected to 
plead for help in the drug war in an address to the un general 
assembly 
cocaine and coffee will be the topics of his meeting with bush 
according to the agenda published in bogota newspapers in recent 
days 
colombians have complained that what the united states gives 
military aid to fight the drug traffickers but costs colombia 
coffee revenues because of washingtons opposition to an 
international agreement on coffee quotas and prices

the government today unveiled a 750 billion 
budget that cuts military spending by 83 percent and increases 
financing for social needs reflecting the soviet unions shifting 
priorities under mikhail s gorbachev 
finance minister valentin pavlov said the government is planning 
to cut the 192 billion deficit in half by raising 83 billion in 
new revenues and trimming expenditures by 103 billion 
he told the opening of the fall session of the supreme soviet 
legislature that military spending could be cut because the soviet 
unions realistic and constructive foreign policy had led to an 
improvement in international relations 
the decision to cut military spending from 119 billion to 109 
billion is in keeping with a directive from the congress of 
peoples deputies parliament to cut military spending by 14 percent 
by 1991 pavlov said 
military research alone will be cut by 34 billion he said 
officials say the 1990 budget is of an emergency character 
because of the deficit that has spun out of control as the 
countrys economic situation worsens the budget deficit is only 
the second the soviet government has acknowledged 
the finance minister said the government was planning to raise 
pensions for 60 million retirees by an average of 15 percent and 
reorient the soviet economy toward fulfilling social needs 
pavlov did not immediately say how the government would raise 
the extra money 
earlier in the day gorbachev told the supreme soviet that the 
government will take firm steps to settle the ethnic dispute over 
nagornokarabakh if armenia and azerbaijan cannot end it quickly 
if the situation doesnt stabilize i think our government 
along with the republics will have to take concrete steps 
gorbachev said over the dispute over the autonomous region of 
nagornokarabakh in azerbaijan 
armenia and azerbaijan two neighboring southern soviet 
republics have been locked in a bitter 19month dispute over 
control of the enclave about 100 people have died in the ethnic 
conflict 
an economic blockade of mainly christian armenia which receives 
more than 80 percent of its food and fuel via predominantly moslem 
azerbaijan has left shelves bare and industry at a virtual 
standstill 
gorbachev did not say what measures he had in mind but in 
replying to legislators questions gorbachev indicated that he 
wanted the problem resolved within days 
located in the caucasus mountains in the southern soviet union 
north of iran nagornokarabakhs area is 1760 square miles 
slightly smaller than delaware the 1979 soviet census put 
nagornokarabakhs population at 162000 of which 76 percent were 
ethnic armenians and 23 percent ethnic azerbaijanis under 
gorbachev the supreme soviet has been transformed from a rubber 
stamp for communist party directives into a lively forum for debate 
the current body chosen after spring elections that gave soviet 
voters their first choice among candidates in seven decades is 
scheduled to sit for two months 
it has about 80 items on its agenda including the matter of 
granting economic sovereignty for several of the countrys 15 
republics and methods for settling labor disputes the official 
tass news agency said 
the body will devote mondays and tuesdays to general sessions 
and the rest of each week to committee meetings 
in its first session as a competitively elected body the 
542member supreme soviet held confirmation hearings on 
cabinetlevel jobs and forced the withdrawal of several candidates 
put forward by the government 
on the agenda now are calls by the congress of peoples 
deputies first organized opposition group to permit people to own 
their own land establish market pricing permit independent 
television broadcasting and allow soviets to move freely within 
their country 
soviets must now carry internal passports and obtain permission 
to move into desired urban areas such as moscow and the government 
still denies external passports to many citizens 
the group of 345 reformminded deputies of the 2250member 
congress known as the interregional group includes such supreme 
soviet legislators as political maverick boris n yeltsin and human 
rights activist andrei sakharov 
the supreme soviet is made up of fulltime legislators elected 
by the congress which meets at least once a year and was chosen in 
spring elections 
the interregional group is calling for legalization of private 
property and the introduction of market pricing gorbachevs 
advisers also have promoted letting supply and demand set prices 
but in the face of strong public objection to lifting government 
subsidies the government has promised to delay the proposal for 
several years 
the opposition group proposes that the vast industrial 
ministries which now control the supplies and decisions of most 
factories in the country be replaced with small commissions of 
experts in the field 
the group also wants an end to the government monopoly on 
television

salvage crews removed the wreckage of a usair 
jet from the east river to check it for evidence of a mechanical 
flaw that might have caused last weeks crash while prosecutors 
weighed criminal charges against the crew 
a grand jury could be asked to consider charges of leaving the 
scene of an accident or even criminally negligent homicide against 
the pilot and copilot of the boeing 737400 a source in the 
district attorneys office told the associated press 
another source in the office told the daily news that queens 
borough district attorney john j santucci may offer immunity from 
prosecution to the copilot constantine kleissas in return for his 
testimony 
santuccis office on sunday declared the crash site off 
laguardia airport a crime scene 
the national transportation safety board is conducting a 
separate probe into wednesdays crash of flight 5050 which killed 
two people 59 others were rescued from the partially submerged 
plane that skidded off a runway and cracked into three pieces 
a lawyer for kleissas and for the captain michael w martin 
said he saw no basis for a grand jury probe and news reports 
indicated some investigators were skeptical the criminal charges 
would hold up 
based on everything i know there is absolutely no criminal 
act committed by either pilot said the attorney frederick 
hafetz 
he said the two men have been fully cooperative with the 
regulatory authorities 
but kleissas and martin were criticized by federal officials for 
failing to submit immediately to drug and alcohol testing although 
they are not legally required to do so they submitted urine 
samples for testing on friday but results will not be available 
for three weeks 
the two pilots flight licenses were suspended because they 
disappeared from the accident scene authorities said 
crews on sunday hoisted the plane from the river and federal 
authorities said they would examine it to see if mechanical 
problems caused or contributed to the crash 
the planes front tail and main fuselage sections were taken to 
an american airlines hangar at laguardia ntsb spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz said 
investigators said they found that the wheels under the 
jetliners nose were locked to the right indicating the pilot had 
turned them sharply to counter the planes pull to the left 
authorities said martin 36 has told investigators he aborted 
the takeoff because the aircraft was drifting to the left and he 
felt and heard a strange vibration 
he believed he had enough room to stop the plane but it skidded 
off the runway and into the water 
at weekend news conferences ntsb officials said kleissas had 
inadvertently pushed a button that shut off an automatic throttle 
but the planes unexplained veer to the left also was being 
investigated as a cause for the crash 
kleissas 29 who had flown a 737400 only once before on a 
passenger flight was at the controls but martin manually took 
over the throttle after kleissas pushed the button authorities 
said

classrooms in nearly every utah school 
district were empty today as teachers staged a oneday strike to 
protest low funding overcrowded classrooms and inadequate supplies 
the walkout the largest by educators in utah in a quarter 
century involved nearly 20000 teachers and affected 450000 
students in 800 schools officials said 
only two of utahs 40 school districts closed for the day state 
board of education spokeswoman eileen rancher said the exceptions 
were the daggett and south summit districts both in the sparsely 
populated northeastern corner of the state the south summit 
schools were expected to operate without teachers 
on saturday the utah education association the states largest 
teachers union said its local affiliates voted unanimously to 
support the walkout the uea says it represents 85 to 90 percent of 
the states educators 
saturdays action was spurred by a spontaneous walkout that 
began friday morning at davis high school in davis county just 
north of salt lake city and spread to schools in three other large 
school districts by the end of the day 
the strike apparently was incited by anger over the 
legislatures decision in a special session last week to give 
utahns a 384 million tax rebate and not to allocate money to 
education from a 94 million surplus 
teachers are decrying low pay large classes and inadequate 
school supplies teachers pay in utah ranks 43rd in the nation 
4500 less than the average national salary of 29400 the 
association says 
gov norm bangerter at a sunday evening news conference said 
he sympathized with the teachers but thought they should wait for 
the january legislative session to press their demands 
i agree with the teachers that education needs more money 
bangerter said i dont agree with the tactic 
however he acknowledged that the walkout draws attention to 
the serious problems that exist in the school system 
bangerter pledged that education would be treated honorably 
and honestly in january he said the surplus may approach 185 
million by years end but said that not all of that would go to 
education 
we have other state needs he said 
the public schoolteachers had urged their university 
counterparts to join the walkout but there was no sign that large 
numbers of faculty were doing so this morning 
at the univeristy of utah psychology professor stephen golding 
had said some professors might cancel classes or use the time for 
discussions on what he called the education crisis in utah 
however no classes had been canceled by midmorning on the first 
day of fall quarter said university spokeswoman shawn anderson

lower interest rates lured buyers back into 
the existing home market last month when sales rose 33 percent to 
their highest level in six months a real estate group reported 
monday 
the august improvement reflects buyers taking advantage of 
the declining interest rates during june and july to get into the 
housing market said ira gribin president of the national 
association of realtors 
the realtors reported existing singlefamily homes sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 344 million units last month 
up from julys revised 333 million units the august pace was the 
best since februarys 348 million units 
the federal home loan mortgage corp reported friday that 
fixedrate home mortgages were averaging 1003 percent down from 
their peak rate of 1122 percent in march 
the realtors report also said the median price of a home fell 
1800 to 94900 in august down 19 percent from july the 
median price means half of the homes cost more half less 
gribin said the seasonal decline in the median price suggested 
that many sales were to entrylevel buyers coming in at the low end 
of the market 
but the bulk of the market roughly twothirds continues to 
be repeat home buyers so there is still much to be done to ease 
affordability conditions for potential firsttime buyers he said 
the august sales pace was 68 percent below the august 1988 rate 
of 369 million units 
john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist said he 
expected existing singlefamily sales to total about 341 million 
in 1989 down about 5 percent from last years 359 million 
the northeast showed the largest sales improvement over july 
with a 73 percent gain to a seasonally adjusted 590000 units 
however the august pace was 132 percent below that of the same 
month a year ago 
the midwest registered a 44 percent gain to 950000 units 
followed by the south with a 34 percent advance to 135 million 
units 
the west showed the only decline in sales down 35 percent to 
550000 units 
median prices were 148400 in the northeast 72300 in the 
midwest 87400 in the south and 139400 in the west

winning the war on drugs may require 
legalizing the personal use of cocaine and buying up the entire 
coca leaf crop perus foreign minister said monday 
in a speech to the general assembly foreign minister guillermo 
larcocox noted the emergence of international drug gangsters and 
alliances between terrorists and drug traffickers 
to break up the lucrative illegal drug trade he proposed the 
partial conversion of the foreign debt into resources to fight 
illegal drug trafficking the legal acquisition of the whole of the 
coca leaf production and finally the decriminalization of 
consumption 
although larcocox said his proposals were tentative he 
described them as going beyond the stage of reciprocal 
accusations between producing and consuming countries 
he said simply suppressing the cultivation of the coca leaf 
from which thousands of peruvian peasants derive their income 
would be promoting a social problem of hunger and a protest which 
may swell subversion and the relocation of illegal crops 
peru is fighting both the cocaine trade and the shining path 
leftist insurgency which is promoting a maoiststyle peasant 
revolution in the andean mountains

trade disputes between the united states 
and japan should not stand in the way of greater cooperation in 
space vice president dan quayle said monday 
quayle and prime minister toshiki kaifu agreed that their 
nations would work together on a project to measure the effects of 
solar radiation on the earths magnetic field 
quayle also said the united states remains the best hope for 
space exploration and pioneering the last frontier 
the united states has taken and will continue to take the lead 
in space activities and we believe japan will be a very good 
partner in exploration of space quayle told reporters 
asked about japansoviet space cooperation quayle did not 
comment directly but said im convinced the best hope for space 
exploration and pioneering rests with the united states 
the soviet union facing financial and political problems in its 
own space program has made overtures to japan on joint development 
of space aircraft the soviet space agency plans to include a 
japanese journalist in a crew traveling to the soviet mir space 
station in 1991 
quayle who chairs the us national space council said a trade 
dispute over satellites should be treated separately from overall 
cooperation in space exploration 
under us trade legislation dubbed the super 301 japan 
could face retaliation for what us officials charge is its 
refusal to buy competitively priced usmade satellites 
japan and the united states will have a partnership in space 
activities super 301 will be treated separately that issue should 
not be a hindrance in cooperation in space quayle said 
the exploration of space is an expensive proposition 
therefore we need international cooperation and contributions of 
partners such as japan quayle said 
mondays agreement calls for japan to provide a satellite and 
scientific instruments and the united states to provide equipment 
and launch the satellite in 1992 said a joint statement issued by 
quayle and kaifu 
quayle who attended a luncheon with emperor akihito on monday 
leaves tuesday for the philippines he also is to visit malaysia

superficially facilitate development but not in the long run 
his statement contrasted with the view once widely held in the 
third world that efforts at conservation are an obstacle to their 
progress or even part of a plot by former colonial powers to hold 
them back 
chidzero appeared at a news conference on a development 
committee report world bank support for the environment made 
public monday the bank is owned by 152 countries with the largest 
voting power in the hands of the united states it is the largest 
source of development loans to third world countries 
figures the bank made public last week showed a continuing 
decline of incomes in many third world countries in 1988 figures 
from its sister organization the international monetary fund 
indicate a continued decline of average incomes in much of southern 
africa and latin america 
the world bank has been heavily criticized by environmentalists 
and members of congress as neglecting or even undercutting 
conservation for example it helped build a major road in western 
brazil that brought in large numbers of settlers whose main purpose 
was to destroy the rain forest so they could plant crops 
managers of the bank have countered criticism with increased 
attention to environment issues 
if the world bank has been part of the problem in the past it 
can and will be a strong force in finding solutions for the 
future bank president barber conable was quoted as saying in a 
new brochure issued by the bank the brochure is called striking 
a balance the environmental challenge of development 
the banks goal is to blur the lines between environmental 
activities and the rest of the banks work it said 
the bank approved more than 21 billion in new loans last year 
it has been trying to take environmental protection into account 
each time it makes a loan on sunday it announced that it a new 
phase of a joint project with the european investment bank and the 
un development fund to help clean up the mediterranean initially 
it will have 10 million to 15 million to spend 
the brochure told of moving a group of patagonian conures a 
rare parrot to new breeding areas when the old ones were about to 
be disturbed by a dam under construction in chile other projects 
will help manage forests in sri lanka and promote reforestation in 
bangladesh

a low overpass ripped a valve off a 
propane truck today allowing highly flammable propane gas to spew 
into the air and the truck blocked evacuation of a subdivision 
authorities said 
youve got a lot of gas you cant move the truck its a very 
dangerous situation said police chief madison bailey 
no injuries fire or explosions were reported 
electricity in the area was shut off to prevent ignition of the 
propane 
bailey said many of the estimated 300 to 400 people authorities 
wanted to evacuate from the area were being concentrated instead in 
a community hall at the opposite end of their subdivision from the 
truck earlier he said they had been evacuated 
the subdivision which contains about 600 homes is at the 
northern end of aquidneck island and is surrounded by water on 
three sides the only roads out of it pass through the site where 
the truck was wedged under the low railroad bridge 
if necessary the residents would be led out of the area on foot 
across a golf course bailey said 
bailey said the leak was bigger than authorities first thought 
and estimated it would take several hours for all the 1900 gallons 
of liquefied propane to vaporize he said it had proved to be 
impossible to transfer the propane to another truck 
the wind which had been blowing the gas away from the homes 
had shifted by midday and was bringing it closer to the homes 
bailey said 
players were evacuated from a nearby golf course golf pro 
stephen diemoz said he had to drive the course in a golf cart to 
round up players they said this thing has the potential to 
create a fireball that could last for a mile and we were downwind 
of it diemoz said 
a highway through the area was closed as was a bridge linking 
portsmouth an aquidneck island town of 15000 to tiverton on the 
mainland 
the truck missed clearing the overpass by just a few inches 
said fire lt john martin 
he didnt tear the tank open martin said he knocked a 
valve off the top of the tank that was protruding 
the bridge is 9 feet 5 inches high and the truck missed 
clearing it by just a few inches bailey said 
the propane was allowed to continue leaking as it vaporized 
because authorities feared it would be too risky to try to cap the 
leak martin said 
robert ferreira air traffic manager for the federal aviation 
administration in providence said the faa was considering closing 
the area within a fivemile radius to aircraft because of the 
threat of ignition he did not know if that would disrupt takeoffs 
or landings at any nearby airports 
an emergency response team from the state department of 
environmental management was on the way spokeswoman fran segerson 
said

an appeals court is being asked to decide 
whether an oil company seeking to replace a pipe will have to do it 
the oldfashioned way with human hands and horses 
in august judge richard i evans ruled that the ohio oil 
gathering corp could not be barred from replacing the pipe it 
installed more than 60 years ago but he said the company could not 
use heavy machinery that might damage property outside the 10foot 
easement it was granted in 1924 
the property owner bruce shrimplin of warsaw had fought the 
companys efforts to replace the pipe 
the company had argued that the easement was not practical for 
modern machinery and said the primary purpose of the easement 
granted by john b foster the propertys previous owner was to 
give the company access even if it damaged the land 
but evans sided with shrimplin citing a handwritten statement 
by foster in the original document that said this grant covers 
the pipe line in the place and manner it is now laid 
the judge ruled that fosters statement limited the methods and 
machinery that could be used to those available in 1924 
while the company may employ some modern materials such as 
welded pipe rather than pipes joined by threaded joints common to 
the 1920s the company is not free to invade defendants land 
with a horde of monstrous machines which subject the land to much 
greater damage than was ever thought of by john b foster in 
1924 evans said 
crops and fences can be replaced in short order native 
hardwood trees and valuable topsoil cannot the judge wrote 
the company appealed on thursday 
a witness for the company reo davis said that when the pipes 
were laid men with shovels dug the trench the pipes were hauled 
to the site by teams of horses and the pipes were laid by hand

a 69000volt electrical wire touched a 
scaffolding being moved at a construction site today killing three 
workers and injuring three others authorities said 
the accident occurred as six workers were rolling the 25foot 
scaffolding away from a building under construction at worthington 
industries on the citys north side said doug reardon president 
of target construction co the general contractor no one was on 
the scaffolding 
the workers all men were putting up aluminum siding on the 
building which is to be a distribution center 
officials at columbus southern power co said the cable which 
ran about 30 feet from the building was carrying 69000 volts of 
electricity enough voltage to supply a small town the electric 
company was called to cut power to the site 
reardon said workers generally do not consider wires to be a 
work hazard unless they are within 10 feet he said they probably 
thought they had enough room to safely move the scaffolding which 
was on wheels to another wall of the building 
roscoe blackburn 24 a target construction employee said he 
was one of several workers installing a roof on the building when 
the accident occurred shortly after 10 am 
i saws a big spark and we went to the edge to look over and 
saw them all lying on the ground he said we got off of there 
we just started yelling for help 
he said the six victims still appeared to be in contact with the 
scaffolding so he and the others did not try to move them 
joe keefer fire battalion chief said three of the men died 
and the injured were taken to hospitals 
they were all just lying on the ground two survivors 
appeared to be in pretty serious shape keefer said im not 
sure about the other one 
worthington industries which makes steel is just north of 
interstate 270 the citys outer belt traffic leading to the site 
was blocked off 
a woman who answered the telephone at worthington said she had 
no details about the accident she referred questions to a 
spokesman who did not immediately return telephone calls

the former husband of dr elizabeth morgan 
today challenged the constitutionality of a law designed to free 
his former wife after 25 months behind bars for concealing their 
daughter in a bitter custodey battle 
morgan remained in jail awaiting action on a weekend request 
filed by her lawyers that she be freed 
in a brief filed with the district of columbia court of appeals 
lawyers for morgans former husband dr eric foretich claim the 
legislation which president bush signed saturday infringed on the 
powers of the local courts 
the attorney elaine mittleman also said the bill violated 
foretichs rights and those of the couples daughter hilary 7 
the justice department also expressed reservations to president 
bush that the law might be an unconstitutional intrusion by 
congress on the powers of the judicial branch to enforce its 
orders according to a department source who declined to be 
identified 
david runkel chief spokesman for attorney general dick 
thornburgh refused to say what kind of advice the department had 
given bush before he signed the measure 
morgan has been in jail rather than produce the child for a 
courtordered visit with foretich claiming he had sexually abused 
hilary foretich denies the allegation 
the child remains in an undisclosed location 
we have not heard anything on how the court will handle it 
said morgan attorney adrian roe its really in the courts 
hands 
were hopeful the court will act promptly but we have no 
guarantees roe said 
ms mittleman said the court could order a hearing on the case 
and that there was no guarantee that the court would immediately 
issue an order freeing morgan 
a threejudge panel heard arguments in the case last year and 
the full court held a rehearing last wednesday 
foretich and ms mittleman both stressed that the bill does not 
require ms morgan to produce the girl 
foretich said he would be delighted to have his former wife 
released if the federal government helped him find their daughter 
but until theyre willing to do that i dont see where i have 
any choice but to concern myself with the violation of my rights 
and those of my daughter he added 
dc corrections department spokeswoman patricia wheeler said 
jail officials required a court order to release morgan 
ms mittleman said foretich has asked bush to direct the 
attorney general to either appoint a special prosecutor or tell the 
fbi to help find the child 
foretich has offered a 5000 reward to anyone who could provide 
information on hilarys whereabouts 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush signed the 
bill out of compassion for her plight after members of 
congress also concerned about her case passed legislation to free 
morgan 
the measure signed by bush which will be applied retroactively 
to morgans case sets a oneyear limit on civil contempt jailings 
in child custody cases in the district of columbia the law is to 
expire after 18 months

president bush challenging the soviet 
union to rid the earth of this scourge of chemical weapons 
said today the united states will destroy more than 80 percent of 
its stockpiles if moscow reduces its arsenals to an equal level 
the world has lived too long in a shadow of chemical 
warfare bush told the united nations general assembly seeking 
to spur a 40nation treaty conference aimed at banning the weapons 
entirely 
while the chemical weapons plan was the centerpiece of his 
remarks bush also paid tribute to the soviet union for removing 
a number of obstacles on treaties reducing longrange nuclear 
weapons as well as troops and tanks in europe 
bush took note of the array of agreements reached during a 
weekend of talks between secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze as well as a 
decision to hold a summit meeting with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev by early next summer 
each of these achievements is important in its own right but 
they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that 
prevails between the us and ussr he said serious 
differences remain we know that but the willingness to deal 
constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we 
and indeed the world must welcome 
bushs nationally televised speech marked his first to the 
united nations general assembly as president bush served as un 
ambassador in the early 1970s and told his audience it was a 
homecoming for both barbara and me 
his speech was interrupted twice by applause once when he 
called for the elimination of chemical weapons and again when he 
touched on the progress of the weekend superpower talks 
shevardnadze who will address the world body tuesday called 
bushs speech a constructive statement in the spirit of the 
times in the spirit of the tasks that we are facing that the us 
is facing and in a broader context too 
he said the soviet union had a positive view of the chemical 
weapons proposals 
in his remarks bush said the world was witnessing a rise of 
freedom and cited advances in hungary poland latin america and 
africa 
make no mistake nothing can stand in the way of freedoms 
march the president said 
today we are witnessing an ideological collapse the demise of 
the totalitarian idea of the omniscient allpowerful state he 
said 
yet he cautioned we have not entered an era of perpetual 
peace he said regimes throughout the world were emerging armed 
with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass 
destruction 
bush said regional conflicts may well threaten world peace as 
never before 
his offer to slash us chemical weapon stockpiles was both a 
challenge to the soviet union to follow his lead and an invitation 
to the 38 other nations whose negotiations in geneva to ban the 
weapons are moving at a snails pace 
let us act together beginning today to rid the earth of this 
scourge he said 
baker had given shevardnadze advance word of the chemical 
weapons proposal during their talks in jackson hole wyo the two 
agreed on a twostage ussoviet program to exchange information 
about their chemical weapons and to inspect each others plants and 
arsenals 
only the united states and the soviet union admit to having 
posion gas but bush said more than 20 nations possess chemical 
weapons or the capability to produce them 
and these horrible weapons are now finding their way into 
regional conflicts he said this is unacceptable 
he referred to us accusations that iraq and iran both used 
poison gas in the persian gulf war 
for the sake of mankind we must halt and reverse this 
threat 
bush outlined a series of steps the united states was willing to 
take to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons and move 
toward an international ban to take effect 10 years after an 
agreement was signed 
the three major elements of bushs plan 
while working to complete a global agreement the united states 
will eliminate more than 80 percent of its stockpile if the 
soviet union joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal 
level and we agree on the conditions including inspections under 
which stockpiles are destroyed bush said 
once an international treaty is signed the united states will 
destroy more than 98 percent of its current chemical weapons 
stockpile over an eightyear period provided the soviet union 
joins the ban i think they will he said 
the remaining 2 percent would be destroyed over the next two 
years after all countries capable of producing chemical weapons 
become partners to the agreement 
the soviets acknowledge having 50000 tons of chemical weapons 
some analysts think they may have more the united states has never 
publicly released figures on its own arsenal analysts estimate it 
totals 30000 tons 
bush said it would be difficult to monitor a total ban on 
chemical weapons but said recent research as well as information 
obtained in recent arms control discussions makes me believe we 
can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to 
go forward with the ban 
on other fronts bush called for international cooperation on 
illegal drugs the environment and terrorism 
he said narcotics were a menace to social order and a source 
of human misery whereever they gain a foothold the nations who 
suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight and we are 
urging a united stand on terrorism bush said hostage taking 
and the terror of random violence are methods that cannot win the 
worlds approval 
bush urged the general assembly to condemn the murder of marine 
lt col william r higgins who was taken hostage in lebanon while 
on a un peacekeeping mission last year his captors said they 
hanged him this summer in retaliation for israels abduction of a 
moslem cleric 
the president said higgins was a soldier of peace and called 
on those resposible for his death to have the decency to return 
his body 
and let us all right now right here rededicate ourselves 
and our nations to the cause that col higgins served so 
selflessly 
bush had a full day of activities at the united nations among 
them separate meetings with un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar brazils president jose sarney israeli finance minister 
shimon peres guatemalan president vinicio cerezo venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez and bolivian president jaime paz 
zamora 
bush also scheduled a lunch for nato allies and with his wife 
barbara a visit to the metropolitan museum of art for a diplomatic 
reception and dinner 
in their weekend meetings baker and shevardnadze signed an 
agreement to exchange data on chemical weapons by the end of the 
year and allow visits by inspectors of the other side to stockpiles 
and plants by june 30 in a second phase there would be more 
intensive onsite inspections of the submitted data 
they also reached agreement on the broad principles for 
verifying limits on strategic forces and nuclear tests 
in a major development the soviets said they would drop their 
demand that the united states abandon work on its star wars missile 
defense program before concluding a treaty curbing longrange 
missiles bombers and submarines

a tree planted by president bush in 
riverfront park last week has been vandalized and is probably 
unsalvageable officials said 
a park worker sunday morning found the 12foot american elm 
sapling grown from seeds taken from a tree on the white house 
lawn uprooted near where it had been planted sgt jim nicks said 
we have no suspects and we have no idea why it happened he 
said 
taylor bressler park superintendent said after an inspection 
this morning that the tree was broken and uprooted all three 
branches have been ground off he said it didnt look real 
hot to tell you the truth 
a park horticulturalist was going to see whether the trees 
limbs could be grafted but his gut feeling was the tree could 
not be repaired bressler said 
the elm was not marked as the tree bush had planted because a 
plaque he brought along had not yet been installed officials said 
but it was the only recently planted tree in the park 
bush and house speaker tom foley dwash planted the tree 
tuesday during a ceremony in the parks lilac bowl 
the sapling was grown from seeds taken from a tree planted on 
the white house grounds in the 1820s by president john quincy adams 
white house groundskeepers have been asked about getting a 
replacement tree but im sure thats a limited resource

the un is moving closer to that ideal and it has the support of 
the united states of america in recent years certainly since my 
time here the war of words that has often echoed in this chamber 
is giving way to a new mood weve seen a welcomed shift from 
polemics to peacekeeping un peacekeeping forces are onduty right 
now and over the years more than 700 peacekeepers have given 
their lives in service to the united nations 
today i want to remember one of those soldiers of peace an 
american on a mission of peace under the united nations flag on a 
mission really for all the world a man of unquestioned bravery 
unswerving dedication to the united nations ideal lieutenant 
colonel william richard higgins and i call on the general assembly 
to condemn the murder of this soldier of peace and call on those 
responsible to have the decency to return his remains to his family 
and let us all right now right here rededicate ourselves and our 
nations to the cause that colonel higgins served so selflessly 
the founders of this historic institution believed that it was 
here that the nations of the world might come to agree that law 
not force shall govern and the united nations can play a 
fundamental role in the central issue of our time for today 
theres an idea at work around the globe an idea of undeniable 
force and that idea is freedom 
freedoms advance is evident everywhere central europe and 
hungary where state and society are now in the midst of a movement 
towards political pluralism and a free market economy where the 
barrier that once enforced an unnatural division between hungary 
and its neighbors to the west has been torn down torn down 
replaced by a new hope for the future a new hope in freedom 
we see freedom at work in poland where in deference to the will 
of the people the communist party has relinquished its monopoly on 
power and indeed in the soviet union where the world hears the 
voices of people no longer afraid to speak out or to assert the 
right to rule themselves 
but freedoms march is not confined to a single continent or to 
the developed world alone we see the rise of freedom in latin 
america where one by one dictatorships are giving way to 
democracy we see it on the continent of africa where more and 
more nations see in the system of free enterprise salvation for 
economies crippled by excessive state control east and west north 
and south on every continent we can see the outlines of a new 
world of freedom 
of course freedoms work remains unfinished the trend we see 
is not yet universal some regimes still stand against the tide 
some rulers still deny the right of the people to govern 
themselves but now the power of prejudice and despotism is 
challenged never before have these regimes stood so isolated and 
alone so out of step with the steady advance of freedom today we 
are witnessing an ideological collapse the demise of the

there are many reasons for this collapse but in the end one 
fact alone explains what we see today advocates of the 
totalitarian idea so its triumph written in the laws of history 
they failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the 
human heart 
two hundred years ago today the united states our congress 
proposed the bill of rights fundamental freedoms belonging to 
every individual rights no government can deny those same rights 
have been recognized in this congress of nations in the words of 
the universal declaration of human rights a common standard of 
achievement for all peoples and all nations 
from where we stand on the threshold of this new world of 
freedom the trend is clear enough if for those who write the 
history of our times the 20th century is remembered as the century 
of the state the 21st century must be an era of emancipation the 
age of the individual 
make no mistake nothing can stand in the way of freedoms 
march there will come a day when freedom is seen the world over to 
be universal birthright a universal birthright of every man and 
woman of every race and walk of life even under the worst 
circumstances at the darkest of times freedom has always remained 
alive a distant dream perhaps but always alive 
today that dream is no longer distant for the first time for 
millions around the world a new world of freedom is within reach 
today is freedoms moment you see the possibility now exists for 
the creation of a true community of nations built on shared 
interests and ideals a true community a world where free 
governments and free markets meet the rising desire of the people 
to control their own destiny to live in dignity and to exercise 
freely their fundamental human rights 
it is time that we work together to deliver that destiny into 
the hands of men and women everywhere our challenge is to 
strengthen the foundations of freedom encourage its advance and 
face our most urgent challenges the global challenges of the 21st 
century economic health environmental wellbeing the great 
questions of war and peace 
first global economic growth during this decade a number of 
developing nations have moved into the ranks of the worlds most 
advanced economies all of them each and every one powered by the 
engine of free enterprise in the decade ahead others can join 
their ranks but for many nations barriers stand in the way 
in the case of some countries these are obstacles of their own 
making unneeded restrictions and regulations that act as dead 
weights on their own economies and obstacles to foreign trade but 
other barriers to growth exist and those too require effective 
action 
too many developing countries struggle today under a burden of 
debt that makes growth all but impossible the nations of the world 
deserve better opportunity to achieve a measure of control over 
their own economic fate and build better lives for their own 
people the approach the us has put forward the brady plan will 
help these nations reduce that debt and at the same time encourage 
the free market reforms that will fuel economic growth 
in just two days i will be speaking to the international 
monetary fund and the world bank and ill discuss there in more 
detail the steps that our nations can take in dealing with the debt 
problem but i can say now the new world of freedom is not a world 
where a few nations live in comfort while others live in want the 
power of commerce is a force for progress open markets are the key 
to continued growth in the developing world 
today the united states buys over onehalf of the manufactured 
exports that all developing nations combined sell to the 
industrialized world its time for the other advanced economies to 
follow suit to create expanded opportunities for trade i believe 
well learn in the century ahead that many nations of the world 
have barely begun to tap their true potential for development the 
free market and its fruits are not the special preserve of a few 
they are a harvest that everyone can share

brendan gill who has been writing for 
the new yorker for more than 50 years says the venerable weekly 
has gone to a more commercial look but still is the best job in 
the world for a writer 
theres been a change in ownership but that hasnt affected 
the editorial side as far as i can see he said in an interview 
published sunday 
its a less pleasing place to have ones work appear because 
it has a more commercial look than it used to with the cluster 
advertising and the fluttering snowflakes of renewal forms falling 
out he said but the contents of the magazine are as good as 
ever and im as eager as ever to appear in its pages 
gill said the editors still live up to their reputation for 
relentless pursuit of clean writing 
every sentence you set down is subject to a series of 
challenges he told the hartford courant but in the end 
although you feel very irritated the finished product is not 
anything but improved it is impregnable

joe clark the former principal who 
patrolled his new jersey school with a baseball bat and bullhorn to 
maintain order and keep out drug dealers says he believes us 
society is near the eve of destruction 
i do feel that we are a nation precariously perched a nation 
at risk from a moral standpoint from an educational standpoint a 
spiritual standpoint and an ethical standpoint he said 
clark subject of the movie lean on me is scheduled to 
share his views on education in a speech tuesday at the university 
of wisconsineau claire 
my philosophy is very very simple he said the 
educational environment must be conducive to learning you cant 
have hooligans and thugs and grown men and women who are just there 
to disrupt 
former president reagan complimented clarks tough leadership at 
paterson east high but critics complained that his style might 
also have driven away potentially successful students

in a final bid to recover the 
bones of one of this citys greatest sons scientists are peeling 
away thin layers of soil on the spot where they hope rembrandt van 
rijn was buried 300 years ago 
the grave of the painters only son titus surfaced during 
restoration work in amsterdams 17thcentury westerkerk church and 
students of rembrandts life believe the bestknown of dutch 
masters might have been interred next to titus 
we know that rembrandt was buried in the westerkerk but the 
location of his remains is unknown because he had no money for a 
tombstone willem van stigt the architect supervising the 
restoration project said in a graveside interview monday 
titus grave seems as logical a place as any other van 
stigt said rembrandt survived his son by one year dying in 1669 
at the age of 63 
it would be nice if we would know for certain where 
rembrandts grave is located so many tourists are asking for 
it added philip korthals altes an amsterdam stockbroker and the 
chairman of the churchs fundraising committee 
currently only a marble plaque on the westerkerks north wall 
commemorates rembrandt 
bestknown for his monumental night watch on display in the 
rijkmuseum here rembrandt was a prolific painter whose innovative 
use of light made him one of the outstanding representatives of the 
17thcentury dutch school 
when the wooden floor was removed from the westerkerks nave 
several weeks ago titus grave became accessible to scientists of 
the anatomy institute of leiden university 25 miles away 
after a week of digging the first brownish skeleton was found 
monday at a depth of 6 feet 6 inches 
it definitely is not rembrandt said van stigt who noted 
that in the 200 years following the opening of the church in 1631 
people were buried in layers 
it is uncertain whether well ever find titus let alone his 
father said harmen beukers a professor of medical history in 
leiden who leads the research team graves especially those inside 
churches were regularly emptied to make room for new bodies 
down in the 6foot 8inchdeep pit on monday three archeology 
students carefully handled the skeletons bones which were to be 
brought to leiden for further study 
but van stigt said digging must be finished by thursday when 
the construction crews will close the grave and start laying a 
churchwide concrete floor putting a final lid on the graves 
beneath it 
were digging in a hurry but well do the examination of the 
bones at a slower pace beukers told the associated press in a 
telephone interview he said it would take months if not years to 
establish the identities of the skeletons 
after determining the skeletons age and sex their particulars 
will be compared with the entries in the westerkerks burial books 
beukers said officials were unsure where the bones would be taken 
after they are studied 
if theres a clear indication that one of the skeletons might be 
rembrandts other tests will be done beukers said we might 
want to determine the lead content of the bones for 17thcentury 
paint contained lots of lead he said 
but its unlikely that when the westerkerk reopens in all its 
former glory next may the painters grave will be one of the 
buildings prominent features 
personally i think that the chance that hes lying there is 
minimal beukers said

ptls chief builder testified today that 
he took an offer from evangelist jerry falwell to ptl founder jim 
bakker that would give bakker a 300000 salary if he kept his 
mouth shut 
builder roe messner testifying for the defense at bakkers 
fraud trial also said a top bakker aide claimed to be acting on 
my own in offering hush money to jessica hahn 
a spokesman for falwell disputed the witness account saying 
that what messner described as an offer from falwell to bakker was 
really a request from bakker to falwell 
falwell whose television ministry is based in lynchburg va 
and who started the defunct moral majority took over ptl 
temporarily in 1987 after bakker resigned following disclosure of 
the sexandmoney scandal involving ms hahn 
under questioning from defense attorneys messner said that 
after bakker left the ministry and falwell took it over falwell 
sent him to palm springs calif to make bakker an offer that 
included 300000 salary a maid a security guard for a year 
health insurance and phone expenses 
bakkers wife tammy wrote the offer down and bakker wrote at 
the bottom of the piece of paper im not making any demands on 
ptl im not asking for anything bakkers statement was 
apparently in reference to whether he would return to ptl 
bakker is accused of defrauding followers who sent ptl more than 
158 million and of misusing more than 37 million in ministry 
money for his own benefit he faces up to 120 years in prison and 
more than 5 million in fines if convicted on all charges 15 
counts of wire fraud eight counts of mail fraud and one count of 
conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud 
messner testified about the 265000 hush money payment to ms 
hahn saying richard dortch ptls executive vice president asked 
him to do a favor on feb 21 1985 
dortch had legal papers with him and told messner that if he 
didnt pay a woman from new york 265000 then she would go to the 
charlotte observer with allegations that bakker raped her messner 
said dortch came to him for help because dortch knew he would keep 
it confidential 
five days later messner said he wired the 265000 to an 
account number in california that was given to him by dortch 
messner said he asked dortch if bakker knew about the payment 
he said dortch replied no im acting on my own dortch said 
he had the authority to spend the 265000 because he was ptls 
chief executive officer he said 
messner said dortch asked him to make up a bogus invoice for 
work never done which he refused to do 
messner said he agreed to make the payment in part because the 
assemblies of god was named as the potential party in ms hahns 
proposed lawsuit i didnt think the church ought to be dragged 
into this incident messner said 
messner said he didnt know ms hahns name and never heard 
anything else about the situation until bakkers resignation in 
march 1987 
mark demoss a falwell spokesman said falwell sent messner to 
meet with the bakkers not long after bakker resigned but did not 
take any specific offer instead demoss said messner returned 
from the meeting with a handwritten list on mrs bakkers 
stationery of what the bakkers wanted from ptl 
moss said the list included bakkers 300000 annual salary for 
life mrs bakkers 100000 annual salary for life all rights to 
books and records secretary and maid service for a year the south 
carolina lakefront house and attorneys fees 
i would like to think roe just forgot the sequence of 
events demoss said

beyond the challenge of global growth lies another issue of 
global magnitude the environment no line drawn on a map can stop 
the advance of pollution threats to our environment have become 
international problems 
we must develop an international approach to urgent 
environmental issues one that seeks common solutions to common 
problems the united nations is already at work on the question of 
global warming and the effort to prevent oil spills and other 
disasters from fouling our seas and the air we breathe 
and i will tell you now the united states will do its part we 
have committed ourselves to the worldwide phaseout of all 
chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000 
we have proposed amending our own clean air act to ensure clean 
air for our citizens within a single generation weve banned the 
import of ivory to protect the elephant and rhinoceros from the 
human predators who exterminate them for profit 
and weve begun to explore ways to work with other nations with 
the major industrialized democracies and in poland and in hungary 
to make common cause for the sake of our environment 
the environment belongs to all of us 
in this new world of freedom the world citizens must enjoy this 
common trust for generations to come global economic growth the 
stewardship of our planet both are critical issues 
but as always questions of war and peace must be paramount to 
the united nations we must move forward to limit and eliminate 
weapons of mass destruction 
five years ago at the united nations conference on disarmament 
in geneva i presented a united states draft treaty outlawing 
chemical weapons since then progress has been made but time is 
running out 
the threat is growing more than 20 nations now possess chemical 
weapons or the capability to produce them and these horrible 
weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts this is 
simply unacceptable 
for the sake of mankind we must halt and reverse this threat 
today i want to announce steps that the united states is ready 
to take steps to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons 
towards a treaty that will ban elimate all chemical weapons from 
the earth 10 years from the day it is signed 
this initiative contains three major elements 
first in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty 
the us is ready to destroy nearly all 98 percent of our 
chemical weapons stockpile provided the soviet union joins the 
ban and i think they will 
second we are ready to destroy all of our chemical weapons 100 
percent every one within 10 years once all nations capable of 
building chemical weapons sign that total ban treaty 
and third the united states is ready to begin now we will 
eliminate more than 80 percent of our stockpile even as we work to 
complete a treaty if the soviet union joins us in cutting chemical 
weapons to an equal level and we agree on the conditions including 
inspections under which stockpiles are destroyed 
we know that monitoring a total ban on chemical weapons will be 
a challenge but the knowledge weve gained from our recent arms 
control experience and our acclerating research in this area makes 
me believe that we can achieve the level of verification that gives 
us confidence to go forward with the ban 
the world has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare 
so let us act together beginning today to rid the earth of this 
scourge 
we are serious about achieving conventional arms reductions as 
welland thats why we tabled new proposals just last thursday at 
the conventional forces in europe negotiations in vienna 
proposals that demonstrate our commitment to act rapidly to ease 
military tensions in europe and move the nations of that continent 
one step closer to their common destiny a europe whole and free 
and the united states is convinced that open and innovative 
measures can move disarmament forward and also ease international 
tensions 
and thats the idea behind the open skies proposal about 
which the soviets have now expressed a positive attitude its the 
idea behind the open lands proposal permitting for the first 
time ever free travel for all soviet and american diplomats 
throughout each others country 
openness is the enemy of mistrust and every step towards a more 
open world is a step toward the new world we seek 
and let me make this comment on our meetings with the 
distinguished foreign minister of the soviet union mr 
shevardnadze over the past few days i am very pleased by the 
progress made 
the soviet union removed a number of obstacles to progress on 
conventional and strategic arms reductions we reached agreements 
in principle on issues from verification to nuclear testing 
and of course we agreed to a summit in the spring or early 
summer of 1990 and i look forward to meeting mr gorbachev there 
each of these achievements is important in its own right but they 
are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails 
between the united states and the ussr 
serious differences remain we know that but the willingness to 
deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news 
that we and indeed the world must welcome 
we have not entered into an era of perpetual peace the threats 
to peace that nations face may today be changing but theyve not 
vanished 
in fact in a number of regions around the world a dangerous 
combination is now emerging regimes armed with old and 
unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction 
this development will raise the stakes whenever war breaks out 
regional conflict may well threaten world peace as never before 
the challenge of preserving peace is a personal one for all of you 
right here in this hall 
mr secretary general with great respect you have made it your 
own the united nations can be a mediator a forum where parties in 
conflict come in search of peaceful solutions 
for the sake of peace the un must redouble its support for 
the peace efforts now underway in regions of conflict all over the 
world and let me assure you the united states is determined to 
take an active role in settling regional conflicts

sometimes our role in regional disputes is and will be highly 
public and sometimes like many of you we work quietly behind the 
scenes but always we are working for positive change and lasting 
peace 
our world faces other less conventional threats no less 
dangerous to international peace and stability 
illegal drugs are a menace to social order and a source of human 
misery wherever they gain a foothold the nations who suffer this 
scourge must join forces in the fight and we are 
and let me salute the commitment and extraordinary courage of 
one country in particular colombia where we are working with the 
people and their president virgilio barco to put the drug cartels 
out of business bring the drug lords to justice 
and finally we must join forces to combat the threat of 
terrorism every nation and the united nations must send the 
outlaws of the world a clear message hostagetaking and the terror 
of random violence are a message that cannot win the worlds 
approval 
terrorism of any kind is repugnant to all values that a 
civilized world holds in common and make no mistake terrorism is 
a means that no end no matter how just that end can sanctify 
whatever the challenge freedom greatly raises the chances of 
our success freedoms moment is a time for hope for all of the 
world because freedom once set in motion takes on a momentum of 
its own 
as i said the day i assumed the presidency of our country we 
dont have to talk late into the night about which form of 
government is better we know that free government democracy is 
best 
and i believe that it is the hardwon truth of our time the 
unassailable fact that still stands at the end of a century of 
great struggle of human suffering and this is true not because 
all our differences must give way to democracy but because 
democracy makes room for all our differences in democracy 
diversity finds its common home 
at the very heart of the democratic ideal is respect for freedom 
of belief freedom of thought and action in all its diversity for 
human rights 
the world has experienced enough of the ideologies that have 
promised to remake man in some new and better image weve seen the 
colossal tragedies and dashed hopes we know now that freedom and 
democracy hold the answers what men and nations want is the 
freedom to live by their own lights and a chance to prosper in 
peace 
when i began today i spoke to you about peacekeeping i want to 
speak to you now about peace making we must bring peace to the 
people who have never known its blessings 
theres a painting that hangs on the wall of my office in the 
white house and it pictures president abraham lincoln and his 
generals meeting near the end of a war that remains the bloodiest 
in the history of my country 
outside at that moment a battle rages in this picture and yet 
what we see in the distance is a rainbow a symbol of hope of the 
passing of the storm that painting is called the peacemakers 
for me it is a constant reminder that our struggle the 
struggle for peace is a struggle blessed by hope 
i do remember sitting in this hall i remember the mutual 
respect among all of us proudly serving as representatives yes i 
remember the almost endless speeches and i dont want this to be 
one of them the security council sessions the receptions those 
long receiving lines the formal meetings of this assembly and the 
informal discussions in the delegates lounge over here 
and i remember something more something beyond the frantic 
pace and sometimes frustrating experiences of daily life here the 
heartbeat of the united nations the quiet conviction that we could 
make the world more peaceful more free 
what we sought then all of us now lies within our reach i ask 
each of you here in this hall can we not bring a unity of purpose 
to the united nations can we not make this new world of freedom 
the common destiny we seek i believe we can i know we must 
my solemn wish today is that here among the united nations that 
spirit will take hold and that all men and all nations will make 
freedoms moment their own 
thank you god bless you and may god bless the work of the 
united nations thank you very much

polands fledgling noncommunist government 
needs such basic things as telephones and copy machines sen pete 
v domenici said monday urging congress and private american 
industry to help 
the parliaments lack of even the most basic resources is 
mindboggling the new mexico republican said at a news 
conference they dont have functioning phones computers office 
equipment or even copying machines 
it is clear that a simple gift of a helping hand in these 
seemingly minor matters is a necessary first step in helping poland 
to have a properly functioning body of government 
domenici who visited poland last week as head of a delegation 
of present and former legislators said the cost of such a gesture 
would be small but would represent an important first gift of 
democracy 
he said he would urge the senate and house leadership to send a 
team of congressional experts to warsaw to see what they have and 
what they need and report back 
joining domenici on the trip to poland were former vice 
president walter mondale former sen thomas eagleton dmo 
former senate republican leader howard baker of tennessee and

opponents of a holiday to honor murdered civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr filed papers with the 
secretary of states office today to force a statewide vote on the 
newly enacted law 
the opponents have until dec 21 to gather at least 43350 voter 
signatures that would force a statewide vote at the general 
election in november 1990 
if they gather the needed signatures the law would be suspended 
pending results of the vote 
todays filing comes on the first business day since democratic 
gov rose mofford signed a bill to replace the states paid 
columbus day holiday with a king holiday 
the group filing today is led by julian sanders a conservative 
activist who opposes any holiday honoring king because he claims 
the civil rights leader had links to communist groups 
a second group made up largely of italians has also said it 
plans to seek a ballot vote on the issue but only because it wants 
the columbus day holiday preserved and not out of any hostility 
toward king christopher columbus was born in italy 
if both groups agree to use the same set of petitions to gather 
signatures they can combine forces despite different reasons for 
seeking the vote 
the lack of a paid king holiday had triggered convention and 
tourism boycotts of the state that cost it an estimated 200 
million in business 
business executives also claimed it was threatening to derail 
the phoenix areas bid for a 1993 national football league super 
bowl

an era ended monday with the last 
nasa launch of an unmanned rocket from this spaceport where 
responsibility for sending payloads into orbit is being turned over 
to private industry after 400 liftoffs in 31 years 
an atlascentaur vaulted skyward at 456 am with a 125 
million communications satellite to link military commands with 
land sea and air forces and for use by the president in times of 
crisis 
for now on when nasa needs an unmanned rocket it will have to 
buy launch services from mcdonnell douglas general dynamics and 
martin marietta 
the space agency will continue to launch manned space shuttles 
from cape canaveral where nasa got its start and where it has 
launched nearly all of its rockets 
the national aeronautics and space administration has one 
unmanned rocket left for launch but it will carry its payload a 
scientific satellite from vandenberg air force base in california 
the launch is scheduled for november 
so far the space agency has seven contracts for private 
launches the first of a scientific satellite is scheduled for 
june from one of four launch pads turned over to companies 
its always sad to see the end of an era said james l 
womack nasa director of expendable launch vehicles 
theres a certain element of sadness but the things we have 
done have been fabulous said joseph mahon the agencys 
assistant administrator for space flight 
mondays unmanned launch was the 448th for nasa dating from a 
thor able that lifted off oct 11 1958 hoisting the pioneer 1 
probe toward a flyby of the moon it failed as did several other 
early launches but the agencys overall success rate is better 
than 90 percent 
we have had a successful mission today the satellite is now 
being tracked by spacecraft controllers after a flawless ride 
aboard its atlascentaur rocket said launch commentator lisa 
malone 
the agency stopped buying atlascentaur delta and other rockets 
early in the 1980s opting to launch payloads from the shuttle once 
it exhausted its backlog of space boosters 
officials admitted after the challenger exploded in 1986 that it 
was a mistake to rely on only one launch vehicle following that 
accident thenpresident reagan directed nasa to get out of the 
business of launching commercial payloads and encouraged government 
support of private companies that wanted to provide launch services 
among nasas unmanned rocket achievements are 
the mariner viking pioneer and voyager missions to the 
planets 42 weather satellites the ranger surveyor and lunar 
orbiter probes that scouted the moon in advance of american 
astronaut landings there 94 communications satellites scores of 
scientific payloads and dozens of unmanned test launches for the 
mercury gemini and apollo maninspace projects 
the atlascentaur which made its 68th appearance monday and 
the delta with 184 liftoffs have been the workhorses of nasas 
fleet both have a success rate of more than 95 percent

a british television inquiry into the pam am 
flight 103 disaster said monday that west germany committed major 
blunders including releasing the probable bombmaker after a raid 
on a palestinian group last year 
however the chief scottish investigator into the bombing of the 
plane over lockerbie scotland last dec 21 said on the program 
we are still on course to being able to put together a case that 
will reveal who was responsible 
the british broadcasting corps current affairs program 
panorama reported that investigators are convinced the 
syrianbacked popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command long the prime suspect masterminded the attack the 
groups leader has denied involvement 
all 259 people aboard flight 103 from frankfurt to new york via 
london were killed along with 11 people on the ground in lockerbie 
scottish investigator lord fraser speaking on the program 
titled lockerbie an avoidable tragedy said a west german 
police raid in october 1988 and the discovery in april of three 
bombs similar to the radio cassette bomb on flight 103 may be 
linked to the lockerbie disaster 
there are clearly points of similarity that have to checked 
out and may indeed point to more than just a loose connection but a 
firm link said fraser 
west german authorities arrested 16 men in the october raid on 
an apartment being used by the popular front but released 14 of 
them despite finding a radio cassette bomb detonators and semtex 
plastic explosives 
those released included a jordanian marwan khreesat 
panorama said khreesat is a known bombmaker and widely 
believed by british and us investigators to have made the 
lockerbie bomb and several others 
there were major blunders by the west germans who let 
the groups bombmaker go in very strange circumstances said 
reporter gavin hewitt 
they took until april to find all the bombs he had made 
including ones that could have been used to blow up commercial 
airliners and they freed key members of the pflpgc who were 
capable of regrouping their network he said 
one of the men still held on bombing charges unconnected with 
flight 103 is hafez kassem dalkamoni the top aide to popular 
front leader ahmed jibril 
jibril has denied his organization had any role in the attack 
but said dalkamoni often built and used the type of bomb that blew 
up flight 103 
the west german federal prosecutors office told the associated 
press monday it has not yet come up with a connection between 
dalkamoni and the lockerbie bombing 
hewitt said without disclosing the source that he had been 
told khreesat now in hiding in jordan was a double agent working 
inside the popular front for jordanian intelligence he said this 
was apparently why the west germans freed him 
asked why khreesat was released hansjuergen foerster 
spokesman for the west german prosecutors office said he was 
released because there was no urgent suspicion of his connection 
with a crime 
previous west german denials that there is evidence linking 
dalkamoni and the october raid to flight 103 have prompted 
speculation bonn is trying to deflect criticism of its security 
operation 
the us federal aviation authority last week fined pan am 
630000 for lapses in security procedures at frankfurt and 
londons heathrow airport but the agency said it was not charging 
that any of the breaches contributed to the lockerbie disaster 
panorama said that in addition to blunders surrounding 
the october raid west german police also released a key popular 
front operative salah fiaz kweiks last october 
it said police failed to discover the true identity of kweiks 
who was carrying a stolen passport in the name of ramzi diab and 
failed to fingerprint him it added that lockerbie investigators 
want to interrogate kweiks but he has now disappeared

president bushs aura of confidence as he 
stood before the united nations monday and proclaimed we are 
witnessing an ideological collapse marked a striking moment in 
the modern era of superpower rivalry following a remarkable series 
of soviet concessions on arms control 
the american president held out to the general assembly 
delegates hope that they were witnessing a new attitude that 
prevails between the us and ussr 
the ideological collapse cited by bush referred to the range 
of serious problems facing soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
from his countrys faltering economy and rising unrest among ethnic 
minorities to the increasingly independent approach of eastern 
european nations 
those problems have pushed soviet leaders toward the concessions 
that allowed bush to speak with a confidence few of his 
predecessors could express in their un appearances 
he offered a sweeping proposal to eliminate us and soviet 
stockpiles of chemical weapons beginning with an 80 percent cut in 
the american arsenal if matched by moscow 
it was a constructive statement in the spirit of the times 
said soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze choosing to 
ignore bushs other words assessing a decline of the soviet sphere 
of influence 
progress made during the past weekend of meetings between us 
and soviet officials created a sense of momentum and lent strength 
to the optimistic tone of bushs words to a world that has lived 
with the threat of nuclear holocaust during 40 years of tension 
but in his united nations speech the president also had to 
concede the fragility of progress in a world where the 
superpowers often are powerless witnesses to terrorism and to 
political and economic upheavals 
we have not entered an era of perpetual peace he cautioned 
referring to regimes that were emerging armed with old and 
unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction 
high on the agenda at most superpower talks are regional 
conflicts the limited warfare that the united states and the 
soviet union once believed each could somehow control years of war 
between iran and iraq and the intractability of the arabisrael 
conflict lessened the belief in what the strongest nations could 
accomplish 
it was in that context that bush talked of a danger that such 
conflicts may well threaten world peace as never before 
one measure of the problem facing the world even if the 
superpowers truly enter an era of coexistence and cooperation is 
the fact that only the united states and soviet union admit to 
having chemical weapons even though as the president stated more 
than 20 other nations possess such weapons or the capability to 
manufacture them 
and these horrible weapons are now finding their way into 
regional conflicts said bush this is unacceptable 
while the dangers throughout the world remain clear so too was 
the progress made over the weekend during the talks between 
shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker iii 
on issue after issue the soviets offered concessions while 
receiving little in return 
shevardnadze abruptly dropped insistence that any progress on 
cutting strategic missile forces be linked to an agreement to limit 
spacebased defense systems such as the us strategic defense 
initiative also withdrawn was the soviet demand that us 
sealaunched cruise missiles be part of any treaty to reduce 
superpower bombers missiles and submarines 
the third big item was the soviet announcement that the 
controversial radar station in krasnoyarsk in siberia would be 
totally dismantled as had been demanded by the reagan 
administration 
while making this remarkable series of concessions soviet 
officials made it clear to their counterparts during their meetings 
in wyoming that gorbachev is seeking a more stable international 
atmosphere while he wrestles with a troubled economy and ethnic 
unrest problems that shevardnadze described as awesome 
for the american president events in poland hungary latin 
america and africa represented the rise of freedom make no 
mistake nothing can stand in the way of freedoms march 
he proclaimed that today we are witnessing an ideological 
collapse the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient 
allpowerful state

the international atomic energy agency 
opened its annual meeting on monday facing political issues third 
world criticism of israel and attempts to expel south africa from 
the 113member organization 
the issues have surfaced repeatedly at the agencys general 
conferences in recent years and figure on the current meetings 
agenda as israeli nuclear capabilities and threat and south 
africa nuclear capabilities 
in his opening address directorgeneral hans blix said 
promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is hampered by 
excessive public concern about radiation from nuclear power 
stations 
the head of the us delegation secretary of energy james d 
watkins warned that regaining public confidence in nuclear power 
could not be achieved solely by promoting new designs and promising 
enhanced safety 
i am absolutely convinced that the key is a positive track 
record of operational safety by the owners and operators of 
nuclear facilities watkins said 
last year the agencys annual conference adopted a resolution 
sponsored by arab states condemning israels nuclear policies 
the resolution denounced israels refusal to renounce the 
possession of nuclear weapons and demanded that it place its 
nuclear facilities under agency control 
the conference also will discuss a resolution supported by 
african nations to suspend south africas membership rights 
pretoria has not sent a delegation to the general conference since 
1979 when its credentials were not accepted for the meeting 
south africas refusal to submit its nuclear facilities to 
international inspection and refusal to sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty has prompted repeated calls from 
developing countries for its ouster 
under the 1969 treaty which has been signed by 140 governments 
countries pledge to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes 
and open their nuclear facilities to inspection by experts of the 
viennabased energy agency 
two known atomic powers france and china have not signed the 
treaty although they submit their peaceful nuclear facilities to 
international inspection 
some countries thought to possess the potential of producing 
nuclear weapons including india pakistan israel libya as well 
as south africa have also not signed the treaty 
blix said the agency recently received a soviet proposal on the 
establishment of a center for international reasearch at chernobyl 
the site of a major nuclear power accident in 1986 
a second soviet proposal calls for an international project in 
waste disposal research at an undisclosed site in the soviet union 
the conference which ends friday is scheduled to approve a 
1628 million budget and also will be asked to approve 455 
million for voluntary contributions toward the agencys 
technological assistance program

a twoweek stream of east germans 
fleeing to west germany via hungary surpassed 20000 on monday and 
an additional 1200 hopeful refugees waited in cramped west german 
embassy compounds in prague and warsaw 
east and west german officials spoke several times by telephone 
monday trying to reach a compromise on the embassy occupations 
said herbert schmuelling a west german government spokesman 
bonn is hoping to find a quick solution and the talks are in a 
highly sensitive phase schmuelling told reporters 
in stuttgart the communist party chief for the east german city 
of dresden said he thinks changes are needed to stop east germans 
from leaving their homeland 
hans modrow said he agreed with a recent remark by retired east 
german intelligence chief markus wolf that the east german 
government must think over the causes of the east german exodus 
on this point i am of the same opinion as my friend mischa 
wolf modrow said on the first day of a fourday visit to west 
germany 
modrow however refused to say what kind of reforms are needed 
in east germany this is something we have to discuss at home 
not here he said 
there have been growing signs of disunity within east germanys 
ruling communist party over the need to adopt democratic reforms 
the aging leadership under party chief erich honecker has resisted 
reforms 
highlevel east german politburo members recently criticized 
modrow for his reformminded views 
in west berlin west germanys minister for innergerman 
relations said it was up to east german leaders to undertake 
reforms that would give east germans a reason to stay in their 
rigidly controlled homeland 
this wave of migration is a clear signal for a change in the 
orthodox policies of the east german leadership dorothee wilms 
told reporters the key for change in the precarious situation in 
east germany lies in east berlin and not in bonn 
east germans fleeing to the west say they left because they saw 
little chance east germanys leaders would soon adopt the kinds of 
reforms under way in the soviet union hungary and poland 
east germans in hungary were allowed to leave their homeland 
when budapest opened its borders on sept 11 
as of early monday 20130 east germans had fled through hungary 
to west germany since the channel to the west was opened west 
german border police said 
the number of east germans occupying west german embassies in 
prague czechoslovakia and warsaw poland has nearly reached its 
saturation point west german government sources said 
about 900 east germans have sought refuge inside the prague 
compound and 300 at the embassy in warsaw the sources said their 
numbers have grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week 
west german news media speculate that a solution may be in the 
works as east germany wants the refugee crisis cleared up by oct 
7 when the communist state will celebrate its 40th anniversary

syrian gunners fired more than 80 shells 
into the christian enclave monday violating a 2dayold ceasefire 
that has drawn 1 million refugees back to beirut an arab league 
mediator urged both sides to honor the truce 
police reported no casualties in the barrage that hit pine woods 
near the mountain towns of beit meri and ein saadeh 10 miles 
northeast of beirut 
christian forces commanded by gen michel aoun did not fire back 
there was no official explanation for the syrian bombardment of 
the thinly populated mountain slopes 
but an informed moslem source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it was designed as a syrian message to aoun that 
the truce could fall apart if the christian media do not stop their 
campaign against the syrians 
the arab league envoy lakhdar alibrahimi announced after a 
onehour meeting with parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite 
moslem that lebanons parliament will meet in saudi arabia on 
saturday to seek political reforms aimed at ending the 14yearold 
civil war 
that marked a major advance in the efforts by the 22member arab 
league to bring lebanons feuding factions together and create a 
formula aimed at reuniting the fragmented country 
but the syrian shelling was a graphic reminder that nothing is 
certain 
iraqi president saddam hussein blamed lebanons plight on syrian 
occupation as he inaugurated an arab cooperation council summit 
monday in north yemen 
praising the peacemaking efforts of the threeman arab league 
committee the iraqi leader said 
we support the efforts of our brethren in the tripartite 
committee despite our conviction that the root of calamity and the 
gateway of evil in lebanon is the syrian occupation of the 
country 
the council groups iraq egypt jordan and north yemen 
a lebanese police spokesman said syrian howitzer batteries hit 
the christian area in a 45minute barrage that ended at 745 am 
an additional four shells hit the woods at 3 pm 
some shells exploded within a mile of the hilltop bustan hotel 
where ibrahimi is staying a police spokesman said 
the shelling was the first serious violation of the ceasefire 
since it took hold saturday it prompted ibrahimi to urge all 
sides to abide by the ceasefire and to believe that there is a 
new chance for peace 
the truce was called last week by a threemember arab league 
committee assigned to find a settlement to the civil war in which 
more than 150000 people have been killed 
many lebanese who have seen hundreds of truces collapse remain 
skeptical of an overall settlement but welcome the current respite 
police said at least 1 million refugees who fled the ferocious 
artillery battles that began march 8 have returned to beirut the 
city has taken the brunt of the devastating shelling forcing all 
but 150000 of its 15 million people to flee 
a moslem woman hoda makkouk returned home to her thirdfloor 
apartment in west beirut on sunday with her husband rashid and 
their two children after four months living with relatives and 
friends in the chouf mountains southeast of the capital 
i was so happy to be back home she said even though all 
the apartments windows had been blown out i spent the whole 
night cleaning up

a top adviser to president mikhail s gorbachev 
said monday that the superpowers have made good progess on a 
strategic arms control treaty but that much work remains 
both sides have the will but it is another question how much 
time it will take marshal sergei f akhromeyev said in an 
interview at the opening of the supreme soviet legislatures fall 
session 
there still is a lot of work ahead he added 
akhromeyev former soviet military chief of staff and now an 
adviser to gorbachev praised a protocol to determine the size of 
chemical weapons stockpiles that was reached in two days of talks 
between secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
he also praised the decision to hold a summit between president 
bush and gorbachev next year 
but he said key questions remain before the two sides can reach 
a final agreement on a treaty to slash their store of longrange 
nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent 
senior us officials say the soviets have dropped their 
insistence that the united states agree to limits on spacebased 
missile defense systems before a nuclear arms reduction treaty is 
signed 
that has been a major roadblock in arms negotiations for several 
years among the unresolved questions are procedures for verifying 
compliance with cuts in bombers missiles and submarines 
us officials say bush wants the treaty completed by the summit 
meeting

the house appropriations committee facing 
spending bill gridlock in the senate approved a measure monday 
designed to keep government agencies in business when the new 
fiscal year begins in six days 
the bill backed by the leadership of both parties and the bush 
administration would keep the government functioning through oct 
25 the house was expected to approve it tuesday and send it to the 
senate 
the legislation is needed because an assortment of disputes has 
kept congress from completing work on all but one of the 13 annual 
spending bills for fiscal 1990 which begins sunday chief among 
the standoffs is a partisan spat over how much money should be 
spent on antidrug programs and how to pay for them 
the house finished work on the last of its money bills aug 4 
but the senate has approved just seven of its own the two chambers 
need to agree on compromise versions of each measure before they 
can be offered to president bush for his signature 
asked how many spending bills he thought would be completed by 
sunday house appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten 
dmiss said talk to the senate i cant tell you who a womans 
going to marry or what the senates going to do 
the emergency measure contains none of the controversial 
provisions many of the individual spending bills are laden with 
for example it does not include language barring cigarette smoking 
on airline flights halting federal aid for obscene art or 
liberalizing abortion restrictions

rest easy america abe weatherwise 
prognosticator of the old farmers almanac says itll be a mild 
winter across most of the country and new englanders can expect a 
white christmas 
abe who claims 80 percent accuracy in americas oldest 
continuously published periodical says only the northern third 
of the country will have more snow than usual 
the 198th edition of the 224page almanac hits the newsstands 
and supermarkets this week with its familiar planting and tide 
tables anecdotes and other tidbits such as 100 ways how to avoid 
untimely death no 49 avoid combing hair in the dark no 77 
never whistle in a coal mine 
abe a collective pseudonym says the almanacs predictions are 
based on stateofthe art analysis of recurring solar cycles 
he predicts that a cold wet and snowy spring in the north will be 
balanced by warm dry spring weather west of the mississippi 
the summer of 1990 says abe will be hot and dry in many areas 
east of the rockies 
in canada where 300000 of the 4 million copies of the 
customary yellowcovered almanac will be sold heavier than average 
snow is forecast from quebec through the prairie provinces 
the more serious the weather the larger percentage we sell 
says executive editor tim clark they count on us more in alberta 
than in alabama 
the old farmers almanac is the legal document for tides and 
sunrises and sunsets in most states in addition to giving readers 
weather predictions advertisements for hernia appliances secrets 
of winning lotteries and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie the 
almanac advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost the 
popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent 
the almanac also predicts the return of 4inchwide neckties for 
men short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette 
recorders 
the old farmers almanac is not to be confused with its upstart 
rival the farmers almanac which is about a third as thick 23 
years younger and is given away to businesses for advertising 
purposes 
the distinguishing trademark of the old farmers almanac is a 
hole in the corner put there at great expense and inconvenience 
its publishers say to preserve the tradition of hanging the book 
on a nail in the pantry or outhouse

women broke into massachusetts 
judicial ranks decades ago but now theyre finally getting into 
the picture with the commissioning of portraits of female judges 
for courthouse walls 
the recently unveiled oil painting of retired superior court 
judge eileen p griffin marks a new trend among the traditional 
oils of blackgarbed men that are a staple of courthouses across 
the state women judges said 
its a symbol said superior court judge suzanne del 
vecchio sitting in dedham its so that other women can come in 
and see there are not only women on the bench there are women on 
the wall 
change is slow but its there said supreme court judge 
ruth i abrams who recalls the lonely days when she and griffin 
were the only women on the superior court bench 
the first woman appointed to superior court jenny barron 
appears in a portrait in suffolk superior court dedicated in 1971 
three years after her death said francis x orfanello an 
administrative assistant to the chief justice 
a check with various judicial offices monday did not produce any 
sightings of other female portraits said joan kenney spokeswoman 
for the supreme court 
portraits are not paid for by the state but are generally 
commissioned by family friends or the local bar associations 
kenney said 
more than half of the women judges now on the bench in 
massachusetts were appointed in the last five years bringing their 
total up to 12 percent of the judiciary 
i think as we have more women judges therell be more womens 
pictures and as we have more women lawyers the profession becomes 
kinder to women abrams said 
griffin who is still active in hampden county as a master in 
mediation sessions involving civil cases said she was surprised to 
find that friends had banded together to commission the portrait 
unveiled last week 
im pleased of course she said 
griffin was appointed to superior court in 1973 by thengov 
francis w sargent 
a recent study commissioned by the supreme court examined how 
women are treated in massachusetts courtrooms as judges 
attorneys and defendants and found bias does exist said gladys 
maged executive director of the study panel 
courtroom comments reported by both male and female attorneys 
included the phrase counsel may be beautiful but she is entirely 
wrong and female judges being addressed as dearie maged 
said 
meanwhile women judges said they look forward to commemoration 
in oil 
the fact that you looked around and you saw no portraits of 
female judges thats a symptom of whats been going on in the 
courts but things are beginning to change del vecchio said

the federal aviation administration said 
monday it has tightened security standards since the december 
bombing of pan am flight 103 but a general accounting office 
investigation said the faa doesnt know if airlines are meeting the 
standards 
in addition an israeli airline security expert who studied us 
systems said american airline companies do very little well 
when it comes to protecting passengers from an attack such as the 
one that killed 270 people in the pan am explosion over lockerbie 
scotland dec 21 
the gao report the details of which are being kept secret by 
congress was summarized by rep cardiss collins dill at a 
hearing of her house government operations subcommittee on 
government activities and transportation 
overall gao found that despite additional security measures 
imposed following pan am 103 faa cannot assure itself that 
required security procedures are being properly carried out by the 
airlines at designated highrisk airports said collins 
she said security deficiencies found in recent faa airline 
inspections showed breakdowns in the training of airline security 
personnel 
gao believes these deficiencies occur largely because faa has 
not established minimum training standards needed to ensure that 
airline security personnel working at highrisk airports overseas 
are sufficiently trained said the congresswoman 
the gao is an investigative agency of congress 
isaac yeffet former director general of security for el al 
israel airlines told the subcommittee that training given security 
agents for us air carriers is extremely low insufficient and 
not effective 
he said that because the faa leaves airlines responsible for 
their own security the agency can avoid responsibility for 
failures 
virtually all american airlines hire security firms based 
solely on the lowest price said yeffet 
monte belger associate administrator for aviation standards at 
the faa said the agency needs to be more active in seeing that 
us standards are being met by us carriers in foreign airports 
we have put us carriers in the posture of having to deal as 
a private organization with a foreign government to implement our 
government regulations said belger who said the bush 
administration was in favor of increasing faa activity abroad 
ray salazar director of civil aviation security at the faa 
said the agency has increased its workforce and expanded its 
intelligence organization since the pan am explosion 
unfortunately we build a 12foot wall and the criminal finds 
a 13foot ladder salazar said 
investigators found that the explosion was caused by plastic 
explosives planted in a cassette player 
american security measures were compared repeatedly during the 
hearing to those used by el al but salazar said the level of 
israeli government support for that airline is such that many 
would argue it is not a commercial airline 
salazar said that el als security procedures are labor 
intensive using proportionately many more workers than any us 
carriers 
he said the airline is small compared to american carriers 
which altogether transport 12 million people a day many on about 
1800 international flights daily 
it isnt practical to put that kind of manpower into the 
system and have the transportation system we have today said 
salazar he said the united states relies more on mechanical 
devices to detect security problems

from a list of the nations 48 supreme court judges and 43 appeals 
court presidents tsaldaris then sent the case file to supreme 
court president yannis grivas who will preside over the tribunal 
it is expected to convene in november 
parliament voted last wednesday to try the 70yearold 
papandreou on allegations he was behind the tapping of telephones 
of his political friends and foes from may 1987 to april 1989 
papandreou boycotted the debate sending instead a note saying 
he was being persecuted unjustly by his political rivals 
theofanis tombras former managing director of the hellenic 
telecommunications organization and costas tsimas former director 
of the national intelligence service will appear in court with 
papandreou on charges of having been accomplices 
the debate followed a report by a parliamentary commission of

one court member as a special investigator to look further into the 
charges 
the investigator then will have 30 days to present his findings

party into the next elections while under indictment

democrats and republicans intensified their 
battle over a capital gains tax cut monday with sharper rhetoric 
and new radio and television ads as they headed toward a showdown 
on the house floor this week 
president bushs budget director richard darman said democrats 
opposing the capital gains tax cut were showing their true colors 
with their alternative plan which would raise tax rates on the 
rich to restore deductions for individual retirement accounts 
its clearly a reconfirmation that they want to raise taxes 
darman said one has to wonder when they say its limited to 
only 600000 taxpayers who will have their taxes raised whos 
going to believe they want to stop there 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash countered angrily that 
darmans comments were stuff and nonsense 
the bushbacked plan to drop the maximum tax rate on capital 
gains from 33 percent to 196 percent was illtimed 
illconsidered and damaging helping only the richest of our 
citizens and unfair to the middle class he said 
if the president thinks a veto threat will provide that 
kind of a bill being sent to him he is very wrong indeed foley 
said 
the house might vote on the issue as early as wednesday the 
exact timing was in doubt monday as the democratic leadership 
wrestled with when to debate it and other controversial items 
attached to a giant budget bill such as child care and medicare 
catastrophic illness insurance 
both sides said they expected a close vote and to tip the 
balance they both launched advertising campaigns 
george bush wants to raid the treasury by reducing capital 
gains taxes for the superrich and he wants working americans to pay 
for it house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said in a 
democratic party television ad taped monday 
a house gopsponsored commercial features an american flag 
flying against those of other industrial nations the comparatively 
high us capital gains tax hurts small businesses trying to 
expand families investing to send kids to college senior citizens 
preparing for retirement it contends 
a radio spot sponsored by organized labor emphasizes that the 
nations wealthiest people get the lions share of the benefits 
from cutting capital gains taxes which are levied on profits from 
stocks and bonds real estate and sales of other assets 
oh theyll trot out the old malarkey about how cutting taxes 
for rich people spurs economic growth but theres not a bit of 
evidence to back it up the ad says 
asked by reporters about statistics that show upperincome 
people benefit disproportionately from capital gains tax cuts 
darman said its off the point the issue is whats the effect 
on longterm growth and productivity 
darman also repeated the republican contention that democrats 
by opposing bushs will would be to blame if congress and the 
president cant agree on a deficitreduction package this fall he 
said it was a kamikaze approach to national politics aimed at 
forcing a tax increase 
the grammrudman law requires acrosstheboard spending cuts on 
oct 15 unless the projected fiscal 1990 deficit is brought to 
below 110 billion by then 
foley said darmans suggestion was unworthy of him 
we are not trying to create some kind of a political combat 
we are trying to offer a proposal we think is good for the 
countrys economic future he said 
both foley and darman tried to play down the longterm political 
consequences of the battle 
the partisanship should be confined to this one issue so we 
dont have adverse spillover effects elsewhere said darman he 
said he still hopes to strike a longterm deficit reduction pact 
with congress 
foley tried to brush aside suggestions that the capital gains 
fight was the first big test of his leadership 
we intend to be in responsibility for a long time to come 
he said

hairtrigger tempers are among the 
aftereffects of hurricane hugo around here lines are long and 
there is no electricity to cook hot meals run water heaters for 
hot showers or power televisions and lights 
i think that you can look at the people and realize that all 
we need is a little spark patrolman angel ortiz said the 
people are shorttempered right now 
a 7 pm curfew in charleston forces residents to return to 
homes lit only with candles flashlights and kerosene lamps on 
monday a steady downpour and temperatures in the 60s added to the 
misery 
at one point people lined up for four hours to buy food 
outside a grocery store near one of charlestons poorer 
neighborhoods frustrations were as plain as damage from the storm 
theres no bread theres no meat harold washington 21 
said we cant survive like that 
gerald dean has been unable to get his paycheck from the 
restaurant where he works even if he could all but a few banks 
remained closed monday because of the lack of electricity 
im frustrated man said dean whose 2yearold child was 
diagnosed with meningitis and hospitalized the day of the hurricane 
on saturday a crowd of about 200 pushed shoved and cursed as 
they waited for free ice which was never distributed police 
called the incident a near riot yet were not surprised it took 
place 
people are getting a little testy after a few days and its 
understandable said maj charles wiley of the charleston police 
department 
on the isle of palms across charleston harbor police on sunday 
punched and arrested a man who refused to heed orders to stay off 
the island the island was offlimits until monday under martial 
law while officials surveyed damage 
wiley said calm will return once more utility services are 
restored relief centers are opened and lines get shorter an 
angry person is not necessarily a riotous person he said 
charleston mayor joseph p riley jr said he does not believe a 
riot will break out 
its not a concern in terms of something that i think is going 
to happen he said we have worked hard our people know were 
working with them so i dont think its going to create any 
problems 
but dean said unless more relief comes soon a lot of peoples 
belongings are going to get took by looters 
the whole towns going to be called hell hole soon thats 
what its going to be one big hell hole only the survivors like 
myself are going to dig ourselves out of it dean said 
others see no reason to get upset with inconveniences over which 
there is little control i dont think people need to get 
angry said leverne brown a hotel employee 
even so ortiz believes hugos full impact is only now beginning 
to be felt 
the first day after people were kind of walking around in 
shock he said then they were elated that they didnt suffer 
any more than they did but now maybe the shock of the whole 
thing is just beginning to hit them that maybe they werent that 
lucky

protesters blocked traffic in downtown leipzig 
the demonstration came hours after communist authorities refused 
to register a prodemocracy opposition group called new forum and 
told its members to cease all activities immediately 
the leipzig demonstration began after a religious service in the 
st nicholas church the monday evening services known as peace 
prayers have become a rallying point for dissidents and rights 
activists in recent months and frequently have been followed by 
demonstrations 
witnesses and rights activists said about 2000 people attended 
the service while another 2000 gathered outside the church 
the crowd then started marching toward downtown and leipzigs 
main train station about 4000 people joined the march along the 
way and the crowd sang we shall overcome and shouted slogans 
such as liberty equality fraternity witnesses said 
security forces cordoned off downtown and intervened to disperse 
the crowd when the protesters reached the main train station 
it was not known if there were any injuries in the police action 
the west german zdf television network said one of its camera 
crews was prevented by police from filming the demonstration

communist country the group has held meetings with other informal 
opposition groups to coordinate their activities

the united states has invited zaires 
president mobutu sese seko for talks on faltering negotiations 
between the sovietbacked angolan government and the usbacked 
rebels officials said monday 
mobutu who will attend the united nations general assembly has 
been asked to come to washington at the same time as jonas savimbi 
leader of unita the union for the total independence of angola 
the officials said 
if mobutu does not come to washington an official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said talks with him would be held in new 
york 
mobutu who has considerable prestige riding on the angolaunita 
pact he sponsored was in washington three months ago 
the state department is eager to have savimbi and mobutu meet to 
prevent the peace talks from derailing completely mobutu served as 
the mediator for a june ceasefire but the truce has shattered and 
subsequent talks failed 
savimbi refused to attend the last negotiating session in 
kinshasa on sept 18 despite urgings from assistant secretary of 
state herman cohen who made a special trip to the region 
mobutu has considerable leverage with unita because most of the 
us arms and other aid for the organization estimated at between 
40 million and 80 million is funneled through zaire 
he appeared in recent weeks to be siding with angolan president 
jose eduardo dos santos 
dos santos contends savimbi agreed to go into exile and 
integrate his troops with the angolan army savimbi denies he 
agreed to exile and says he will only surrender arms in return for 
a promise of free elections 
the united states is concerned that if the unitaangola talks 
dont resume soon cuba may disrupt the pullout of its troops from 
angola 
the pullout of 50000 cuban troops by 1991 was part of a 
ussponsored agreement signed in december which also granted 
namibia independence from south african rule

the leader of the miskito indian 
resistance to the sandinista government said monday he will return 
to nicaragua to discuss turning in his weapons and forming a 
political party to take part in februarys elections 
the war against the sandinista government is paralyzed because 
of the peace accords wycliff diego leader of about 3500 
guerrillas said at a news conference 
diego was referring to accords signed aug 7 by five central 
american presidents that call for disbanding ussupported rebels 
that have been trying to topple nicaraguas leftist sandinistas in 
return for a sandinista guarantee of fair elections 
diego heads a directorate that controls the miskito 
antisandinista movement which has operated independently from the 
main contra resistance 
the miskitos other indians and blacks of west indian descent 
make up the majority of the population in the sparsely populated 
eastern twothirds of nicaragua in some areas along its caribbean 
coast english is spoken 
the miskitos have spearheaded the resistance in eastern 
nicaragua operating from bases in remote northeastern honduras 
with us support 
we indians have always been discriminated against in 
nicaragua thats why weve had to fight all our lives including 
in the war to make ourselves part of that society diego said 
even so diego said his group called yatama after the miskito 
words for sons of mother earth decided to explore repatriation 
because of the stalled war 
diego said resistance leaders brooklyn rivera steadman fagoth 
muller and julian holmes will join him on a trip to nicaragua 
beginning later this week 
diego said his group will meet with nicaraguan president daniel 
ortega discuss the repatriation of 9000 refugees living in 
honduras and visit indians living in eastern nicaragua 
the sandinistas have recently made conciliatory moves toward the 
indians making sure that a miskito was given a chance to speak at 
their convention sunday that nominated ortega as the sandinista 
presidential candidate in the feb 25 elections 
diego said yatama has 3500 guerrillas 1000 inside nicaragua 
and 2500 on the honduran frontier the northeastern frontier 
between the two countries has always been more porous than other 
parts of the border because of heavy jungle and thin population 
fighting in nicaragua has decreased sharply since february 1988 
when the us cut off military aid to the mainline contra 
resistance and the indian fighters both groups continue to receive 
nonlethal aid 
diego said yatama fighters including members of the miskito 
sumo and rama tribes as well as nicaraguan blacks are prepared to 
turn in their arms by dec 8 when the peace accord calls for 
demobilization of armed rebels 
we intend to create a political party in nicaragua that will 
be called yatama to participate in next years vote even so the 
situation is difficult because the sandinistas have said all 
parties must be organized by the end of this month diego said 
holmes said the directors trip back to nicaragua was authorized 
by ortega at the request of former president carter who visited 
managua last week and who serve as an election observer 
our commission will hold talks with the sandinistas study the 
nicaraguan political situation and see if it is possible for our 
refugees and exiles to return to the country holmes said

nearly 20000 utah teachers boycotted 
classrooms monday in a oneday strike to protest what they claim is 
chronic underfunding of one of the nations most crowded public 
school systems 
the strike called after the legislature last week approved a 
384 million tax cut but no new money for education canceled 
classes for about 450000 students 
the walkout began with a wildcat strike friday in the salt lake 
ogden and provo areas 
because the teachers union did not announce the statewide 
walkout until saturday districts could not get enough substitutes 
said james r moss superintendent of public instruction 
were saying there are real critical needs in reducing class 
size more textbooks teacher salaries and in the area of personnel 
like counselors librarians those kinds of special people said 
jim campbell president of the teachers union which represents up 
to 90 percent of utahs teachers 
with a population of 17 million utah has the largest average 
household size at 317 compared to the national average of 262 
nearly 70 percent of its residents are members of the mormon 
church which encourages big families and the state has the 
nations highest percentage of schoolage children or 37 percent 
under 18 
with a studentteacher ratio of 254 to 1 utah also has the 
most crowded classrooms and at 22621 a year its teacher salaries 
are smaller than in 43 other states the state ranks 50th in 
average annual expenditure per student of 2326 
teachers long have complained they have 40 or more students in 
some classrooms and dont have enought textbooks and other supplies 
gov norm bangerter acknowledged serious problems but said 
the teachers should have waited for the regular january legislative 
session to press their demands 
the governor said the state may have a surplus of 185 million 
by the end of the fiscal year in june 
more than 100 students crowded into a conference room monday at 
the capitol for a discussion with bangerter who was asked why he 
wouldnt veto the tax cut 
i wanted the tax cut the governor said you have to 
remember i was the one who raised taxes two years ago

with the education summit at hand eight 
business groups called on president bush and the nations governors 
monday to dedicate as much energy and resources to schools as has 
been committed to the war on drugs 
the strength of the american economy rests on the strength of 
americas public schools said william kolberg president of the 
national alliance of business 
kolberg referring to statistics showing dismal academic 
achievement by us students said all sectors share a 
responsibility for the current crisis and stressed that bush 
must show leadership by making the improvement of public 
education a national priority on a level similar to his war on 
drugs 
kolberg and robert holland president of the committee for 
economic development announced the formation of a special 
coalition and outlined an agenda for action that coalition members 
said is necessary if education reform is to become a reality 
the business coalition for education reform cochaired by 
holland and kolberg also will include the business roundtable the 
us chamber of commerce the national association of 
manufacturers the conference board the american business 
conference and the us hispanic chamber of commerce 
under the proposed sixpoint agenda the coalition said we 
must define the goals of education set the standards for 
attainment and develop better ways of measuring achievement and 
assigning accountability for students teachers and 
administrators 
bush and members of the national governors association already 
have agreed to focus the twoday summit at charlottesville va on 
creating a process for developing national performance goals 
the coalition agenda also called for creating a new 
professionalism for teachers and administrators investing in early 
prevention and intervention strategies to help disadvantaged 
children become ready for school supporting more equitable 
financing of education within states linking the resources of 
higher education into the reform effort and restructuring the 
school systems 
the group called on the president to select as soon as possible 
members for a presidential education policy advisory committee 
kolberg said the coalition will work with the governors on a 
national and statebystate basis and with the white house and 
appropriate agencies to begin to initiate new policies practices 
and strategies that enable systemic change 
we will encourage business leaders to becoming more involved 
at state and local levels not in feelgood endeavors but those 
directed at systemic change said kolberg we will increase 
business understanding about education restructuring issues and 
serve as a resource for others who want to be involved

among the us proposals that soviet foreign 
secretary eduard a shevardnadze will carry back to moscow is one 
to open large areas of both countries that have been closed to 
citizens of the other an administration official said monday 
secretary of state james a baker iii advanced the open 
lands proposal in talks with shevardnadze last weekend in 
wyoming but the positive soviet response was lost amid several 
surprise developments to speed conclusion of major arms control 
treaties 
we believe that we should move toward a situation of open seas 
and oceans open lands and open space shevardnadze told a news 
conference saturday 
transparency here glasnost here should not be selective or 
limited it should apply everywhere the soviet foreign minister 
said 
the soviets did not respond immediately to bakers proposal 
because frankly there were bigger fish to fry said a state 
department official speaking on condition he not be further 
identified but the soviets told the americans they were going to 
take a look at it 
the two sides have already made steps toward lifting travel 
restrictions that were first imposed by the soviet union in 1941 
while that country was fighting invading germans 
in 1955 during the cold war the united states introduced 
reciprocal restrictions of its own closing about half of the 
country to soviet diplomats journalists and academics 
those restrictions were eased slightly with the helsinki accord 
in 1976 but soviets and americans living in each others countries 
must still follow elaborate notification procedures if they wish to 
travel many areas remain closed 
the state department official said that recently there have 
been some problems but otherwise it is easier there has been an 
opening up 
a written department statement said it has always been united 
states policy that both the united states and the ussr should 
reciprocally abolish closed areas 
as a result of glasnost openness and perestroika 
restructuring academic scientific and commerical interchange 
and peopletopeople contact between the united states and the 
soviet union have witnessed unparalled growth it said 
yet outmoded internal travel restrictions continue to make it 
difficult for diplomats and journalists to do their jobs academics 
to do research and families to visit relatives the statement 
said 
the us proposal calls for abolition of areas that have been 
closed for security reasons but would leave some sensitive bases 
offlimits it calls for simplifying the system of notification 
but would ensure that officials continue to book travel and 
accomodations through the existing agencies the soviet directorate 
of the diplomatic corps and the us office of foreign missions

a propane truck became wedged under a 
bridge and sprang a leak monday cutting off residents at one end 
of aquidneck island from the mainland for more than seven hours 
no one was injured and no fire or explosion occurred in the 
accident which took place about 9 am 
houses within a quartermile were evacuated to community centers 
at the north end of the island and police stood ready to lead 
residents of the areas 600 homes on foot across a golf course 
the only escape route if necessary 
electricity in the area was shut off to prevent an explosion 
the federal aviation administration closed airspace above the 
accident to a height of 3000 feet and the coast guard blocked 
boat traffic nearby 
access and electricity were restored to the northern tip of 
aquidneck island shortly after 4 pm after the truck had leaked 
the last of its volatile cargo and was removed 
the accident cut off the only two roads in and out of the north 
end of the narragansett bay island which is about 15 miles long a 
bridge links portsmouth a town of 15000 to the mainland 
a woman who identified herself only as maureen pushed her 
yearold daughter in a stroller from their home across the golf 
course a 1mile trek i dont want to be stuck there and i felt 
threatened she said 
police chief madison bailey said three safety valves protruding 
from the truck tore off when the vehicle failed to clear a 9foot5 
railroad underpass by about 6 inches 
bailey said authorities had to let the 1900 gallons of propane 
in the truck vaporize and dissipate because there was no way to 
stop the leak and attempts to pump the cargo into another truck 
were were unsuccessful 
youve got a lot of gas you cant move the truck its a very 
dangerous situation bailey said early in the day he said 
authorities tried letting the air out of the trucks tires to 
remove the vehicle but the springs kept it wedged up against the 
bridge 
william chase northeast general manager for star gas co owner 
of the truck said the truck was not likely to explode because the 
gas was venting through a roof valve and not concentrating near the 
ground 
if it were to ignite it probably would be just like a large 
torch a flare he said

trustees of the embattled corcoran gallery of 
art reaffirmed support monday for director christina orrcahall and 
ordered a study of ways to resolve a controversy over her 
cancellation of an exhibit that included sexually explicit 
photographs 
the 120yearold gallery the oldest art museum in washington 
has been the target of severe criticism since midjune when ms 
orrcahall canceled an exhibition of robert mapplethorpe 
photographs the cancellation was made with the consent of the 
corcorans board of trustees 
the traveling exhibit organized by the institute of 
contemporary arts in philadelphia contained sexually explicit and 
homoerotic photographs and pictures of nude children which drew 
protests from sen jesse helms rnc and other conservative 
members of congress 
at a regularly scheduled meeting monday the corcoran board 
agreed to appoint a special panel of trustees to examine the 
threemonth controversy and recommend steps to defuse it 
spokeswoman debra shriver said the panel would study concerns 
of the museum such as the status of the director staff morale 
and future curatorial decisions 
there have been persistent rumors that ms orrcahall might be 
fired but board president freeborn g jewett jr who is general 
counsel of the interamerican development bank said after mondays 
meeting there was substantial and widespread support for the 
director among the trustees 
a representative of the corcoran staff asked ms orrcahall on 
friday to resign but she refused 
ms orrcahall has said consistently that the mapplethorpe show 
was canceled in the hope of preventing the corcoran from becoming 
involved in a congressional dispute over the grantmaking policies 
of the national endowment for the arts which had partially 
financed the mapplethorpe shows national tour 
but as the corcoran noted last week in a statement issued by 
ms orrcahall and the boards executive committee the corcoran 
gallery of art in attempting to defuse the nea funding controversy 
by removing itself from the political spotlight has instead found 
itself in the center of controversy 
the board and the director said the mapplethorpe cancellation 
had inadvertently offended many members of the arts cmmunity 
which we deeply regret 
the statement added that the corcorans course in the future 
will be to support art artists and artistic freedom of 
expression 
the cancellation resulted in a firestorm of criticism against 
the corcoran and ms orrcahall who joined the gallery 18 months 
ago from the oakland museum in california where she was chief 
curator and director of the art division 
artists protesting the cancellation as a violation of freedom of 
artistic expression withdrew plans for two exhibitions of 
contemporary art at the corcoran and a third exhibition is in 
doubt artist lowell nesbitt announced he is withdrawing a 15 
million bequest to the corcoran from his will and instead will give 
the money to the phillips collection another private washington 
art gallery 
low morale among corcoran staff members worsened recently when 
jane livingston the museums chief curator announced her 
resignation effective in january she had arranged for the 
mapplethorpe exhibit to be shown at the corcoran after it appeared 
in philadelphia and chicago without incident

the bush administration is not prepared to 
move toward normal relations with vietnam despite the apparent 
completion of that countrys troop withdrawal from cambodia state 
department officials said monday 
the officials said the administration would have been prepared 
to move toward that goal if there had been an agreement on a 
comprehensive settlement in cambodia 
they blamed vietnams intransigence for the failure of the 
cambodia peace conference this past july in paris to reach a 
settlement on new political arrangements for that country once 
hanois withdrawal was complete 
vietnam has said the last of its remaining 26000 troops were to 
have been out of cambodia by tuesday 
we believe normalization with hanoi would be premature said 
one official asking not to be identified 
we hope that if we and other countries continue to minimize 
diplomatic and economic ties with vietnam hanoi will take a more 
cooperative approach toward a comprehensive cambodian settlement 
the official said 
the vietnamese withdrawal leaves in place the hanoibacked 
government in phnom penh which failed in an effort to reach a 
power sharing arrangement with three other cambodian factions 
the bush administration has come under strong criticism from 
members of congress and elsewhere over its cambodia policy on 
grounds that the existing government phnom penh alone has the 
strength to prevent the khmer rouge from retaking power 
the khmer rouge the most powerful of the factions contending 
for power are widely blamed for the murders of at least 1 million 
cambodians during their 3 year rule between 197578 
asked about the prospect of a return to power by the khmer 
rouge state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
monday this issue can best be dealt with through a process of 
negotiation and a comprehensive political solution 
only such a solution can have the guarantees and the 
interational peacekeeping force under the united nations which will 
minimize the danger of the khmer rouge he said 
successive us presidents dating back to jimmy carter have 
linked the normalization of relations with hanoi to its withdrawal 
from cambodia us policy also has taken into account vietnams 
attitude on providing information on american servicemen still 
missing from the indochina war 
vietnam is one of a handful of countries with which the united 
states has no diplomatic or trade relations 
the united states has never recognized the hanoi government 
since what was then north vietnam became independent in 1954 the 
us diplomatic presence in south vietnam ended with the north 
vietnamese conquest of that country in 1975

house members expressed willingness monday to 
give up free newsletter mailings to constituents and use the 45 
million savings to treat pregnant women addicted to drugs 
we really created a frankenstein said rep silvio conte 
rmass the only way were going to free ourselves from this 
monster is to cut its head off and use it for something 
worthwhile 
but rep vic fazio dcalif who argued against the ban during 
floor debate was critical of the action 
its pure demagogy but its great politics he said 
the 245137 nonbinding vote didnt ban the mailings but 
instructed house conferees to support the prohibition as part of a 
195 billion money bill to run congress in the next fiscal year 
which begins oct 1 
this was not a vote to instruct the conferees so much as it 
was a vote to pose for holy pictures said fazio chairman of 
the house appropriations committee on legislative appropriations 
fazio predicted a compromise would be reached because members 
want to save their newsletter programs 
the senate voted 838 on sept 7 for the same ban approving an 
amendment by sen pete wilson rcalif 
anyone who has read a congressional newsletter will understand 
immediately we are not asking for the sacrifice of great 
intellectual or informational exchange said rep lynn martin 
rill arguing for the ban 
newsletters she said often are a taxpayerfunded political 
advertisement for sitting members 
are you willing to give up a congressional perk to combat drug 
addiction in newborn babies conte asked in his motion to 
instruct conferees the frank has been abused 
conte said that in fiscal 1988 which ended about a month before 
congressional elections the cost of newsletters rose steadily as 
the election approached from 59 million the first quarter to 
16 million the last quarter senate mass mailings started at 38 
million the first quarter and rose to 10 million in the fourth 
quarter 
supporters of the ban said more than 1000 babies are born in 
the united states each day with substance abuse symptons they said 
the savings from the newsletter ban would permit a 10fold increase 
in the pregnant addict programs

an accused drug trafficker arrested in 
colombia is wanted on federal charges of running an operation that 
shipped tons of the illegal drug methaqualone to this country 
officials said monday 
carlos humberto gomezzapata was arrested over the weekend by 
the colombian army according to justice department officials 
justice department spokesman david runkel said that if the 
department confirms his identity it would likely seek the 
extradition of gomezzapata who was indicted by a federal grand 
jury in florida in 1984 
drug enforcement adminstration spokesman frank shults said 
colombian authorities had indeed confirmed through fingerprints 
that the suspect in custody is gomezzapata 
the indictment charges that gomezzapata masterminded a drug 
ring that shipped tons of methaqualone from west germany and 
austria through panama to colombia where it was then transported 
illegally into the united states 
the drug is also known as quaaludes a hypnotic depressant that 
was believed by users to enhance sexual pleasure 
the indictment was one of four returned by a federal grand jury 
as a result of deas operation hammerhead which the justice 
department said identified 24 shipments of methaqualone pills and 
powder totalling 54 tons of illegal drugs bound for this country 
dea agents seized 6 tons of methaqualone powder in canada six 
tons in panama and nine tons of methaqualone tablets in the 
bahamas according to a 1984 justice department news release on the 
case 
at the time the department said the investigation had focused 
on the gomezzapata family of barranquilla colombia the 
indictment charged that some of the defendants conspired to obtain 
us equipment and chemicals to set up a methaqualone laboratory to 
make tablets for distribution in this country 
gomezzapatas two brothers john jairo gomezzapata and luis 
guillermo gomezzapata were also charged and are fugitives 
so far 23 defendants have been convicted and are serving 
sentences said diane cossin a spokeswoman for the us attorneys 
office in miami which prosecuted the cases seven defendants are 
fugitives 
one of the charges against carlos humberto gomezzapata 
continuing criminal enterprise carries a sentence of 10 years up 
to life 
the indictment also alleges that other shipments of the drug 
disguised as harmless chemicals were sent through the netherlands 
to canada

king fahd pledged an unwavering war 
on terrorists monday stressing his governments resolve to behead 
whoever tries to undermine security in the holy places of islam 
his warning came at a cabinet meeting according to a statement 
by information minister ali alshaer that was distributed by the 
official saudi press agency 
mahdi karrubi the radical speaker of irans parliament on 
monday reiterated his call for retribution against saudi arabia for 
last weeks beheading of 16 kuwati shiite moslems convicted of 
planting bombs in the holy city of mecca 
the july 10 bombings came at the height of the moslem pilgrimage 
season in mecca killing one pilgrim and wounding 16 
the doomed kuwaitis said in a recorded confession broadcast last 
week on saudi television that they received sabotage training from 
iranians in a remote area of kuwait they said two iranians at the 
iranian embassy in kuwait provided them with explosives and timing 
devices 
iran denied it 
on monday fahd said the kingdom will not retreat as much as 
a hairs breadth from exacting hodood gods punishment on 
whoever tries to tamper with the sanctity of the islams holiest 
shrines or tries to undermine security in the country 
we will accept no blame in our quest to uphold justice we 
will not heed the false propaganda campaigns he said referring 
to antisaudi pronouncements from iran 
saudi arabia is governed by sharia koranic law that prescribes 
beheading for convicted murderers saboteurs and whoever desecrates 
holy shrines the punishments are known as hodood which also 
sentences adulterers to death by stoning and thieves to having a 
hand cut off 
saudi authorities said the bombs in mecca were planted by a 
group identified as kuwaiti nationals most of them of iranian 
extraction sixteen were executed in mecca on thursday four 
sentenced to jail and nine acquitted 
alshaer quoted fahd as noting that executive authorities do not 
influence the islamic courts which handed down the death 
sentences but is limited to carrying out such sentences 
in iran karrubi said saudi arabia must expect vengeance for 
beheading the 16 in kuwait groups of shiites tried to demonstrate 
in front of the saudi embassy but were dispersed by police 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus said that in a statement 
released monday karrubi said a mourning ceremony will be held 
thursday for the kuwaiti martyrs at the shrine of the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on the outskirts of tehran 
he told the iranian parliament on monday that revolutionary 
moslems will deliver the appropriate response for this crime the 
radio said 
the executions have become a cause celebre for iranian radicals 
who oppose normal ties between tehran and riyadh 
iranian pragmatists led by the newly elected president hashemi 
rafsanjani had been moving to ease a tehranriyadh rift dating 
from july 1987 when more than 400 pilgrims most of them iranians 
were killed in clashes with saudi security forces in mecca

the soviet union said monday it will slash 
military spending by more than 8 percent and cut its huge deficit 
in half in a 1990 crisis budget made necessary by the nations 
poor fiscal health 
finance minister valentin pavlov used that wording as he 
unveiled the proposed budget on opening day of the supreme soviet 
legislatures fall session 
the sessions sweeping twomonth agenda of about 80 bills 
includes proposals to radically alter some traditional ways of 
doing things in soviet politics 
under dire need for more revenues and less expenses the kremlin 
plans to implement a progressive income tax for soviets earning 700 
rubles 1076 or more a month more than three times the average 
wage and float a 92 billion bond issue the nations first to 
help finance new construction pavlov told lawmakers 
president mikhail s gorbachev presided over the 542member 
supreme soviet which reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil 
and discontent caused by the often conflicting demands of the 
countrys more than 100 ethnic groups and the state economys 
failure to meet many basic needs 
many people were looking to the 4monthold legislature for 
solutions it was given expanded powers and a fulltime political 
role by gorbachevs drive for democratization the legislators 
met in a hall at the kremlin and heard government officials give a 
bleak assessment of recent economic performance 
deputy premier lev voronin told them the dynamism of the 
economy this year has been steadily falling in many major areas 
social tension has increased and the national economy has been 
losing its balance 
against the background of these trends deficits on the 
consumer market and in production have grown 
trying to parry shortages of goods ranging from tea and meat to 
salt and matches the government plan for 1990 calls for a 20 
percent increase in factorymade consumer goods voronin said with 
the total produced by converted defense plants growing by almost 35 
percent to 61 billion 
according to pavlov the government of premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov plans to raise 83 billion in new revenues and trim 
expenditures by 103 billion to cut by half the 1989 government 
budget deficit of 192 billion next year 
the resulting budget including 750 billion in expenditures 
is intended to overcome the crisis situation in finance pavlov 
said 
the soviets cannot expect any help from foreign trade he added 
projected revenues in 1990 will decline by 39 billion from this 
year if no increase occurs in the selling price of oil and gas 
the soviets top exports all the revenue they generate abroad will 
go to pay off existing foreign debt he said 
he said the proposed 1990 budget is designed to shore up the 
ruble and improve the inadequate social safety net now offered most 
soviets pensions for 60 million retirees will be increased by an 
average of 15 percent pavlov said but not enough rubles are 
available to go to all who deserve them 
pensions are often woefully low 
cooperatives whose output of goods and services is estimated to 
reach 46 billion next year will pay about 23 billion in taxes 
the plan to cut military spending from 119 billion to 109 
billion or by 83 percent is in keeping with a directive from the 
congress of peoples deputies to reduce defense spending by 14 
percent by 1991 pavlov said 
the 2250member congress the nations new parliament elected 
the membership of the supreme soviet from among its own ranks this 
summer 
military research will be cut by 34 billion next year pavlov 
said he credited the kremlins realistic and constructive 
foreign policy for the easing of world tensions that made defense 
cuts possible 
many western observers are wary of how the soviets calculate 
their defense expenditures saying kremlin bureaucrats can 
arbitrarily raise or lower their prices 
likewise soviet officials last year presented a government 
budget with a 58 billion deficit but much of the shortfall was 
hidden with accounting tricks later estimates put it more than 
three times higher 
the 1989 soviet deficit officially said at one point to equal 
192 billion was more than the us governments deficit for 
fiscal 1989 of 161 billion and relatively more serious because 
the soviet economy is much smaller than the american 
the us governments fiscal 1989 federal budget is 11 
trillion 
in other business gorbachev told the supreme soviet the 
moscowbased government will take firm steps to settle the dispute 
over nagornokarabakh if armenia and azerbaijan cannot end their 
feud quickly he did not elaborate 
gorbachev pushed the supreme soviet session to get down to work 
immediately on the budget and not get bogged down in wrangling on 
procedure 
however it took nearly an hour of debate before deputies agreed 
to use a new electronic votetallying system rather than the 
traditional raised hands way of counting votes 
gorbachev laughed and told lawmakers to go back to tried and 
true weapons like decades of soviet legislators before them 
they raised their supreme soviet identification cards for a count

government troops killed two sinhalese 
radicals and arrested 85 in a new crackdown but officials appealed 
monday for other militants to surrender during a threeday 
ceasefire later this week 
other ethnic clashes reportedly left four people dead 
a government statement said the two radicals were killed and the 
85 others arrested during search operations it did not say exactly 
when the operations were mounted 
it said such activities would be suspended for three days 
beginning wednesday as part of a government effort to restore peace 
to this nation torn by ethnic strife 
the government has offered 512 to each sinhalese radical who 
surrenders with his weapon during the three days 
there has been no response from sinhalese extremists to the 
governments offer 
the sinhalese government monday distributed leaflets written in 
sinhalese saying you are fighting a futile war in which many of 
your colleagues have died and more more wounded 
two sinhalese brothers were also killed by the radicals in 
central nuwara eliya district 
sinhalese radicals of the peoples liberation front started 
their violent campaign against the government after it signed a 
peace accord with india in july 1987 to end a tamil insurrection 
for a separate homeland in the northeast india deployed its troops 
to enforce the agreement but the leading tamil group turned its 
guns on them 
in the north monday indian troops shot and killed a tamil rebel 
after an indian patrol was attacked at pandatharippu village in 
jaffna about 190 miles north of colombo an indian diplomatic 
spokesman said 
it was the first death involving indian troops since since 
42000 indian peacekeeping troops suspended military offensives 
against the rebels on wednesday 
india has said it will withdraw its troops by dec 31 
the indian spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity also 
said a tamil civilian was killed by suspected tamil rebels in the 
jaffna area 
however tamil residents contacted by phone in jaffna said the 
victim a tamil student and postman were killed when indian troops 
fired on a group of rebels pasting posters to commemorate the death 
anniversary of a colleague 
sinhalese militants have objected to the presence of the indians 
troops who they accuse of violating this countrys sovereignty 
they also said the government has provided too many concessions to 
the tamils in an effort to end the minority uprising 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
sinhalese about 75 percent 
at least 5000 people have died in the sinhalese radicals 
campaign another 11000 people have been killed since the tamil 
ethnic war started in 1983

president bush in his maiden presidential 
address to the united nations offered measured praise for the 
organization that he had pilloried on the campaign trail last year 
no the un isnt perfect its not a panacea for the worlds 
problems bush told the opening session of the 44th general 
assembly but it is a vital forum where the nations of the world 
seek to replace conflict with consensus and it must remain a 
forum for peace 
bush the nixon administration un ambassador in 197173 said 
he has seen a shift in the international body 
in recent years certainly since my time here the war of 
words that has often echoed in this chamber is giving way to a new 
mood weve seen a welcome shift from polemics to peacekeeping 
the president closed with an appeal to bring a unity of 
purpose to the united nations to spread peace and freedom 
throughout the world 
last year during his campaign against democrat michael dukakis 
bush took several rhetorical swipes at the un and he accused 
dukakis of wanting to rely too much on the un to resolve 
international crises 
in his acceptance speech at the republican convention in new 
orleans on aug 18 1988 bush said dukakis sees america as 
another pleasant country on the un roll call somewhere between 
albania and zimbabwe i see america as the leader a unique nation 
with a special role in the world 
elsewhere on the campaign trail bush said youve got to 
understand that it is only the united states that can stand for 
freedom and democracy around the world and we cant turn it over 
to the united nations or other multilateral organizations 
he also said the un was torn by tensions and called it 
an unreal place where the maldive islands has the same votes as 
the united states 
in his 1987 autobiography looking forward bush wrote 
like most americans who had idealistic hopes for the united 
nations when it was created in 1945 id undergone a sea change in 
attitude by the early 1970s as the last best hope for peace the 
un was another light that failed 
but bush added that it still serves a valuable purpose it may 
be largely ineffective and sometimes counterproductive in the 
political area but un peacekeeping forces have performed well 
he said un contributions in science medicine agriculture 
space and humanitarian efforts have been indispensable

in selfdefense after he forcefully pulled her from her 
rollsroyce a screenwriter testified monday at the actress trial 
that man was after blood i think said david katzman a 
freelance writer who has written for televisions knots 
landing and dallas 
he reached in with his left hand and grabbed miss gabors 
wrist with his other hand he opened the car door katzman said 
in relating the profanitylaced june 14 encounter between miss 
gabor and officer paul kramer 
she was just as irate as he was she was more frightened than 
anything else he was really hot she reached up and slapped him 
he was more surprised than anything else said katzman who was 
called by the defense 
katzman said he stopped his car when he noticed the unusual 
sight of a policeman pulling over a white rollsroyce corniche and 
became concerned while he watched 
the lady looked as if she was going to be threatened and as 
though she would be hurt he said 
after describing the brief altercation that ended with miss 
gabors arrest he said i couldnt understand that because she 
was half his size 
monday opened the third week of the misdemeanor trial before a 
beverly hills municipal court jury that has cost taxpayers more 
than 22000 
defense attorney william graysen said new witnesses turned up 
during the weekend and the case would likely go until friday 
miss gabor could receive up to 18 months in jail if convicted of 
misdemeanor battery on a police officer disobeying an officer 
driving with an expired license and having an open container of 
alcohol in her car 
the day began with miss gabor bounding from her car to tell 
reporters about upsetting letters she received during the weekend 
regarding an earlier outofcourt remark that she was afraid of 
going to jail because there were lesbians in there 
i have nothing against gays or lesbians i have lots of gay 
boys working for me miss gabor said i got letter from the 
lesbians and gay association they are going to boycott me because 
i said there are lesbians in jail how do i know whos in jail 
imagine a womens jail there must be lesbians maybe i should 
become a lesbian what do i know i like men 
miss gabor claims she acted in selfdefense because the officer 
cursed her and dragged her from her car after he spotted expired 
registration tags on the car 
prosecutors contend that after kramer stopped miss gabor she 
drove away while he was checking for other violations and that she 
slapped him when he pulled her over a second time

pacific northwest lawmakers on monday 
presented a key house subcommittee chairman a plan they hope can 
break the impasse over legislation designed to begin protecting the 
northern spotted owl and allow continued logging in the regions 
oldgrowth forests 
while the lawmakers declined to discuss the plan in detail they 
indicated it would require expedited court review of timber 
sales planned in the northwests federal forests and hinted it may 
include a slight drop in the sales level envisioned in earlier 
proposals 
im not prepared to rush into anything illinois democratic 
rep sidney yates chairman of the house interior appropriations 
subcommittee said after an hour meeting with rep norm dicks 
dwash and rep les aucoin dore both members of the 
subcommittee 
northwest lawmakers consider yates support essential if they 
are going to gain the support of a housesenate conference 
committee now scheduled to meet wednesday and avoid a fight on the 
house floor yates is the house chairman of the conference 
committee and dicks and aucoin are members 
yates has been an outspoken critic of a senatepassed plan that 
would prohibit federal courts from enjoining timber sales over the 
next year in forests known to contain spotted owls 
i heard language that makes me hopeful we can come to an 
agreement said yates he said he was not sure agreement could be 
reached before the meeting 
lawmakers were searching for a compromise that would assure 
northwest mills of a stable supply of timber over the next 12 
months while the fish and wildlife services decides whether the owl 
should be protected as a threatened species such a designation 
would require protection of its habitat the oldgrowth forest 
environmentalists have launched an allout lobbying campaign to 
defeat the senate plan which they charge would severely restrict 
their access to the courts where they have won injunctions that at 
one point halted more than half of the timber sales planned in the 
regions federal forests this fiscal year 
the timber industry supports the senate plan but insists it 
will fail unless it includes restrictions on court appeals

rock n roll and rap musicians rallied across 
the street from the white house on monday to protest groups they 
say want to censor their music 
i think the framers of our constitution would not have wanted 
to create a constitutional revolution where you couldnt rap and 
you couldnt rock and you couldnt roll barry lynn of the 
american civil liberties union told about 200 people in lafayette 
square 
attending the rally held on the 200th anniversary of congress 
sending the bill of rights to the states for ratification were 
joseph simmons of the rap group run dmc and vernon reid of living 
colour statements from frank zappa and bruce springsteen were read 
the musicians principal target was the parents music resource 
center a nonprofit group that has been critical of what it 
considers violent and suggestive lyrics 
among leaders of the arlington vabased group are tipper gore 
wife of sen albert gore jr dtenn and susan baker wife of 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
they are never going to be happy until the only thing that 
they see or hear is the america that they wish were out there the 
america that fits their cultural standards lynn said 
jennifer norwood executive director of the parents music 
resource center said monday that her group does not advocate 
censorship 
we do not support legislation and we dont support 
restrictions on popular music of any kind she said 
we do support our voluntary agreement with the recording 
industry which has been in effect since 1985 the individual 
record companies decide which albums are the ones that get the 
consumer information we dont play a role in that decisionmaking 
process 
the consumer information can include lyrics printed on album 
covers so parents can decide if they find the musics message 
objectionable 
dave marsh master of ceremonies for the rally said musicians 
should be able to sing about drugs and the gang culture and 
teenage sexuality and a whole list of issues that need to be sung 
about and talked about 
he said music in action a group that opposes mrs gores 
organization had gathered 50000 signatures protesting the 
activities of the parents group 
when we first did our concerts and this woman tipper gore 
said that it was our fault that people fight and do things like 
that because she didnt have anything better to say said 
simmons known professionally as run 
living colours reid said the parents group was involved in 
an attack on the creative impulse 
say somebody is writing a song that talks about sexual 
politics and in the course of that song they use profanity to 
express their anger about something he said if the censorship 
groups prevail that artist will think twice about the kind of 
lyrics he is writing

an anglican church group that visited namibia said 
on monday that violence within the groups fighting for the 
independence of that southern african country was deplorable but 
understandable 
we are aware that there have been incidents of denial of human 
rights and the use of torture among and within groups struggling 
for liberation said a statement from the group headed by 
archbishop edward scott former primate of the anglican church of 
canada 
as church people we condemn such violations of human rights 
and the use of torture wherever it occurs where it has occurred it 
needs to be acknowledged and those responsible held accountable 
dissidents said security forces of swapo the southwest africa 
peoples organization tortured and killed fellow africans who 
questioned or opposed the swapo leadership headed by sam nujoma 
scotts group was in namibia sept 1022 it was sent by 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie the anglican leader the 
anglican communion worldwide has 70 million members 
namibia is to hold independence elections in november 
supervised by the un transitional assistance group namibias 
population is 1518 million 
swapo terror is a substantial problem and it needs to be 
addressed said scott adding war is a dirty business 
he said swapo had reasons for its suspicion because it he said 
undoubtedly had been penetrated by south african spies 
but he said the question could not be considered in isolation 
from apartheid and violence which he said has characterized 
south africa and its rule in namibia as southwest africa is now 
known 
the territory was a german colony from 1884 until it was taken 
over in 1915 by south africa 
scott said difficulties there rose essentially from 105 years 
of external control and the incredible brutality and illegal 
occupation by the south africans 
he said he was cautiously optimistic that elections in 
namibia would be free and fair and that a stable government would 
be established 
scott reported to runcie at his lambeth palace residence in 
london on monday 
lutherans anglicans and roman catholics are the majority 
churches in nambia 
among the members of scotts group was hk allen us 
episcopal church layman and former vice chairman of the us

a former official at the irish embassy pleaded 
guilty monday to charges he provided falsified passports to 
foreigners in return for cash and sex southwark crown court 
sentenced kevin mcdonald to 21 months in jail 
witnesses told the court that mcdonald 35 charged up to 
24000 for a passport normally available for 100 and he made 
400000 in six months 
mcdonald who was the chief passport officer for the irish 
embassy in london pleaded guilty to conspiring with other 
unidentified people to obtain false passports between january 1986 
and may 1987 
in return for thousands of pounds he supplied passports to 
virtually anyone no matter how bogus or sham their applications 
were said prosecutor julian bevan 
the official also demanded sexual favors from moroccan 
prostitutes to whom he sold passports the prosecutor said he said 
the official was photographed in bed with two of them 
in sentencing mcdonald judge marcus anwyldavies said the 
official had breached the trust of his employers the judge ordered 
him to pay 5680 in legal costs 
holding an irish passport allowed mcdonalds customers to stay 
in britain for an unlimited time and easily visit other countries 
said bevan 
he said irish passports are granted legally to people with an 
irish parent or grandparent or others who are married to an irish 
citizen 
mcdonald put details from legitimate birth and marriage 
certificates on application forms and used them to issue the false 
passports bevan said 
the scheme was exposed when a reporter from the people 
newspaper a london weekly sent a south american woman posing as 
the mistress of a wealthy businessman to see mcdonald accompanied 
by a woman reporter their conversation was secretly recorded 
when the story was published mcdonald fled to dublin he was 
arrested in august 1988 and extradited to britain for prosecution 
the case also led to several trials last year of people 
described as mcdonalds customers and agents 
one of his operatives frenchborn collette raud said at one of 
the earlier trials that mcdonald supplied passports to people from 
libya who might have been terrorists

avoided had residents called police but foulk said police are too 
slow to react and must wait until shooting actually starts

police investigation before deciding whether disciplinary action 
was warranted against the rangers 
but maj clyde newman secondincommand of the 2nd ranger 
battalion said from everything i am told by the city police 
the rangers were right they were having a party and they were 
attacked 
residents of the house denied sunday that they fired any shots 
at the foulk house they also denied participating in drug deals

abandoned were fixing it up and as far as im concerned i think 
this neighborhood is going to be restored to a decent place to 
live he said

cocaine dealers in the past two years has transformed the 
treelined workingclass street into a dangerous place to walk 
now most people are scared to be outside she said

20 was held for investigation of assault and gang member daniel 
lynn vaughn 21 was held for investigation of unlawful use of a 
weapon police also said they confiscated two semiautomatic rifles

france said monday it has suspended its search for 
more bodies of the 171 people killed when a french dc10 exploded 
over the niger desert on sept 19 but investigators from france 
chad and niger still sought clues in debris scattered over a remote 
area more than five miles long and a mile wide 
robert paillasse head of the investigation commission told a 
french tv interviewer he was sure an explosive substance in a 
front cargo compartment caused the crash but that it has not yet 
been positively identified as a bomb 
paillasse said laboratory tests on wreckage are proceeding in 
paris to find out from the traces of combustion which explosive 
material was involved 
the plane exploded at an altitude of 30000 feet about an hour 
after taking off from ndjamena chad for paris wreckage of the 
uta airline plane was scattered over the tenere desert in 
neighboring niger one of the most inaccessible spots on earth 
in paris judicial sources said investigating magistrate 
jeanlouis bruguieres officially asked frances counterespionage 
police the direction de la surveillance du territoire or dst 
to aid in the probe 
bruguieres an antiterrorism specialist heads the criminal 
investigation 
the sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
various unidentified callers to news media in beirut and paris 
claimed responsibility for the crash but none was verified the 
calls included the previously unknown secret chadian resistance and 
the islamic jihad which is believed to hold western hostages in 
lebanon 
a foreign ministry spokesman declined to say precisely how many 
bodies had been recovered when he announced abandonment of the 
search on monday 
in the heat of the desert which averages 122 degrees 
it is very unlikely that any parts of bodies may still be found we 
have searched the area very thoroughly and brought back anything 
that resembled human remains he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity in keeping with government policy 
all the bodies and parts of bodies have been transported to 
paris where the judicialmedical research institute will try to 
identify them autopsies will be performed but we do not expect to 
be able to identify more than about 100 of the bodies 
so far only the bodies of the pilot and copilot and a few 
other people recognizable by uniforms or distinctive marks have 
been positively identified he said 
the plane was flying precisely along its scheduled route and 
preliminary analysis of flight data showed all systems on board 
failed at the same instant indicating an explosion

hospital where hinckley is confined testified that hinckley is 
severely mentally ill 
in a series of letters to a woman imprisoned in oakdale iowa 
hinckley called hitler a prophet and said that i am his 
successor 
my movement has blacks and whites and everyone else except jews 
because i have a theory that they are the cause of most of the 
worlds problems and they are all antichrists hinckley said in a 
sept 9 1985 letter 
psychiatrists treating hinckley were unaware of the letters 
until they were turned over by the us attorneys office which 
got them from the secret service patterson testified 
i seem to have developed a cult of females who worship me but 
you are special and i believe we will all be a loving and happy

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
monday he would try to set up a threeway meeting with the foreign 
ministers of egypt and israel next week to find a way for israel to 
hold negotiations with palestinian arabs 
baker at a news conference praised both a proposal by israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir for elections on the west bank and in 
gaza to choose palestinians for the talks and another by egyptian 
president hosni mujbarak that he select the palestinians 
president bush in new york for a speech to the un general 
assembly met separately with israeli deputy prime minister shimon 
peres and foreign minister moshe arens 
mubarak wants israel to commit itself in advance to surrendering 
land in exchange for arab recognition shamir is against the idea 
but peres who heads the israeli labor party accepts the 
proposition 
the palestine liberation organization meanwhile has dismissed 
shamirs plan as a ploy to prevent establishment of a state 
baker had intended to hold a threeway meeting this week in new 
york with arens and the egyptian foreign minister esmet 
abdulmeguid 
but us officals said the egyptian had a schedule problem and 
could not be there 
i cant tell you exactly when the meeting will be held 
baker said but i would suspect that within the course of the 
next week well be able to arrange that meeting

the united states has so far refused to 
promise 3 billion dollars it is expected to contribute to loans 
for the poorest countries of the world world bank president barber 
conable said monday 
the money would be the us share of a 145 billion fund to be 
lent out over three years to about 55 countries where the income of 
the average citizen is little more than a dollar a day it would be 
distributed by the international development association a world 
bank affiliate in 40year loans at less than 1 percent interest a 
year starting next july 1 
unfortunately the united states was not in a position this 
past week to advise its ida partners of its ability to take an 
appropriate share of a replenishment of this magnitude said 
conable a former us congressman 
he spoke at a closed door meeting of the development committee 
which brings together representatives of the world bank and 
international monetary fund now holding their annual meetings in 
washington a copy of his statement was distributed to reporters 
the united states is also holding out against a proposal to make 
a big increase in the 120 billion dollars now availale for the 
imf french finance minister pierre beregovoy said earlier monday 
that he thought a compromise would eventually be reached on about 
80 billion in new money 
about 16 billion of that would come from the united states but 
unlike the ida contribution it would not be a charge on the 
federal budget 
idas money is replenished every three years congress is now 
working on an appropriation of 975 million the final us 
contribution to ida for the current threeyear period 
the united states is the biggest giver among the 34 current 
donor countries it provides more than one dollar out of every 
five conable held out hope that the bush administration would 
change its mind about the ida contribution at a meeting to be held 
in kyoto japan in november 
discussing the proposed new threeyear pool of 145 billion 
conable said to most members agreement on this approximate 
amount seems feasible and they have indicated their willingness to 
take a reasonable share under the right circumstances 
a bank official who spoke on condition he not be named said the 
united states was the only holdout some other countries however 
will make their contributions dependent on the us contribution 
so that if the united states offers a smaller sum than expected 
they might reduce their contributions too

china continued its strong criticism of france 
tuesday saying the french opendoor policy toward chinese 
prodemocracy dissidents was brutal interference in chinas 
internal affairs 
the communist partys peoples daily accused france of violating 
un and international laws people cant help believing that 
under the pretext of upholding human rights the very purpose of 
the french government is to support the antichinese government 
activities 
the commentary came a day after the foreign ministry issued a 
strong protest to france over the staging in paris of the 
inaugural meeting of the federation of democracy in china a group 
headed by activists who fled china following the june 34 military 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
like the foreign ministry on monday the peoples daily asserted 
that the federation leaders are criminals who tried to overthrow 
the chinese government and that france was seriously threatening 
sinofrench relations by harboring them 
the french government has the cheek to brag that its 
connivance and open support to the antichinese government 
activities of yan jiaqi and the like are for safeguarding human 
rights it said referring to the political scientist elected 
chairman of the federation 
but the chinese government is strong and stable it said and 
any scheme to subvert the peoples republic will surely end up in 
a daydream anyone who bets on a handful of national scums such 
as yan jiaqi is doomed to fail 
the commentary noted that france was the first nation to declare 
a freeze on highlevel contacts and other sanctions following the 
june suppression of dissent and these acts have led to a 
deterioration of the sinofrench relations 
the daily also mentioned other recent cases of violent 
terrorist activities against china such as a twohour occupation 
of the chinese embassy education section in paris in late june an 
attack on the office of chinas airlines in paris and the alleged 
harassment by french border police of chinese officials traveling 
through france 
all these could hardly be viewed as isolated and accidental 
the daily said the chinese government has done nothing unfair to 
the french government while the latter is going further in 
poisoning the bilateral relations 
it said the late president charles de gualle had shown 
foresight and sagacity in establishing relations with china 25 
years ago we do not want to see the door closed again only 
because of the shortsightedness and recklessness of some people

the partys central committee met 
monday in the communists worst crisis since taking power in 1948 
and premier miklos nemeth was quoted as saying he made a mistake in 
agreeing to join party leadership 
the meeting was to prepare for a party congress starting oct 6 
that may lead to a split in party ranks the congress was 
originally scheduled for next year but was advanced because of the 
immense political changes under way in hungary 
the closeddoor session presided over by party chairman rezso 
nyers discussed a draft manifesto to be presented to the congress 
for debate that advocates a multiparty system in hungary and a 
balanced distribution of power 
a brief communique issued after the meeting of the policymaking 
central committee said the talks were marked by lively and 
extensive debate but gave no details indicating considerable 
disagreement among party factions 
the state news agency mti said 1276 delegates were elected to 
the congress 
in an interview with mti nemeth a reformer who is also on the 
fourmember presidium gave an indication of how deep the rifts are 
by saying even the four could not agree on all issues 
although it was a mistake for him to have joined the party 
leadership he was quoted as saying its mandate was only to lead 
the party until the party congress so it was not worth considering 
leadership changes now 
according to mti nemeth indicated he was prepared for a split 
in party ranks saying he would do everything possible for the 
organization of a renewed party after the forthcoming congress 
which is aware that its fate at the elections will be decided 
on the basis of the governments performance 
nemeth said he supported a broad coalition government after the 
elections that includes all major political forces 
parliament is due to begin debate on tuesday on key draft 
legislation toward a peaceful transition to a multiparty democracy 
that was agreed upon by the communist party and the opposition 
in weekend speeches reformers and conservatives highlighted the 
widening differences between the various factions of the communist 
party which is officially called the hungarian socialist workers 
party 
ivan t berend president of the hungarian academy of sciences 
and a central committee member said in an article published in the 
party daily nepszabadsag that the confusion within the party is 
chaotic 
politburo member imre pozsgay a party reformer and presidium 
member said in an italian tv interview the party should discard 
the organizational principle called democratic centralism in 
our endeavors we feel related to the social parties of western 
europe 
he said sunday the party would call itself simply a socialist 
party after the congress and would no longer be a communist party 
in the bolshevik and stalinist sense of the word 
party conservatives have expressed fears hungarys reforms could 
lead it out of the soviet sphere of influence and mean the end of 
socialism in hungary 
nemeth said no danger exists that hungary would leave the 
sovietled warsaw pact alliance 
referring to remarks by parliament speaker matyas szueros that 
hungary would like a neutral status in europe nemeth said this was 
not in the interest of washington and moscow mti reported 
it would disrupt the european balance of power destabilizing 
the region he was quoted as saying therefore no single 
western power is encouraging us to do this 
nemeth said hungary could become neutral only if nato and the 
warsaw pact were dismantled and both superpowers supported the 
move he said this could happen in the foreseeable future

highway 1 cambodia ap thousands of vietnamese soldiers 
jammed the main highway in indochina on monday night as they snaked 
toward the border on the eve of vietnams pledged exit from a 
nearly 11yearold war 
sovietmade armored personnel carriers americanmade trucks 
jeeps and artillery and chinese liberation troop transport 
vehicles clogged the 20footwide stretch of highway for 120 miles 
from cambodias capital phnom penh to the vietnamese border 
traffic on the road that vietnam used as one of its main 
invasion in december 1978 came to a standstill 
soldiers stripped to their undershorts hung hammocks under 
trucks cooked rice by the side of the road and draped their 
laundry from antiaircraft guns on the final night before the 
border crossing begins 
i am very happy to be returning home to my family said one 
soldier from thai binh province i have been in cambodia for 10 
years and seen my wife only three times 
peasants gathered by the side of the road and waved to the 
troops whose uniforms were decorated with flowers and medals 
speakers set up for the occasion blared the vietnamesecambodian 
friendship song and patriotic speeches which were prepared for 
the governmentorchestrated ceremony 
starting tuesday vietnamese troops will return home overland 
by ferry on the mekong river and via the gulf of thailand 
vietnam says it is withdrawing the last 26000 of its troops in 
cambodia and ending its occupation of its southeast asian neighbor 
the cambodian resistance movement calls the pullout a sham but 
already khmer rouge guerrillas have attacked a town in western 
cambodia in an apparent attempt to challenge the cambodian army no 
longer aided by vietnamese troops 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said monday that although the vietnamese occupation is apparently 
ending we believe that vietnam cannot evade its responsibility 
to help achieve a comprehensive political solution in cambodia 
as for the prospect of a return to power by the communist khmer 
rouge boucher said this problem can best be dealt with through 
negotiations and a comprehensive political solution 
on monday khmer rouge radio broadcasts monitored in bangkok 
claimed the guerrillas had seized a strategic position on the 
road from the western town pailin to the provincial capital of 
battambang 
cambodian officials acknowledged recently that khmer rouge 
guerrilla forces occupy parts of the gemrich area near pailin but 
premier hun sen predicted that the rebels would be unable to hold 
their ground 
cambodian officials and a soviet military observer said the two 
sides were throwing their best divisions at each other in pailin 
they said the khmer rouge was raining up to 2000 mortar shells a 
day on the town 
the battle has raised fears that cambodia will slide into civil 
war after vietnams soldiers are gone many cambodians say they are 
worried the government army will be unable to stand up to the khmer 
rouge 
cambodians have begun stockpiling rice in some cities for fear 
that guerrilla forces may cut supply lines sending the price of 
rice up at least 200 percent 
ethnic vietnamese who fear persecution under the khmer rouge 
also have reportedly begun fleeing back to vietnam 
the khmer rouge seized power in 1975 from americanbacked gen 
lon nol after a civil war it ruled cambodia from 1975 to 1978 and 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in practicing an 
ultraradical form of agrarian communism 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and ousted the khmer 
rouge replacing it with a government to its own liking 
since then the conflict has been stalemated 
china supplies the khmer rouge with weapons and thailand allows 
the guerrilla group to use its territory the soviet union and 
vietnam supply cambodia with arms peace talks failed in paris last 
month 
earlier monday thousands of vietnamese soldiers in personnel 
carriers and tanks rolled past the royal palace in phnom penh as 
the vietnamese army made what it said was its last exit from the 
capital 
school children were brought to the central square to bid the 
vietnamese invaders farewell 
soldiers rolled by in americanmade equipment captured from the 
united states during the vietnam war a long line of dodge buses 
saigon express written on their sides led the convoy 
heng samrin president of the vietnameseinstalled government 
thanked the commanders of two departing divisions and hailed the 
revolutionary friendship of the cambodian and vietnamese peoples

poland said on monday it will consider 
itself bound by major world human rights treaties and will sign an 
accord allowing poles to take complaints directly to un legal 
authorities 
poland is already a member of the 1975 helsinki agreement which 
guarantees fundamental human rights such as freedom of thought 
religion and conscience 
mondays announcement extends polands acceptance of 
international judgment of its human rights practices 
poland attaches major weight to the implementation of human 
rights foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski told the 44th 
general assembly 
we intend to accede to some instruments which are not yet 
binding on us 
he said poland will accept the optional protocol to the 
international covenant on civil and political rights that will 
allow polish citizens to appeal to the unaffiliated human rights 
committee in cases involving emigration torture forced labor 
arbitrary arrest or detention and freedom of thought conscience 
and peaceful assembly among other rights 
legal experts on the committee can order compensation hungary 
ratified the protocol last year 
skubiszewski said poland will accept the compulsory 
jurisdiction of the international court of justice at the hague 
in all cases involving poland 
we think that the obligatory jurisdiction of the court should 
be enhanced and supported he said 
the court an organ of the united nations can recommend to 
states but its rulings are not binding 
reflecting polands shift toward the west since solidarity 
entered the government skubiszewski continued 
we also look forward to the day when it will be possible for 
us to become a member of the council of europe and to accede to the 
european convention on human rights 
that convention dating from 1950 also guarantees basic human 
rights 
polands participation in the council of europe would mean poles 
could take human rights complaints to the european commission of 
human rights whose findings are examined by the european court of 
human rights nineteen european nations have accepted the mandatory 
jurisdiction of that court 
the council of europe includes an assembly and was founded in 
1949 in an effort to create a united europe 
last december soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs declared 
that human rights should be given new emphasis in international 
affairs 
moscow also intends to sign the optional protocol un human 
rights officials have said 
the soviet union said in march it would accept world court 
jurisdiction in six human rights treaties 
world legal experts hailed the decision which reversed a soviet 
postworld war ii policy of resisting outside judgment of its 
practices

prime rape material he drew the ire of some black groups the same 
year when he called black crime against blacks our little dirty 
secret

a housesenate conference committee voted 
monday to continue the perk of free congressional mass mailings 
reversing lopsided house and senate votes that sought to end the 
practice and use the savings to combat illegal drugs 
the conferees voted overwhelmingly to spend 1156 million for 
three newsletter mailings a year acting only two hours after the 
house voted 245137 to stop the valuable campaign tool 
the house action was a nonbinding vote it instructed conferees 
negotiating a congressional money bill to accept a senate provision 
barring virtually all mass mailings 
the house conferees saying they knew members really wanted 
their free mailings ignored the advice the majority of senate 
votes went along with continuing the free mailings although no 
formal vote was taken after the direction of the conference became 
clear 
the senate began the antifree mail campaign on sept 7 by 
voting 838 for an amendment to stop the newsletters and spend the 
45 million savings to treat pregnant women addicted to drugs 
the provision sponsored by sen pete wilson rcalif would 
have banned all newsletters town meeting notices and mailings to 
more than 500 households 
house members in the conference were furious that senators by 
originally going on record against the mailings tried to interfere 
with the way the house does business and then put house members on 
the spot 
rep david obey dwis said he will be prepared in the future 
to propose changes in the senate rules which are far less strict 
in the use of campaign money for office expenses they want to 
keep their slush funds while posing for headlines he said of 
senators 
obey said senators used the same tactic earlier this year when 
they overwhelmingly rejected a proposed 51 percent pay raise for 
congress but secretly hoped the house would find a way to pass an 
increase 
rep vic fazio dcalif chairman of the house appropriations 
legislative subcommittee said the senates tinkering with the 
houses affairs was a real breach of housesenate cooperation 
and warned we can have open warfare unless the interference 
stops 
during floor debate fazio was critical of the instruction to 
the house members of the confernece committee its pure 
demagogy but its great politics said fazio accusing his 
colleagues of voting to pose for holy pictures 
while the decision to continue the mailings was overwhelmingly 
adopted by the conferees not everyone was happy sen don nickles 
rokla said the senate proposal was not aimed at the house 
and rep silvio conte rmass who offered the house resolution 
to follow the senates lead said he would refuse to sign the 
conference report because we gave away the store 
the provision on mass mailing would establish separate mass mail 
accounts 545 million or 65 percent of the total for the 
435member house and 293 million or 35 percent for the 
100member senate in addition the provision calls for 317 
million to cover mailing costs through the end of 1989 
currently there are six mass mailings of newsletters a year 
but they would be reduced to three beginning next jan 1 there 
would be a twosheet limit 
the motion to instruct conferees came on a motion by conte who 
asked colleagues are you willing to give up a congressional perk 
to combat drug addiction in newborn babies the frank has been 
abused 
conte said that in the 1988 fiscal year which ended about a 
month before congressional elections the cost of newsletters rose 
steadily as the election approached from 59 million the first 
quarter to 16 million the last quarter senate mass mailings 
started at 38 million the first quarter and rose to 10 million 
in the fourth quarter 
supporters of the ban said more than 1000 babies are born in 
the united states each day with substance abuse symptons they said 
the savings from the newsletter ban would permit a 10fold increase 
in the pregnant addict programs

the chairman of a house investigative panel on 
monday rebuffed an eleventhhour request by lawyers for former hud 
secretary samuel r pierce jr to delay his subpoenaed testimony 
but said he would enforce a house rule permitting pierce to bar 
television coverage 
the chairman rep tom lantos dcalif and house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash were named as defendants in a lawsuit 
filed in us district court by television networks seeking to 
block pierces use of the rule and thus to permit electronic and 
photographic coverage of the hearing tuesday 
us district judge joyce hens green on monday denied the 
networks petition fo a temporary restraining order and said she 
would hear arguments at a later date on whether to grant a 
permanent injunction 
lantos said he opposes the house rule pierce is using and has 
asked house leaders to back a repeal 
foley had anticipated the suit telling reporters before it was 
filed that as a defendant he would not comment 
the house government operations subcommittee on labor and 
housing which has been probing the scandal at hud since last 
spring voted last week to subpoena pierce after the former 
secretary cancelled a voluntary appearance negotiated after two 
previous delays 
lantos said attorneys for pierce requested another delay on 
monday and he rejected it 
i have no intention of postponing the hearing lantos told 
reporters 
pierces attorney paul l perito said pierce would appear he 
declined to say what advice he had given his client but seemed to 
hint that pierce might not testify 
i have made some strong recommendations based on my experience 
in these matters but no firm decision has been made the secretary 
wanted to sleep on it and make a decision in the morning if he 
agrees with my recommendations then i will make it clear to the 
subcommittee and to the press that it was my decision 
perito repeatedly has said the comments of subcommittee members 
have convinced him pierce will not be treated fairly a sentiment 
he repeated in an interview monday night its hard for me to 
believe he can be given a fair shake 
perito had said earlier pierce was willing to testify but needed 
more time to prepare 
the subcommittee has attempted to accommodate mr pierce in an 
extraordinary fashion lantos said a subcommittee cannot be at 
the mercy of a witness who procrastinates obtaining counsel 
pierce did not hire an attorney until early september more than 
three months after he first appeared before the committee 
voluntarily and after a series of government reports outlined 
millions of dollars of apparant fraud at the department he headed 
for eight years 
lantos said he had not asked pierces attorneys if their client 
would refuse to testify on constitutional grounds 
i have no idea whther mr pierce will take the 5th amendment 
or not lantos said we are prepared to have him testify 
perito said friday that pierce was invoking the littleused 
house rule that permits witnesses appearing under subpoena to ban 
radio television and still photographic coverage of their 
appearances 
he said he had asked the speaker and rules chairman joe moakley 
dmass to consider changing the rule he said he would abide by 
the speakers decision but was determined to seek a change in the 
next session of congress if not this one 
it is my judgment that congressional hearings are very 
different now lantos said 
it is my own view that the rule is no longer relevant that it 
is obsolete it ought to be changed he said i believe it 
is unreasonable to discriminate against certain media 
however lantos said he would oppose efforts to overturn the 
rule in the courts because congress should have the right to set 
its own rules

13th graf with baker remarks adds two grafs for other bush events 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
declaring the world has lived too long 
in the shadow of chemical warfare president bush offered monday 
to slash us stocks of such weapons more than 80 percent provided 
the soviet union reduces to an equal level 
bushs proposal in his first speech to the un general 
assembly as president was designed to spur a 40nation conference 
in geneva to ban chemical weapons entirely within 10 years 
he also used his appearance to salute freedoms march around 
the world in hungary poland latin america and africa and to 
praise the soviet union for removing a number of obstacles in 
the way of treaties to reduce longrange nuclear weapons and 
troops and tanks in europe 
bush noted progress on those issues and agreements on other 
matters during talks last weekend between secretary of state 
james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze as well as a decision to hold a summit meeting with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev by early next summer 
let us act together beginning today to rid the earth of 
this scourge bush said in his comments on chemical weapons 
shevardnadze said after the speech that the soviets had a 
positive view of the plan but that it and other bush proposals 
will have to be studied additionally 
at a dinner later at the metropolitan museum of art where he was 
host president bush and his wife shook the hands of 400 guests in 
a receiving line among them shevardnardze 
shevardnardze told bush and later told baker also in the 
receiving line we have some news from moscow 
baker replied that he and shevardnardze should find some time 
tuesday or wednesday for a short chat 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser said 
the news might be a response to bushs chemical weapons proposal 
but no one knew he said the soviets had been given an outline of 
the us initiative in advance and they really have not 
responded 
he also told reporters at a briefing that bushs proposal did 
not include biological weapons which some experts consider as 
deadly as poison gas 
one year ago during the first presidential candidates debate 
bush had said i want to be the one to banish chemical and 
biological weapons from the face of the earth the united states 
has in the past accused the soviets of developing biological 
weapons 
congress has passed legislation requiring the administration to 
destroy old chemical weapons by 1997 as more advanced weapons are 
stockpiled asked about any connection between bushs proposal and 
the legal mandate to destroy a large percentage of such weapons 
the white house official said that whether or not the new plan was 
making a virtue of necessity it is certainly part of a major 
effort and a serious effort now 
twice as vice president bush blocked legislation to destroy 
us chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote in those instances 
the cutback would not have required soviet reductions as well 
to get down to the equal stocks that bush proposed the soviets 
would have to make deeper cuts since they are thought to have more 
chemical weapons on hand only the two superpowers acknowledge 
having poison gas but bush said more than 20 nations either 
possess them or can produce them 
the reagan administration singled out libya as being on the 
verge of producing chemical weapons with the assistance of west 
german firms 
baker told reporters this proposal really attacks the 
proliferation problem by making it impossible for these countries 
to argue that major countries have them and are just dragging their 
feet in chemical weapons negotiations 
bush who served as us permanent representative at the united 
nations in 1971 and 1972 described his visit and speech as a 
homecoming the delegates interrupted him twice with applause 
when he proposed the chemical weapons reductions and when he 
reported progress in ussoviet relations 
at one point he also mourned the slaying of marine lt col 
william r higgins who was taken hostage on a un mission in 
lebanon in february 1988 and subsequently slain he called higgins 
a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving dedication to the 
un ideal and called on the general assembly to condemn the 
murder 
bushs chemical weapons proposal has three key elements 
the united states was ready to begin now by eliminating 
more than 80 percent of its stockpile while working on a treaty 
provided the soviets also made their cuts 
in the first eight years of a 40nation treaty the united 
states would destroy nearly all 98 percent of its chemical 
weapons if the soviet union joined the ban 
all us chemical weapons 100 percent every one would 
be destroyed within 10 years once all nations capable of building 
such weapons signed a total ban treaty 
as for superpower relations bush said he saw signs of a new 
attitude in ussoviet relations also we are witnessing an 
ideological collapse the demise of the totalitarian idea of the 
omniscient allpowerful state 
as for chemical weapons he said these horrible weapons are 
now finding their way into regional conflicts this is 
unacceptable 
bush referred to the use of poison gas by iran and iraq in their 
persian gulf war the threat is considered potentially explosive 
especially in the middle east where syria is feared to have 
chemical weapons that could be placed on the tip of missiles and 
fired at israel 
bush acknowledged monitoring and enforcing a ban would be a 
challenge but he said inspection procedures developed for 
nuclear weapons cutbacks offer useful experience 
american chemical weapons stockpiles are estimated at about 
30000 tons a small portion is stored in west germany 
the soviet union has admitted to possessing about 50000 tons 
though some analysts believe the arsenal is larger 
baker outlined the plan to shevardnadze at their talks last 
weekend in jackson hole wyo 
there they agreed to exchange information about us and soviet 
chemical weapons and to conduct crossinspections of arsenals and 
plants 
shevardnadze said monday that from the very beginning we stood 
for the total elimination of all chemical stockpiles 
in a long day in new yorkthe president also hosted a lunch for 
the foreign ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization 
australia japan and south korea and held separate meetings with 
president jose sarney of brazil deputy prime minister shimon peres 
of israel president vinizio cerezo of guatemala president carlos 
andres peres of venezuela and foreign minister moshe arens of 
israel 
at dinner the president said in a toast the resolution of 
conflicts by nonviolent political means has now taken center 
stage and the un is leading the way 
he was nearly 20 minutes late for the dinner and offered a 
thousand apologies when he and his wife finally arrived 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was 
delayed by meetings with the foreign ministers of hungary 
yugoslavia and poland

jerry falwell offered jim bakker 300000 
and other perks to keep his mouth shut after falwell took over the 
scandalridden ptl the tv ministrys chief builder testified 
monday 
falwell denied the account given by builder roe messner who 
testified for the defense at bakkers fraud trial 
messner also said a chief bakker aide claimed bakker knew 
nothing about 265000 in hush money to jessica hahn the church 
secretary with whom bakker had a sexual encounter in 1980 
bakker is accused of defrauding followers by using more than 
37 million in ministry money to live in high style the tv 
evangelist faces up to 120 years in prison and more than 5 million 
in fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
falwell founder of the now defunct moral majority took over 
ptl in 1987 after bakker resigned in the scandal involving ms hahn 
messner testified that the offer to bakker from falwell included 
a maid a security guard and telephone expenses if bakker kept 
his mouth shut 
messner said bakker wrote at the bottom of the piece of paper 
im not making any demands on ptl im not asking for anything 
it was not immediately clear whether bakker turned down the 
alleged offer messner was not questioned further about the matter 
mark demoss a falwell spokesman said in a telephone interview 
that messner was mistaken the offer actually was a demand from 
bakker demoss said 
falwell dispatched messner to palm springs calif to talk to 
bakker but he carried no offer demoss said messner returned with 
a handwritten list of demands on the pink stationery of bakkers 
wife tammy demoss said 
demoss said bakkers demands included hospital insurance 
bakkers 300000 annual salary for life tammy bakkers 100000 
annual salary for life royalties on inspirational books and 
recordings made by the bakkers secretary and maid service for a 
year use of a south carolina lakefront house and furniture and 
attorneys fees 
simply put the items roe messner testifed that rev falwell 
sent him out to offer bakker were items that bakker requested and 
messner presented to rev falwell demoss said i would like to 
think roe just forgot the sequence of events 
messner testified that he handled the 265000 payment to ms 
hahn he said he was called by richard dortch ptls executive vice 
president on feb 21 1985 
dortch told messner that if he didnt pay a woman from new york 
265000 then she would go to the charlotte observer with 
allegations that bakker raped her five days later messner said 
he wired the 265000 to an account number in california that was 
given to him by dortch 
messner said he asked dortch if bakker knew about the payment 
he said dortch replied no im acting on my own 
messner said he agreed to make the payment in part because the 
assemblies of god was named as the potential party in a lawsuit 
threatened by ms hahn i didnt think the church ought to be 
dragged into this incident messner said 
contributors to ptl who remain supportive of bakker also 
testified 
ive always thought from the beginning that jim bakker was a 
giver said karl garmager a television director from michigan

us and soviet negotiators reached tentative 
agreement on a plan they hope will eventually eliminate all high 
seas salmon fishing in the north pacific the state department said 
monday 
during talks in lenningrad last week both nations also 
expressed concern about the illegal harvesting of salmon by 
drift net fleets in the north pacific and agreed to seek 
multilateral cooperation in effectively regulating such fishing 
practices 
decided to establish an advisory committee that will develop 
recommendations that could lead to regulation of bottom fishing in 
an area of the bering sea known as the doughnut hole 
the salmon plan envisioned by the united states and the soviet 
union would if canada and japan agreed replace the international 
north pacific fisheries convention 
the convention has overseen the regulation of salmon fishing in 
the north pacific since the 1950s besides the illegal harvest of 
salmon by the drift net fleets some nations allow a directed 
high seas salmon catch 
the convention terms discussed reflect the view of the two 
sides that high seas fishing for anadromous resources is irrational 
and wasteful the jointstatement said 
the new agreement would include significant enforcement 
provisions aimed at preventing illegal harvesting of salmon and 
increased scientific cooperation 
the idea is to prohibit salmon fishing on the high seas 
said ed wolfe who as the state departments ambassador for oceans 
and fisheries led the us delegation to the lenningrad talks 
this is something that will save our salmon 
wolfe said he expected that the legal high seas salmon fishing 
currently allowed on a limited basis would also be phased out 
the united states canada soviet union and japan all have 
salmon stocks that migrate into the north pacific

building in the financial district slightly injuring two women 
the assailant escaped 
the grenade blasts over the last two weeks have killed at least 
two people prompting officials to place police and military units

external defense eventually laurel said right now we are 
completely dependent on the united states 
in another development monday president aquino criticized us 
authorities for releasing a report that erroneously linked her to a 
gunrunning case 
she chided the us embassy for a report claiming she had signed 
an authorization for weapons purchased in california and seized 
sept 5 in the luggage of a filipino congressman nicanor de 
guzman he was charged last week with illegal weapons possession 
us officials said a report by the us alcohol tobacco and 
firearms bureau was provided to the manila government at its 
request the report quoted a gun dealer in the los angeles area as 
saying mrs aquino allegedly signed the authorization 
filipino officials later said the document was signed by col 
george aquino of the philippine embassy in washington 
i imagine whoever this person was the gun store dealer 
thought that i am the only one with the name aquino in the 
philippines mrs aquino told reporters what i want to see is 
that my name not be taken to lightly

federal investigators went inside the wreckage 
of a usair jet monday looking for additional clues to the cause of 
last weeks aborted takeoff and crash into the east river that 
killed two people 
local authorities announced a grand jury would investigate the 
crash of the boeing 737400 to see if any criminal charges are 
warranted the aircraft was headed for charlotte nc when it 
slid off the runway 
john santucci district attorney in the borough of queens where 
the airport is located said he initially had no designated targets 
and would not seek specific charges but sources in santuccis 
office said the grand jury might be asked to consider charges 
including criminally negligent homicide vehicular manslaughter and 
leaving the scene of an accident an airplane is considered a 
vehicle under state law 
the last pieces of the jet which landed partly in the water and 
partly on a row of pilings were pulled from the river sunday 
national transportation safety board investigators were for 
the first time getting an opportunity to really go into the wreck 
and find out what exists in the wreckage said rachel halterman 
an ntsb spokeswoman 
over the weekend the ntsb said the rookie copilot had 
inadvertently pushed a button that cut the throttle the board said 
pilot michael w martin told investigators he decided to abort 
takeoff because of a strange vibration and because the aircraft was 
drifting to the left 
however the unexplained veer to the left also was being 
investigated 
the crash of flight 5050 late wednesday killed two people 59 
others were rescued from the of the east river 
martin 36 and copilot constantine kleissas were criticized by 
federal officials for failing to submit immediately to drug and 
alcohol testing although they are not legally required to do so 
they submitted urine samples friday results will not be available 
for three weeks 
on saturday they also gave urine samples to the district 
attorneys office after they were told a warrant was being 
prepared martin didnt want anybody to see his face and had a 
blanket wrapped around his head when he met local investigators 
said piperno 
the two pilots flight licenses were also suspended because they 
disappeared from the accident scene 
local criminal charges against a flight crew would be highly 
unusual according to industry insiders 
were not aware of criminal charges in the past ever being 
brought here in the united states against an airline pilot 
following a crash said john macor spokesman for the air line 
pilots association in washington 
i dont recall it happening before said ms halterman 
a lawyer for martin and kleissas frederick hafetz has said he 
believes his clients committed no criminal act 
kleissas 29 who had flown a 737400 only once before on a 
passenger flight was at the controls but martin took over the 
throttle after kleissas pushed the button authorities said

quebec premier robert bourassa easily won a 
second straight majority government for his liberal party on 
monday but with a slightly reduced margin over a revitalized 
nationalist parti quebecois 
i believe that this is a sign of confidence a smiling 
bourassa said at his district headquarters 
besides the continuing quarrel between french and english 
speakers the campaign was marked by environmental protests and 
labor unrest 
the parti quebecois which had been reeling from its election 
debacle four years ago and was suffering from internal struggles 
only last year ran a strong campaign on its platform of eventual 
independence for the majority frenchspeaking province and gained 
seats 
we have progressed solidly toward the goal that we think is 
the right one its leader jacques parizeau said in reiterating 
his separatist aims 
even if we havent had as many seats as we wanted isnt it 
marvelous this idea of independence for quebec he told 
supporters who broke into chants of le quebec aux quebecois 
quebec for quebecers 
they said it independence was dead parizeau added it 
is alive a new equality party formed by english speakers irate 
over quebecs profrench language policies won two seats in the 
125member provincial assembly and tight races were going for two 
more 
but bourassas liberals had won or were leading in more than 
twothirds of the districts 
a canadian broadcasting corp projection after the polls closed 
at 8 pm edt indicated the liberals had won or were leading for 91 
seats the parti quebecois for 30 and the equality party for four 
bourassa whose party has held power in the province for four 
years had predicted the win as he voted in his home district of 
outremont where he was reelected 
late monday as bourassa was leaving his home where he watched 
the results with his family he yelled out he was feeling very 
happy 
parizeau had predicted a good showing for his party which moved 
up steadily in the polls through the election campaign in this 
predominately frenchspeaking province 
the equality party was in a tight race for a third seat 
equality party worker jocelyn kruger said she was ecstatic 
about the sixmonthold partys showing when we started we had 
to think it would happen and it did 
during the campaign the parti quebecois tried to capitalize on 
environmental and labor protests that overshadowed bourassas 
promises of continued prosperity 
the liberals won 99 of 122 seats in the provincial assembly four 
years ago and preelection opinion polls showed little likelihood 
that the parti quebecois would be able to muster the 42 percent of 
the popular vote needed to make much of a dent this year 
but under leader parizeau who won an internal struggle last 
year to put the separatist party back on a hardline course the 
party showed during the campaign it was not in danger of either 
disappearing or becoming irrelevant 
bourassa an economist counted on quebec residents being more 
interested in prosperity than in independence 
he touted a 4 percent annual economic growth rate the creation 
of 233000 new jobs and the social stability that lasted through 
most of his term 
but the idea of separatism thought to have been put to rest in 
a 1980 referendum in which 60 percent of the voters rejected it 
proved surprisingly durable 
the parti quebecois won 387 percent of the popular vote in the 
december 1985 provincial election 
bourassas support among quebecs englishspeaking minority 
which traditionally votes liberal may have been hurt by his 
refusal in december to allow more than a token change in provincial 
laws restricting commercial signs to the french language 
his compromise solution allowed bilingual signs only indoors 
and as long as the frenchlanguage portion was significantly larger 
than the english 
quebec canadas largest and secondmost populous province with 
65 million people is 81 percent frenchspeaking it has 46 
million registered voters 
supporters of language restrictions argue they are necessary to 
protect quebecs special culture

some call it corrupting the classics but 
conductor daniel lipton calls it popera 
popera is a program he started at opera hamilton a suburb of 
toronto canada which plays wellknown operatic pieces for people 
who dont normally attend opera 
everyone thinks opera is its not over until the fat lady 
sings he said but thats changing anything in art is sort 
of like porno films you have to participate to really appreciate 
it 
for lipton opera is an emotional outlet for fantasy and his 
goal through popera is to expand that fantasy to people with only a 
passing acquaintance with the music 
opera suffers from its reputation as an art for fanatics and 
through the popera program which has been duplicated elsewhere 
lipton has sought to convince listeners that opera isnt 
unattainably highbrow 
programs have included excerpts from carmen don 
giovanni the barber of seville and other operas in which 
people recognize the melody but dont know its origins 
i wanted to get away from the elitist and break down the 
barriers lipton said 
lipton has not been alone opera it seems is all around in 
movie scores and in plays in commercials for pizzas there is even 
an album entitled madison avenue goes to the opera 
purists rail against the trend fearing people will learn the 
tunes but miss the point 
but lipton argues that theres nothing wrong with it its 
fun he said an elderly couple once wrote him after they 
attended a popera concert in hamilton and thanked him for giving 
them a new love in their old age 
lipton would like to bring his baton to new york one place in 
which the transplanted new yorker has never played 
its pretty depressing not to have played in your hometown 
lipton said in a recent interview while he was visiting new york 
for auditions but i think its just a matter of time 
he has been approached by companies in new york but for one 
reason or another his return home has never worked out its not 
for lack of recognition lipton made his debut in paris and has 
conducted at most major opera houses in europe and many in this 
country 
his reputation led to his selection as the conductor of the 
world premiere of gian carlo menottis the wedding day at the 
seoul olympics 
he founded an opera company in colombia and has been credited 
with saving the company in hamilton where he now lives through 
popera 
hes won applause at annual appearances in france italy spain 
germany colombia and the united states but new york opera buffs 
have never seen him at the podium 
he tries not to dwell on it hes too busy 
born in paris lipton lived on three continents before his first 
birthday his family fled france during world war ii by way of 
casablanca before settling in new york where his father operated a 
frenchlanguage bookstore 
lipton the youngest of three boys began playing the piano when 
he was 3 years old 
my mother wanted to be a concert pianist he said but her 
father wouldnt hear of it it wasnt proper for a woman at that 
time 
at 14 lipton decided to live on his own in new york supporting 
himself by playing jazz in clubs sometimes finishing early enough 
to catch humorist lenny bruce perform playing both oboe and piano 
lipton entered the juilliard school of music at 16 he toyed with 
five majors before settling on a career in conducting 
he went to europe on a fulbright fellowship in siena italy he 
happened upon an opera class he watched from the balcony became 
fascinated by the music and decided he wanted to conduct opera on 
the spot he arranged to audition for the class that afternoon 
i didnt know the scores he recalled i studied over 
lunch 
he made it and hes been successful ever since conducting at 
the munich staatsoper nice opera houston grand opera denver 
symphony teatro de la fenice in venice the teatro san carla in 
naples and the madrid opera house he also has served as artistic 
director of the san antonio international festival of the arts 
four years ago lipton was asked to take over the helm of the 
struggling opera hamilton 
hamilton a small company gives him the opportunity to 
experiment an opportunity that he might not have at a larger 
company still he would like to move on to a bigger troupe within 
the next decade hes aware that whatever happens his abilities 
are well known 
they opera companies keep asking me back he said i 
must be doing something right

karl marx has been dusted off to do battle 
against what chinese leaders regard as the serious threat of 
liberal thinking 
marxist theory is making a strong comeback in china as students 
their democracy movement crushed file off to political education 
classes and commmunist party leaders trying to figure out what 
went wrong return to their ideological roots 
the basic theories and tenets of marxism have been lashed by 
trends of bourgeois liberalization party theorists concluded at 
a recent meeting the main reason for the student protests of this 
past spring they said was serious confusion in ideology and 
theory 
the conservative leadership in charge since the military 
crackdown in early june on the democracy movement is now moving to 
correct ideological heresy 
the official press is bombarding readers with commentaries on 
the need to study marxistleninist thought people are constantly 
being reminded that only socialism can save china and without the 
communist party there would be no new china 
the guangming daily a newspaper for chinese intellectuals 
noted recently that critics say marxism combined with chinas 
feudalism to form feudalist marxism but it contended history has 
proved that socialism has taken root germinated blossomed 
brought forth fruit and stood many severe tests 
marx is on every students reading list this fall as educators 
try to repair the damage done by the democracy movement 
in the days when bourgeois liberalization spread unchecked 
many regarded marxist theoretical education as a disgusting extra 
burden and a troublesome matter which must be studied although it 
is useless the communist partys peoples daily said 
why has such a monstrous absurdity happened in a socialist 
republic where marxism is the guiding ideology 
on the annual teachers day in september a senior party 
official song ping urged teachers to persuade students of the 
superiority of socialism 
antagonistic forces and those who stubbornly cling to 
bourgeois liberal values are doing their utmost to win the younger 
generation away from us our colleges and universities must never 
train our own gravediggers 
the communist party concerned about bourgeois or western 
leanings among its 48 million members is demanding more serious 
study of the ideological basics 
we can smash the fond dream of international capitalism to 
lead china down the capitalist road if we use marxismleninism to 
arm the broad masses of party members politburo member qiao shi 
told students at the central party school 
deng xiaoping the senior leader best known outside china for 
introducing marketoriented reforms that challenged basic tenets of 
the stateplanned economy is now being hailed for creative 
contributions to marxism 
political theory took a new leap forward the peoples daily 
said when deng in 1979 came up with the concept of the four 
principles allegiance to the socialist system the dictatorship 
of the people the communist party and marxistleninist mao 
tsetung thought 
marxist thought has always been a guiding force for the party 
but in recent years the prevailing feeling as been that some of 
what the 19th century philosopher was saying was no longer 
applicable to 20th century political and economic forces 
in december 1985 the peoples daily noted that marx had been 
dead for 101 years and we cannot depend on the works of marx and 
lenin to solve our modernday questions the next day it put out 
an awkward correction saying marx cant solve all problems 
the day after that the guangming daily said if new ideas are 
not implemented and new marxist conclusions and answers are not 
brought forth then socalled support for the basic tenets of 
marxism will only be empty talk 
last year the same newspaper now a bastion of support for the 
battle against liberalism commented that there are mistakes in the 
works of marx engels and lenin and that china must pluck up its 
courage to restudy capitalism so as to creatively develop 
marxist theory 
the final insult appeared to come on may day when for the first 
time in three decades huge portraits of marx engels lenin and 
stalin failed to appear on tiananmen square for the annual labor 
day celebrations 
but marx now is definitely back in the fold

three decades after he and a us navy 
officer set a world record by diving as deep in the sea as 
jetliners fly high in the sky the swiss deepsea researcher 
jacques piccard has designed a submarine for tourists 
it will be launched in the spring by a private company and will 
offer passengers an uncommon way to share the riches of the sea 
the 4million craft which will seat 16 people and a crew of 
two is nearing completion at a swiss plant in winterthur 
it will be somewhat roomier than the bathyscaph trieste that 
went down 32748 feet to challenger deep at the bottom of the 
marianas trench in the pacific on jan 23 1960 with piccard and 
lt don walsh on board 
exploring life underwater has since filled most of the 
67yearold piccards life he has done research for universities 
governments and the police collecting marine samples and 
checking up on underwater pipelines 
we have found everything from automobile tires to aircraft 
down there he said 
he still boards his small working sub about twice a week 
diving in lake geneva western europes largest freshwater body 
launched in 1979 the sub named after the swiss scientist fa 
forel has been used on scientific industrial and recovery 
missions in many european lakes as well as in the mediterranean 
in 1969 piccard and five other scientists spent a month 
exploring the gulf stream in the mesoscaphe ben franklin also 
designed by him but he says none matched the experience he had on 
his world record dive 
by far the most interesting find was the fish that came 
floating by our porthole at the bottom of the challenger deep he 
said in an interview we were astounded to find higher marine 
life forms down there at all 
having more people share the riches of the sea is an idea 
initiated by his father auguste piccard who also made scientific 
history in the stratosphere in the early 1930s ascending 50400 
feet in a balloon of his own design 
i came up with the idea of sending tourists underwater and it 
was my father who designed the worlds first tourist submarine 
piccard said 
during the swiss national exhibition in 1964 the fathers 
submarine carried more than 30000 people to the depths of lake 
geneva 
jacques piccards new 33ton 40foot px44 has several more 
sophisticated features and more advanced electronic equipment than 
his fathers 
it will cruise at three miles an hour and be capable of diving 
to 300 feet on tours of up to 40 minutes piccard said 
powerful searchlights and large portholes will bring the depths 
of the sea to brilliant life for the passengers entering the world 
of scuba divers in relaxed firstclass comfort 
but for piccard the px44 will also help bring greater awareness 
of the environmental threats to the worlds seas 
for me the more people discover the sea the greater the 
chance of bringing marine issues into public view and the better 
off we will all be he said

for the past several months 
16yearold marcio santos martins has been closely following the 
nine candidates running in brazils presidentialelection campaign 
thats because hell be casting a ballot for one of them on nov 
15 in the nations first direct presidential election in 29 years 
brazil has lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 the only 
country in the world other than nicaragua to allow citizens so 
young to vote 
why shouldnt i be excited said martins a prepschool 
student just because im 16 doesnt mean im not politically 
mature or dont take voting seriously 
the lowering of the voting age is not expected to have any 
dramatic effect the outcome of the election just 45 million 
brazilians under 18 less than 6 percent of the total voting 
population of 815 million registered to vote by the aug 6 
deadline according to the governments supreme electoral tribunal 
in addition none of the presidential frontrunners has made a 
special drive to attract voters under 18 
but the voting experiment has sparked harsh debate across this 
country of 144 million people on the role teenagers should play in 
brazilian society 
young brazilians today are being confronted with reality at an 
earlier age said helena quadrado director of the 
mccannerickson reserch and planning department in sao paulo 
brazils biggest city they are more equipped to make such 
decisions at their age than teenagers of past generations 
in brazil 16yearolds can work pay taxes marry and open bank 
accounts she said 
supporters also say television radio and a stronger educational 
system have produced a generation that is betterinformed and 
prepared to take on the responsibility of voting than young people 
30 years ago 
allowing 16 and 17yearolds to vote will help cement democracy 
in brazils nascent republic and discourage the young from tacitly 
accepting future military takeovers said sen afonso arinos of rio 
de janeiro a leading of the lower voting age 
the military seized power in 1964 and did not relinquish it 
until 1985 when the civilian jose sarney took office as president 
after a militarycontrolled electoral college vote 
critics of the lower voting age contend that teenagers lack 
experience in decisionmaking and will fall prey to campaign 
jingoism and flash instead of focusing on substantive issues 
people under 18 are not psychologically mature enough to 
comprehend the meaning or importance of their vote said celso 
bastos a law professor at the university of sao paulo 
but the expectation surrounding the months leading up to the 
election also seem to typify the mood of many young registered 
voters 
angered by indecision and charges of nepotism in their 
government and frustrated by shrinking job markets and spiraling 
inflation brazils young view their vote as a tool for drastic 
change surveys and interviews show 
young people though aware of the economic strains imposed by 
brazils 110billion foreign debt overwhelmingly blame official 
corruption for the nations problems according to a recent survey 
of youths 15 to 24 years old in rio and sao paulo 
more and more teenagers are realizing that we ourselves are 
one of the last hopes for turning our country around said ana 
paula nascimento 16 a high school student in brasilia the 
national capital 
overwhelmingly the most pressing problem facing the countrys 
new leader is inflation now runnign at 1084 percent a year 
my friends talk often about economics and what itll be like 
when we finish school said elma silva dos reis 17 a student in 
an englishlanguage institute in the southeastern city of juiz de 
fora we never talked this way until a few years ago 
a depressed educational system environmental abuse in the 
amazon violence and social injustice are other prominent issues 
for brazils newest voters 
as a result brazilian teenagers are turning to liberal 
candidates who advocate socialistoriented economic reform 
the right wing has been running the country for years and look 
how things are said edno alberto braz serafim 16 a rio 
student he said he plans to vote for luis inacio lula da silva of 
the farleft workers party 
one rightofcenter candidate that has appealed to young voters 
is fernando collor de mello a 40yearold upstart candidate from 
brazils poor northeast who has pledged to clean up government 
hes new blood said mariela garcia 16 another rio 
student he hasnt gotten himself wound up in scandals thats 
important to a lot of young people 
many 16 and 17yearolds consider their new right a priviledge 
were expected to perform more like adults each day said 
17yearold carlos enrique de souza a rio student giving us the 
chance to vote lets us express how we feel about the changes around 
us

like a bureaucratic bogeyman a dreaded 
sequester is lurking at the gates of government 
thats federal jargon for an automatic cut in spending required 
by law if congress and the white house dont settle on a 
deficitreduction plan by oct 16 the word sequester actually 
is a verb meaning to set apart withhold or confiscate 
we are drifting toward a sequester rep newt gingrich of 
georgia the republican whip said the other day and blamed the 
democratic leadership in congress for the prospect of what he said 
would be a bureaucratic nightmare 
the word and the partisan argument will be repeated frequently 
in the debate that begins in the house this week on a comprehensive 
budget bill that is supposed to trim the projected federal deficit 
below the legal limit of 110 billion a measure now snarled in the 
dispute over taxes 
unless the budget bill is law before oct 16 automatic budget 
cuts will have to be ordered to enforce the deficit ceiling and 
president bush says he will veto any budget bill that includes a 
tax rate increase like the one house democratic leaders want to 
put into the measure 
all of that raises the likelihood that at least the first phase 
of the deficit control law the jargon for that is 
grammrudman will be triggered next month the president then 
would order acrosstheboard spending cuts to hold the anticipated 
deficit under the ceiling 
another wrinkle if the deficit goals are met prior to the 
deadline theres 10 billion in leeway but if the automatic cuts 
are triggered that cushion is eliminated and the limit becomes 
100 billion 
all of that was put into place to do something about the 
worsening deficit habit in 1987 the system was triggered and 
president reagan had to order about 23 million in spending cuts in 
order to meet the limits of the law they took effect only 
temporarily 
republicans now are saying that it could happen for real this 
time maybe well have the first real taste of grammrudman 
acrosstheboard sequester in order to accomplish the 100 billion 
deficit thats required by that law said sen pete domenici 
rnm 
domenici ranking republican on the budget committee said the 
office of management and budget would have to draw up cuts of about 
53 percent in domestic programs and 46 percent in defense in 
order to come up with about 168 billion in savings that process 
would begin oct 1 
but it will be a while before anything really happens even if 
the cuts actually took effect they would not be locked into place 
for 30 days the cuts triggered in 1987 never did become permanent 
government agencies got their money back after the administration 
and congress negotiated a budget agreement 
this falls budget measure was stalled even before it became the 
arena for a tax fight that echoes the presidential campaign of 
1988 bush won committee approval of his proposed capital gains tax 
cut over the opposition of democratic leaders and they now have 
drafted a rival plan including an income tax rate increase on the 
wealthiest taxpayers 
i will veto a rate increase bush said in a thursday night 
television interview i have sent that signal up to the hill 
well then well try to send it to him and let him veto it 
house speaker thomas s foley retorted on friday 
gingrich said the president told republican congressional 
leaders he was not going to accept takeotorleaveit budget bills 
including amendments he would veto if they stood alone 
that draws lines for the argument over who will be to blame if 
there are indeed automatic spending cuts for popular programs 
and in debates like this one those are the programs that get the 
attention thats standard procedure so the office of management 
and budget has warned that cuts could force such measures as 
threeday layoffs of air traffic controllers and reductions in 
loans and grants for needy college students 
i think were going to see one of the most important periods 
of the bush presidency in the next 45 days gingrich said he 
said it will be a real test of will between the democrats and 
the president with the democrats apparently willing to 
potentially risk sequester to get their programs

the new season brings a new reason for 
thinking youre still looking at the summer festival of rejected 
pilots on network television 
have you seen abcs chicken soup or homeroom or cbs 
top of the hill 
no wonder the three networks are losing viewers to alternative 
viewing no wonder their share of the audience is down to 62 
percent the share dropped below 60 percent during the summer 
the fall season got under way officially last week and the 
offerings are mixed 
first the good news 
stephanie beacham last seen vamping on dynasty has taken 
the vows and borrowed the tongue of an asp to have a go at nbcs 
sister kate she rides herd on a group of unruly orphans who 
are the dickens sorry charles it does have a nice twist and 
great expectations 
the famous teddy z on cbs is the kind of agent your mother 
would want you to take home laughing all the way of course 
creator hugh wilson is at his best tilting his lance at hollywood 
and actor jon cryer makes the little twerp endearing 
abcs life goes on is a satisfying story of a family coping 
with the usual problems plus a teenage son with downs syndrome 
christopher burke who has the genetic condition himself is corky 
and if you dont watch out hell charm your socks off 
abcs the young riders shows promise it follows a group of 
pony express riders whom one critic called hunks on horseback 
anyway its great to see another western on the air 
nbcs hardball looks tolerable its premise of a 
hardcharging cop getting on in years who struggles to keep up with 
his young partner is an interesting one 
heres the bad news 
abcs chicken soup appears to be on its way to becoming a 
smash hit simply because if follows roseanne scheduled 
anywhere else this show would be gone in a few weeks its not 
funny and it has no charm the socalled abies irish rose 
romance between jackie mason and lynn redgrave doesnt generate 
enough heat to warm a flea mason even at his cheeriest comes 
across like a messenger of doom 
cbs top of the hill started with great potential the 
surfer son of an ailing congressman takes over his seat in the 
house his idealism clashes with political realism it has touches 
of mr smith goes to washington that lasted about five 
minutes rep tom bell played by william katt quickly becomes 
involved in freeing a federal agent being held by a drug lord in a 
latin american country 
the state department doesnt want to upset a friendly 
government so no official action is taken the possibilities for a 
contratype story arise kelsey grammer does a nice turn as an 
ugly american foreign service officer but otherwise forget it 
bells heroics become so unbelievable you expect katt to get back 
into his costume from the greatest american hero 
abcs homeroom will never move to the head of the class not 
funny no appeal 
nbcs nutt house is too much shtick while harvey korman and 
cloris leachman are marvelously loony the show needs one sane 
person for them to revolve around 
foxs alien nation should just get on with telling its 
stories and lay off the heavyhanded preaching we dont need to be 
hit over the head to get its message of tolerance 
cbs the people next door is the kind of show that makes you 
wonder whats happening to the neighborhood taint funny mcgee 
no hard opinions yet either way abcs doogie howser md 
cbs island son abcs family matters cbs peaceable 
kingdom 
cbs snoops and nbcs mancuso fbi are still unseen but

author saul bellow once said a novel is 
balanced between a few true impressions and the multitude of false 
ones that make up most of what we call life 
could the same be said about the economy you judge 
we continue to experience the longest peactime economic 
expansion in our history an experience that is often 
misinterpreted to mean that these are the best of economic times 
they may not be by some measures they might even be among the 
worst of times perhaps the worst in 50 years and that brings us 
back to the great depression of the 1930s 
speaking recently to a meeting of the construction industry 
institute in seattle investment advisor john wright pointed out 
that the economy has grown at an average of more than 4 percent a 
year since 1982 
that growth he observed has come not from a normal level of 
economic activity but from one that was extremely depressed so far 
in the 1980s the economy has grown at just a 25 percent annual 
rate in real terms 
unless the economy grows more than twice as fast as now appears 
likely he said the decade of the 1980s will be the worst decade 
for economic growth since the 1930s 
worse it follows a decade that wasnt much better after 30 
years of growth averaging more than 4 percent the us economy has 
grown only 25 percent a year for nearly 20 years 
if this is prosperity he asks why are average hourly earnings 
in the nonfarm sector of the economy no higher than they were a 
decade and a half ago 
two other misimpressions of the economy or aspects of it tend 
to support the observation by benjamin franklin that half the 
truth is often a great lie 
1 it is often believed that until the big crash of october 
1987 increasingly affluent americans were becoming more active 
buyers of corporate stocks it isnt so 
federal reserve figures show that since 1968 households have 
been net sellers of stock in all but one year in that time the 
percentage of household financial assets held as stocks has fallen 
to 196 percent from 434 percent 
following the 1987 debacle the university of michigans survey 
research center sought reasons why the impact didnt spread as 
forecast one finding startling to many people at the time was 
that so few families owned any stock 
2 an impression exists that housing has been priced beyond the 
means of most americans a notion that probably results from some 
of the socalled affordability indexes 
it isnt true and probably couldnt be true for an extended 
period of time before supply and demand corrected the disparity in 
defining affordability these indexes usually relate the median 
price of a typical onefamily home to the median income of 
americans 
median of course means that onehalf the houses are below the 
figure cited and onehalf the incomes are above the income cited 
that leaves many thousands of households each with ability to buy 
one of thousands of houses 
none of these families is required to buy the medianpriced 
house smart ones might find equally good houses for much less 
some seek twofamily units some prefer to rent rather than buy 
theyre not priced out they choose out 
the indexes are merely guides when they rise it is more 
difficult to buy when they fall it is relatively easier to buy 
assuming other factors remain stable 
money magazine points out still another misimpression about our 
economic life it announces that the common image of americans 
casting aside their aging parents for nursing homes is largely a 
myth 
it claims that only 6 percent of all americans 65 and older live 
in nursing homes while 70 perecent of the countrys dependent 
elderly get all their care from family and friends 
do not despair if you held such notions said washington irving 
a long time ago the ability to discern between that which is 
true and that which is false is one of the last attainments of the 
human mind

one name arises more than any other 
in the pursuit of a peaceful settlement of the 11yearold civil 
war in afghanistan zahir shah the king who was ousted in 1973 
after 40 years on the throne 
almost all the parties involved in the conflict between the 
communist government and moslem guerrillas have reasons both to 
accept him and reject him 
the 74yearold former monarch now living in exile in rome has 
said he is willing to serve his people if they want him 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan has proposed 
zahir repeatedly as the only neutral figure who could head a 
temporary transitional administration if hostilities cease 
but the mujahedeen rebels islamic holy warriors are 
deeply divided over what role if any zahir should play in 
afghanistan 
seven allied mujahedeen parties based in pakistan have formed 
their own afghan governmentinexile or interim government 
but it excludes eight smaller rebel groups based in iran 
the most radical moslem rebel groups have branded zahir a 
traitor who let soviet influence flourish during his reign they 
claim the soviets gained a toehold through extensive financial 
investment in the countrys infrastructure and that this eventually 
led to the soviet military invasion of afghanistan in 1979 
but delegations of mujahedeen field commanders many from the 
royalist stronghold of southern afghanistan have issued calls for 
the return of the king 
zahirs rule ended when afghanistans fledgling marxist parties 
rallied behind his cousin mohammad daoud who toppled him in a 
bloodless coup 
but when daoud tried to distance himself from moscow his former 
communist allies the peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
killed him in 1978 and seized power 
the coup set off a widespread insurgency that included 
royalists moslem fundamentalists and tribal leaders moscow sent 
its forces in 1979 to replace one peoples democratic party 
government with another but it failed to put down the rebellion 
the soviets withdrew the last of their combat forces last feb 15 
zahir shah takes a very grave risk of being shot if he returns 
to afghanistan said nawab salim a spokesman in pakistan for the 
extremist hezbiislami rebel group one of the most powerful 
the mujahedeen will not let zahir shah come to afghanistan 
abdul rahim a spokesman of the guerrillas interim government 
said the former kings return would mean the mujahedeen and the 
people of afghanistan are defeated 
however in july 1987 a prominent afghan intellectual and 
author sayd majrooh asked a random sampling of 2000 afghan 
refugees among more than 3 million who reside in pakistan whom they 
preferred as afghanistans leader and 71 percent replied they 
favored zahir shah 
the royalists among the mujahedeen most notably the national 
islamic front of afghanistan led by syed gailani say the former 
king is the only afghan able to rally warring factions 
azim nasserzia a spokesman for gailanis group said zahir 
embodies the afghans strong respect for traditions 
the most important thing is tradition nasserzia added 
not just anyone can come and claim a leadership role in 
afghanistan no one else has emerged during these last 11 or 12 
years as a unifying force 
but nasserzia said the zahir will not return to afghanistan 
until president najib is out of power 
he said that if the zahir were to head a transitional 
administration he would convene a grand council to oversee 
elections and then step aside 
pakistan which has channeled millions of dollars worth of us 
weapons to the mujahedeen professes impartiality to a political 
settlement of the afghan war 
however pakistans policies often have coincided with those 
rebel groups who say they will settle for nothing less than an 
allislamic afghan government 
the zahir shah option is no option gen aslam beg chief of 
staff of pakistans army said at a news conference 
the united states has acknowledged it sent envoys to talk to 
zahir shad twice in september 
hekmatyar the hezbiislami leader and a major recipient of 
us military aid called the meetings a sellout to moscow intended 
to blunt the moslem fundamentalists power in any future afghan 
government 
us attempts are in fact aimed at suppressing the islamic 
resurgence in afghanistan as well as in other countries pursuing 
the policy of nip the evil in the bud so that the wave of islamic 
reawakening throughout the world can be contained hekmatyar said 
in a press statement 
the hardline mujahedeen groups claim zahir watched silently in 
luxurious exile as soviet troops invaded afghanistan in 1979 
he never cared about the jihad holy war said rahim the 
interim government spokesman he never participated 
practically

there is a booming new marketplace for comedy in 
the tradition of vaudeville and the coffeehouses and cafes of the 
midcentury comedy clubs are drawing a million people a month and 
500 million a year they are also serving as a farm system for 
televisions growing demand for comics 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
call it a laughter explosion 
ten years ago there were fewer than 20 comedy clubs in the 
united states today there are some 225 of them out there 
dedicated to making people laugh for a 10 to 20 cover charge and 
the price of a drink or two 
its a growth rate of nine clubs a year for the last quarter of 
a century and thousands of comics are laughing their way to the 
bank they can find work on some 700 stages where comics are 
featured not to mention the growing number of comedy shows on 
television 
its a 500 millionayear business that draws a million people 
a month and shows no sign of abating 
the comedy clubs have become a vast farm system for televisions 
insatiable appetite for talent there are an estimated 10000 
working comedians vying for the stage 
home box office is beginning a 24hour cable comedy channel in 
november and mtv has one in the planning stage for the thousands 
of comics out there they would become huge showcases for talent 
headliners at comedy clubs are paid as much as 10000 a week 
in the bigtime halls with seating in the thousands headliners 
can draw 100000 a week not bad in a business in which most start 
at about 25 a night naturally few make it to the top 
once there was vaudeville which gave birth to the likes of bob 
hope milton berle and red skelton then there were the 
coffeehouses and cafes that spawned the likes of mort sahl woody 
allen bob newhart and bill cosby 
then in 1963 bud friedman and his wife opened new yorks first 
comedy club the improvisation when they divorced she kept the 
new york showcase and he opened the improvisation in los angeles 
and now heads a chain of improvs 
whether it is the punch line in atlanta and nine punch line 
franchises in other southern cities or the laff stop in houston 
or the funny bone in st louis or byfields and zanies in chicago 
or the holy city zoo in san francisco or comedy underground in 
seattle or the comedy connection in boston or the comedy store in 
los angeles or carolines in new york city or any of half a dozen 
catch a rising stars from princeton nj to palo alto calif to 
boston the stream of talent seems endless 
the comedy clubs are places where young comics can hone their 
talents before a live audience they also offer a mirror for the 
changing face of humor for instance 
sex jokes are passe they dont shock audiences anymore so now 
the young comics play games with personal relationships the 
blurring of sexual roles and distinctions motherinlaw jokes are 
out but mothers and fathers make great material 
this glittering city where they say good luck instead of good 
morning is one of the brightest beacons for young comics on the 
make it has helped launch many of them to stardom robin williams 
bill murray billy crystal sandra bernhard eddie murphy john 
belushi judy tenuta richard pryor roseanne barr to name a few 
pam matteson is a striking redhead from brooklyn she has been 
aping other peoples accents since she put on her own sidewalk 
shows as an 8yearold tap dancing to how high the moon and 
singing chattanooga choo choo songs her father taught her 
on one particular night she is winding up a week at catch a 
rising star an opulent club room in the bally resort hotel on the 
las vegas strip she has the audience most of them sitting on 
sofalike seats hanging on her every word 
she is the daughter of a retired irish cop and an italian 
mother she says thats why i drink a lot and kill people 
it is the rare comic who is over 40 these days matteson says 
she is a good 28 
and the lines roll on jesting at family anyones quartering 
religion anyones 
glen schwartz who says he has the only comedyonly public 
relations agency in the country says when you publicize actors you 
emphasize the physical the hair the looks but when you 
publicize the comedian its the vanity of the mind these people 
think they observe theyre going to tell you what you already 
know but youre going to think you thought of it for the very 
first time and youll laugh 
you cant teach an actor to be a comic but you can teach a 
comic how to act 
twice a year comics get together at the montreal international 
comedy festival in july and the comedy convention in las vegas 
established comics take the stages in montreal and upandcomers 
are showcased in vegas some 200 comics from all over the world go 
to montreal expensespaid the las vegas show plops hopefuls in

then the comics have their own affair on hbo have had for the 
last three years proceeds going to the nations homeless this 
years hosts were whoopi goldberg robin williams and billy 
crystal the show is called what else comic relief 
some 110 of the comic clubs subscribe to a new yorkpublished 
handout for guests patterned after broadways playbill called 
laughtrack it is the product of josh abrams who says it brings in 
several million dollars a year gross 
it supplies a number of short features on comedy and comics in 
march it took notice of the heartattack death at age 40 of 
comedian ronnie shakes in 1987 and noted in retrospect some of his 
ironic humor seen and heard on the johnny carson show 
i know when i die im going to hell i know its hot down 
there but is it humid because a dry heat i can take but that 
humidity thatll kill you and what about heaven is every day the 
same or should i bring a light jacket 
once ron remembered asking his father were born we live and 
we die so what is the purpose of life his father answered 
ronnie tax purposes 
richard fields who took catch a rising star public and just 
sold his original catch for more than a million shares in the new 
company is expanding catch has an agreement with hyatt hotels and 
bally resorts to open clubs in some of those establishments it 
already has a freestanding catch in cambridge mass and clubs in 
hyatt hotels in chicago princeton nj oak brook ill and palo 
alto calif 
the suburban and university locations are not by chance fields 
says they are targeting areas with high concentrations of tourists 
and relatively young upper middleclass people renos bally may 
be next on the catch list and fields says he is looking at 
locations in the los angeles area 
las vegas catch should gross just under 2 million a year at 
this point he says 
while it does not act as agent for young comics catchs other 
function is to manage their careers for from 15 percent to 20 
percent of the gross it can offer them booking at a number of 
clubs and promotion and exposure to the tv and hollywood producers 
caroline hirsch who runs carolines at the south street seaport 
in new york city says her 150seat room grosses over 2 million a 
year by running nearly full three nights a week and selling out 
four nights cover charges range from 10 to 20 depending on the 
talent the cover pays for the comics and advertising 
but a lot of the talent that started with her in a small 87seat 
room uptown are priced out of her market now people such as steven 
wright andrew dice clay pee wee herman sandra bernhardt and 
roseanne barr theyre on to the next part of their careers 
she says 
mostly she makes no attempt to censor the material but 
sometimes she feels she has no choice there have been times when 
people have gotten into aids jokes and i take a little offense to 
making fun of homosexuality in the vein of people dying she 
says i told one person to knock it off i dont like it dont 
do it 
but says hirsch a feminist theyre up there making fun of 
women and everything else thats ok 
for judy tenuta who started in a chicago blues club called 
kingston mines and now is on the road touring university clubs in 
texas religion is what works 
southern audiences love her tenuta says because these people 
want to be spanked with a bible belt and because of my religion 
judyism i shake them up 
she considers herself a living saint she says even 
though i came from a large catholic family i was always the 
isolated petite flower i always heard voices and the saints talked 
to me when i was little i was kind of forced to play the 
accordion at the same time i had six brothers so i had to practice 
in the closet while they watched the bears game i learned to play 
lady of spain in the dark 
each comic has his or her own material richard belzer a 
successful comedian now living in beverly hills says his allergies

bill liddell a retired seed company executive 
spends 10 months of the year growing food for the poor so far 
hes donated 100000 pounds of produce but he doesnt consider 
himself a dogooder just a veteran gardener enjoying a productive 
and fruitful retirement 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when bill liddell first contacted the 
connecticut food bank nancy carrington envisioned yet another 
guy with half a bag of tomatoes and cucumbers 
he presented himself very modestly a guy growing a garden and 
having some surplus to donate says carrington the food banks 
interim director 
but the tall rumpled man with scrambled white hair who showed 
up had 50 pounds of summer squash followed in short order by 350 
pounds more the squash harvested he moved on to sweet corn then 
tomatoes just after labor day he started on greens 
by the end of the summer of 1985 liddell had delivered 7000 
pounds of produce to the food banks warehouse in new haven the 
staff was impressed but he brushed off their thanks 
you aint seen nothing he said waitll next year 
a little better organized in 1986 liddell donated 16000 
pounds of homegrown vegetables 
in 1987 he topped 26000 pounds 
last year when the skies dried up and the sun beat down until 
the soil cracked like an overbaked cake liddell harvested 28000 
pounds of food from his rocky threefifths of an acre all of it 
destined for connecticuts poor 
but dont get the wrong idea about bill liddell just because a 
guy spends 40 hours a week on his 69yearold knees growing food 
for the poor and urges others to follow his example is no reason 
to brand him a dogooder 
im no mother teresa he says 
what he is is a veteran gardener who found himself facetoface 
with retirement a divorced father of four grown kids with no 
hobbies beyond the joys of coaxing fruit flowers and vegetables 
out of the recalcitrant earth 
as bill liddell sees it his giveaway garden is less an act of 
altruism than an act of survival 
ive known retired people with more money than they know what 
to do with but theyve had jaws down to here he says cupping a 
dirtstained hand over his belt buckle 
i started out to keep doing what ive always done it was not 
how can i help the poor but what can i do with all this oh i 
will give it to the poor 
until a neighbor suggested a local shelter as a recipient of his 
bountiful harvest i knew zero about the homeless 
one might assume that a man who spends so much time toiling on 
behalf of the hungry and homeless would have pondered the matter 
but i really dont think about it that much its too 
distressing 
its a national obscenity i shouldnt be having to do this 
stuff its not the way the ball game should be run 
end of discussion rather than ruminate about politics he 
prefers to contemplate the heft of a cabbage or the sweetness of a 
lettuce raising his voice to be heard over the locusts buzz 
it is difficult to lure liddell out from between the neat 
weedless rows of anaheim chilies and turnip greens guests find 
themselves conversing with the muddy soles of his shoes or his 
rapidly retreating back as he strides off in midsentence to yank a 
weed or pulverize a beetle 
hes very singleminded but a lot of fun to work with says 
jean heston one of liddells migrant workers 16 men and women 
who take turns helping plant weed or pick 
its one of the enjoyments of my retirement says heston 
who signed up after liddell made an appeal at spring glen church 
hes not a believer but he does have that instinct to do for 
somebody else he comes to church twice a year at the beginning to 
ask for volunteers and at the end to say thanks 
in the four years since he began liddell has seen his produce 
become a staple on soup kitchen menus around new haven the 
nations seventh poorest city in per capita income 
the city of 125000 has two soup kitchens a third lost its 
lease several months ago and runs a food pantry while searching for 
new quarters 
at the community soup kitchen which serves 75000 meals a year 
its hard to describe how much bill liddell means to us says 
coordinator david osullivan very often we get donations from 
all kinds of people and theyre all welcome 
but what do you do when someone shows up with five pounds of 
tomatoes and youve got 200 people lined up outside bill grows 
food in quantities we need and its all firstrate stuff 
the fruits of his labors were instrumental in helping the soup 
kitchen expand from soup and bread to full meals 
the connecticut food bank where liddell delivers his 
vegetables is at the heart of a network that distributes food to 
350 agencies around the state soup kitchens shelters and food 
pantries shop at the warehouse paying up to 12 cents a pound 
to cover overhead costs 
for the most part the food bank subsists on throwaways from the 
food industry carrington says liddell is our precedentsetter 
he grows prime lovely produce thats brought to the food bank 
within hours of being picked he stands alone as an example of how 
a simple idea can have a really big impact on people in need

liddell has donated 100000 pounds of homegrown tomatoes 
beans squash peas cabbages lettuce greens corn and peppers 
by his calculation his threefifths of an acre has served up 
about what the average home gardener might expect from an acre and 
a half but after 35 years working for asgrow seed co which 
donates seed and fertilizer liddell isnt your average home 
gardener 
for one thing his is a 10month operation beginning in 
february and continuing into december long after the hardiest 
volunteers have succumbed for the winter 
last year he called it quits 10 days before christmas after 
harvesting a hundred pounds of collards and kale according to his 
careful records the snow measured 3 inches that day 
with an eye toward bigger yields and greater efficiency he 
spends evenings scribbling in the large looseleaf notebooks he 
uses to record weather measure progress and plot strategy 
keeping track of yields is like keeping score in golf liddell 
says so far despite the blight that wiped out this years 
tomatoes hes ahead 
you can grow an awful lot if you manage your land right he 
says since space is limited he starts most of his seeds in trays 
moving them outdoors just long enough to finish them by 
limiting the time each vegetable spends in the ground he can plant 
several crops in a given spot over the season 
in midseptember he harvested turnips from the same patch that 
bore cabbages during the summer in another section kale followed 
collard greens which in turn supplanted lettuce 
plants have certain limits liddell says when a squash 
plant produces a couple of fruits its done its job the name of 
the game is to keep it going one way is by picking off mature 
leaves and working them into the soil alongside the plant if it 
doesnt run into mildew itll go on forever 
dense planting is another way to boost production you can 
crowd provided you know how to compensate with extra applications 
of fertilizer and water 
his three cats help with wildlife control although insects 
still claim their share maggots stole 40 percent of last years 
cabbages but a dusting of organic phosphate saved this years crop 
chemicalfree gardening is like riding a unicycle a neat 
trick if you can pull it off but a hell of a way to get to new 
york city 
liddell discovered the joys of the soil while tending a 
community garden he shared with other graduate students at yale 
university where he worked toward a phd in history during the 
late 1940s 
when teaching jobs proved scarce he went to work for what was 
then associated seed growers inc of new haven though he never 
billed himself as a plant scientist ive never had one hour of 
formal instruction he says proudly his customers were free to 
draw their own conclusions about doc liddell 
he spent much of his career as the companys advertising 
director putting together seed catalogs there aint no one 
around who takes better pictures of vegetables 
to accurately depict them he had first to grow them a 
sufficient excuse for buying a homestead on 1 acres atop a ridge 
in hamden just outside new haven 
the property came with a strawberry patch and a tractor with a 
plow attachment sold i also looked briefly at the house 
many of the photogenic peas and symmetrical squashes that showed 
up in subsequent catalogs came out of liddells garden a loosely 
run affair where weeds flourished alongside vegetables 
the garden was a source of food and relaxation cheaper than 
golf or a boat growing food gives you the feeling youre master of 
your own destiny it also gives you fresh vegetables that taste 
quite a bit different from the ones you can buy 
in time it became a laboratory of sorts with liddell taking 
advantage of his access to the companys plant scientists and 
experimental varieties of seed 
later as an asgrow consultant he traveled the country 
advising customers and picking up tips i have the sort of brain 
information sticks to he says like a harris tweed suit 
walking through a burdock field 
hed always intended to keep working indefinitely but heart 
problems and ensuing ailments persuaded him otherwise 
mindful of a friend who had retired only to die six months later 
of cancer liddell resolved not to make any plans when he retired 
in january 1985 he didnt look any further ahead than the 20 
75foot rows of beans he thought hed plant in the spring 
surviving four years has eased his fears somewhat though most 
of his plans still involve next years crops 
almost in spite of himself the man who insists hes no mother 
teresa finds himself looking at the bigger picture 
under his tutelage bethany united church of christ volunteers 
are in their third year growing cabbages peppers and beans on 
donated land and last year members of a congregational church in 
woodmont grew beans and cabbages on the churchs lawn 
i want to see a lot more of that kind of thing says 
liddell who dreams of a fullscale community effort to feed the 
hungry with a garden at every church and a station wagon full of 
church people picking up leftover vegetables from farm stands and 
delivering them to food banks 
my days in this are numbered but i could talk to people 
explain to them tell them whats possible all thats lacking is 
someone who wants to do it badly enough you also need expertise 
but if you have the enthusiasm you can learn what you need to 
know

in puerto rico which is experiencing one of the 
most serious aids epidemics in the western world a housewife and 
her husband have opened a home to care for unwanted children 
infected by the virus its called project love 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
marisa blay was content as a wife 
mother and homemaker until a dream changed her life and led her to 
become a guardian of some of the youngest and mostabused victims 
of aids 
in my dream i was in heaven and god told me i was going to 
hell because he had given me so much and i had never helped anybody 
in return she says 
the result is a nonprofit charity called proyecto amor or 
project love puerto ricos first home for newborns and toddlers 
who are not only infected with the aids virus but also have been 
battered neglected or abandoned 
i want the kids nobody wants mrs blay says 
she and her husband jorge who owns a swimming pool 
construction company used their savings to buy an 85000 home and 
halfacre lot for proyecto amor in the san juan suburb of rio 
piedras local businesses civic groups and individual donors 
provided paint furniture clothes and toys 
after months of untangling red tape with the health authorities 
the home which mrs blay runs with an assistant eight nurses and 
two cooks finally opened in july 
proyecto amor is a cheery bungalow surrounded by palms and 
broadleafed tropical plants with a swing set a slide and monkey 
bars in the back yard the rooms are airy and freshly painted the 
closets bulge with little dresses and shirts bright new cribs sit 
in tidy rows in the three bedrooms 
this is my bed 4yearold hilario says proudly hurrying 
over to a crib where he has left his teddy bears from the night 
before 
hilario carmen 3 and margarita 11 months were the first 
children brought to proyecto amor their names are changed here at 
mrs blays request 
twelve more children including a newborn whose drugaddict 
mother walked away from her in the hospital are expected in the 
coming months 
puerto rico with a population of 33 million is experiencing 
one of the most serious aids epidemics in the western world since 
1982 there have been 2940 reported cases of aids and authorities 
estimate 10 times that number may be infected with the virus 
mrs blay met carmen on a visit with her church group to a 
shelter for battered children at the age of 4 months carmen had 
been left alone in an apartment with two toddler brothers for about 
five days 
she was undernourished and had pneumonia and a fungal infection 
blood tests determined that she was hivpositive a carrier of the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
police picked up hilario at the age of 2 wandering the streets 
of old san juan the capitals historic district his mother was a 
chronic drug abuser and he was found to be an aids carrier 
he was taken to the same hospital where carmen was staying they 
shared a room there for nearly two years and now they easily play 
together around their new home very much like a brother and sister 
theyve been together so long they have to be together now 
mrs blay says its like theyre the only one the others ever 
had 
baby margarita was born to a drug addict with four other 
children and she nearly died of neglect 
she didnt smile she didnt cry mrs blay says when 
they told us about her they told us she needs a lot of caring she 
needs to be held a lot she had never been held 
proyecto amor is licensed as a shelter for up to 15 children 
ranging in age from newborn to 7 the puerto rico department of 
social services pays 2000 a month for each child which covers 
food medicine and a 5000 monthly staff payroll mrs blay says 
the blays who have two young children of their own retain 
title to the proyecto amor property and pay taxes and utility 
charges even though they do not live there mrs blay says they 
plan to build on more rooms if necessary and did not want to ever 
give up ownership for fear it would become too much like an 
institution 
i want it to work as a home full of love for these kids as 
long as they last she says 
hilario carmen and margarita all appear healthy now but 
medical statistics are stacked against them mrs blay says she is 
trying to prepare herself emotionally for their deaths 
i know that they have a sickness that will one day bring their 
lives to an end she says but i have faith they are going to 
last a long time 
the little boy and the little girl have told me theyre going 
to run this house when they grow up

puerto rico is experiencing one of 
the most serious aids epidemics in the western world 
since 1982 there have been 2940 reported cases of aids among 
the caribbean islands 33 million residents and authorities 
estimate 10 times that number may be infected with the virus 
among us cities only san francisco and new york reported 
higher per capita aids cases last year than the capital of san juan 
dr john rullan chief epidemiologist for the puerto rico health 
department estimates at least 16000 people and possibly as many 
as 30000 are infected with the aids virus across the island 
an islandwide survey of households to determine the spread of 
aids among lowrisk groups found hiv infection among one in every 
125 people in san juan a city of 11 million people the 
infection rate was 1 in 65 
the danger for children is that needlesharing drug abusers 
account for 58 percent of the aids cases reported increasing the 
risk of a rapid spread into the general population rullan says 
pregnant women who contract aids from bloodcontaminated needles 
or sexual contact with intravenous drug abusers can pass the virus 
to their unborn children 
a study in 1987 at san juans university hospital found 1 in 60 
pregnant mothers infected with the aids virus now all babies born 
in the capital are screened for the infection 
jose toro executive director of fundacion sida or the aids 
foundation says there were 64 cases of pediatric aids in puerto 
rico by the end of may most of the infected children are being 
cared for by parents and relatives toro says but homes cant be 
found for 20 to 30 of them

visitors to the old french colonial post of st 
louis in west africa are mostly businessmen and backpackers these 
days for good reason the city is literally falling apart but in 
a way that gives it a certain forlorn charm 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
st louis once the throbbing capital 
of a vast french west african empire has fallen on hard times 
the atmosphere is still there in fact the place reeks of it 
palm trees sway beige and pink colonialstyle buildings with 
wroughtiron balconies and flowering bushes line the narrow 
streets local residents in brilliantly colored dresses and robes 
go about their daily business under a tropical african sun 
one almost expects to see pithhelmeted french army officers and 
colonial administrators step from the governors palace or emerge 
from an afternoon aperitif on the veranda of the hotel de la poste 
more likely however is the appearance of a young senegalese in 
his adidas sneakers and running suit or perhaps a landrover 
filled with expatriate aid workers 
horsedrawn carts still clipclop through the narrow streets 
their drivers upon seeing an obviously foreign face will insist 
at some length that the visitor needs to be ambulated someplace 
the heart of st louis is on an island in the senegal river 
estuary it was from here that gen louis faidherbe ruled over a 
vast chunk of 19th century africa and pacified its natives the 
island is connected by the iron faidherbe bridge to the mainland 
and by two other bridges to the langue de barbarie a spit of land 
that separates the island from the waves of the atlantic ocean 
st louis has been abandoned bemoans marie jo durande who 
runs the 150yearold hotel de la poste 
there are a few tourists who do a circuit from dakar to the 
casamance in the south and st louis says ms durande in an 
evening conversation over coffee in a hotel dining room dripping 
with atmosphere 
otherwise its mostly businessmen and a few backpackers 
city officials are trying to spruceup the town and make it 
attractive to moneyed visitors a few of the principal historical 
buildings are being restored or at least repainted but the place 
is crumbling faster than it is being stuck back together which in 
itself gives it a certain forlorn charm 
a prime example of decay is the oncefine adamson museum on the 
south point named after 18th century botanist michel adamson 
author of the eightvolume natural history of senegal 
the museum is slowly being swallowed by dust examples of 
typical senegalese fauna rot in the display cases skins falling 
away stuffing ignominiously hanging out interesting exhibits of 
costumes artifacts tools and housebuilding methods of the 
countrys many ethnic groups are falling to pieces the explanatory 
labels frequently so yellowed they are illegible 
abdul haidara director of the center for research and 
documentation on senegal that houses the museum can only shrug his 
shoulders and plod on with the little money that is available 
st louis was founded in 1659 first as a headquarters for 
french companies plying trade in gum arabic ivory leather gold 
and slaves and later a colonial and political capital 
the english snatched it up on several occasions when european 
wars spilled over into africa for six months in 1693 from 1758 
to 1779 from 1809 to 1816 as a result several armstrongs 
oharas and pattersons are numbered among st louis families 
when the estates general met in paris during the french 
revolution st louis sent its famous cahier de doleances or 
book of complaints it was supposed to be from all of the people 
but in reality according to haidara it was a plea from the french 
and the mixedrace population 
ive searched in vain and not found the name of one true st 
louisian in the documents the historian said and the cahiers 
mainly demanded freedom of commerce which in those days really 
meant the slave trade 
at one time st louis served as the capital of the colony of 
senegal the capital of the federation of territories known as 
french west africa and capital of mauritania the city lost the 
first two titles to dakar the booming port with deeper calmer 
water farther to the south and the third to nouakchott built 
after independence in 1960 on a vacant piece of desert 200 miles 
north 
leaving the island of st louis and its one stoplight winking 
forlornly in a particularly useless spot one enters another world 
on the langue de barbarie a teeming african world of bustling 
markets aggressive colors and hot sand 
the langue is slowly disappearing 
moammar sourang president of the chamber of commerce says when 
his father wanted to walk to the sea he had to get up early in the 
morning to get there by afternoon now he says the atlantic is at 
his feet thats a bit of exaggeration but the land is wearing 
away 
turning south one passes through the guetndar district 900 
yards long by 400 yards wide and packed with 18000 people mostly 
fishermen the district and the people are poor st louisians 
consider them a crude lot but the whole area is vibrant and alive 
a contrast with the city which seems to be holding its breath

bat experts say the winged mammals have gotten a 
bum rap but you wont convince brett and bill whitney who have 
hundreds of them in their attic and they are not alone it seems 
evicting bats from that charming old house in the country presents 
some sticky problems 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ever since she was a child and a bat flew 
into her bedroom one night brett whitney has feared the little 
monsters now shes scared to death 
it all began when she and her husband bill bought a 
centuryold farmhouse in upstate new york not knowing the attic 
was a roost for 1600 of the nightflying creatures 
ive never heard of this many bats in a house before brett 
whitney says 
at dusk the sky blackens and fills with screeches as hundreds 
of bats pour out of the house spreading their wings and dropping 
like miniature parachuters before circling back up over their roost 
and heading for the nearby chenango river to feed 
i dont want to go up there mrs whitney says motioning 
toward the attic where the bats hang upside down from the rafters 
during the day like clusters of grapes 
but while many people like the whitneys are trying to rid their 
homes of bats conservationists are working to save them 
bat experts say the winged mammals are vitally important for 
insect control eating up to 50 percent of their body weight during 
each nocturnal feeding 
bats are some of the most misunderstood animals in the 
world says pat morton director of the texasbased bat 
conservation international theyve been shrouded for centuries 
in myth and misinformation because they fly at night and are 
needlessly feared 
her organization educates people about the importance of bats 
and with the return of batman to movie screens across the country 
this summer that job was made a little easier morton says 
requests for information about bats has doubled 
even brett whitney has been leaning on the caped crusader to 
help her deal with the thousands of bats in her home 
you have to have a sense of humor about it im buying all 
this batman paraphernalia she says pointing to the bat sticker 
on the window of her black renault i tell my friends im driving 
my batmobile to the bat house 
bats have been soaring around the planet for 60 million years 
at speeds of up to 40 mphtheyre not blind but use sound waves for 
navigation and to hunt for food 
despite sensational accounts of people being bitten by rabid 
bats such attacks are rare less than onehalf of 1 percent of 
bats contract rabies and those that do seldom become aggressive 
said dr stephen c frantz of the new york state department of 
health 
in fact bats do more for us humans than we think 
many flowers fruits and plants grown in the tropics including 
peaches grapefruit avocados and bananas depend on bats for 
pollination 
the bats instinctive radar system may lead to development of 
devices to help the blind 
man has also put bats to use in research for new contraceptives 
a unique hormone allows bats to give birth once a year the female 
is inseminated in the fall but fertilization is delayed until 
spring after a winter of hibernation 
even so having hundreds of bats living in your attic is enough 
to well drive you batty 
weve been fighting them for five years says robert 
harrington who has 2000 or so living in the attic of his north 
bay home on the shore of oneida lake 
harrington has spent almost 1500 trying to keep the flying 
creatures out of his attic but it hasnt done any good they can 
get through a hole the size of a dime he says 
ive sprayed ammonia bought cases and cases of mothballs and 
all its done is stunk up the house he says 
his two daughters refuse to sleep in the house they sleep 
outside in the familys truck 
there are no exact figures on how many houses in the country are 
infested with bats in new york state frantz knows of about half a 
dozen homes where more than 500 bats have moved in and taken over

<TEXT>
he says in most cases of major bat infestation the houses are 
old with dark and poorly ventilated attics something bats love he 
says the homes are also near water which attracts numerous insects 
and makes for a good nights meal 
frantz who works for a research arm of the state health 
department that studies rodent diseases such as rabies visits 
many of these batinfested houses to get information for his 
research 
once hes finished gathering data he shows the residents how to 
batproof their homes and he does a little handholding 
a lot of time these people just need someone to talk to and to 
tell them things arent so bad he says they need to know that 
their house is not unlivable they just have to get the bats out 
i guess you could say im the living batman 
brett whitney and her husband didnt know their house had bats 
when they bought it as is last spring intending to fix it up 
themselves now theyre living elsewhere 
mrs whitney says she remembers smelling a powerful odor when 
she walked through the house and recalls seeing animal droppings 
but she just assumed the previous owners had pets lots of them 
frantz says the bats were probably hibernating in nearby caves 
when the whitneys saw the house and returned shortly after the 
purchase agreement was signed 
the whitneys discovered the bats when bill peeked into the attic 
and saw foothigh mounds of bat guano 
i was shocked he says they were just hanging on the 
rafters it was like being in a cave 
he went immediately to the countys environmental officials 
when he mentioned the address they began nodding their heads 
they told me the house had been infested for years whitney 
says 
frantz says that because the colony is so large it probably 
dates back to the early 1920s whitney found bat guano beneath the 
insulation which was put into the house in the 1930s 
whitney a selfemployed roofer and contractor in the binghamton 
area plans to renovate the house himself 
he says the roof will have to be torn off and replaced and all 
the manure and urinesoaked insulation will have to be shoveled 
out of the walls and replaced with new insulation he says the 
ceilings and walls on the second floor will also have to be removed 
because theyre soaked with bat waste 
its not an unsolvable problem whitney says people are 
abandoning houses with bats i looked at the deeds in the county 
office and they show that this house has changed hands a lot i 
guess the owners discovered bats and ran 
but theres nothing wrong with the house it will take a total 
renovation but its structurally sound 
the whitneys who have two young children hope to move in this 
month 
frantz says the best remedy for ridding an attic of bats is 
waiting until theyre out for a night of feeding and then seal off 
points of entry and exit 
he says the best time to batproof is late fall through winter 
when bats are hibernating in caves he says batproofing should not 
be done in late spring and early summer because baby bats can 
become trapped inside and repopulate 
harrington says hes looking forward to getting some help in his 
private war from the oneida county community action agency inc the 
organization is preparing a grant application specifically to get 
money to help people batproof their homes 
harrington says hes pretty much batproofed the living areas of 
his home he says that before he did he used to get bats in the 
house all the time now he sees only a couple in the living 
quarters 
but at most of these homes the outside still belongs to the 
bats 
you can get a stiff neck from watching them come out of the 
house brett whitney says its like kids with a house facing 
mcdonalds

theres an international flavor to mackinac 
island during the tourist season jamaican waiters austrian cooks 
and mexican maids are imported each year to fill jobs some hotel 
operators say americans dont want its all perfectly legal under 
the us labor departments temporary certification program for 
aliens 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
here on this resort island in the 
great lakes jamaican waiters and austrian cooks square off in a 
soccer match 
jamaican independence day is celebrated on mackinac island with 
a dinner party thrown by the waiters islanders still talk about 
the time a tureen of goats head soup from the party wound up the 
next day on the serving table of one of the smaller hotels 
down on the wharf on a recent weekend the sugary smell of fudge 
mingled with that of horses and cyclists and tourists all 
perspiring under an unseasonably hot sun 
above it all at the cliffside grand hotel leroy champagnie 
smoothly waited tables by the golf course not a drop of sweat 
beaded his brow nor stained his white coat 
he doesnt mind the heat in fact hes quite happy i like 
the work he says in a thick jamaican accent 
champagnie is among 32000 foreign workers brought to the united 
states this year under the us labor departments temporary 
certification program to take jobs some employers claim americans 
either cant or wont fill 
these legal aliens cut florida sugar cane pick maryland apples 
and in michigan they wait upon the mostly white rich tourists at 
the grand hotel on mackinac island 
federal overseers acknowledge the program is a target for legal 
suits from any number of contestants including displaced 
americans and advocates for foreign laborers 
court cases go handinhand with this program said one 
administrator tom bruening in washington dc 
this year for instance apple growers in maryland virginia and 
west virginia were ordered to pay more than 2 million in back 
wages to 10000 underpaid jamaican field hands 
yet employers such as the grand hotel swear by the program 
service at the impeccable grand was getting well sloppy 
before the jamaicans arrived says owner dan musser 
ten years ago the hotel was hiring american college students 
who cared little about what to do with the wine cork i think our 
service showed it dramatically musser says 
even that kind of help was hard to find eight people answered 
the hotels advertisement in a detroit newspaper offering 335 an 
hour minimum to waiters waitresses and chambermaids 
five of the american applicants were hired only two showed up 
for work musser says 
every year we try to recruit but it is very difficult he 
says 
meanwhile in jamaica the grands headwaiter kenneth salmon 
sifted through thousands of applications for the same jobs the 123 
jamaican waiters austrian cooks and mexican maids the grand hotel 
hired not only wanted the seasonal jobs they are professionals who 
work the highclass resorts of their home countries the six months 
of the year they are not on mackinac island 
american waiters are not that hard to find says floyd borowski 
head of human resources for mackinac islands other large resort 
mission point but mission point does not recruit in detroit the 
hotel hires seasoned waiters from resorts in western florida and 
arizona the supply is there borowski says 
after seven years of using foreign labor the grands waiters 
now are almost entirely jamaican 
musser refuses to say how much his foreign waiters earn we 
like not to spread that around or how much of their wages are 
deposited directly in jamaican banks a requirement imposed by the 
british west indies central labour organization 
federal law requires that foreign laborers earn as much as their 
american counterparts and according to figures from the michigan 
employment security commission the grands waiters earn 335 an 
hour above the standard 252 but the hotels notipping policy 
eliminates the standard gratuity instead the grand waiters are 
paid 220 for each 40 dinner they serve 
champagnie expects to earn about 8000 for his six months at 
the grand hotel comparable to what he earns during the winter at a 
resort in jamaica where his wife and children stay someday 
champagnie hopes to save enough money to stop waiting tables and 
open a real estate company 
i took this for traveling experience to better myself in 
life says waiter george gaubault 27 from montego bay jamaica 
its a future here so i really work hard 
the grands jamaicans live as cheaply as they can on an island 
built for vacationers 
workers can buy their meals at a hotel cafeteria and the grand 
charges its employees about 125 a month to live in dormitories 
behind the hotel musser says 
rice kidney beans and soup meat butcher pat granning 
ticked off the usual shopping list for jamaicans at douds 
mercantile the only grocery on mackinac island and chicken they 
buy a lot of chicken 
now the bellboys of summer are going home the college kids who 
put on aprons and waiters jackets are back in school 
the grands jamaicans leave this month to return to their native 
jobs before the tourist season in the caribbean gets into full 
swing

stephanie beacham has shed her sexy armor for 
her new role as a plain tarttongued nun in nbcs sister kate 
its funny not to have all the armaments of looks sexuality 
and sensuality says beacham whose last role was sable the 
alluring vixen on abcs dynasty its strange to work without 
the designer gowns and the makeup people and hairdressers standing 
by 
i feel insecure that people dont flirt with me on the set 
anymore 
in the new comedy series shes an adventurous nun who 
reluctantly takes charge of a group of unruly orphans who have just 
driven out her predecessor its an uneven match as the kids 
quickly learn their new overseer is no pushover shes tough and 
has no tolerance for nonsense 
sister kate is not sexually aware beacham says its 
quite a turn for me after sable thats why it was so wonderful for 
me to do the pilot while i was still in dynasty but perhaps 
after this ill be longing to play a harlot 
im grateful that people can see that sable was an acting job 
and sister kate is an acting job and that im both and yet neither 
is me 
beacham maintains a home in england where her two daughters 
attend school but she has spent most of her time here since 1985 
thats when she became the glamorous scheming sable in the 
colbys a spinoff of dynasty the show folded two years later 
and she moved over to dynasty to match wits with alexis colby 
joan collins until its cancellation at the end of the past season 
she did the pilot for sister kate last spring on a weekend 
away from dynasty 
thats the reason i couldnt get a haircut and why kate has a 
ponytail she says its the only effective way i could think 
to do my hair i wear the ponytail now thats how decisions are 
made were in the roughandtumble of a sitcom television is just 
a very rushed process 
beacham says if dynasty had not been canceled she would have 
stayed with that show she thinks nbc checked with dynasty 
executive producers aaron spelling and esther shapiro before going 
ahead with the pilot 
i really didnt think nbc would pick up sister kate so i 
took off to bali she says i didnt know we were on the 
schedule until i got back to hawaii there were a lot of phone 
calls to every hotel in bali but i was in a mud hut 
bali is a long way to go to get away from the telephone but 
it was glorious the balinese dont watch tv so they had no idea 
who i was it was lovely to be with such friendly people 
she took a copy of shakespeares antony and cleopatra with 
her to bali in case neither dynasty nor sister kate worked 
out 
i was slowly working my way toward thinking of playing 
cleopatra she says its my private goal its my thing its 
a very hard role i dont know if i would ever dare 
beacham has come up with her own background for sister kate 
which she says she must have to get a real grasp on the character 
she has to have had a damaged childhood to lead the solitary 
life she says shes seeking peace and quiet and the security 
of the church shes taken her vows of obedience so she goes where 
the church sends her but i think she likes working with the 
children 
i was brought up by nuns i loved them but i was also 
frightened of them i was nearly 35 before i could slouch over a 
table sister philomena stuck a ruler down my back the tapping of 
the black boot fills me with dread even to this day

behind any good female impersonator there are a 
few good wigs not to mention an exotic wardrobe and a good supply 
of false eyelashes 
ask charles busch star of the lady in question the comedy 
spoof of 1940s movie melodramas in which he plays gertrude garnet 
thats garnay honey a brilliant concert pianist trapped in 
the schloss of a sinister german baron during the dark days of 
world war ii before the play is over gertrude discovers among 
other things happiness humility and a softer hair style 
turning busch into gertrude garnet has become an 
eighttimesaweek job since the play opened to favorable reviews 
last july at offbroadways orpheum theater 
he depends on a trio of dedicated coworkers to help create his 
female stage persona elizabeth katherine carr who did his wigs 
and robert locke and jennifer arnold who designed and are in 
charge of his clothes as well as the costumes of other cast members 
im a creature of habit busch was saying the other day 
my evening starts at 6 oclock when i go over every line i say in 
the play to warm up my voice i arrive at the theater at 7 and 
after chatting with everybody for about 20 minutes i get to work 
the makeup and eyelashes 325 a pair from lees mardi gras 
boutique go on first 
ive been doing this drag stuff for so long now that i get 
that makeup on quick says the lanky lowkey busch im better 
than any woman in a fire then i guess i put my costume on and then 
my wig and then my hat then im off for business 
a white gown originally made for busch by locke two years ago 
was the inspiration for the lady in question according to 
locke busch wanted something similar to a famous lounging gown the 
hollywood designer adrian created for katharine hepburn in the 
philadelphia story 
when busch tried the gown on he stood in front of a mirror and 
exclaimed i see it now an antinazi play and im a big 
parisian fashion designer we laughed about it then locke 
recalls now the parisian fashion designer eventually evolved into 
a concert pianist but the gown remained the same 
when you design for charles you are dealing with the same 
things that adrian and other designers did for crawford hepburn 
and garbo locke says these were not curvaceous women they 
had shoulders and sort of straightish figures in fact charles 
comes pretty close to garbos original measurements except for the 
waist 
carr first met busch in 1983 when she was hired as stage manager 
for his oneman show out of necessity she began to look after the 
wigs he collected for many of his early shows done at the limbo 
lounge in the east village 
when buschs first venture vampire lesbians of sodom moved 
offbroadway in 1985 to the provincetown playhouse where it is 
still running carr came along since then she has done all the 
wigs most of them various shades of red for all of buschs shows 
copper is charles color insists carr a cheerful woman who 
says she first became fascinated with hair as a child of the 60s 
when beehives and teasing were in he doesnt look good in 
blond 
carr locke and busch are big movie fans particularly of films 
of the 1940s the period of the lady in question their work is 
a collaboration with all of them making suggestions on what busch 
will wear 
charles will give you an idea of what he wants without taking 
your hand and putting it on the paper says locke who made sure 
busch had a different costume for each of the plays six scenes 
arnold did most of the mens clothing for the lady in 
question and also shopped for fabric shoes and accessories for 
the rest of the costumes 
then we worked together on construction arnold says we 
built these costumes from a lot of things i found in shops all over 
the city 
there are certain things that dont change in designing 
particularly for the wigs 
we have to soften charles forehead because he is a man 
carr says so we always do little wispy bangs and the hair is 
usually no shorter than the base of the neck because we want to 
make his neck look more streamlined and feminine 
carr buys the wigs from a shop in back of a liquor store on 19th 
street and then styles the long flowing hair herself there are 13 
wigs in eight different styles in the lady in question most 
cost between 20 and 50 and are made out of synthetic fiber from 
the far east carr tried using human hair but it didnt hold up as 
well and synthetics were able to look larger than life 
busch wears three different wigs in the show he starts with a 
copy of a 1940s roll three large surfer curls in front and 
rolled in the back then a barbara stanwyck takeoff and finally a 
loosely flowing hairdo that busch calls his norma shearer wig 
charles first two wigs are very stylized whereas the last one 
is soft to go along with the way the character is progressing 
carr says gertrude starts out as very hardboiled and becomes 
more human as the play goes on in the last act when she becomes 
this giving loving woman her hair is very soft 
carr washes the wigs periodically with shampoo and conditioner 
they are dried under a hair dryer and then combed 
backstage at the orpheum carr has a little table where she 
keeps a hair dryer shampoo combs brushes and assorted mousses 
and gels with which she touches up the wigs about three times each 
week 
sometimes wigs can be temperamental she says as they 
age they are harder to deal with and start losing their shine 
wigs dont last long usually after three months they are ready to 
be replaced and i have to start all over again

forty years after mao tsetung stood on tiananmen 
square on oct 1 1949 and declared a new china the nation is 
still searching for the ideal peoples republic and frequently at 
war with itself 
but china has much to celebrate this oct 1 its 40th national 
day emerging from a long past of foreign domination and internal 
decay it is a strong and independent nation a world leader 
the fireworks flowers and galas marking the anniversary are 
deserved recognition for a government that has managed to feed 
clothe and educate a nation whose population has swollen in these 
past four decades from 540 million to 11 billion a fifth of the 
entire world 
but the 40th year of new china has been chaotic and few people 
are in the mood to celebrate 
it has been four months since the army crushed the democracy 
movement in a spasm of bloodshed and martial law troops still 
stand guard to keep people off tiananmen square focal point of the 
uprising primed by students 
any thoughts of a military parade such as was held on the 35th 
anniversary were set aside no one wants to see tanks on tiananmen 
square again 
marketoriented reforms that have doubled the size of chinas 
economy and vastly improved the lives of millions over the past 
decade are in serious trouble the conservatives in power have put 
a hold on new reforms until the problems of inflation corruption 
and excessive growth can be solved 
zhao ziyang the former communist party leader who was the main 
proponent of reform was purged because of his liberal leanings 
the grand old man of reform deng xiaoping 85 appeared recently 
in public for the first time in months looking robust he had been 
reported to be seriously ill 
the government has acknowledged that after four decades of 
indoctrination it has failed to persuade many of the nations 
young of the virtues of communist rule since the student protests 
time devoted to political education has doubled and tripled in 
offices and schools the official press is again talking of class 
struggle a notion largely forgotten since the 196676 cultural 
revolution 
hou renzhi a 78yearold beijing university professor who 
experienced the pre1949 past and stood on tiananmen square to hear 
mao proclaim the birth of a peoples republic of china 40 years 
ago speaks for many older chinese when he says i believe in 
socialism thats the hope of china 
yet on the same campus young students shrug off the hours of 
political education they are given and whisper that they know the 
truth that they live under a government willing to train guns on 
its own people 
the many 40year retrospectives in the media couch their 
impressive figures on economic growth with reminders that all this 
is due to socialism 
only socialism can save china and there would be no new china 
without the communist party the peoples daily intoned in its 
series titled the rise of an oriental giant 
politburo member li ruihuan in addressing culture ministry 
officials responsible for planning this national day had told them 
the events should emphasize that public order has been restored 
and people are living and working in peace after the quelling of 
the counterrevolutionary rebellion on the bloody night of june 
34 in beijing 
he added we should explain with convincing facts that only 
socialism can save and develop china 
there is much to be said for chinas accomplishments since maos 
communists defeated chiang kaisheks nationalists in 1949 driving 
them off to taiwan 
life expectancy around 35 at the time has nearly doubled to 
69 cholera malaria smallpox plague and other infectious 
diseases have been largely brought under control 
the nation victimized by imperialism and gunboat diplomacy now 
sits permanently on the un security council in the place of 
nationalist china it joined the exclusive nuclear club by 
exploding its first atomic bomb in 1964 and has independently 
launched 25 satellites since 1970 
it has normalized relations with both the united states and 
lately the soviet union without leaning too heavily toward either 
except for the korean war and some brief border clashes with india 
the soviet union and vietnam it has rescued the chinese people 
from centuries of civil and international strife

incomes at 545 yuan 147 per person a year are triple those of 
1978 urban residents earn 1119 yuan 302 a person up 876 
percent over 1978 after deducting price rises 
daunting problems remain illiteracy has been cut from 80 
percent of the population to 20 percent but that still leaves 220 
million people who cant read and an underfinanced educational 
system that does little to encourage children to stay in school 
the government says 60 million people more than the entire 
population of france live below the poverty line of 200 yuan 54 
in annual income some in remote barren areas depend on government 
handouts for survival 
forty years after mao announced the end to exploitation of the 
people more and more people are asking whether the progress 
achieved has been worth the pain 
a million people in the beijing streets this past spring 
demanding democratic reform attested to disillusionment with the 
communist party which like other absolute rulers is tainted by 
corruption privilege and disdain for the common man 
after four decades china still lacks a legal system that 
protects people from the whims of politicians and police and the 
large majority have little or no control over where they will live 
or work 
the communist partys claims to infallibility have long been 
discredited by its excesses and miscalculations there was the 
antirightist campaign of 1957 that led to the persecution of 
tens of thousands of intellectuals the economic fiasco of maos 
leap forward in 1958 which was followed by crop failures and mass 
starvation and the tragic folly of the leftist cultural 
revolution which nearly destroyed a whole generation of educated 
chinese 
optimistic chinese point out that in the past decade under deng 
xiaoping the periodic political campaigns against spiritual 
pollution and bourgeois liberalization have been far milder 
with fewer arrests and less persecution than in the past but since 
the june military attack on protesters in beijing followed by a 
nationwide crackdown on dissent the mellowing of the masters seems 
less certain 
the party in turn is demanding patience saying it will put its 
divided house in order and guide the nation to prosperous stability 
if only people learn to forgo western political ideas and consumer 
habits 
jiang zemin the new communist party chief set the stage for 
national day 1989 by returning to yenan the stillimpoverished 
town of cave dwellers in northwest china where mao set up his 
revolutionary base in the 1930s and 1940s 
we should carry forward the yenan spirit of self reliance and 
hard struggle jiang said it will be hard to accomplish the 
socialist modernization drive without such a spirit

tears welling in her eyes hou bo stood in 
tiananmen square on oct 1 1949 snapping pictures of mao tsetung 
proclaiming the new peoples republic of china 
he represented the hopes and feelings of the chinese people 
said the only woman photographer on the official rostrum that 
bright fall day 
hou now 67 and her photographer husband xu xiaobing who is 
now 73 had been with maos communists since the famous caves of 
yenan in the northwest and took thousands of pictures during the 
193845 war against japan and the 194549 civil war against chiang 
kaisheks nationalists 
we lived with the red army in yenan she said we fought 
against the japanese then we went to tiananmen together i was so 
moved that my eyes were filled with tears when i took those 
pictures 
in january 1949 after the communists marched into beijing then 
called peiping hou was assigned as a photographer at the communist 
party headquarters in the city 
by mid1949 the communists had seized nanjing the nationalist 
capital and shanghai and were swiftly moving southward on oct 
1 with canton under siege and the nationalists fleeing to taiwan 
mao announced the founding of his new peoples republic 
hou said chou enlai who became chinas muchadmired premier 
arrived first on the tiananmen rostrum to assure that all the 
preparations were in order 
it was 3 pm when mao pushed a button raising the new national 
flag of five yellow stars on red before a crowd of 100000 
he told them 
the chinese people have triumphed over their enemies changed 
the face of their country and founded the peoples republic of 
china 
the chinese people one quarter of humanity have stood up 
from now on no one will insult us again 
among the dignitaries on the rostrum were zhu de commander in 
chief of the red army soong chingling sisterinlaw of chiang 
kaishek and later vicechairman of the chinese parliament and liu 
shaoqi the presidenttobe who would be persecuted to death during 
the cultural revolution of 196676 
tiananmen the gate to the old forbidden city or imperial 
palace was very shabby in 1949 hou recalled there was no 
elevator to the rostrum and the leaders scrambled up a steep 
stairway 
tiananmen square then enclosed in a red wall was about 
onefourth the size of its current 100 acres residential houses 
crowded the space outside the square now occupied by two massive 
archetypes of socialist architecture the great hall of the people 
and the history museum 
hou said the street running past tiananmen was far narrower than 
it is today and it took well into the evening before a procession 
of 300000 people could pass by the rostrum and see their new 
leaders 
the people did not want to leave her husband xu said 
they chanted long live mao tsetung long live the communist 
party and chairman mao shouted back long live the people in a 
clear resounding voice

on the surface life is back to normal in beijing 
the tanks are gone the bodies of the dead have been cremated 
the buses are running again the markets are bustling everyone 
goes to work 
one of the few visual reminders of a popular sevenweek 
studentled movement for democracy and the violence that ended it 
june 34 in tiananmen square are the soldiers at main intersections 
and on bridges throughout the capital 
the government is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the 
founding of the peoples republic of china on oct 1 1949 
but people are frightened 
theres no law anymore no legal protection a college 
student said they can just come and take you away 
many say they fear the soldiers who the government says are 
here to protect the people others fear the telephone hotlines and 
the boxes in every work unit to report people 
one man said anyone could put a neighbors name in the box and 
accuse him of throwing stones at soldiers and the police would 
come to arrest him 
he like many other people tells of friends who were hauled 
away beaten and interrogated 
beijing residents also worry about the miles of footage taken by 
the police and on cameras mounted on main streets during the weeks 
of demonstrations police now are studying the film and many 
people wonder if their faces will be found 
one old man who said he was persecuted during the 196676 
ultraleftist cultural revolution was asked by a foreigner how the 
police could find one person in beijings population of about 10 
million 
he waved his hand impatiently and looked away to show what a 
silly question he thought it was 
he did not participate in any protests never went to tiananmen 
square and even told young friends and colleagues not to go 
yet he is fearful 
in a room he and his friends once considered safe to speak 
freely he now speaks in low hushed tones we have to be very 
careful now 
a young intellectual who took a foreign friend to his home 
barely spoke until they reached his room there with a sigh of 
relief he said its ok you can say whatever you want here 
its safe 
but driven by a thunderstorm to the foreigners hotel room he 
was restrained 
later outside he said there were many things i was afraid 
to say in your hotel room who knows maybe those smoke detectors 
are actually bugs 
beijing university the site of animated open discussions about 
politics and the government in the spring is virtually empty of 
students now the start of the fall term was delayed until after 
national day to prevent disturbances during the 40th anniversary 
of the communist takeover 
but earlier in the summer the graduating class was still on 
campus undergoing several weeks of political study in contrast to 
their earlier eagerness many students politely backed away from 
talking to strangers about political issues 
the few who talked did so only in a remote corner of the campus 
away from others 
many chinese have learned it is best not to talk about the 
events of may and june 
whats the use said a student 
peoples hearts and mouths no longer are connected said the 
old man

underground economies typified by 
merchants selling goods on street corners are growing in south 
america draining billions of dollars in taxes and other revenues 
from financially troubled governments 
but peddling goods often smuggled from foldup tables on the 
streets is the only way many south americans can survive rising 
taxes eroding wages and entrenched bureaucracies 
the only way to earn enough to feed your family is to be 
selfemployed and ignore the government its red tape and its 
taxes said claudio tavares on a busy street corner in downtown 
sao paulo where he sells cheap disposable lighters and ballpoint 
pens earning five times what he did as an office assistant 
even selfemployed professionals such as doctors dentists 
lawyers and psychiatrists are going underground 
not far from claudio tavares corner a dermatologist in an 
elegant private clinic tells a patient his bill will be 50 new 
cruzados about 15 if the patient wants a receipt for income tax 
records without the receipt its 37 new cruzados 11 
the underground network provides millions with jobs or extra 
income but experts say the gross national product of many 
countries would grow 50 percent or more if underground economies 
were counted 
the informal economy dodges direct taxation but uses public 
schools and roads the first national bank of boston said in a 
recent newsletter distributed in brazil it avoids massive 
paperwork government inspectors and the burden of dealing with 38 
government entities to make a simple business decision 
the bank estimated an additional 30 40 or even 50 percent of 
extra economic activities are out there bubbling away and 
contributing to a much more sizeable gross national product 
economist nelson barrizzelli of the university of sao paulo sees 
government as the reason for the growth of the informal economy 
the government with its interventionist and highly 
centralized economic policies is a virus that attacks the 
countrys economic organism he said in an interview the 
informal economy represents the antibodies society creates to 
protect itself from this virus 
barrizzelli who recently concluded a study on brazils 
underground economy calculated it was about half the size of the 
countrys official gnp put at nearly 350 billion 
the brazilian government claims underground activity would raise 
the gnp by only 13 percent but carlos alberto ramos of the labor 
ministry said at least half the countrys labor force of 60 million 
is involved in the informal economy 
other latin american nations report similar figures 
in argentina the informal economy represents 40 percent to 70 
percent beyond the countrys official gnp put at 70 billion to 
90 billion about half of the nations work force of 12 million is 
believed to participate in the underground economy 
in ecuador about half of the countrys 33 million workers are 
involved in the underground economy which would add 15 percent to 
20 percent to the countrys 71 billion gnp 
perus 225 billion economy would grow 40 percent if the 
informal activity were included in official statistics 
hernando de soto president of perus institute for liberty and 
democracy a private economic research foundation said the 
informal economy in his country is a response to the mountains of 
red tape that discourage small businessmen from registering their 
operations 
it also is a reaction to the protectionism enjoyed by large 
business enterprises said de soto author of el otro sendero 
the other path a study on the underground economy that has 
become a best seller in nations across the continent 
throughout south america the most visible signs of the 
underground economy are the street vendors who sell just about 
everything from flashlights cigarette lighters and clothing to 
candies fruit and popcorn 
others collect bottles rags loose paper and cardboard to sell 
them to recycling companies 
they are people who could not find jobs in the formal economy or 
left lowpaying ones 
pedro morresi is one such dropout from the official economy 
he sells candy smuggled in from brazil on a street in montevideo 
uruguay 
it is hard to find work and when you do it doesnt pay enough 
to live he said i earn more doing this than as an employee 
in quito the capital of ecuador jose elias puente has made a 
living for 30 years weighing people on his scale near the 
presidential palace he earns 86 a month with which he has 
educated his nine children 
claudio tavares 30 joined the underground economy in sao paulo 
this year after quitting his job as an assistant in the personnel 
department of a construction firm where he earned the equivalent 
of about 100 a month 
i wanted to open a store to sell lighters and pens he said 
but the taxes i would have to pay and the bureaucracy involved to 
get a license made me abandon the idea 
today he sells his merchandise which is smuggled in from 
neighboring paraguay and takes home around about 500 a month a 
sum few wage earners make in brazil where the monthly minimum wage 
is 75 
because i dont pay taxes or pay rent my prices are at least 
50 percent less than those charged by stores selling the same 
product tavares said claiming he makes 100 percent profit on 
each item he sells 
but the biggest slice of the informal economy consists of 
selfemployed professionals who declare only a fraction of what 
they really earn economist barrizzelli said 
the dermatologist in the sao paulo clinic speaking on the 
condition of anonymity explained his reasons for working off the 
books if i declared all i earn i would fall into a higher tax 
bracket which would make it hard for me to make ends meet in an 
economy where prices rise almost daily 
inflation in brazil was 1084 percent in the past year and 
growth was practically zero that combination of recession and 
inflation has hit many south american countries and is one of the 
prime causes of the growth of the informal economy 
in brazil government figures show that in the first five months 
of 1989 industrial output dropped 36 percent while gnp declined 
24 percent in the first quarter 
despite those negative economic indicators the bank of bostons 
newsletter said energy consumption rose employment levels 
remained more or less steady and there was relative social 
stability 
the only explantion for this the bank said was the informal 
economy 
economist barrizzelli said he is convinced the informal economy 
will continue to grow and thrive as long as free market economic 
policies are not adopted in the region 
the informal economy represents the only functioning version 
of capitalism in latin america because it is the only sector where 
supply and demand is a determinant factor

a sizzling hot corvette a quartet of new 
japanese luxury cars federally mandated safety devices and an 
influx of fourdoor trucks from overseas top the new car and truck 
news for the 1990 model year 
while consumers are admiring all the new sheet metal and 
technological changes for the new vehicles they may find 
themselves hit with a dose of sticker shock prices for 1990 cars 
are higher and part of the reason is safety 
the federal government ruled that cars manufactured after sept 
1 1989 must have either supplemental air bags or automatic seat 
belts on the drivers side 
cars with air bags also must have manually operated lap and 
shoulder belts by the 1994 model year passive restraints either 
air bags or automatic belts must be standard for the frontseat 
passenger too 
all chrysler models built in the us about 15 percent of the 
general motors fleet and just less than half of fords will have 
standard air bags this year 
costs of the systems which manufacturers often decline to 
reveal could add hundreds of dollars to the price of a 1990 car 
each of the big three has blamed air bags for part of its price 
increases 
in the truck market importers were shaking in their boots in 
january and february worrying about whether the treasury 
department would classify their sportutility vehicles as cars 
with a 2 percent tariff or as trucks with a duty 10 times 
stiffer 
the department ruled in effect that fourdoor vehicles are 
primarily for passenger use making them cars and twodoor 
versions are mostly for commercial purposes making them trucks 
that ruling had a direct impact on the prices of the imported 
trucks which already had been hurt by a currency exchange rate 
that ballooned prices of their vehicles the number of twodoor 
sportutility vehicles from overseas will drop substantially 
in the united states chevrolet is making just 3000 of its new 
corvette zr1 cars which have engines packing 370 horsepower to 
push the sports car from 0 to 60 mph in 42 seconds the consumer 
is going to pay the price for all that power though the sticker 
on the zr1 carries a base price of 58995 
the muchpublicized entry of two japanese luxury car lines 
nissans infiniti and toyotas lexus has occurred the cars two 
from each division first were shown during january on the 
autoshow circuit they will be marketed through dealers separate 
than those franchised by their parent companies as are hondas 
acura cars now

offerings for the 1990 model year in the united states

ethanol added to gasoline will reduce carbon monoxide air 
pollution in cities by as much as 25 percent says the president of 
a consulting firm specializing in fuel blend quality control 
robert reynolds who heads downstream alternatives inc an 
indiana firm says that a 10 percent ethanolgasoline blend burns 
more thoroughly thereby decreasing auto emissions 
in addition it enhances the gasolines octane level which 
lessens the occurrence of engine ping or the knocking sound that 
results from using unleaded fuels which contain a lower octane 
value says reynolds a regular unleaded gasoline has an octane 
value of 87 compared to a 10 percent ethanol blend with a value of 
895 or 90 
reynolds notes that auto companies are experimenting with other 
alcohol fuels but ethanol is the only alterntive which blends 
easily with gasoline and needs no modification of cars ethanol is 
derived fom agricultual crops containing sugar or starch 
in the late 1970s alternative fuel programs were driven by 
fears of being dependent on foreign crude oil today both the 
automotive industry and consumer must look toward fuel alternatives 
as a means for selfpreservation reynolds says

the little antennas with the funny corkscrew 
parts are more and more noticeable on us highways these days as 
manufacturers add cellular phones as options to new cars 
business people who cant afford to be out of touch have found 
that beepers and pagers have limited ranges and to answer one a 
driver has to stop and hunt for a public telephone 
that can be tough while driving on an interstate highway 
somewhere in the middle of south dakota 
there are at least two dozen companies making cellular phones 
for cars and trucks some of the devices are powered by batteries 
and can be carried around others must be left in the car 
a mobile phone can be used while being held like one at home 
or in its rack usually mounted on the center console or 
transmission hump 
placing a call is pretty much the same as using a phone at home 
the signal goes through a cell and then is relayed by microwave 
to its destination whether its another mobile phone or a 
stationary one 
making the call is getting easier 
gte mobilenet inc is marketing a voiceactivated phone that 
recognizes two different voices and can dial and cut off telephone 
calls without anyone touching the handset it also can be used like 
a conventional mobile phone 
a tiny microphone mounted on the post between the windshield 
and drivers window picks up preset commands and places calls 
a lot of cars in fortune 500 companies have cellular phones 
and company policy says you have to use them on the hook says 
sam mcdaniel marketing manager for get mobilnet 
some telephone numbers can be programmed in so the phone will 
dial it on a oneword command like office safeguards are 
built in to prevent the phone from dialing the number if the word 
comes up in casual conversation 
if you have your wife with you and have a girlfriend named 
jane and you say jane you could be in trouble mcdaniel said

in the old days the am radio in the big 
nineseat station wagon would fade in and out nearly as often as 
the odometer clicked over another dozen or so miles 
no more radio stations are different these days so are cars 
and their audio systems 
a car equipped only with an am radio is a rarity now some cars 
come with amfm radios cassette tape players or compact disc 
players as standard equipment and theres everything in between 
as americans take more and more to the highways so do their 
audio tastes inside any car on the road someones probably 
listening to some jazz oldies easy listening gospel or 
headbanging rock n roll music they also may be learning a 
foreign language or how to be more forceful in business 
theres a good chance some of that is coming from a tape or disc 
player 
manufacturers whose brand names have been in living room systems 
for years are showing up more and more in cars an trucks sony 
bose aiwa and pioneer are only a few 
many vehicles are coming with a radio cassette player and four 
speakers as standard equipment others come with options boosting 
power measured in wattage 
all that can make the systems attractive to thieves 
to deter them manufacturers make systems that can be removed 
from the passenger cabin and stowed in the trunk or others that 
blend into the dash board 
other ways to keep the cars stereo system where it should be 
include alarm systems with window stickers warning passersby or a 
registration system with an identification number on each radio 
tape or disc player 
then there are some folks who have special love affairs with 
their custom designed systems like peter hoffsaess of los angeles 
who owns a plymouth sapparo 
when he cranks his car up and turns up the radio its kind of 
difficult to breathe and swallow he says 
hoffsaess has equipped his car with a system that can put out 
143 decibels through two dozen speakers accelerating jet planes 
are quieter 
hoffsaess gets defensive when somebody challenges the wisdom of 
putting all that sound in a car 
whos anybody to tell me whats too loud he says i mean 
what might be too loud for one person might not be loud enough for 
another person 
the cost of volume doesnt come cheap hoffsaess shelled out a 
cool 12000 just for the stereo thats about the cost of two 
wellequipped yugos each with an electronic digital amfm cassette 
sound systems

read any good tires lately 
ok so the sides of tires arent the most compelling reading 
they still provide a lot of information that can help consumers be 
sure they have the right tires on their cars or trucks 
all the words letters and numbers on the sides of tires can be 
as easy to follow as the family tree in wuthering heights for a 
typical consumer 
each tire carries the manufacturers name and registered name of 
the model of tire usually thats in big letters sometimes in 
raised white letters thats easy to understand 
a little more difficult perhaps but also in large print is 
the size designation this can start with a p for passenger 
tires or lt for light truck then there are three numbers the 
tires width in millimeters 
after a slash there are two other numbers representing the 
height of the tire from the tread surface to the rim measured as a 
percentage of the tires width for example 75 the letter r 
for radial b for bias belted or d for bias only tires 
follows to indicate the design of the tire after that is a 
twodigit number showing the size of the wheel it fits measured in 
inches 
continuing along that line are designations of whether the tire 
meets the tire and rim associations snow and mud specifications 
noted by the letters appropriately mamps 
the last bits of information closest to the tread are ratings 
for tread wear traction and temperature 
tread wear is rated by a threedigit number with 100 as a base 
for example a tire with a 340 rating will last 34 times 
longer than a tire with a 100 rating under the same driving 
conditions 
traction is rated on an abc scale with a being the best 
traction at 40 mph on a wet surface temperature ratings also are 
on an abc scale with a being the mostresistant to the effects of 
temperature at 85 mph 
now the fine print comes in nearly all of the rest of the 
information is printed on the tire nearest the wheel rim 
the longest section involves tire safety warnings about 
inflation and what can happen if a tire is underinflated or 
overinflated 
there are descriptions of what the tire is made of its design 
the number of plies in the tread and sidewall whether the tire 
needs a tube or not and the loads the tire can handle 
also on the side of tire is the recommended pressure when the 
tire is cold that information often is carried in booklets that 
come with the car 
much of that information is required by law 
other information not required in the us but included are 
markings for common market countries the code includes references 
to load capacity speed the country giving approval and the tire 
size and type all in letters and numbers 
all the numbers may not be easy reading but following the 
manufacturers recommendations in inflation and care can prolong 
the life of a tire

would you buy a used car from a saleswoman 
helene lawson found the question intriguing enough to choose it 
as a topic to complete her doctorate in sociology at loyola 
university in chicago 
i found myself wondering how a woman got into auto sales 
something i perceived as an allmale domain she said after a 
female salesperson sold her a 1968 mazda a car the sociologist 
really hadnt intended to buy 
her research showed that women car sellers ranged from 23 to 52 
years of age onethird were single parents primarily divorcees 
and more than onethird of the sample had school age children 
a third of the women are married she reported they cited 
the support of their husbands in sharing the responsibility of 
caring for the children 
their previous occupational backgrounds varied from socalled 
pink collar backgrounds such traditional female jobs as 
beauticians secretaries and housewives to teachers and social 
workers or artists and photographers 
many of the women she studied played out feminine stereotypes to 
sell cars said lawson 
they take on roles men expect of them the matronly 
grandmother or mother or they act silly or dizzy she said 
these are the roles that men accept and feel comfortable with 
she found that some older men simply will not buy a car from a 
woman they feel intimidated and uncomfortable divulging personal 
financial information to a female theyll try to stump the female 
salesperson asking her tough technical questions about the cars 
displayed on the showroom floor queries they wouldnt pose to a 
man 
on the other hand women love to find women on the sales floor

some windshields can melt an icy coating cut the 
suns glare or resist shattering when rocks hit them at 50 mph 
but theres one thing common to all windshields and it can 
interfere with driving dirt 
but cleaning windshields may cause longterm problems if it 
isnt done properly says a fairleigh dickinson university 
professor 
oswald haase who teaches physics at the rutherford nj 
school has studied windshield wear and how light is diffused by 
the grooves and pits left behind by dirt or flying pebbles 
windshield washers and wiper blades may take away some dirt but 
the abrasion may leave behind scratches that can cause problems 
down the road 
they help you see in the short run but louse it up in the 
long run haase says 
the research done during the last four years in sweden and 
cologne west germany showed scratches and pits caused significant 
vision problems in less than 2 percent of the windshields tested 
while dirt accounted for serious problems in about 25 percent 
he says it isnt clear yet if recent automobile design trends 
making windshields less vertical will help move dirt and small 
objects over the car or if longer wiper blades needed by larger 
windshields will hurt 
the fact that the windshield is fitted is good you have to 
get a better windshield washer he says 
the volkswagen beetle was the best he said because of its 
small windshield and short wiper blades while offering no 
specifics haase says washers that spray a wide stream of fluid or 
those integrated into wiper arms would help

on one battery and then the other end to the positive terminal on 
the other battery clamp one end of the black cable to the negative 
terminal on the good battery connect the other end of the black 
cable to the engine block of the vehicle with the bad battery 
being sure its away from the fan 
start the vehicle with the good battery then the vehicle with 
the bad one 
disconnect the cables in reverse order of connection

the temperatures beginning to drop and in some 
places leaves are about to begin their change to autumn hues 
that means its time to take a few moments and spend a little 
money now to avoid long hours of inconvenience and a big repair 
bill later in the winter when drivings less fun than it has been 
for the past several months 
here are some tips for getting your car into shape before the 
first leaves fall 
have the cooling system flushed if it hasnt been in the last 
two years cleaning the system and replacing antifreeze in the fall 
helps the car run smoothly in the winter if the cooling system has 
been flushed in the last two years have the potency of the 
antifreeze checked 
inspect the battery terminals and clean them if necessary be 
sure the battery has a good charge 
be sure your vehicle is properly tuned a welltuned engine 
starts easier in lousy weather and runs better than a poorly tuned 
engine 
check windshield wiper blades and switch to heavyduty ones if 
driving in snow and ice is anticipated 
get an oil change it only takes a few minutes and many 
businesses will check levels of other fluids in the vehicle at the 
same time 
during winter frequently check the level of windshield washer 
fluid 
before cold weather sets in check the heaters operation it 
may get a little warm for a moment or two now but thats better 
than starting a long trip in freezing temperatures and finding 
theres going to be no heat for you and your passengers 
inspect tires for tread depth and uneven wear frequently check 
inflation pressure 
check the brakes and remember that cold weather snow and ice 
increase stopping distances

for the comfort of the behind of the one behind the wheel a 
swedish automaker has some advice on adjusting the seat to fit 
yours 
saabscania offers these tips for sitting pretty while on 
the road 
move the seat up or down until the top of your hip line is 
just below the lowest part of the steering wheel 
adjust the seat forward or backward until the clutch or brake 
can be fully depressed without lifting your left buttock off the 
seat cushion 
sit completely back and adjust the angle of the seatback 
until the whole length of your back is pressing against the back 
rest sitting too upright puts too much stress on the lower back 
and upper thighs leaning too far back puts stress on the neck and 
shoulders 
adjust the lumbar support until there is a gentle awareness of 
a supporting pressure in the lumbar area 
adjust the steering wheel until your arms are slightly bent 
with hands at the 10 and 2 oclock position 
the advice comes from terry moule an osteopathic consultant and 
sports injury specialist 
despite the amount of time americans spend in their cars they 
have not been taught how to use seats correctly and therefore dont 
spend the necessary few minutes to achieve the correct driving 
position says moule 
its easier to blame your aching back on your car seat design 
rather than take the time to learn all the benefits of 
welldesigned car seating and adjust the seat until it fits you 
properly

be warned coming from japan are 6inch model cars that move at 
the equivalent in scale to 320 mph probably through your living 
room 
problem is these hyper cars move so fast that your kids may 
have trouble playing with them 
its a real problem conceded kenneth a bloom vice 
president for finance at matchbox international ltd one of the 
marketers you put it down on the rug and let it go and its 
just going to shoot off and keep going until it hits something or 
flips over 
toymakers hope to solve the problem by selling plastic track 
that kids can put together in their bedrooms garages or backyards 
in japan arcades have installed elaborate tracks that junior 
racers pay to use 
the 5 to 12 cars powered by two or three aa batteries move 
at actual speeds of about 10 miles per hour but in comparison with 
their scale which is 132 of a fullsized car they easily outrun 
formula i racers 
the toys are just now hitting the retail stores being marketed 
by matchbox hasbro inc mattel inc and tonka corp 
the cars come in numerous designs including some with 
interchangeable motors and gear boxes although they are being 
marketed under various names such as hyperdrivers and record 
breakers most versions are made in japan and are nearly identical 
in construction 
carhenge a circle of junked halfburied cars that mimics

in an effort to salvage the tourist attraction the alliance 
city council has voted to pursue a change in zoning laws allowing 
carhenge to remain intact 
critics argue it should be torn down because it is unsightly 
but council members decided to review the specialuse permit 
granted to its creator james reinders of houston after he bought 
the land reinders a former alliance resident contends that the 
monument is a work of art 
before the councils vote about a dozen citizens appeared at a

janet steele executive director of the alliance area chamber of 
commerce told the council that carhenge helps attract visitors to 
the community in northwestern nebraska and a supportive letter was 
submitted to the panel from state tourism director peggy briggs 
 
beijing ap five years after production of chinas red flag 
limousine was suspended a factory is turning out 10 of the luxury 
cars in time for the 40th anniversary of communist rule according 
to an official report 
the red flag or hongqi limousine first produced in 1958 for 
years was used only by highranking officials the government 
ordered production halted in 1983 saying the car used too much 
fuel 
last year the state said production would resume without 
mentioning the fuelconsumption problem 
most of chinas leaders have stopped using the red flag which 
some say was slow to start ran too slowly and was too big for 
narrow driveways

daily said the red flags were given to lower level officials or 
sold to private businessmen

using imported cars as part of costcutting measures and the no 1

driving with the gas gauge on empty isnt a good idea and not 
just because you may find yourself stranded 
when too little gasoline is in the tank condensation can form 
literally watering down the gas thats there that can cause 
starting problems hesitation on acceleration and poor overall 
performance 
keeping a maintenance record for your car can pay off 
in addition to being a handy reference if you want to complain 
to a service department about a job you think was poorly performed 
the log can be a selling tool too 
if you can show a potential buyer that you have taken care of 
your car there may be less concern by the purchaser of getting 
stuck with unseen problems 
here are some things which may indicate a problem with your 
brakes according to allied aftermarket division which markets 
fram bendix and autolite products 
a spongy feeling in the pedal this may indicate that air has 
gotten into the brake fluid making it less efficient 
the pedal throbs when pressed throbbing can be caused by a 
problem with brake drums or rotors drums press against rotors to 
slow the car and when the contact surfaces are uneven throbbing 
occurs 
brake fade the driver notices that it takes longer to slow 
from one speed to another when using the brakes it often occurs 
when there is frequent braking during rush hour traffic situations 
heat is the most common reason for fading 
tough drunken driving laws are turning into good news for 
limousine operators according to the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association 
the mvma says about half of the revenues collected by limousine 
operators come from business uses but lots of folks are leaving 
the driving at party time to someone else 
it can be cheaper and safer for a group of friends to rent a 
limousine for the night forget about parking charges and stay away 
from steering wheels after having a few too many the organization 
says 
what a difference a hemisphere makes 
there are five vehicle dealerships in moscow idaho selling 
subaru jeep toyota chevrolet volkswagen ford mercury buick 
pontiac cadillac nissan and gmc trucks 
in moscow soviet union there are just three but they have 
hundreds of service bays apiece 
households with more than one car in the driveway or garage 
arent as rare as some may think 
the motor vehicle manufacturers association says about 30 
percent of all households in the united states have two vehicles 
and about 9 percent have three or more 
motorists who run red lights in new york city may find 
themselves on something like candid camera 
the citys police have set up automated cameras at busy 
intersections in the big apple to photograph the license plates of 
motorists who go when they should stop 
offenders could be fined up to 50 but no points will be 
charged against their licenses 
the rebates that car buyers see advertised these days arent 
anything new 
the original henry ford offered rebates of 40 to 60 to each 
purchaser of a model t but there was a catch 
those rebates would be available only if ford sold more than 
300000 of the cars between august 1914 and august 1915 these 
days manufacturers impose no such restrictions 
you can play with your toy cars at any age if you look at the 
models as objets dart 
and a new york gallery lart et lautomobile has a collection 
to fit your artistic tastes such as a 25000 madetoorder 
bugatti royale coupe napoleon the gallery also stocks posters 
books sculptures paintings badges and other automobilia with 
more modest pricetags 
gallery owner jacques vaucher raced formula iii cars in the 
united states and his native france before opening the gallery 
eight years ago 
 
driver abuse is the most common reason for premature wear and 
breakdowns on automobiles according to an industry newsletter 
the newsletter runzheimer reports on fleet management surveyed 
117 automotive fleet managers and 62 percent of them blamed 
breakdowns on the drivers themselves twenty percent blamed 
manufacturing defects for breakdowns 
when asked which is the most common car component to fail 36 
percent said it was the brakes followed by body integrity 13 
percent and the engine 13 percent

the economy will continue to grow through 
1990 forestalling until at least 1991 a recession that many once 
forecast for next year top business economists said today 
nearly twothirds of the 72 forecasting experts surveyed by the 
national association of business economists said they think a 
recession is not likely before 1991 a third of them said a 
recession will not arrive until 1992 or later 
if the expansion does continue until that time the 
association said it will set a record for the longest expansion 
in either war or peacetime in the history of the united states 
the nations economy currently is enjoying record peacetime 
growth which will be seven years old in december the longest 
expansion ever occurred in the february 1961december 1969 period 
that included the vietnam war 
the survey was being presented at nabes annual meeting in san 
francisco a copy was made available here 
in its previous quarterly survey last may nabe found that 63 
percent of the respondents expected the next recession next year 
now only 37 percent foresee a serious downturn by 1990 
in todays survey 32 percent said the next recession would not 
begin until 1991 another 14 percent said 1992 and 17 percent said 
1993 or later twelve percent said a recession would arrive before 
years end and 25 percent expected it next year 
at the time of this writing the fed seems to have engineered 
the muchawaited softlanding the report said referring to 
the continued but slower economic growth sought by the federal 
reserve as it seeks to control inflation 
economic growth has dropped to below 3 percent inflation is 
dropping and interest rates are easing it continued a 
majority of nabe panel members expect this soft landing to continue 
through 1990 with real growth at a level fast enough to keep the 
unemployment rate below 6 percent but slow enough to keep 
inflation in the 44 percent range 
however the survey responses did imply a slowdown in economic 
growth in the last half of this year 
the forecasters median growth rate for the gross national 
product the nations broadest measure of economic health during 
the final three months of 1989 is 21 percent that compares with a 
31 percent growth in the first half of the year 
the survey found a substantial majority expect growth to 
continue at about the same 21 percent rate throughout 1990 
at the same time the economists scaled back their inflation 
forecast to 5 percent for the octoberdecember quarter down from 
53 percent in the may survey the median forecast for inflation in 
1990 is 43 percent 
progress on the nations twin trade and budget deficits 
meanwhile was expected to continue 
the economists median forecast for the trade deficit was 110 
billion this year and 100 billion in 1990 compared with 1228 
billion in 1988 
the survey found the survey panel expects a 150 billion budget 
deficit this year and 135 billion in 1990 compared with 1551 
billion last year the forecast is far from the 100 billion 
grammrudman deficit reduction ceiling mandated for fiscal 1990 
other forecasts in the survey included 
industrial production is expected to grow at 31 percent this 
year slowing to 17 percent in 1990 
construction of new homes and apartments is forecast to average 
142 million units this year and 145 million units in 1990 
car and truck sales are expected to total 15 million this year 
and before falling to 147 million in 1990

lomas financial corp says it was forced to seek 
federal bankruptcy protection after failing to work out an 
agreement with creditors 
chairman jess hay said it became apparent last week that the 
company was at least two or three weeks away from an agreement 
with holders of its senior debt 
that may not sound like much time but they are critical days 
in our efforts to restructure our business hay said we 
decided the bankruptcy court provided a better forum for proceeding 
with our fundamental restructuring 
lomas financial filed for protection under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy laws on sunday in new york where most of its 
creditors are based the petition involves only the parent company 
and some land developing subsidiaries of lomas which has more than 
6 billion in assets and operations in mortgage banking and real 
estate finance 
the action freezes payments on a total of 21 billion in debt 
hurt by real estate problems and a slowdown in mortgage 
lending lomas had reported a 564 million loss in fiscal 1988 and 
a 3045 million loss in the year that ended june 30 
hay said the firms operations should not be affected by the 
action and he anticipates no material staff reductions 
in june lomas announced a major restructuring program that 
sought to reduce its outstanding debt by nearly twothirds from 
57 billion to about 2 billion the company already had reduced 
its total debt by 19 billion from the sale of assets 
lomas missed a 145 million payment on its senior debt on sept 
1 and the creditors could have forced the immediate repayment of 
all senior debt but talks had been continuing between lomas 
officials and the debtholders

about 5400 workers at timken co steel 
plants walked off the job today after rejecting the latest contract 
offer 
the workers voted overwhelmingly over the weekend in canton 
columbus and wooster to reject the fouryear proposal and strike 
the company said jack nichelson president of united steelworkers 
of america local 1123 in canton 
todays walkout began at 1201 am 
timken a manufacturer of speciality steel and tapered roller 
bearings is the largest employer in northeastern ohio with about 
7000 workers including whitecollar employees not in the union 
we are very disappointed that the united steelworkers did not 
accept the company proposal timken spokesman james mulder said 
late sunday the wage and benefit package offered was outstanding 
compared to that provided by others in the bearing and steel 
industries 
no new talks have been set 
nichelson said union members top concern was the companys 
pension plan 
the minimum pension for a worker who retires with 30 years 
service is 592 a month the company had proposed raising that to 
667 a month but the union was pushing for 1000 a month 
nichelson said 
timken also offered 43 cents an hour in a costofliving 
increase and a pay increase of 25 cents an hour in the first year 
to be followed by an average increase of 25 cents an hour in the 
second year and 50 cents an hour in the third year there would be 
no wage increases in the final year of the contract 
the average hourly wage at timken now stands at 1183 
nichelson said

stanley w vogel who presided over 
the growth of casual corner from a small sportswear shop to an 
800store chain died in a connecticut nursing home he was 71 
vogel who died saturday and his partner charles e carples 
took advantage of a trend toward sportswear that swept the country 
and helped revolutionize retailing by providing easy access to the 
clothes 
in 1950 vogel who was a buyer for the former brownthomson 
retail store in hartford and carples a manager at sageallen amp 
co inc opened their first store in west hartford 
carples said sportswear was a new concept whose time had come 
when the first casual corner opened 
it was only natural that people were dressing more casually 
and were less formal in their approach to life because of the move 
into suburbia carples said casual corner was designed to 
appeal to that 
the two men strove to create an atmosphere at casual corner far 
removed from department stores 
we wanted to create something more fun than work carples 
said and we felt we could create a store that would be really 
fun to work in and shop in where both customers and sales people 
coultners fun 
in 1950 casual corner did 45000 in business in 1960 it 
grossed 2 million and in 1969 annual sales were 14 million 
in 1970 vogel and carples sold their 20 casual corner stores to 
us shoe corp based in cincinnati and vogel became president of 
the corporations specialty retailing division vogel retired in 
1980 
in 10 years at us shoe he helped set up a division that now 
has about 1500 stores with 15000 employees and 1 billion in 
sales

opec ministers worked behind closed doors today to 
try to restart stalled talks over whether they can lift oil 
production and still keep crude prices steady 
algerian mines minister sadek boussena one of the mediators in 
the discussions of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries left early to return to algiers for a legislative 
meeting 
hurrying to his car he said he had no statement to make but 
wished his colleagues much success 
we havent agreed on anything yet ecuadors oil minister 
diego tamariz told reporters were still analyzing the 
situation 
boussena has been pressing the ministers to maintain their 
production ceiling at the current level in an effort to lift crude 
prices by a dollar up to the cartels target of 18 a barrel 
but a senior algerian delegate who demanded anonymity said 
we are willing to consider an increase in the ceiling if that 
doesnt mean a decline in the price that is our basic position 
other countries want to raise the supply cap from the current 
195 million barrels a day in the last three months of the year 
they argue demand is strong enough to absorb the increase without 
upsetting prices 
ministers of the 13nation cartel met for several hours sunday 
evening before breaking up to try to resolve their differences 
privately one official leaving the meeting said the meeting was 
going badly 
it seems that the ceiling is the imminent problem said 
iraqi oil minister issam alchalabi 
according to an opec official who did not want to be identified 
by name a majority of the countries including iraq nigeria 
kuwait and the united arab emirates want an increase in the 
ceiling they are at odds though over how to divide up the 
additional supply 
chalabi said he favors an increase in the supply cap with the 
extra amount shared proportionately among all 13 each would get a 
certain amount added to its individual supply quota 
kuwait and the united arab emirates already are pumping beyond 
the quotas assigned them in june 
a smaller group including algeria and libya wants to maintain 
the ceiling at the current level to ensure that the group reaches 
its price target 
the ministers are described as very insistent on and locked 
into their positions 
opec secretarygeneral subroto told reporters we are still 
deliberating about the best way to achieve our goal 
he likened the oil ministers to hikers carrying maps and 
compasses 
but there seems to be some discussion about the route to reach 
that objective he said the pro con and the handicap of the 
terrain are being evaluated 
he said the objective is point x everybody agrees the one 
goal is point x 
he declined to say more but the goal is certain to be the 
benchmark price 
subroto has predicted demand for the cartels oil would reach 22 
million barrels a day in the octoberdecember period 
the cartels executive body according to sources has said 
prices could reach 18 a barrel even if the cap were lifted to as 
much as 215 million barrels a day but only if everyone agreed to 
abide by his quota 
chalabi suggested the ministers had given up any attempt to 
solve the problem of finding a more acceptable way to divvy up 
production shares and set individual quotas 
we should address the problem of the quotas if we can he 
said we will continue the discussions in the meantime from now 
until november their next meeting is scheduled for late november 
in june some ministers said they would try to settle the quota 
issue at this meeting there was no indication when the meeting 
would end 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said he would 
leave tuesday for japan 
the talks are officially held by a monitoring panel made up of 
algeria indonesia iran iraq kuwait nigeria saudi arabia and 
venezuela 
the other members gabon ecuador libya qatar and the united 
arab emirates were invited to attend

despite a higher per capita income the japanese 
have less purchasing power than consumers in other advanced 
industrial countries because japans prices are so high the 
economic planning agency says 
in an annual report released monday the agency estimated that 
prices in tokyo were 39 percent higher than those in new york and 
47 percent higher than those in hamburg west germany 
its conclusion was based on a survey of prices of 400 selected 
items in the three cities 
the survey showed that housing rent and food subject to import 
restrictions were particularly costly in tokyo but consumer 
durables such as automobiles were not much more expensive than in 
the other two cities it said 
the agency said 35 ounces of beef cost 86 cents in new york and 
97 cents in hamburg last november but cost 275 in tokyo 
a videotape recorder however cost 471 in new york 682 in 
hamburg and 504 in tokyo 
the agency said prices of imported brand items which should 
have fallen as the japanese yen rose in value against other 
currencies had remained very high relative to their prices in new 
york paris and dusseldorf 
because of the yens rise a sudden increase in japanese 
domestic prices quoted in dollar terms is unavoidable the 
report said but the economic mechanism should work toward bringing 
these prices into line 
the agency said japans higher consumer prices resulted from 
such things as government restrictions consumer behavior and high 
land prices

the value of the dollar plunged in hectic 
trading on world currency markets today as the worlds richest 
countries dumped the greenback as a way of showing their 
determination to block any further rise in the us currency 
the dollar selloff began in japanese currency markets in 
turbulent trading which was later matched in european and new york 
markets 
traders reported that the dollars plunge was aided by 
coordinated selling on the part of the central banks of the united 
states japan west germany britain france and canada 
finance ministers and central bank presidents from those 
countries along with italy on saturday issued a blunt statement 
expressing displeasure with increases this year in the dollars 
value a rise which many fear will abort needed improvement in the 
us trade deficit a stronger dollar makes us products less 
competitive on overseas markets 
the finance ministers in washington for the annual meetings of 
the international monetary fund and world bank pronounced their 
satisfaction today with the dollars decline 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy said that the 
coordinated intervention on the part of governments to push the 
dollar lower was a confirmation and illustration of the resolve 
of the group of seven to cooperate on international economic 
matters 
some critics have complained that the g7 coordination process 
was in danger of coming apart given a failure so far in the year 
by the group to influence the dollars exchange rate 
beregovoy briefing reporters at the french embassy said that 
the g7 communique meant what it said and he said it reflected 
the reassertion of our common will to cooperate in monetary 
terms 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar plunged 205 yen to a closing 14295 yen the 
dollar later fell even further in london trading 
karl otto poehl president of the west german central bank 
confirmed for reporters that widespread intervention was occurring 
and said that it was appropriate and reasonable given the need 
to make further progress in reducing world trade imbalances 
despite todays sharp plunge in the dollars value private 
economists said it remained to be seen whether intervention would 
work any better in the long term than it has up until now at 
keeping the us currency from rising 
the sessions of the imf and world bank are focusing on such 
topics as the bush administration efforts to reduce a portion of 
the third worlds debt burden and proposals to assist in the 
dramatic political and economic reforms under way in poland and 
hungary 
imf officials told reporters today that there had been no final 
decision on the question of doubling imf resources although they 
predicted that the matter could still be resolved by the end of 
this year 
while there is overwhelming support among the 152 nations for at 
least some type of increase the united states which has veto 
power on the issue remains opposed 
imf managing director michel camdessus insisted that the outlook 
for an increase still looked encouraging saying he believed there 
was a growing perception of the weight of the responsibilities 
put on our sholders to help carry out the bush administrations 
third world debt reduction strategy 
in the group of seven communique issued late saturday after a 
day of closeddoor dicussions treasury secretary nicholas brady 
and his counterparts from the other countries expressed their 
displeasure with the persistent increase in the dollars value this 
year 
the joint statement called the dollars increase inconsistent 
with longerrun economic fundamentals and said a further rise 
could adversely affect prospects for the world economy 
the saturday session was the first meeting of the finance 
ministers and central bank presidents since last april at that 
time the officials had also decried the rising value of the 
dollar although the language used was milder in tone 
the steppedup sense of urgency led many private economists to 
expect a heavy effort at intervention today 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said he was also looking for japan 
and west germany to show more willingness in the months ahead to 
raise interest rates in their countries as a way of influencing 
currency markets 
higher interest rates overseas relative to us rates would make 
dollardenominated investments less attractive to foreign investors 
but some analysts said they were not sure whether the latest 
effort would be any more successful than the april vow to keep the 
dollar from rising in value 
despite heavy intervention in the currency markets since last 
spring the dollar has continued rising and now stands about 20 
percent above its january level in relation to the japanese yen it 
is about 25 percent above its january level against the west german 
mark 
before saturdays g7 meeting the dollar bought 146 yen and 
195 marks well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of 
the trading range sought by the group of seven 140 yen and 190 
marks 
the fact of the matter is intervention does not work in the 
long run said economist david wyss of drimcgraw hill he and 
other economists said what really was needed was for the united 
states and other countries to improve underlying economic 
conditions 
for the united states that would mean stronger efforts to 
reduce its budget deficit which drains away domestic savings and 
pushes up us interest rates and greater efforts in west germany 
and japan to reduce their huge trade surpluses with the united 
states 
on sunday brady said the administration was making strides in 
reducing the federal deficit and he called on countries running 
large trade surpluses such as japan and west germany to do more 
to stimulate domestic demand and open their borders to us exports

the st louis sun starting from scratch in an 
attempt to buck the trend of newspaper mergers and shutdowns 
debuted early today before a curious and eager community 
the first edition of the tabloid featured a photograph of a 
bright sun rising over the gateway arch 
the lead story was the launch of the newspaper and its headline 
was st louis we have liftoff 
the sun is the first major newspaper to begin from scratch in a 
big us city since the washington times debuted in 1982 
ralph ingersoll ii chairman and chief executive officer of new 
jerseybased ingersoll publications co which owns the sun is 
moving to st louis from connecticut to become editorinchief 
i think its pretty clear that print has a good future i 
havent the least doubt the st louis sun will be profitable its 
one of the lower risk ventures weve undertaken he said 
this newspaper will be successful if its relevant thats our 
number one priority 
to herald the suns rising ingersoll and other executives 
gathered at a sidewalk reception this morning at the citys 
downtown offices a dixieland jazz band played in the background as 
sun employees waded into traffic to hand out free copies of the 
morning newspaper 
sue selvidge a clerk at world news in downtown st louis said 
this morning that the paper was selling briskly everygody likes 
to see something new she said 
already the sun has attracted 55000 subscribers nearly twice 
the level company officials had been aiming for after a month of 
publication advertising space in the inaugural edition was sold 
out 
the sun started printing 200000 copies of the newspaper about 
930 pm sunday night three hours earlier than its planned 
deadline in order to meet expected heavy demand 
the 1dayold sun will be competing with the st louis 
postdispatch which will be 111 years old in december the 
postdispatch has been the citys only daily newspaper since the 
st louis globedemocrat folded in october 1986 
we definitely welcome competition said the postdispatchs 
managing editor david lipman we find it exciting and 
challenging 
the postdispatchs circulation has been increasing all summer 
and its 10 biggest advertisers are spending more money than they 
were a year ago last weeks paid circulation stood at 564000 on 
sunday and 384000 on weekdays 
the postdispatch took note of its new competition with a story 
on the bottom of todays front page that included this quote from 
editor william woo 
its a goodlooking newspaper but its not a newspaper that 
was invented on mars or is the likes of something that people have 
never seen 
sun officials are calling the new tabloid a laptop paper 
thats user friendly 
although industry analysts are closely following the suns 
progress they dont think it will have that big an impact on the 
industry 
no matter what happens in st louis i dont think youre 
going to see many people rushing to try the same thing around the 
country said john morton a washingtonbased newspaper analyst 
morton said there are only 19 cities in the country that still 
have two commercially competitive newspapers and it appears that 
number will be shrinking soon

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
increased by two last week to total 967 continuing a slow but 
steady rise and remaining above yearago levels for the fourth 
straight week baker hughes inc reported today 
a year ago the count stood at 917 the company said 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states texas posted the most 
increases by adding nine rigs other increases were seen in 
oklahoma with five new mexico two ohio two pennsylvania two 
and michigan one 
wyoming showed the most decreases with five followed by north 
dakota with three and california colorado and kansas which each 
lost one rig

employees of the staterun television 
corporation went on strike monday to protest a proposed bill 
establishing private television 
the blackout which was to last until 1 am tuesday was the 
longest in a series of work stoppages that began sept 7 to protest 
the legislation breaking the state monopoly on television 
parliament was expected to pass the bill 
the government rejected a series of employee demands at a 
meeting on monday said sifis kakavoulis deputy president of the 
federation of employees of the hellenic radio television 
corporation 
kakavoulis said one of the employees key demands was that they 
be represented on a special council overseeing state and private 
radio and television 
another point of contention with the government is that the 
bill does not oblige private television stations to present any 
greek programs kakavoulis said this means that they will be 
able to present only foreign programs with which ert wont be able 
to compete 
foreign programs are cheaper to buy than greek productions 
the government has called the strikes politically inspired and 
said it would ask the courts to declare further work stoppages 
illegal 
the employees federation is controlled by the panhellenic 
socialist movement which lost the june 18 general elections after 
eight years in power 
the elections produced a hung parliament resulting in a 
conservativeleftist coalition that promised to clean up scandals 
from the previous socialist administration new elections are 
scheduled nov5 
private tv stations are expected to start broadcasting after the 
general elections

the proposed merger of arthur andersen amp co and 
price waterhouse into what would become the worlds largest 
accounting firm may be scrapped due to differences over retirement 
funding according to a report published monday 
a dispute over the name of the combined firm and various sticky 
legal and internal issues also threaten to derail the merger talks 
the wall street journal reported quoting unidentified parties 
close to both firms 
neither chicagobased andersen nor new yorkbased price 
waterhouse would comment on the report 
some industry observers told the associated press that while 
retirement funding may be a major obstacle to a merger the 
negative consequences of not merging are likely to bring the 
bickering companies together in the end 
if the problem is combining retirement plans who ought to be 
better able to do that than accountants said james emerson 
publisher of emersons professional services review in bellevue 
wash 
the journal said andersen accrues or sets up a reserve for its 
partners in advance of their retirement and they generally receive 
25000 to 50000 a year in benefits after they retire 
price doesnt fund its retirement benefits in advance and pays 
its partners about 100000 a year after they retire the newspaper 
said 
emerson said many people in the acconting field were saying a 
merger looked unlikely but if you had asked me a month ago i 
would have told you they were saying it wouldnt work then too 
emerson said he believes andersen and price will merge largely 
because of what each firm stands to lose if they dont 
without a merger andersen the secondlargest us accounting 
firm would be unlikely to regain the no 1 position it lost 
earlier this year when ernst amp whinney and arthur young amp co 
combined their operations 
andersen needs to expand its foreign operations currently the 
smallest of any major us accounting firm and would be unlikely 
to do so without a merger emerson said 
steven stiling who resigned from andersen last month as a 
managing director in consulting to join csc consulting group of 
cambridge mass said that without a merger to strengthen its 
accounting business andersens consulting arm would possibly split 
off as a separate company 
consulting has been andersens fastestgrowing business in 
recent years but the firm has been unable to halt the defections of 
its top consulting partners who are unhappy with subsidizing the 
accounting and related operations 
for price waterhouse the no 5 us accounting firm failure to 
merge with andersen would mark its second aborted merger since 
1984 when merger talks with deloitte haskins amp sells fell through 
deloitte combined with touche ross amp co earlier this year 
two failed mergers doesnt look good emerson said 
other hurdles andersen and price would have to overcome include 
a potential conflict of interest in their dealings with 
international business machines corp and hewlett packard corp 
according to the journal 
andersen has joint ventures with both firms to develop computer 
integration products while price is the auditor for both firms 
accounting profession ethics rules ban business ties with audit 
clients 
andersen and price waterhouse began formal talks to explore the 
feasibility of a merger in july the two firms announced on sept 5 
that they would need more time to continue their merger talks 
a merged company would reap 5 billion a year in worldwide 
revenue and 27 billion in us revenue

cabinet ministers who oversee the 
international monetary fund said monday that back dues owed by 
member nations continue to grow and they urged repayment of the 
arrears to help ease the burden on other countries 
in a communique after several days of deliberations the interim 
committee of the imf also said many of the organizations 152 
member nations support a substantial increase in the lending 
funds provided by the institution 
the question of increasing the lending reserves is one of the 
central issues at this years annual meeting of the imf and its 
sister organization the world bank which was to begin tuesday 
imf director michel camdessus is urging the member nations to 
double socalled quotas from 120 billion others say he will only 
get a 50 perent to 70 percent increase while us officials have 
said they believe the imf has adequate resources to respond to the 
needs of poorer countries 
the united states is the largest contributor to both 
organizations and has the biggest voting share 
there was widespread support in the committee on the need for 
a substantial increase in quotas although a few members believe 
that the fund has adequate resources at the present time to fulfill 
its responsibilities said the statement issued at the end of the 
panels deliberations 
the committee called for a decision to be made on the proposed 
increases by the end of the year 
the panel welcomed the significant reduction in the number of 
members in arrears but is also was concerned that the overall 
amount of arrears had nonetheless continued to rise owing to the 
failure of a few countries with protracted arrears to meet their 
financial obligations 
the back dues to the imf totaled 375 billion at the end of 
september compared with 237 billion at the same time last year 
those with the longest back dues which have been declared 
ineligible for further lending until they repay some of the money 
are cambodia guyana liberia panama peru sierra leone somalia 
the sudan and zambia 
the committee again called on all members in arrears to adopt 
policies promptly to correct their economic imbalances and 
regularize their relations with the fund bearing in mind the 
burden that overdue obligations impose on other fund members the 
statement said

rjr nabisco inc said monday it had made the 
last major asset sale under a 55 billion divestiture plan as an 
investor group led by merrill lynch amp co agreed to buy its del 
monte canned food business for 148 billion 
del montes senior management citicorp capital investors ltd 
and kikkoman corp also are members of the investor group 
rjr nabisco said proceeds from the sale will bring to 
approximately 49 billion the amount of money it has earned from 
its divestiture program 
the company began selling assets to reduce its debt following 
the record 2453 billion buyout of the food and tobacco giant by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co earlier this year 
sarah sheckler who analyzes rjr nabisco for duff amp phelps inc 
in chicago said the asset sales are proceeding well and that 
the prices rjr nabisco has received were generally in line with 
expectations 
the company previously announced the sale of five european food 
businesses for 25 billion its chun king food division for 52 
million its associated biscuits international ltd for 44 
million and the fresh fruit operations of del monte for 875 
million 
we dont anticipate that there will be any more major 
divestitures rjr nabisco spokesman david kalis said monday 
rjr nabisco management would look at the companys businesses 
individually and decide where it could make further cuts kalis 
said 
ms sheckler said she expected rjr nabisco to sell individual 
grocery product lines to achieve its goal of 55 billion 
there had been speculation that rjr nabisco might sell its 
planters lifesavers co but the company apparently plans to retain 
the division 
rjr nabisco had been expected to sell del montes canned food 
business to a group led by citicorp venture capital however the 
company was forced to revamp the deal after the federal reserve 
boards staff expressed concern that the transaction did not comply 
with regulations limiting banks ownership of nonfinancial 
companies 
citicorp was forced to reduce its stake in the del monte 
holdings because federal banking rules prohibit banks from owning 
more than 5 percent of voting stock and 25 percnet of nonvoting 
stock in nonfinancial firms 
businesses included in the latest sale included del monte foods 
usa del monte foods europe del montes processed food business in 
mexico the caribbean and the far east and its pineapple operations 
in the philippines and kenya 
rjr nabisco said it would keep del monteaylmer canada del 
montes processed food business in venezuela and nabisco food 
businesses in latin america that had been managed by del monte

polands noncommunist government privatize its economy including 
creating a new financial system a bank official said monday

controlled now trying to make the transition and its a very 
difficult transition to make he said 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy said he had seen the 
economic plan of polands noncommunist government but that it was 
too soon to comment on it 
one major problem is polands 42 billion debt threequarters

governments are being asked to postpone payments due this year and 
next 
the ifc program calls for new private foreign investment in 
poland especially joint ventures between foreign investors and 
polish interests it also offers to help on privatizing stateowned 
enterprises creation of a new bank or banks to provide a base for 
more private companies and help in developing capital markets

the government has asked northwest airlines 
owner alfred checchi to sharply reduce the 400 million investment 
made in the carrier by klm royal dutch airlines according to a 
published report monday 
transportation secretary samuel skinner made the request in a 
meeting last friday where skinner told checchi his conclusions from 
a review of northwests financial health the wall street journal 
reported 
the newspaper quoting two unidentified sources said checchi 
had no comment neither the transportation department nor northwest 
has disclosed skinners findings which are expected to made public 
later this week 
klm made the investment to help checchi finance the 365 
billion purchase of northwests parent company nwa inc based in 
eagan minn 
although foreign companies cannot own more than 25 percent of a 
us airline klm provided 57 percent of the 700 million in equity 
checchi raised to buy northwest klm officially owns only 5 percent 
of northwest because its investment is mostly in nonvoting 
preferred stock 
one person familiar with skinners decisions said he wants to 
cut klms investment in northwest from 400 million to 175 
million an amount equal to 25 percent of the 700 million in 
equity checchi raised the journal reported 
skinner and other transportation department officials have 
expressed concern about the foreign interest in recent airline 
takeovers and the level of debt carriers are being forced to assume 
foreign ownership of us airlines raises concerns about 
national security competition and bilateral negotiations on 
international routes skinner has said 
transportation department spokesman hal paris declined to 
comment monday on the newspaper report northwest also has declined 
to disclose what skinner said to checchi last week

animalrights activists said monday they are 
beginning a nationwide boycott of procter amp gamble co to pressure 
the company into stopping the use of animals in product safety 
tests 
the giant consumer products company said it has been studying 
alternatives but that there arent sufficient methods available to 
make the elimination of animal tests possible 
holly hazard executive director of the washingtonbased doris 
day animal league met with company representatives at procter amp 
gambles headquarters to present her groups demands but said 
later she was disappointed with the results 
she told a news conference earlier monday that 36000 of the 
doris day leagues members nationwide have returned cards 
indicating they will support the boycott 
the group accuses the cincinnatibased pampg of needlessly 
torturing rabbits and other animals in laboratory tests in which 
cosmetics and other products are forced into the eyes to document 
exposure risks 
pampg which manufactures a wide range of products from crest 
toothpaste to pampers disposable diapers had 214 billion in 
worldwide sales during the past year 
the doris day group and other animalrights associations 
including in defense of animals and people for the ethical 
treatment of animals say the tests are cruel unnecessary and 
produce irrelevant data that could be replaced by more humane tests 
ms hazard said pampg representatives turned down her requests 
monday to provide data on the number of animals used in testing and 
would not commit the company to support bills before congress 
designed to phase out the use of animals in testing 
she said pampg officials also refused to disavow any relationship 
or contribution to the animal testing coalition which 
animalrights activists say is an industry group secretly committed 
to battling the activists and persuading the public that animal 
testing is necessary 
pampg spokeswoman linda ulrey said the company proposed the 
coalition only as an industry vehicle to educate the public that 
sufficient alternatives havent been develped to permit the 
elimination of animals in product tests 
ms ulrey said pampg has spent 10 million in the last three years 
on research into alternatives she said that compares with 150000 
that pampg plans to spend this year on the industry coalition 
she said alternatives to animal testing include scientific 
databased predictions of effects of product exposure and 
computersimulated results of exposure 
this year several companies including cosmetics maker avons 
products inc have announced that they were discontinuing animal 
tests and replacing them with alternative methods 
but ms ulrey said right now the scientific community says 
you cannot completely walk away from animal testing 
pampg has won recognition for its research into alternatives to 
animal testing and will receive an award in recognition next month 
from the massachusetts society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals ms ulrey said 
ms hazard and other activists said monday they will stage 
demonstrations at pampg headquarters during the companys oct 10 
shareholders meeting they also said they will demonstrate that 
day at other pampg opeations in baltimore chicago dallas 
greensboro nc hatboro pa iowa city iowa kansas city mo 
oxnard calif phoenix ariz and sacramento calif 
animalrights activists have picketed pampgs shareholders 
meetings before in 1987 pampgs shareholders followed the companys 
recommendation in rejecting a resolution to stop using animals in 
product testing 
in 1988 the shareholders followed pampgs recommendation to 
reject a resolution that would have required the company to 
disclose the numbers of animals used in tests and how much it cost 
pampg officials have consistently refused to release such 
information saying it is privileged and is not necessarily 
relevant for comparison with other corporations

seeking new sources of money amid an 
economic crisis the government is asking poles for a loan issuing 
treasury bills for the first time since world war ii 
but soaring inflation led the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta 
wyborcza to advise readers that the bonds can be considered a way 
to support the new noncommunistled government but not an 
investment for savings 
the government hopes to raise 420 billion zlotys or 289 
million bonds redeemable within six months will have a total face 
value of 600 billion zlotys 
the annual interest rate will be about 86 percent about twice 
as much as banks are paying in interest 
but inflation during the month of august alone was put at 50 
percent after government controls on food prices were lifted and 
the value of the zloty continued to plummet as the government 
printed more money to cover the budget deficit 
the government budget deficit totals more than 4 trillion 
zlotys or 275 billion 
finance vice minister andrzej podsiadlo announcing the start of 
the bond sale next monday said he is optimistic the government 
would be able to repay its obligations from the receipts from the 
next bond issue planned 
planning for the bond issue began under the previous finance 
minister who was replaced by a solidarity supporter after tadeusz 
mazowiecki took office as the east blocs first noncommunist prime 
minister aug 24 and formed a cabinet sept 12 
mazowiecki has been struggling to put together an economic 
recovery plan that will satisfy poles pressed by rising prices and 
shortages of consumer goods and western bankers considering aid 
plans and rescheduling of payments on polands 39 billion foreign 
debt 
the bonds will be sold at banks and post offices until dec 30 
and will be available to individuals enterprises and foreigners 
who obtain permission from the finance ministry

in an apparent move to deflect criticism from 
employees over the profits he stands to make from a 
pilotmanagement buyout ual corp chairman stephen m wolf says he 
is willing to work without a golden parachute and a years 
salary 
in an interview published in mondays wall street journal wolf 
defended the estimated 767 million he stands to reap from ual 
stock and options he holds if the proposed takeover of ual parent 
of united airlines is completed 
under the 675 billion buyout proposal united pilots would 
make pay and benefits concessions worth 250 million a year over 
seven years in exchange for a 75 percent stake in ual 
in his first interview since the ual board of directors approved 
the pilotmanagement buyout earlier this month wolf told the 
journal that he plans to forgo his 575000 annual salary for the 
first year after the takeover 
he also said he was willing to work indefinitely without a 
contract which would prevent him from receiving his substantial 
golden parachute severance pay should he leave ual 
wolf said he has asked other senior managers to follow his lead 
and work without contracts he also said he plans to donate 1 
million from his profits to educational charities 
wolf 48 is guaranteed to benefit financially from the 
300ashare proposed buyout by senior managers the pilots union 
and british airways plc he said though that he would do 
everything in his power to make sure the employees make a profit on 
their own investment in the takeover 
while wolf warned there is no way to guarantee that 
rankandfile employees will benefit from the takeover he added 
it is my objective to return to employees 100 percent of their 
investment and a significant profit margin on top of that 
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission 
disclosed friday how much wolf is guaranteed to make once the 
buyout is completed as well as the information that john c pope 
uals chief financial officer would receive 377 million from his 
ual stock and options 
wolf would get 225 million for his 75000 ual shares and 
5417 million for his options to buy another 250000 shares pope 
stands to make 3 million on his 10000 shares and 3465 million 
on his options the two would continue to run the company under the 
buyout plan 
the sec disclosures came while wolf and other senior managers 
were trying to persuade all ual employees to make wage concessions 
and productivity improvements to help facilitate the takeover 
so far only the air line pilots association a party to the 
takeover has agreed to participate in addition to the 250 
million a year in concessions the pilots have pledged 200 million 
from pension funds toward the buyout 
the sharpest criticism of wolf and the other senior executives 
has come from the machinists union which is not participating in 
the buyout 
a machinist spokesman said the union finds the wolf windfall 
offensive and also objects to the fact that uals outside 
directors recently voted themselves 20000ayear salaries for 
life and unlimited free travel privileges on the airline 
the employees would own 75 percent of ual under the proposal 
making it the largest employeeowned company in the nation a 
management group headed by wolf would hold 10 percent and british 
airways would hold the remaining 15 percent in exchange for a 750 
million investment

stroh said in february it wanted a partner with cash to help pay 
off debts and enable it to come closer to matching advertising 
dollars with the likes of beer market leader anheuserbusch cos 
but on aug 31 of this year chairman peter stroh 
greatgrandson of the company founder announced there were no 
takers and that stroh was trimming support of community events and 
laying off 300 of its 1500 whitecollar workers to cut costs 
two hundred of the layoffs were in the companys detroit 
headquarters the rest in its seven us breweries the company 
founded in 1850 by german immigrant bernard stroh made its last 
beer in detroit in 1985 
that there wont be a stroh family in the beer business is 
difficult for many people who have been in the industry said 
jerry steinman of the trade newsletter beer marketers insights 
peter stroh has been a wellliked person and his uncle john 
board member john stroh jr was adored so its the end of an era 
in the industry 
peter stroh issued a statement saying his company had neither 
the size nor the money to compete with larger publicly held 
competitors 
stroh spent an estimated 21 million last year promoting its 
major brands stroh and stroh light while anheuserbusch spent an 
estimated 204 million promoting budweiser and bud light beer 
marketers insights said 
stroh had cut expenditures such as sponsorship of auto racing 
national audubon societys television specials and community 
programs including annual freedom festival fireworks over the 
detroit river 
the company recently launched an advertising campaign stressing 
the familys background as brewers with roots in germany more than 
200 years ago stroh said that made the decision to sell difficult 
but caused the family to lean toward dealing with coors also a 
familyrun operation 
i think youll find a lot of people will be glad the suspense 
is over said one employee entering the company monday after the 
announcement of the deal with coors its a relief said the 
worker who wouldnt give her name 
several other stroh employees declined comment one man said he 
didnt know how to react because he didnt know yet what would 
become of his job 
stroh workers face a period of suspense waiting for word on who 
will be laid off and who will stay to manage the companys 
remaining businesses 
those include sundance sparkling fruitjuice beverages beach 
club juice drinks white mountain and california cooler wine 
coolers and interests in spains cruz del campo brewery and 
canadas sleeman brewing co in guelph ontario 
george kuehn senior vice president counsel and secretary said 
the sale wouldnt affect stroh family enterprises apart from the 
brewery company including family interests in the stroh river 
place and brewery park office complexes and the newly opened 16 
million 109room river place inn all in downtown detroit 
precise plans which we have for any of our remaining 
facilities or businesses have not been determined said kuehn 
senior vice president counsel and secretary he said details would 
be worked out in time to close the deal with coors in january or 
earlier 
kuehn said stroh family members wouldnt comment beyond peter 
strohs statement

crude oil futures rose monday amid expectations 
that opec would legitimize current production by raising its quota 
but would not go any higher 
there are a lot of optimistic people out there said greg 
dreis energy broker with merrill lynch energy futures as long 
as opec production doesnt change and as long as demand remains 
strong out there its not going to make that much difference 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil rose 18 
cents to close at 1946 a 42gallon barrel december crude rose 20 
cents to 1932 and january advanced 22 cents to 1921 a barrel 
among refined products heating oil for october delivery added 
054 cent to finish at 5751 cents a gallon while other contract 
months posted slightly higher gains 
unleaded gasoline for october delivery which had risen last 
week after reports of hurricane damage to a big refinery in st 
croix virgin islands declined 028 cent to 6167 cents a gallon 
november slipped 03 cent to 5813 cents while contracts for later 
delivery rose 
traders said the meeting of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries in geneva dominated the days trading late in 
the day some opec delegates said the cartel was close to signing 
an agreement that would formalize opecs production at about 21 
million barrels however a meeting scheduled late in the day was 
abruptly postponed until tuesday 
iraqi oil minister issam alchalabi said the delay was due to 
slight differences among some members over the exact quota 
opec has a stated ceiling of 195 million barrels a day but 
socalled cheating by some of the 13 members has put the 
oilproducing groups actual production at about 22 million barrels 
some opec sources have said they believe current world demand is 
enough to sustain a higher quota without weakening prices although 
crude prices are below levels of this spring they have remained in 
the 1920 range 
analysts said legitimizing opecs production at around 21 
million barrels a day probably would not dampen prices as long as 
members stick to the agreement

lomas financial corp said monday it filed for 
bankruptcy court protection so it can focus on restructuring plans 
after negotiations with creditors dragged on for three months 
it was just to the point where time had run out lomas 
spokesman mike sitrick said it was really the pressure of the 
time that had passed 
lomas sought chapter 11 protection from creditors filing sunday 
in us bankruptcy court in new york the action freezes payments 
on a total of 21 billion in debt it involves only the parent 
company and some land developing subsidiaries 
lomas is the nations thirdlargest mortgage banker with more 
than 6 billion in assets and operations 
hurt by real estate problems and a slowdown in mortgage lending 
lomas reported a 564 million loss in fiscal 1988 and a 3045 
million loss in the year that ended june 30 
in june lomas announced a major restructuring program that 
sought to reduce its outstanding debt by nearly twothirds to 
about 2 billion from 57 billion the company already had reduced 
its total debt by 19 billion from the asset sales 
but as lomas was implementing its restructuring plan it also 
was trying to negotiate an agreement with senior debtholders 
lomas missed a 145 million payment on senior debt sept 1 at 
which time creditors could have forced the immediate payment of all 
senior debt talks had been continuing between lomas officials and 
the creditors 
despite substantial progress in restructuring our business 
exhaustive negotiations with our lenders over a threemonth period 
did not produce timely closure or a satisfactory debt 
restructure lomas chairman and chief executive jess hay said in 
a statement 
as the complex negotiations and disputes among creditors 
dragged on time simply ran out he said 
lomas had hoped to settle with the 50 lenders by the end of 
july then the end of august hay said it became apparent last week 
the firm was at least two or three weeks away from an agreement 
with holders of its senior debt 
earlier this month lomas said all of its senior creditors 
except two banks holding 3 percent of the debt had agreed to 
the restructuring which analysts believed could have forestalled a 
bankruptcy court filing 
subsidiaries including lomas mortgage banking life insurance 
and leasing companies did not seek bankruptcy protection the 
company said

the us dollar plunged on world markets 
monday as the united states and its major allies demonstrated 
determination to push the currencys value lower in a bid to solve 
americas trade deficit problems 
the selloff began in hectic trading in tokyo and was later 
matched in european and new york markets in what traders described 
as a rout for the dollar 
the market is shellshocked said robert hatcher a trader 
in the new york office of barclays bank plc the manner in which 
the central banks conducted the intervention in the far east and 
europe today was extremely effective 
the dollar began dropping when markets opened in tokyo with the 
decline continuing later in trading in europe and new york 
in tokyo the dollar lost 14 percent of its value falling to 
14295 yen compared to a friday level of 145 yen later in 
london it fell further to 14269 yen the slide continued in the 
united states where the dollar skidded to 14213 yen in new york 
trading down 27 percent from fridays level of 14605 
the dollar also lost ground against the west german mark the 
british pound the french franc and other european currencies 
traders reported heavy selling on the part of the centrals banks 
of the united states japan west germany and other major us 
allies 
the wellcoordinated moves were timed to back up a blunt 
statement expressing displeasure with the dollars rise in value 
this year the statement was issued late saturday by finance 
officials from the united states japan west germany britian 
france canada and italy 
the discussions being held in conjunction with the annual 
meetings of the 152nation international monetary fund and its 
sister lending organization the world bank were hosted by 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan 
the communique expressed fears that the dollars rise threatened 
to abort the improvement in the us trade deficit a stronger 
dollar makes american goods more expensive on overseas markets 
finance officials pronounced themselves pleased with the impact 
of their efforts monday and said they stood ready to take further 
coordinated efforts if the markets try to push the dollar higher 
again 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy termed the coordinated 
intervention a confirmation and illustration of the new resolve 
on the part of the group of seven countries 
karl otto poehl president of the west german central bank said 
that mondays selloff of dollars by central banks had been 
obviously quite successful 
he said we will still continue to coordinate with our 
american japanese and european colleagues in order to achieve the 
results we agreed upon in the g7 meeting 
poehl added to market nervousness with his statement in 
response to a question that hinted the west german central bank 
might be poised to push interest rates higher in view of rapid 
growth in that country 
many economists said they are looking for mondays coordinated 
dollar selling to be followed later on by coordinated changes in 
interest rates to further depress the dollars value 
a rise in interest rates in west germany and japan would tend to 
weaken the dollar because it would boost the rateofreturn on 
investments in those countries in relation to dollardenominated 
investments 
the bush administration has been putting pressure on the federal 
reserve to lower interest rates in this country a move that could 
also relieve the upward pressure on the dollar but economists said 
this was less likely to occur given lingering inflation worries at 
the fed 
before saturdays meeting the dollar had risen by about 20 
percent against the japanese yen and 25 perent against the west 
german mark this year those rises occurred despite a record level 
of dollar selling on the part of the federal reserve over the 
summer 
some economists expressed the belief that the latest round of 
intervention could carry more weight especially if backed up later 
by coordinated interest rate moves 
i think it is in the interest of all countries to push the 
dollar down said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
he said that the bush administration is worried that weaker 
exports could lead to a possible recession in 1990 an election 
year while bonn and tokyo are both worried about the need to push 
interest rates higher to combat inflation 
brady in a speech monday before the world bankimf meetings 
called for continued efforts to provide debt relief to more nations 
under the socalled brady plan he called this approach the only 
hope for achieving our common goal of extending prosperity 
throughout the world 
finance officials from other countries said they still hoped to 
achieve agreement for boosting the resources of the imf before the 
end of the year although the united states has made it known that 
it was not yet convinced of the need to boost the lending 
institutions reserves known as quotas 
the imf and world bank meetings continue through thursday with 
president bush scheduled to address the gathering on wednesday

the house on monday passed legislation 
enabling federal securities regulators to maintain the 
confidentiality of documents that foreign governments supply to 
help us investigators 
the international securities enforcement cooperation act cleared 
the house on a voice vote with little debate 
a similar bill was passed by the senate banking committee last 
week but has yet to make it onto the senate floor 
under the bill the securities and exchange commission would be 
exempt from certain aspects of the freedom of information act and 
would be able to guarantee foreign authorities that documents and 
testimony they supply the sec will be kept confidential which is 
often required under foreign laws 
the bill is designed to foster international cooperation in the 
enforcement of securities laws and securities trading and 
securities fraud across oceans and borders 
in legislation passed last year the sec was given authority to 
assist foreign governments in investigating violations of foreign 
securities laws 
but the agency expressed concern that previous negotiations of 
bilateral assistance agreements bogged down with the secs 
inability to assure foreign governments that information would be 
kept confidential

the united states has refused to promise 3 
billion it is expected to contribute to loans for the worlds 
poorest countries world bank president barber conable said monday 
the money would be the us share of a 145 billion fund to be 
lent out over three years to about 55 countries where the income of 
the average citizen is little more than 1 a day 
it would be distributed by bank affilaite the international 
development association in 40year loans at less than 1 percent 
interest a year 
unfortunately the united states was not in a position this 
past week to advise its ida partners of its ability to take an 
appropriate share of a replenishment of this magnitude 
conable said 
he spoke at a closed door meeting of the development committee 
which includes representatives of the world bank and international 
monetary fund now holding their annual meetings in washington a 
copy of his statement was distributed to reporters 
the united states also is holding out against a proposal to make 
a big increase in the 120 billion now availale for the imf french 
finance minister pierre beregovoy said monday he thought a 
compromise eventually would be reached on about 80 billion in new 
money 
about 16 billion of that would come from the united states but 
unlike the ida contribution it would not be a charge on the 
federal budget 
idas money is replenished every three years the contributions 
now being sought would be lent beginning next july 1 
congress is now working on an appropriation of 975 million the 
final us contribution to ida for the current threeyear period 
the united states is the biggest giver among the 34 current donor 
countries providing more than onefifth of the money 
conable held out hope the bush administration would change its 
mind about the ida contribution at a meeting to be held in kyoto 
japan in november 
on a proposed new threeyear pool of 145 billion conable 
said to most members agreement on this approximate amount seems 
feasible and they have indicated their willingness to take a 
reasonable share under the right circumstances 
a world bank official said the united states was the only 
holdout but some other countries will make contributions dependent 
on the us share so if the united states offers a smaller sum 
than expected other nations might reduce their contribution

the recession many experts once predicted 
for next year will not occur until at least late 1991 according to 
business economists who on monday forecast slower but continued 
economic growth through 1990 
confidence in the federal reserve boards softlanding 
policy of controlled expansion to limit inflation and unemployment 
was a primary reason for the largely favorable report issued by the 
national association of business economists 
the fed is trying to prevent growth from going too fast or too 
slow it seems to be working and the vast majority of this group 
likes this very much said james f smith vice president of the 
organization which is holding its annual meeting here 
a majority of nabe forecasting experts 52 percent expected the 
current record peacetime expansion to continue until late 1991 or 
beyond that would surpass the 106month record set during a period 
in the 1960s that included the war in vietnam 
only 99 percent expected a recession this year and only 21 
percent predicted an economic slowdown in 1990 
association experts also forecast that the growth in the gross 
national product adjusted for inflation would continue at the 
current 21 percent annual rate through 1990 then rise to an 
average 27 a year for the 198993 fiveyear period 
no boom no bust more good news than bad was how smith 
characterized the report which also predicted continued low levels 
of inflation and unemployment 
the nabes predictions were echoed by michael boskin chairman 
of the presidents council of economic advisers who spoke to 400 
of the associations members monday 
we anticipate continued growth for the economy albeit at a 
slower rate said boskin who predicted a 25 percent growth rate 
in 1989 that would pick up somewhat in mid1990 
our best guess is for sustained moderate growth gradual 
reductions in inflation and continued low employment he said 
the nabe economists predicted 5 percent annual inflation for 
this years october through december quarter and 43 percent for 
all of 1993 unemployment the lowest in 15 years should average 
53 percent this year and rise only to 57 percent in 1990 the 
panel said 
while economists welcomed slower growth as a way of curbing 
inflation they acknowledged it would be so sluggish for the next 
two years that it would feel like a downturn for many industries 
some parts of the country and some industries are going to 
feel theyre in a recession smith said 
businesses most affected would be producers of consumer goods 
because consumers are holding onto their wallets the nabe said 
consumer spending which grew 34 percent last year will grow 22 
percent this year and 19 percent in 1990 economists said 
for a country in which shop til you drop is almost the 
national battle cry this could easily be viewed as the most 
unamerican forecast ever issued by the nabe forecast panel the 
association report said 
meanwhile consumers are saving more said the panel which 
expects the savings rate to soar because of continued low 
unemployment 
the nabe also expected the nations twin trade and budget 
deficit to continue their slow decline 
the economists median forecast for the trade deficit was 110 
billion this year and 100 billion in 1990 compared with 1228 
billion in 1988 
the survey panel expects a 150 billion budget deficit this year 
and 135 billion in 1990 compared with 1551 billion last year 
the forecast is far from the 100 billion deficit reduction ceiling 
mandated for fiscal 1990 by the grammrudman law 
other forecasts in the survey included 
industrial production should grow 31 percent this year 
slowing to 17 percent in 1990 
construction of new homes and apartments is forecast to average 
142 million units this year and 145 million units in 1990 
car and truck sales are expected to total 15 million this year 
before falling to 147 million in 1990

coors brewing co said monday it reached an 
agreement in principle on a 425 million buyout of stroh brewing 
co a move analysts said effectively creates a big three group 
of dominant us breweries 
peter coors the brewerys president and chief executive said 
the proposed acquisition of most of strohs brewing and container 
facilities and brands would strengthen his companys distributor 
organization product quality and brand names 
if we are going to be in the beer business longterm weve 
got to be a major and significant competitor said coors 
the purchase price includes cash plus assumption of longterm 
debt and certain other liabilities the transaction is subject to a 
definitive agreement and approval by the boards of directors of 
both companies and government regulators 
a combined coorsstroh would control about 187 percent of the 
us beer market stroh now holds 11 percent trailing only 
anheuserbusch cos incs 41 percent share and miller which is 
owned by philip morris inc with 21 percent 
the next biggest afer coorsstroh g heileman brewing co has 
about a 7 percent market share according to industry estimates 
a buyout also would end the independence of 139yearold stroh 
a detroitbased brewery that makes such brands as strohs stroh 
light old milwaukee and schlitz 
coors brands include coors and coors light extra gold draft 
herman josephs original draft jh light killians red and 
winterfest coors also introduced the keystone and keystone light 
bargain brands a month ago and is marketing them on a limited basis 
coors brewing is a unit of adolph coors co the coors family 
controls 100 percent of adolph coors class a voting stock and 
about a third of its nonvoting publicly traded class b stock the 
class b shares rose 150 to 2375 a share in overthecounter 
trading monday 
coors began expanding from a regional to a national brewer in 
the early 1980s and now sells its products in 49 states and 
washington dc peter coors said stroh operations would be 
consolidated under coors brewing 
adolph coors posted a profit of 121 million or 33 cents a 
share in the first six months of this year down more than 47 
percent from a year earlier in announcing its earnings in july 
chairman william k coors said the beer industry faced stiff price 
competition rising operating costs and flat volume growth 
for its part stroh has had financial problems in the wake of 
its move to go national by acquiring jos schlitz brewing co in 
1982 analysts say stroh which is privately held and does not 
report its earnings was unable to make inroads on the growth of 
industry leader anheuser busch 
stroh has been looking for potential partners since february and 
announced aug 31 it had been unsuccessful and was laying off 300 
of its 1500 whitecollar employees nationwide 
chairman peter stroh greatgrandson of the company founder 
issued a statement that his company had neither the size nor the 
money to compete with larger publicly held competitors 
jay nelson of brown brothers harriman in new york said 
combining the two companies means coors could compete better and 
benefit from economies of scale distribution and purchasing 
you may have more clout all along the line more bang for the 
buck in advertising and more bang for the buck in general he 
said 
brands included in the agreement in principle are strohs and 
strohs light signature schlitz schlitz light and schlitz malt 
liquor schaefer light schaefer nonalcohol and lowalcohol 
brands old milwaukee and old milwaukee light red bull silver 
thunder st barts a nonalcohol brand plus the licensing rights 
to piels piels light and augsburger 
not included were primo a beer brewed in hawaii and distributed 
in some west coast cities is not included and sundance a wine 
cooler stroh also bottles other wine coolers and drinks that are 
not includedin the sale said peter coors 
coors would acquire breweries in st paul minn tampa fla 
winstonsalem nc longview texas and allentown pa 
stroh also has breweries in memphis tenn and van nuys 
calif that will not be acquired coors said 
can plants to be acquired are in winstonsalem and longview 
coors already makes its own cans and bottles grows its own malt 
and makes ceramics at plants in the united states and three other 
countries 
coors also said his company had been in contact with the 
teamsters union but declined to predict whether the buyout would 
affect the union the teamsters which represents stroh plant 
workers but was rejected by coors workers as a potential 
representative in december 1988

a federal appeals court ruled monday that 
apple computer inc and its top officers must go to trial on the 
question of whether its optimistic statements about a novel new 
office computer discdrive dubbed twiggy misled investors 
the cupertinobased company was sued by a group of investors 
claiming fraud in connection with the promotion of a computer 
called lisa and a compatible discdrive twiggy in 1982 
and 1983 both proved commercially unsuccessful and apple replaced 
twiggy with another system before beginning actual sales of lisa 
which later was discontinued 
the investors contend they bought apple stock at an artificially 
high price based on apples misrepresentations they said they 
suffered severely when the products failed and apple stock plunged

the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled 30 that unlike 
information about the market risks of lisa problems linked to 
twiggy were not made known to the market by the press or by 
anyone else although internal tests indicated the mechanisms 
information processing ability was slow and unreliable 
appeals judge jerome farris said the appeals court couldnt 
determine if apples failure to disclose twiggys technical 
problems had no misleading effect on market price so the court 
said the matter should be decided by a lower court jury

optimism was adequately counterbalanced by the press documentation 
of lisas risks 
it upheld a grant of summary judgment to apple involving the 
lisa lawsuit 
apple spokeswoman carleen levassur said company officials were 
pleased by the ruling which she called a very significant 
decision that shows apple acted properly in promoting the 
products and did not violate any securities laws

matter will be resolved in apples favor
