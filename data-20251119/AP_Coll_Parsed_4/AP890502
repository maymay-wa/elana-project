high turnover among nurses is leaving hospitals 
shorthanded but better working conditions and higher pay should 
ease a national nursing shortage researchers said tuesday 
working conditions are more important than pay said steven 
g vernon of the wyatt co a consulting firm that conducted a 
twoyear national survey on nursing called i love my work i 
hate my job 
besides higher pay nurses should have more influence on their 
jobs fewer menial or nonmedical tasks more chances for 
advancement and more scheduling flexibility where possible the 
study says 
a separate wyatt study issued in july showed that one in 10 
hospitalnursing jobs is unfilled and that one in five registered 
nurses leave their hospital employ every year vernon said 
there really is not a shortage of registered nurses in the 
united states said claudia j wyatt a consultant in wyatts 
chicago office 
the shortage is of those willing to work in hospitals she said 
keeping nurses in hospitalbased nursing is the key 
priority ms wyatt said 
for the twoyear study wyatt conducted interviews some 
lasting several hours with more than 500 people including 
hospital administrators nursing managers and more than 200 current 
or former nurses ms wyatt said 
the sample of people at 100 hospitals in 10 states was designed 
to be nationally representative including nurses with a range of 
jobs from hospitals of all sizes she said 
spokeswoman pamela towne of the chicagobased illinois nurses 
association said the groups parent organization the american 
nurses association in kansas city mo issued a set of similar 
solutions to the nursing shortage a year ago 
improved salary and benefits better working conditions and 
helping parttime nurses return to full employment were among the 
suggestions she said 
according to the wyatt study the average staff salary for a 
registered nurse in august was 26000 ranging from a low of 
22800 in the rural southeast to a high of 30400 in west coast 
suburbs 
the average starting annual salary for a newly graduated 
registered nurse was 22300 ranging from a low of 20400 in a 
rural hospital in the northcentral region to a high of 25500 in 
the west coast suburbs 
the report noted that no relationship was found between salaries 
at facilities that perceive a nursing shortage and those that do 
not 
ms towne also said that an increasing demand for nurses rather 
than nurses giving up hospital work appeared to be creating the 
shortage in illinois where 100000 registered nurses work 
she said nationwide 2 million registered nurses are licensed 
and 16 million the most ever are working of those 65 percent 
to 68 percent work in hospitals ms towne said 
ms wyatt said giving nurses more say in defining their jobs 
and more options concerning shifts and parttime work can pay off 
for hospitals 
nurses are true whitecollar professionals who love being in 
the front line of patient care she said but sometimes they 
feel they get treated like bluecollar workers 
the survey was conducted at hospitals in alabama florida 
georgia north carolina south carolina tennessee illinois ohio 
texas and california

the jail in this windswept provincial 
capital is empty except for a rusting bicycle stored in one cell 
and potted plants in the other 
there are crimes here but only small crimes said sgt 
clementi cantor chief of the twoman police force in basco 
capital of batanes the forgotten province of the philippines 
this year sgt cantor has investigated three crimes 
domestic disputes and fights between neighbors none was serious 
enough for the courts 
only 23 crimes were reported in the entire province last year 
the most serious a murder committed by a soldier was the first 
killing reported in 20 years 
weve had judges come to hear cases and they say its like a 
vacation in the bahamas said tess castillejos executive 
secretary to the mayor 
the low crime rate is one of many features that make batanes 
the smallest most northerly and least developed province unique 
in the violenceplagued philippines 
its 15000 people known as ivatans live in quiet isolation 
they fish and raise crops and cattle on 10 small islands about 250 
miles north of manila and only 140 miles south of taiwan 
few outsiders venture to batanes whose lush green fields 
mistshrouded hills and villages on rocky cliffs make it look more 
like the welsh coast than the tropics 
telephones forget it the radiotelephone link was cut last 
year when communist rebels blew up a relay station on luzon the 
main philippine island 
batanes is not perfect 
it has the highest rate of alcohol consumption in the 
philippines per capita income is only 416 pesos 1980 a month 
so many of the brightest youngsters leave after high school in 
search of opportunity 
we need government investments in cattle fishing garlic and 
root crops and to improve the seaport so our young people can find 
jobs here said the provincial governor telesforo castillejos 
most provinces have an overpopulation problem but our growth 
has been almost nill because of emigration 
typhoons and and other storms batter the islands frequently and 
ivatans live in square fortresslike stone houses for protection 
from them but there are no communist rebels no armed gangs and no 
beggars 
internal combustion engines do not pollute the air in basco a 
town of 6000 people all batanes has only 120 motor vehicles and 
twothirds are motorcycles 
if roosters crowing can be called noise pollution it is the 
most common form 
lt col jesus poblete provincial military commander said i 
dont feel very busy here 
his major challenge is the occasional taiwanese fishing vessel 
encroaching on philippine waters otherwise he said all we do 
is run train and have meetings i dont have much to do 
i think its the perpetual serenity which we dont find in the 
metropolitan areas that keeps people here said tess castillejos 
an inlaw of the governor and native of batanes who returned with 
her husband after several years in manila 
in manila i spent the whole day taking my children to and 
from school and driving to stores here i kiss them in the morning 
and they come home in the afternoon i can walk everywhere 
because of frequent storms in the balintang channel commercial 
ships do not run regular services between batanes and luzon 140 
miles to the south 
most supplies come on lst landing craft which the philippine 
navy uses extensively for interisland traffic 
they reach batanes about every three months one ran aground in 
the harbor during a storm last year and its hulk is still there 
quietly rusting 
philippine air lines provides the main link with the world a 
daily flight often canceled because of bad weather 
a siren heralds the planes arrival and scores of townspeople 
usually go to meet it since the airport is within walking distance 
of downtown basco 
there is no television and residents can pick up philippine 
state radio for only a few hours a day on a relay from tuguegarao 
200 miles south 
that hardly matters because only a few hundred homes in basco 
can receive the parttime electricity when the juice comes on for 
four hours each evening residents flock to makeshift theaters 
where local entrepreneurs show movies at 5 pesos 25 cents a head 
those who have seen the available movies watch or participate in 
pickup basketball games in the town square until the electricity 
goes off 
fishing swimming biking thats about all the recreation 
here said aniano bata 45 a lifelong resident its good 
clean fun

the nations largest school system with nearly 1 
million students has been beset by reports of drug abuse theft and 
sexual misconduct by teachers principals and school board 
officials 
new yorkers will have their first opportunity to render an 
electoral verdict on the scandals in todays elections for new 
community school board members but few expected a large turnout 
and no one even knows if the results of the election will stand 
up a federal judge last week struck down a new law prohibiting 
school employees political office holders and party officials from 
sitting on the boards but challenges were expected 
all of this is making the voters feel somewhat powerless 
said state assemblyman jose serrano of the bronx 
the citys 32 school boards were set up two decades ago when the 
citys school system was decentralized to help parents and 
communities get a handle on their neighborhood schools 
the local boards operate 800 elementary and intermediate 
schools each board hires its schools principals assistant 
principals and district administrators and is responsible for 
educating about 20000 children from kindergarten through grades 8 
or 9 
the school system also maintains a bureaucracy of employees who 
work in the central board of education headquarters the central 
board operates the citys 115 senior high schools negotiates 
citywide contracts maintains the systems 900 schools sets 
citywide policy and in theory oversees the community boards 
but in the last few months five school board officials in the 
bronx have been indicted on felony charges ranging from theft to 
bribe taking outraged over alleged criminality and proved 
mismanagement schools chancellor richard r green has suspended 
two bronx school boards 
there also have been reports that principals and other 
administrators obtained their positions by paying bribes to school 
board members 
the notion that you become a principal not on the merits but 
on the basis of how much money you got in your pocket to me is 
just mind boggling and its outrageous it just makes my blood 
boil said james f gill a lawyer and former prosecutor heading 
a city commission charged with investigating the allegations of 
wrongdoing 
at one school meeting in the bronx women publicly confronted a 
school official with allegations he had offered to trade jobs for 
sex recent newspaper articles have told of boozeanddrug parties 
on school property graft and corruption 
the scandals broke last november when a principal at a bronx 
elementary school was arrested on drug charges that was followed 
by arrests of several teachers on similar charges 
criminal inquiries of some boards are under way in the boroughs 
of manhattan the bronx brooklyn and queens only staten island 
has escaped 
educators analysts and teacher union officials agree that the 
wrongdoing at the root of the scandals has had an affect on the 
performance of many schools 
when people are misusing funds then it takes away resources 
from the educational program it directly affects what goes on in 
the schools said thurston a atkins a longtime observer of 
decentralization and a professor at columbia universitys teachers 
college 
a bronx teacher who who asked not to be identified put it more 
succinctly it kills morale when you have to worry am i going to 
have enough chalk enough of this enough of that 
the school systems decentralization was a product of the 
turbulent 1960s a lengthy citywide teachers strike and pressure 
from militant civilrights activists 
the reform divided up the system to give local residents 
particularly parents a greater voice in the operation of the 
schools 
but with a disturbingly low voter turnout of 5 percent not 
uncommon in school elections some boards are dominated not by 
parents but by political hacks who allegedly dole out jobs to 
supporters friends relatives and sometimes applicants willing to 
put cash in the right pockets 
stanley s litlow executive director of interface a research 
organization concerned with education has studied the schools for 
a dozen years and blames voter apathy on the timing of the 
elections which are not held on regular election days but in the 
spring of every third year and the little media attention they 
generally get 
the confused structure of the school system also promotes 
low turnout he said

children like adults may be keenly conscious 
of their waistlines and many have tried dieting a hospital survey 
suggests 
nearly half of 318 elementary school children surveyed worried 
they were overweight and more than a third said they had attempted 
diets according to a study released monday 
this study tells us that its not just the 15 20 or 
40yearolds who feel theyre overweight 9 and 10yearolds feel 
the same way said dr michael j maloney director of psychiatry 
and psychology at childrens hospital medical center in cincinnati 
the study a survey of dieting behavior and eating attitudes 
in children will be published in septembers issue of 
pediatrics a monthly professional journal 
researchers at the hospital surveyed girls and boys in the third 
through sixth grades at two randomly hosen schools in middleincome 
cincinnatiarea neighborhoods 
of those surveyed the researchers said 45 percent indicated 
they were uncomfortable with their bodies and wanted to be thinner 
thirtyseven percent said they had already tried to lose weight 
maloney said 
girls in grades five and six reported significantly more 
discomfort about their bodies than girls in grades three and four 
or boys in all grades he said 
a total of 69 percent gave responses similar to those obtained 
in studies of teenagers and young adult females who suffer from 
anorexia nervosa a condition characterized by severe and prolonged 
inability or refusal to eat he said 
previous research has determined that 70 percent of 
17yearold girls think theyre overweight but only 20 to 30 
percent really are he said 
the researchers plan a sixyear followup study in hopes of 
learning more about the possible causes of eating disorders and 
ways to treat them 
maloney planned to present his findings thursday to the american 
society for pediatric research in washington

twenty tons of rocket fuel 
burst into flame monday in a munitions igloo sending a cloud of 
smoke and fumes 1000 feet into the air officials said there were 
no injuries 
the blaze burned part of the domed storage area and scorched a 
2000squarefoot area of adjacent grass before being put out 1 
hours after it started said air force sgt louis aranabarradas 
lt col bruce rianda said there was no explosion but said the 
minuteman i missile propellant burned rapidly at this base about 20 
miles north of salt lake city 
there was no damage estimate but aranabarradas said the igloo 
was built to withstand this kind of stuff 
the cloud of smoke and fumes which rose 1000 feet above the 
igloo drifted south over the base and dispersed into the 
atmosphere base officials said in a statement 
taking into account the possibility that someone might have come 
into contact with remants of the cloud base environmental 
officials cautioned that the type of fire involved normally 
produces large amounts of hydrogen chloride gas which could 
irritate the nose throat and lungs the statement said 
an investigation into the fire was not expected to begin until 
noon tuesday because of a mandatory waiting period to allow the 
igloo to cool off before air force munitions crews can enter 
aranabarradas said

murphys law caught up with the murphy bed when 
a federal appeals court ruled that the name of the famous folddown 
bed is now so commonly used that its no longer protected by 
trademark laws 
we hold that murphy bed is a generic term having been 
appropriated by the public to designate generally a type of bed 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals said monday in overturning 
part of a lower court ruling 
the 2nd circuit ruled that a federal judge on long island erred 
in finding companies in georgia and florida both named murphy bed 
co of america inc had infringed on the trademark rights of the 
murphy door bed co which was founded in 1925 by the inventor of 
the disappearing bed 
but like murphys law in which anything that can go wrong will 
the appeals court also had some bad news for the murphy bed 
imitators 
we agree with the district court that defendants engaged in 
unfair competition by passing off beds of their own manufacture as 
beds of the murphy co which is based in amittyville 
the court also affirmed us district judge jacob mishlers 
injunction which bars the two companies from using the term 
murphy bed 
at the turn of the century william lawrence murphy invented a 
bed that could be concealed in a wall closet when not in use he 
patented the idea in 1918 
at least twice murphy successfully convinced imitators who 
marketed their products as murphy beds to use a different name 
but the appeals court noted that in 1981 and in 1982 the 
federal patent and trademark office refused the murphy cos bid to 
register murphy bed as a trademark and a trademark appeals 
board found in 1984 that murphy bed has for a long period of time 
been used by a substantial segment of the public as a generic term 
for a bed which folds into a wall or closet 
while affirming the 6330 in damages awarded the murphy door 
bed co for breach of contract the appeals court dismissed the 
801161 awarded in compensatory damages and sent the case back to 
mishler for a recalculation based on the florida and georgia 
companies net profits 
court papers did not specify in which cities the companies are 
based

in its final days this countrys 
election campaign is getting nasty even by central americas 
roughandtumble standards 
stumping opposition candidates for the presidency and other 
national and local posts call government leaders treacherous slime 
thugs and thieves 
the eightparty progovernment coalition counters with a 
television ad featuring president bush speaking with a bogus 
voiceover in english with spanish subtitles 
the voiceover picking up on a published report has bush 
admitting he authorized 10 million to subsidize opposition 
parties although the us administration has not commented on the 
report 
washington contends forces loyal to panamas de facto leader 
gen manuel antonio noriega intend to rig sundays election 
billboards proclaiming the charms of opposition presidential 
candidate guillermo endara have had large american flag decals 
pasted on them with the slogan for 10 million he sold out his 
country 
much of the vilification has been undertaken in the name of two 
dead men gen omar torrijos the charismatic dictator who died in 
a plane crash in 1981 and arnulfo arias madrid the grand old man 
of the panamanian opposition 
arias was thrown out of the presidency three times by coups and 
died last year at age 87 
both men had large almost fantaical cultlike personal 
followings something both endara and progovernment candidate 
carlos duque lack 
even some of endaras posters carry pictures not of him but of 
arias duques ads rarely mention his name without invoking the 
memory of torrijos the prime mover in getting the united states to 
agree to turn the panama canal over to panama at the end of the 
century 
this weeks cocktail party joke goes like this 
torrijos and arias meet in heaven you look a little tired 
observes torrijos 
you look a little worn yourself replies arias 
i know says the general maybe we should stop campaigning 
so hard

sanctions but failed and the relationship has since been as tense

his catch gave him quite a battle but a 
fisherman known as salmon bill landed the seasons first salmon 
on maines penobscot river earning him the right to offer his 
prize to the president 
bill ellison 41 who lives in a tent near the river during the 
maymidoctober season caught the 25inch 6pound fish early 
monday 
this fish took me out in the middle of the river three or four 
times she didnt want to come ashore no how and it was nip and 
tuck right up to the end but she finally came in said ellison 
who was among about 100 anglers in the penobscot near bangor for 
the opening of season 
within hours the fish had been certified as a searun salmon 
and up to standards for delivery to the white house in keeping 
with tradition 
maine inland fisheries and wildlife department officials were 
making arrangements for a presentation later this month to 
president bush who is a fishing enthusiast said department 
spokesman paul fournier 
ellisons offer continues a tradition that started in 1912 when 
a searun salmon was presented to president william howard taft 
pollution of the penobscot forced a halt to the practice during 
the 1960s but with cleanup efforts extensive restocking removal 
of some dams and construction of fish ladders the tradition was 
revived after president reagan was elected

a wolf that ran wild in a residential area 
and ate a pet rabbit belongs to actor sam j jones but the flash 
gordon star wont be getting his pet back authorities said 
we believe he purchased it as a pup from a breeder so it was 
raised in a sort of domestic environment but still you cant have 
them lt marshall vernon of the citys department of animal 
regulation said monday 
the 100pound wolf a fullgrown female named hurricane was 
captured april 14 near the encino reservoir in the san fernando 
valley 
residents of the hillside neighborhood had complained that a 
huge white dog had been roaming the area for about two months and 
gobbled down a rabbit 
vernon said the predator is probably an endangered gray wolf 
its nearest wild relatives are in alaska or minnesota 
in addition to starring in the 1980 movie flash gordon 
jones appeared in 10 and in the television series hardcastle 
and mccormick hunter and highwaymen 
his personal manager stan kamens said he had no knowledge of 
the matter and would not comment 
keeping wolves within city limits without a permit is a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up 
to 500 said lt fred michael of the animal regulation department 
but he said there were no immediate plans to prosecute jones 
hurricane apparently lived by hunting wild rabbits ground 
squirrels opossums and quail in the uninhabited brush around the 
reservoir officials said 
we want to give the wolf to some type of a sanctuary that can 
handle that type of animal we just dont want to send it 
anywhere vernon said shes not going back to the owner

lainos party received 148202 or 199 percent 
the colorados would thus by law receive 24 of the 36 senate 
seats and 48 spots in the 72seat chamber of deputies 
rodriguez 65 an army general and longtime aide to stroessner 
dissolved congress after leading the feb 3 coup that ended nearly 
35 years of stroessner rule he served as provisional president 
since then stroessner also belonged to the party which has been 
in power since 1947 
turnout appeared high across this landlocked south american 
nation of 4 million despite cloudy skies light rain and cool fall 
weather 
diplomats and foreign observers said the balloting and vote 
count were reasonably fair and rodriguez clearly won 
i think it was a very good attempt at something they have 
never done before said british ambassador john grant mcdonald 
presidential candidate carlos ferreira ibarra of the liberal 
party acknowledged that rodriguez won 
laino a former exile said earlier monday that the voting 
irregularities were numerous and serious we do not have all the 
information but the irregularities exceeded our expectations 
election observers and party officials said not every citizen 
was able to vote in private ballots of opposition parties were 
stolen and so not available at election tables indelible ink was 
not always used to prevent multiple voting and the government 
added voters to the official list after the registration period 
ended three weeks ago 
euclides acevedo president of the revolutionary febrerista 
party said ballots for his party were stolen at several voting 
stations by colorado supporters who simply put them in their 
pockets 
but fernando vera the partys presidential nominee said the 
four opposition parties were not about to withdraw from the 
election 
why the obsession about withdrawing vera asked a reporter 
no one has to withdraw from the process what must be done is 
determine on the basis of results if the fraud was significant 
in its entirety or not 
government and colorado party officials denied irregularities 
were widespread organized by them or influenced the outcome 
paraguayans seemed to accept as unavoidable one more general in 
the national palace and the colorados once more in control of 
congress given the suddenness of elections following a long 
dictatorship 
my party was founded in 1965 this is the first time were 
participating in elections said martin caceres 28 a christian 
democrat 
people are hopeful he said standing in a school courtyard 
the period of stroessner hasnt ended but this is a 
beneficial transition peaceful with people getting used to 
democracy 
in coronel oviedo a large rural town 80 miles east of the 
capital city of asuncion peasants traveled along muddy roads to 
voting stations by flatbed truck horse bicycle and tractor 
the last time i voted was in stroessners second 
reelection in the late 1960s said dario benitez 60 then i 
quit because i didnt like him anymore 
since becoming provisional president rodriguez has criticized 
the former regime permitted banned newspapers and political 
parties to operate and mended fences with foreign governments and 
the roman catholic church prominent stroessner aides and ministers 
have been arrested 
stroessner 76 lives in exile in brazil

fans sipped champagne and led cheers in 
greek as st johns college won its only official intercollegiate 
athletic event defeating the us naval academy at a daylong 
croquet tournament 
the 6hour match played sunday after rain postponed it for a 
day ended with the home team capturing the annapolis cup 
the music of vivaldi and beethoven filled the air and some 
spectators alternated between watching the game and reading george 
orwells down and out in paris and london 
the croquet tournament is not so much an athletic event as a 
chance for neighboring schools that normally have little contact to 
have a little fun together 
while the academy turns out naval officers drilled in tactics 
and terminology st johns produces a small crop of literary 
scholars versed in shakespeare and socrates 
members of the two teams planned to meet later this week at a 
restaurant where the tournament trophy is kept i see that as a 
step forward in the midshipmenjohnnie relationship said george

hes a federal bureaucrat by day an opera 
singer by night and soon to be making his debut in a broadwaystyle 
musical i understand how clark kent feels says vladimir 
ekzarkhov 
after he leaves his 8 to 5 job as a mildmannered government 
financial analyst ekzarkhov ducks into a dressing room and emerges 
as a theatrical version of superman playing dual roles as a 
brooklyn dockhand and a new york cop in arena stages recreation of 
on the town 
the hit 1944 musical created by the best in show business 
music by leonard bernstein book and lyrics by betty comden and 
adolph green and choreography by jerome robbins is the story of 
three sailors on 24hour shore leave in new york city during world 
war ii 
the arena stage production which opens thursday and will run 
through june 4 will be the first major revival of on the town 
since 1971 at new yorks city center and the first ever presented 
at a theater in the round this production was underwritten by 
american telephone amp telegraph co 
arena stage has no orchestra pit so musical director william 
huckaby installed his 18 musicians under the stage and will conduct 
while peeking up at the actors and dancers through a manhole in the 
floor 
ekzarkhov shows off his booming bass voice in the opening 
number i feel like im not out of bed yet as a workman at the 
brooklyn navy yard at 6 feet 3 inches and 235 pounds hes 
physically right for the part 
its a wonderful piece he says the only bone i have to 
pick with bernstein is that he didnt write at least 10 more 
pages 
ekzarkhov 42 is the son of russian emigres who fled their 
homeland after the 1917 revolution and met in austria where they 
were married and ekzarkhov was born he was 5 when he and his 
parents moved to the united states and settled in erie pa home 
of a large russian and polish community 
it was a comfortable place to grow up in said ekzarkhov a 
high school pal was fred biletnikoff who later earned fame as a 
star pass receiver for the oakland raiders 
ekzarkhov learned to sing in the local russian orthodox church 
choir under the direction of his steelworker father they really 
like their basses to sing very low he said 
he met his wife dusia the daughter of soviet emigres at a new 
years eve party in 1969 in washington while he was on shore leave 
from the navy they still prefer to speak russian at home after 
nearly 20 years of marriage 
the couple and their two young children spent 2 satisfying 
years in the central volga region of the soviet union where 
ekzarkhov was office manager for an occidental petroleum chemical 
plant then returned to washington and its russianspeaking 
community for good 
it was an incredible experience ekzarkhov recalls the 
people there looked exactly like the people i grew up with in erie 
in a way we came home yet as americans we couldnt help noticing 
that our point of reference was america 
with a family to support and a mortgage to pay ekzarkhov took a 
job at the federal energy regulatory commission where he 
specializes in gas transmission rate cases 
im not knocking my job he says but its not what i want 
on my tombstone 
ekzarkhov discovered his true passion singing when he landed 
a job in the chorus of a local amateur opera production of verdis 
aida 10 years ago encouraged by friends voice teachers and 
auditioners including sovietborn conductor mstislav rostropovich 
he has sung with the washington opera the summer opera theater at 
catholic university the opera orchestra of new york opera bel 
canto and local oratorio societies 
im right up against reality now ekzarkhov adds im at 
the point where i need an agent you cant do anything in opera 
without an agent i guess i never followed through because it would 
mean living out of a suitcase at very reduced pay 
hes clearly ready to take the plunge though whenever his 
persistent round of recitals choral work stage appearances and 
auditions finally pays off either in opera or musical comedy 
ive spent many lonely hours singing at the piano says 
ekzarkhov i keep saying to myself what am i doing here who am 
i kidding 
but then theres the ecstasy of being on stage and performing 
at this level whats important is that the audience have this look 
on their faces if you can get the audience to get a little wet in 
the eyes youve gotten them thats it

president bush vowed read my lips no new 
taxes all through his presidential campaign but never indicated 
for how long the message would be displayed there 
administration officials now are reluctantly conceding that bush 
may only stick to the pledge for a year and that higher taxes may 
be part of a fiscal 1991 budget agreement 
one possibility actively being considered is a swap trading 
white house support for some new taxes most likely on gasoline 
for concessions from congress in other areas like a cut in the 
capital gains tax rate said the sources speaking on the condition 
of anonymity 
bush has long made chopping the capital gains tax rate a key 
item claiming it will eventually raise revenue for the treasury 
but it has found scant support in the democratic controlled 
congress which questions the logic of trying to raise revenue by 
cutting taxes 
despite bushs rhetoric against new taxes reiterated as 
recently as monday in a speech to the us chamber of commerce 
many economists say higher taxes seem all but inevitable to get the 
federal deficit estimated at 163 billion this year under 
control 
in fact to many analysts it was only a matter of time before 
the administration conceded that some forms of tax hikes were 
needed 
administration officials still havent done this publicly but 
privately they admit contingency planning is under way on new taxes 
and on what tradeoffs the administration might be able to wrest 
from congress in exchange for white house support for them 
even the nonewtaxes budget compromise bush recently reached 
with congress for fiscal year 1990 calls for 53 billion in 
unspecified new revenues 
bush has claimed that slashing the capital gains tax from the 
present 28 percent to 15 percent will produce the bulk of this 
48 billion but since congress seems unlikely to go along with 
this tax cut some way must still be found this year to come up 
with the 53 billion 
and a weakening economy could make the projected 1990 deficit 
even larger than the 986 billion bush projected in his budget 
submission to congress meaning even more new revenues will be 
needed to meet deficit targets of the grammrudman law 
that budgetbalancing act requires a deficit of no more than 
100 billion in fiscal 1990 or automatic acrosstheboard cuts 
are triggered 
budget director richard darman will issue revised economic 
assumptions on the economy on july 15 
some administration sources suggested that a 
gastaxforcapitalgainscut deal might even be considered as 
early as then if the new economic numbers prove to be gloomy 
but generally administration officials said the presidents 
clear intention was to honor his campaign vow through this year 
after that all bets are off 
bush on monday showed no indication he was ready to make a deal 
however in his speech to the us chamber of commerce he said 
i mean to live by what ive said no new taxes 
bush told the chamber of commerce we dont have to raise 
taxes we have to release the energies of free enterprise he 
said his favorite source of new revenue was the capital gains 
tax cut 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said monday we 
are talking to the taxwriting committees about it the capital 
gains tax cut but we wouldnt want to speculate on how it might 
come out at this time 
the notion of a deal trading support for higher gasoline taxes 
for a cut in the capital gains tax was first raised the weekend 
before last in a session between bush and a group of economists at 
the presidential retreat in camp david md 
although bush was generally noncommittal he did not object to 
discussing possible higher taxes and the proposed swap was 
endorsed by some of the economists present according to the 
sources 
the federal gasoline tax is now 91 cents per gallon 
there have been a variety of congressional proposals for raising 
the gasoline tax for amounts ranging from a few cents up to 50 
cents a gallon however a major obstacle to any such rise is the 
opposition of senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen

the bush administration is delaying the 
deadline for employers to begin using complex tests to prove that 
their health insurance plans do not discriminate against lowerpaid 
workers 
the testing requirement enacted at the request of the reagan 
administration as part of the 1986 tax overhaul imposes an 
unreasonable compliance burden on business treasury secretary 
nicholas brady said 
he chose a meeting of business executives at the us chamber of 
commerce on monday to announce we have ordered a delay until 
oct 1 in the beginning date for testing plans for compliance 
with internal revenue code section 89 regulations 
the audience which has made repeal or modification of the law a 
major goal applauded loudly 
brady said the goal of the legislation to ensure that 
taxdeductible fringe benefits are distributed equitably among 
workers was a good one a system that differentiates between 
people in the matter of health benefits subsidized by the taxpayers 
cannot be sustained he said 
nevertheless the cost of compliance is excessive brady said 
the law needs to be changed and we stand ready to encourage 
support and work with congress to revise and improve it 
more than half the members of the house and a large number of 
senators are sponsoring bills to repeal the provision or change it 
significantly the house ways and means committee whose chairman 
and most of its members are sponsoring one modification bill was 
holding hearings on the subject today 
the law requires employers to conduct a lengthy series of 
complex tests to demonstrate that employee benefits especially 
health insurance are not weighted against workers making less than 
50000 a year 
paperwork required by the law is so voluminous that some 
employers are threatening to withdraw health insurance coverage for 
all employees 
the section 89 rules went into effect on jan 1 but the irs 
freed employers from any significant compliance requirements until 
july 1 and agreed that no employer would be penalized if a 
goodfaith effort to follow the rules was made the remainder of 
1989 
the federal government forgoes more than 30 billion a year in 
taxes on the value of employerfinanced health insurance the 
employer deducts the cost as a business expense and the employee 
excludes the value from taxable income 
under the section 89 law highly compensated employees may be 
subject to taxation on the excess coverage if their health plan is 
more valuable than is offered to rankandfile workers 
under the house substitute plan employers that provide a health 
plan would have to offer coverage costing workers 10 a week or 
less 25 or less for a family plan to 90 percent of employees 
higherpaid workers would be taxed on the value of coverage that 
was better than that provided other employees

womens rights advocates are hailing a supreme 
court ruling they say will lower a catch 22 barrier to 
advancement in the workplace 
women often have had be assertive to win promotion they say 
but at the same time not offend employers by sacrificing 
femininity they said mondays ruling is an important step in 
limiting the impact of such sexual stereotyping 
the court said employers must bear the burden of proving they 
did not discriminate illegally once there is evidence bias played a 
part in personnel decisions 
sarah burns of the national organization for women legal defense 
fund said the ruling is an important victory for womens rights 
in these situations there is substantial doubt who is going to 
win she said now that were going to see a shift in the 
focus its sufficient for a plaintiff to win 
ms burns said the decision will help overcome a dual standard 
she labeled a catch 22 that has held women back 
its been that you had to have the attributes of an assertive 
manager but also all the attributes of a passive feminine 
nonassertive woman she said 
by a 63 vote the justices ordered further lower court hearings 
in a suit against the accounting firm price waterhouse by a former 
employee ann hopkins 
ms hopkins said she was denied partnership because of macho 
attitudes that in effect demanded she behave more like a lady 
the firm said other factors such as her failure to get along 
with others were decisive 
mondays decision may leave some questions unanswered because 
only four justices agreed on the standards that should govern such 
mixedmotive discrimination cases there were three separate 
opinions by the six justices in the majority 
this may not clarify things because of the split decision 
said douglas mcdowell of the equal employment advisory council that 
sided with price waterhouse 
but judith winston of the womens legal defense fund said 
although this is not a complete victory we consider it to be in 
the win category we are gratified that the court said that once a 
woman proves gender was a factor the burden shifts to the 
employer 
price waterhouse in a statement said it expects to win against 
ms hopkins when the suit returns to federal trial court 
we are confident that after the lower court reconsiders the 
case it will conclude ms hopkins was denied partnership for 
legitimate reasons the company said 
ms hopkins is seeking back pay and possibly reinstatement to 
the firm with promotion to partnership 
the high court rejected a federal appeals courts requirement 
that price waterhouse show clear and convincing evidence its 
actions were unbiased it is enough that the company show by a 
preponderance of the evidence it did not practice illegal 
discrimination the court said 
the clear and convincing standard usually means that to 
successfully defend against a lawsuit an employer must show 
overwhelming evidence in its favor by contrast a preponderance 
standard means an employer wins by showing more evidence than not 
is on its side 
the ruling is based on an interpretation of title vii of the 
1964 civil rights act banning discrimination based on race 
religion and national origin as well as gender 
ms hopkins formerly a senior manager for price waterhouse 
here quit the firm after she was denied partnership and later 
became a consultant to the world bank 
while she was under consideration for the promotion at the 
accounting firm critics and supporters said she sometimes was 
overly aggressive too harsh impatient with her staff and very 
demanding 
she said one partner who supported her for promotion told her 
she would stand a better chance of advancement if she would walk 
more femininely talk more femininely dress more femininely wear 
makeup have her hair styled and wear jewelry 
in other action the court 
agreed to consider blocking the partial merger of detroits two 
daily newspapers the court will hear a challenge to former 
attorney general edwin meeses decision allowing a joint operating 
agreement of the newspapers 
ruled unanimously that additional environmentalimpact studies 
are not required before building a ski resort in washington state 
and completing a dam in oregon 
agreed to use a case involving the michigan chamber of commerce 
to restudy what limits should be placed on campaign spending by 
political groups that incorporate 
agreed to hear in an ohio case a bush administration appeal 
aimed at allowing the government to collect potentially hundreds of 
millions of dollars in taxes from multinational corporations 
ruled 54 in a case from iowa that lawyers may not be forced 
by federal law to represent poor people in noncriminal federal 
cases

one of the state departments most experienced 
latin america hands is in line to become ambassador to the 
organization of american states as part of an administration effort 
to revitalize that institution according to us officials 
president bush is expected to appoint luigi einaudi 52 a 
righthand man to the last six assistant secretaries of state for 
interamerican affairs to the oas post succeeding former 
ambassador richard mccormack the officials who confirmed einaudis 
prospective appointment asked not to be identified 
one of a handful of intellectuals at the state department 
einaudi has a doctorate in political science from harvard and is a 
recipient of the highest award in the career public service 
he was once called by former secretary of state george p shultz 
the state departments leading expert on uslatin american 
relations 
because of budgetary constraints partly brought on by us 
failure to meet its quota commitments the oas has been forced to 
negotiate early retirement for about 300 of its estimated 1000 
employees over the past several weeks 
the bush administration has promised to seek full funding for 
the oas in 1990 and is showing support in other ways 
as an example secretary of state james a baker iii had a 
private meeting recently with oas secretary general joao baena 
soares officials said they could not recall shultz ever having had 
such a meeting during his seven years as secretary of state 
the administration also has been looking to the oas to play an 
active role in monitoring the political process under way in 
nicaragua that is scheduled to result in national elections next 
february 
a generation ago the oas was at the center of political debate 
in the hemisphere it imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic 
sanctions against cuba in 1964 for attempting to promote revolution 
in venezuela it also was deeply involved in the diplomatic process 
that followed the us invasion of the dominican republic the 
following year 
however the oas has been at the periphery of events for much of 
this decade playing little or no role in such issues as the 
malvinasfalklands war of 1982 the grenada invasion of 1983 and 
the conflicts in central america 
us officials said baker envisions a stronger role for the oas 
under bush as part of a us shift in emphasis toward multilateral 
diplomacy

a group of texas investors in a gas well that 
yielded huge profits for house speaker jim wright defend their 
dealings as legitimate and say the report of the house ethics 
committees outside counsel is misleading 
the investors who have been subpoenaed to testify wednesday 
before the panel issued a report on monday through their 
washington lawyer stanley brand attacking committee counsel 
richard j phelan 
phelans report shows a lack of basic understanding of the oil 
industry and the actual facts of this venture said the report 
which the group said it was issuing to set the record straight 
rather than acting as an impartial investigator mr phelan 
has displayed prosecutorial zeal without regard to innocent third 
parties who may stand in his way the report said 
wright and his defenders have taken to attacking phelan as part 
of their strategy to counter the 69 counts of rules violations 
lodged by the ethics committee brand was hired to represent the 
gas well investors at the suggestion of former democratic party 
chief john white a wright ally 
the group argued that a geological formation struck by the well 
continues to be promising even though it so far has been unable to 
produce commercial quantities of gas or oil and two earlier wells 
have been shut down 
the report states that phelan in characterizing the lucrative 
sale of wrights share in the venture as a gift has shown a 
fundamental misunderstanding of the oil business because the 
share had a high value 
the remaining partners in the venture plan to spend another 2 
million to drill again because they estimate there remains some 88 
million in recoverable oil and gas in their leased tract near the 
louisianatexas line according to the report 
brand said the group which includes san antonio financier 
morris jaffe and his son md doug jaffe has not yet decided 
whether to honor the ethics committees subpoena calling for them 
to testify on wednesday and thursday 
also subpoenaed are dave myers who has a working interest in 
the venture and supplied the drilling equipment jeff prestridge a 
geologist who consulted on sabine lake for the group and marlyn 
cherry a bookkeeper for the jaffes 
the five had been subpoenaed for interviews last week but 
failed to show up when the ethics committees two senior members 
chairman julian dixon dcalif and ranking republican john t 
myers of indiana traveled to san antonio to speak with them 
the committee later reiterated its subpoenas and ordered the 
five to appear on wednesday and thursday of this week

over the next six months us savings bonds 
will be earning the highest rate of return in three years the 
government says 
the new rate which took effect monday will be 781 percent up 
from the rate of 735 percent that had been in effect over the past 
six months the new rate is the highest return for savers since the 
bonds earned 836 percent for the sxmonth period ending in april 
1986 
interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year on may 1 and 
nov 1 to reflect open market rates the rate is based on 85 
percent of the yield on fiveyear treasury securities which have 
averaged 919 percent over the past six months 
since the government switched to market rates for savings bonds 
in november 1982 the rate of return has averaged 829 percent 
investors who hold their bonds for at least five years earn the 
average of the halfyear rtes 
jerrold b speers executive director of the savings bond 
program called the new rate terrific news for savers 
when looked at in combination of the other benefits of bonds 
including tax advantages complete safety against loss ease of 
purchase it is clear that this new rate makes savings bonds an 
unbeatable deal speers said 
investors are guaranteed a minimum interest rate regardless of 
what the market rates do that minimum guaranteed rate is currently 
6 percent but for bonds purchased before nov 1 1986 the minimum 
is 75 percent 
since market rates for bonds were introduced the rates have 
ranged from a high of 1094 percent for the six months beginning in 
november 1984 to a low of 584 percent for the six months beginning 
in may 1987

a house subcommittee this week will be 
examining whether americans are getting imported produce sprayed 
with usmade pesticides that are outlawed for use here 
rep mike synar dokla who chairs the subcommittee on 
environment energy and natural resources said he is concerned the 
environmental protection agency isnt adequately informing other 
countries about the chemicals theyre buying from american 
companies to enhance crop production 
many of these countries do not have the resources or 
information needed to ensure that pesticides are used safely 
said synar 
he said they need help developing regulations and they need 
information 
theyre not getting enough of either he said 
synar noted that pesticide exports have increased and so have 
foreign food imports 
he said his subcommittee which will hold a hearing on the issue 
wednesday will review epas efforts to protect american consumers 
from imported food contaminated by pesticides which are prohibited 
from use domestically 
jay vroom spokesman for the national agricultural chemicals 
association said some of the pesticides that are exported are 
unregistered here because they are designed to combat insects that 
exist only in the climate of the foreign country 
but he said it is in the best interests of the industry to have 
as much information available to buyers as possible 
we support access to information delivery of information and 
delivery of educational packages that do some good not just arrive 
on a dock somewhere said vroom 
he said his organization has conducted educational programs on 
pesticide use for foreign buyers 
through the united nations efforts are under way to develop an 
international system of pesticide information exchange and export 
notification said synar 
adoption of a system of prior informed consent is an important 
first step toward improving the information base for many 
countries he said however our current notification system 
must be improved 
epa attorney bob perlis said federal law requires that companies 
planning to export unregistered pesticides obtain a signed 
statement from the foreign buyer saying the buyer understands that 
the pesticide is not allowed to be sold in the united states 
a copy of that statement is then sent to a representative of 
the foreign countrys government said perlis 
he said the registration of pesticides is canceled from time to 
time by the epa and when that happens countries that have 
purchased the product are notified the reason for the cancellation 
there is not a pesticide product produced in this country 
which could not be exported under the law said perlis 
over the past decade global pesticide use has doubled said 
synar 
the united states is a major pesticide producer supplying about 
onequarter of the world market he said adding that about 25 
percent of the us pesticide exports are unregistered 
garry hamlin spokesman for dow chemical co said his company 
follows the law explicitly 
he also said we do not ship banned products or products that 
are severely restricted to other countries which is not to say we 
do not ship products that are not registered in the united states 
he said dow is seeking registration on a number of products that 
are not registered here

the morton downey jr show and other 
interview programs with a bent for the weird and rowdy have a place 
in television because they put viewers in touch with issues 
defenders of socalled trash tv say 
and even if theyre just plain bizarre shows like crime 
time that feature exfelons singing dancing or cooking also 
deserve to be aired in a free society a panel of producers 
journalists and advertisers said monday during a lively discussion 
of television from mash to trash at the national association 
of broadcasters convention 
in a session that at times threatened to veer into a 
downeybrook morton downeys producer bill boggs crossed 
swords with outraged audience members who said downey was lowering 
tv standards 
were not yelling and hollering about transvestites and mud 
wrestling boggs said were dealing with issues 
were raising our voice about things that are on the front 
page of the la times the new york times and washington post 
he said the issues downey treats such as gun control politics 
and the ku klux klan would generate heated arguments in many homes 
as for downeys style he said in a loud voice what is wrong 
with people raising their voice 
david crook a tv writer for the los angeles times said there 
is a big difference between talk shows of the 1960s and geraldo 
riveras show on monday which visited nevadas notorious mustang 
ranch house of prostitution 
crook said downey and geraldo were providing an interesting 
counter to traditional journalism and were getting people on 
the street to discuss issues 
boggs agreed saying our guy has broken the mold of the 
polite host whos being neutral 
moderator james bohannon who is the host of crime time and 
its companion the talk show felon interview progam suggested 
that the trend was for television shows to be more sensational 
jennings bryant of the university of alabama said he was 
concerned about the social effects on children who may watch shows 
that feed on polarizing their audiences 
and nbc censor alan gerson said he could foresee an advertiser 
backlash developing 
if the environment for the commercial messages isnt 
acceptable that could be a problem he said if all commercial 
advertisers decide that the program isnt commercially viable then 
the program wont be commercially viable there are a number of 
checks and balances 
but in an era of cable tv there are a lot of different voices 
and different program standards what is not suitable for nbc may 
be acceptable on other outlets he said 
robert bolte an executive with the clorox co said clorox 
doesnt advertise on such shows because they dont provide the 
proper environment for clorox products 
not even toilet bowl cleaner or something of that nature 
bohannon deadpanned to huge laughter in the room

president bush who received 35 million to 
make the transition from candidate to president between his 
election and inauguration days has returned more than a third of 
the money to the treasury 
bush spent 221 million to facilitate his entry into the 
nations highest office and returned 129 million to the 
taxpayers according to the final balance sheet released monday 
under a new federal law bush had been allocated 15 million 
more than former president ronald reagan to make the transition 
into office according to raymond a fontaine comptroller of the 
general services administration which administers transition 
accounts but the increase also tightened regulations for reporting 
private sector donations 
bush raised no private money said fontaine who has headed the 
financial aspects of the transition process since lyndon b johnson 
left the white house in 1969 
this was squeaky clean no outside money no outside gifts 
fontaine said the bush people refused to take free ibm 
typewriters or free general motors rental cars the reagan people 
took lots of freebies 
the president spent his transition funds primarily on salaries 
of the people who assisted in his smooth passage to a new 
administration said fontaine 
bush employed 225 people compared with the 400 government 
employees reagan used for the same purpose in 1981 reagan spent 
more than 17 million for transition according to fontaine 
this was a much slimmer transition than reagan had said 
fontaine smaller people smaller money they seem to be a little 
obsessed with this whole ethics thing 
the transition allocation for outgoing presidents to spend over 
the six months after leaving office was increased from 1 to 15 
million under the new law fontaine said reagans activities have 
included setting up the reagan presidential library

a food and drug administration advisory 
committee has recommended approval of an aerosol version of a drug 
that helps prevent a lifethreatening pneumonia in aids patients 
the fda is expected to agree and approve an aerosol version of 
pentamidine within weeks said an fda source who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
aerosol pentamidine has been widely available to aids patients 
since the fda in february allowed expanded distribution as an 
experimental medication under government review 
however many insurance plans do not cover experimental drugs 
fda approval would allow nearly universal reimbursement for aids 
patients using the drug 
the advisory committee recommended approval of the drug for 
preventing bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia which causes an 
estimated 60 percent of aids deaths 
pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable 
drug to treat those already suffering from pneumocycstis the spray 
version would make it easier to take into the lungs where the 
pneumonia infection first shows up

the dessert and hot topic was cheesecake 
nightingales star suzanne pleshette ate it as reallife nurses 
told her how not to portray them as the confection 
miss pleshette also apologized for the nbctv series portrayal 
of nurses as doctorchasing airheads and asked for their help 
save our show 
youre looking at a hit show thats about to be canceled as a 
result of the controversy the actress said unfortunately now 
the nurses are in a position to undo what theyve done they have 
to save us 
unless every nurse who wrote a letter before can fax a letter 
to nbc in the next two days we may be over and out said miss 
pleshette who portrays the den mother to a group of sexkitten 
nurses 
miss pleshette and coproducer douglas cramer met with nurses at 
union hospital on monday to discuss how the program could portray 
nurses more realistically 
we want the show kept on the air and to reflect nursing and 
health care as it could be said patricia lynch nursing 
administrator at the 201bed hospital in this town 30 miles west of 
new york city 
the program which premiered in january and is broadcast on 
wednesday nights has been criticized for demeaning the nursing 
profession in particular and women generally by portraying five 
student nurses as lusty bimbos the program often shows them in 
racy lingerie bouncy aerobic workouts and lockerroom disrobing 
sessions 
the 189000member american nurses association organized a 
massive letterwriting protest and sponsors including chrysler 
corp and sears roebuck and co have withdrawn advertisements from 
the show 
nbc is expected to decide whether to renew the show within two 
weeks 
last week executive producer aaron spelling said the series 
would show less skin and more nurses working in uniform if nbc 
brings it back next season he also said he would hire a nursing 
adviser to help the show depict more realistic situations 
barbara wright executive director of the new jersey state 
nurses association which has joined in the protest against the 
show said the group has been encouraged by the response to their 
complaints 
we would certainly want to consider any ways that things could 
be modified and create a positive image she said in a telephone 
interview 
ms lynch said she invited miss pleshette and cramer to union 
hospital because she believed the staff could provide constructive 
criticism they talked over a private lunch of shrimp cocktail 
followed by cheesecake 
we consider a show in its first season a work in progress 
miss pleshette said at a news conference 
we do not deny and we never deny that we made some mistakes 
after the shows initial episodes miss pleshette said she 
objected to the garter belts and bras the actresses wore and 
ordered appropriate undergarments 
changes were made but did not appear on television for about 
four episodes and well after the protests began because of the 
lag in airing primetime programs she said 
a show about nurses dealing with aids cancer and other 
diseases would make the program more interesting said ms lynch 
what really makes a nurse is whats inside her heart and her 
mind and how she deals with people and life issues she added 
thats more dramatic than seeing somebody jump up and down in 
their tights

utah scientists who captured worldwide 
attention with their claim to have achieved cold nuclear fusion 
were probably fooled by faulty calculations researchers from two 
of the nations most prominent science institutes say 
researchers from both the massachusetts institute of technology 
and the california institute of technology are challenging the cold 
fusion claim made at the university of utah 
nathan lewis said monday that he and other caltech researchers 
conducted the most precise effort yet to duplicate the utah 
experiment and found that no fusion took place he said the utah 
scientists calculated a gain in heat but that precise measurements 
at caltech showed no such gain 
papers prepared by mit researchers for presentation today at the 
american physical society meeting also reported that verification 
experiments conducted over a fiveweek period failed to detect any 
fusion reaction 
richard petrasso of mits plasma fusion center said the amount 
of neutrons another fusion byproduct emitted by the utah 
experiment was probably much lower than the utah scientists 
thought he said the claimed flow was inconsistent with other 
data reported from the utah experiment 
were asserting that their neutron emission was below what 
they thought it was including the possibility that it could have 
been none at all ronald r parker director of mits plasma 
fusion center said in a telephone interview monday 
the international physics community has spent millions of 
dollars over the last quarter century attempting to achieve fusion 
using massive machines filled with plasma heated to temperatures of 
up to 100 million degrees 
university of utah chemist b stanley pons and his collaborator 
martin fleischmann of englands university of southampton sent 
shock waves through the scientific world march 23 when they said 
they had achieved nuclear fusion using a simple electrochemical 
cell at room temperature 
pons and fleischmann said the cell used an electrode of 
palladium and one of platinum that were immersed in a flask of 
deuterium oxide or heavy water the researchers claimed that when 
an electrical current was applied to the electrodes deuterium 
nuclei were jammed into the crystal lattice of the palladium until 
the nuclei fused 
when the fusion occurred pons and fleischmann said the device 
produced four times more heat than was required to operate the 
experiment they later said the ratio of heat produced to heat 
expended could be up to 81 
but lewis said caltech researchers found a number of problems 
with the utah apparatus 
these problems may lead to errors large enough to cast serious 
doubts on published determinations of excess heat said lewis 
when these errors are avoided we obtain no evidence for excess 
heat production 
however james brophy university of utah vice president of 
research said the criticisms arent really different than any 
weve heard from the beginning valid objections are welcome he 
said but if its out of pique then i dont think its 
helpful 
brophy said the negative results should be judged alongside 
positive results from such institutions as stanford texas aampm and 
case western reserve 
brophy said pons and fleischmann are very good experimenters 
i cant believe they could carry out measurements as they have 
done improperly 
pons and fleischmann lewis said have admitted that their 
report of a 41 energy return was based on mathematical 
calculations and not on actual measurements he said the utah 
researchers evidently used incorrect assumptions to make their 
calculations 
he said errors were easily made for instance if the heavy 
water was not stirred to distribute heat evenly from the electrical 
current when the measurements were made correctly said lewis it 
was obvious that the total heat from the reaction was less than the 
energy used to operate the experiment 
parker meanwhile said mit researchers have been working for 
weeks to verify the utah experiments but the results didnt hold 
up when measured against a standard known as a neutron capture 
gamma spectrum 
if fusion occurred at all it was far below what they 
deduced from their measurements parker said 
part of the problem parker said could be that pons and 
fleischmann did not directly measure the neutrons released in their 
experiment 
the measurement they made was an indirect measurement not of 
neutrons directly but of gamma rays produced by neutrons parker 
said 
the two mit researchers said in a paper planned for presentation 
to the conference that the utah research apparently misinterpreted 
some crucial data on neutrons 
lewis said the caltech experiments used detection equipment 
100000 times more sensitive than devices used in the utah 
experiment he said caltech used instruments to detect and measure 
any product of fusion including neutrons or gamma rays tritium or 
helium and any rise in heat 
all such measurements when performed correctly were negative 
lewis said 
we have no reason to invoke fusion to explain any of their 
results he said at this point we can find no evidence of 
anything except conventional chemistry

150000 bettors predicted the time to the minute 
the 73rd annual nenana ice classic held 50 miles southwest of 
fairbanks in one of the states coldest areas is watched statewide 
as a harbinger of warmer weather 
a tripod on the ice is connected by a cable to a clock on shore 
when the ice thaw moves the tripod a certain distance the cable 
stops the clock 
the tripod toppled over early monday and moved 30 feet when a 
downstream ice jam dislodged but it wasnt until 814 pm monday 
that the tripod finally tripped the clock 
manager wayne taylor said four tickets had 814 pm on may 1 as 
the time the ice would go out they were bought by doris craig 
michelle phillips and dennis starr of anchorage and a pool of 
bettors in fairbanks 
the winners will divide 135000 in prize money taylor said 
about 150000 tickets were sold at 2 apiece the rest of the

sinhalese militants early today 
attacked the countrys largest army garrison with grenades and 
automatic rifles but were beaten back before they could reach the 
armory a military official said 
at least three militants were killed and five soldiers wounded 
in the raid which was launched during a heavy downpour at 130 
am said the official who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules 
he said at least 100 militants attacked the panagoda army 
garrison 12 miles southeast of colombo which usually holds 
between 10000 and 15000 soldiers 
the attack was the biggest raid on an army post by the militants 
since they launched an antigovernment campaign in 1987 to protest 
peace overtures to ethnic tamil rebels 
the sinhalese extremists contend the sinhalesedominated 
government of this indian ocean island nation is making too many 
concessions to the tamil minority 
the militants have attacked army camps and police stations in 
the past to get weapons the military official said the attackers 
penetrated the panagoda garrisons perimeter and came within yards 
of its armory before being repulsed 
army helicopters and foot patrols searched rice paddies and 
jungles around the camp for the militants many of whom are 
believed to be injured he said 
he said authorities thought the attackers belonged to the 
peoples liberation front an ultranationalist sinhalese group 
the government has blamed the front for the killings of at least 
3000 people mostly government officials and supporters since sri 
lanka signed a peace accord in july 1987 aimed at ending a tamil 
insurrection that started four years earlier 
the largest tamil rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam also rejected the 1987 peace accord but opened talks with 
the government last week 
the talks were held after president ranasinghe premadasa offered 
amnesty and seats in parliament to the rebels and the sinhalese 
militants the sinhalese radicals rejected the governments offer 
sinhalese form 75 percent of sri lankas 18 million people and 
tamils make up 18 percent

a farmer proudly displayed his 
calloused right index finger stained with the purple ink designed 
to ensure that no voter cast more than one vote 
in his 60 years pablo caballero has known little but 
dictatorship and seen few elections that were not fixed he said 
his inkstained finger represented the hope of change 
now we can vote freely for our own candidate with no rushing 
or pressures said caballero a feeling expressed monday 
throughout this rural farming town 80 miles east of asuncion the 
capital 
i am over the obligatory voting age but i came to cast my 
vote anyway because i have hopes that things will change said 
ramon ramirez 64 
the vote monday to select a president and twochamber congress 
to replace the regime of former president alfredo stroessner 
ousted in a feb 3 coup was mandatory for all paraguayans between 
18 and 60 
stroessner 76 who took power in a 1954 coup had eight 
straight times arranged his own election rural peasants often were 
trucked to voting sites handed ballots for the ruling colorado 
party and told to place them in the box while party officials 
looked on 
caballero said he did not cast his ballot for the colorados this 
time 
i voted for domingo laino of the authentic radical liberal 
party because he always fought for freedom added caballero 
despite the support of voters such as caballero the election 
was won by the general who deposed stroessner colorado party 
candidate andres rodriguez 
im going to vote for gen rodriguez because he promised many 
things to the peasants and he brought us democracy said eulalia 
dominguez 33 in the town of caacupe 32 miles east of asuncion 
clusters of farmers stood beside the highway in a light drizzle 
waiting for flatbed trucks of rodriguezs and lainos parties the 
two largest to take them to voting sites others traveled by 
bicycle horse and tractor 
officials at voting sites in several small towns strictly 
followed regulations supplying private rooms for citizens to 
choose in secrecy between the ballots supplied by the eight parties 
participating in the elections 
they also supplied indelible purple ink furnished by the united 
states to mark voters right index fingers 
in the february 1988 election only colorado party ballots could 
be found at many voting places and private voting rooms were 
scarce but all sides called the election monday more open 
some people are saying these are the cleanest elections in 
paraguayan history said omar jara 29 who quit his job as a 
teacher because of low pay and now does odd jobs 
but i say it is the cleanest fraud he added i would have 
voted for rodriguez but you can see that the people around him are 
just continuing the farce 
opposition spokesmen reported some irregularities in voting 
such as indelible ink that washed off registration of new voters 
by colorado officials on the day of balloting and some mixups with 
voter registration lists 
things are somewhat better than in 1988 but we still have a 
long way to go said fernando guillen an observer for the 
revolutionary febrerista party in arroyo san jose 60 miles east of 
the capital 
lidia ramirez 64 of caacupe seemed to take the irregularities 
in stride 
it may not be perfect but at least now we have freedom to 
choose she said waiting in line to vote

pope john paul ii today beatified a 
19th century french missionary considered the apostle of the slaves 
brought to this island saying he should inspire islanders to fight 
todays slavery of materialism 
the pope celebrated a beatification mass on the palmfringed 
esplanade of the notre dame of the trinity church the crowd was 
estimated at up to 200000 twofifths of the entire population of 
this volcanic indian ocean island 
french prime minister michel rocard wearing a straw hat to ward 
off the tropical sun headed the official french delegation at the 
ceremony reunion has been a french overseas territory since 1946 
the pope arrived on the island monday night after a threeday 
visit to the african island of madagascar the first stop of his 
nineday pilgrimage he headed later today to zambia traveling for 
the first time on the concorde 
he is to visit malawi later in the week and return to rome 
saturday 
the beatification represented a first step towards possible 
sainthood for jeanbernard rousseau known as brother scubilion 
who died in 1867 at the age of 70 born in burgundy and baptized 
secretly during the french revolution rousseau joined the brother 
of the christian schools and moved to this island then known as 
bourbon in 1833 
he remained 34 years until his death devoting himself to 
teaching catechism to the african slaves brought to the island by 
the french colonists to work the coffee plantations 
described by local church officials as a nonviolent 
subversive he is credited with helping create the climate for 
the abolishment of slavery in 1848 
about 70 percent of reunions current population are descended 
from the slaves ninety percent of the population is roman catholic 
brother scubilion is a remarkable witness of the movement for 
holiness begun on this island by the first missionaries the 
whiterobed pope said in his homily in french he enlightened 
others with the light of jesus christ by his example and 
especially by his catechism among the slaves 
he helped them to gain confidence to give meaning to their 
lives to march toward hope and he distinguished himself in the 
service to the sick showing much compassion for his brothers in 
distress 
john paul said todays catholics in reunion should follow 
brother scubilions example and build a society more respectful 
of human dignity without being afraid of saying no to the slavery 
of materialism that could seduce you 
on your island you enjoy a relative abundance he said 
at the same time the race to consumerism can lead away from the 
real evangelist path 
reunion covering 970 square miles is the most prosperous of 
the four stops on the popes trip its economy is based on sugar 
exports and tourism and the per capita income is 3500 compared 
to only a few hundred dollars in the other countries 
earlier today the pope met with a group of youths in the garden 
of the residence of the local bishops he cautioned them not to be 
seeduced by secularization pornography casual sex and the 
temptation of magic 
he did not elaborate on that topic but local church officials 
have expressed concern about the spread of superstition fetishism 
exorcism and satanic cults

a federal judges ruling that illinois 
death penalty law is unconstitutional could help to resolve legal 
questions that have loomed since it was enacted in 1977 experts 
say 
us district judge harold baker said monday the law gives 
prosecutors too much leeway in deciding when to seek the death 
penalty violating us supreme court rulings that states must 
ensure capital punishment is not imposed in an arbitrary and 
capricious manner 
if higher courts agree bakers decision would invalidate the 
sentences of the 121 men currently facing the death penalty in 
illinois among them is john w gacy convicted of killing 33 young 
men and boys in the worst multiplekilling case in us history 
bakers decision marked the first time a federal judge has ruled 
on the constitutionality of illinois death penalty law the us 
supreme court has never agreed to hear an illinois death penalty 
case 
in the past legal experts have said a final resolution of the 
issue was unlikely until federal courts addressed a case focusing 
solely on the constitutional question 
i think weve finally got a case where the issue has been 
squarely addressed in the district court and will be squarely 
addressed on appeal said david bradford a chicago attorney who 
has handled appeals of death row inmates 
illinois attorney general neil hartigan said the state would 
appeal the ruling to the 7th us circuit court of appeals in 
chicago michael ficaro hartigans first assistant said he was 
confident bakers ruling would be overturned 
the illinois supreme court has dealt with that issue over 60 
times he said we believe the statute is constitutional 
because of prolonged appeals no one has been executed under the 
1977 statute 
jay miller director of the illinois chapter of the american 
civil liberties union said we think theyre all 
unconstitutional i dont think theres any way to write a death 
penalty law thats constitutional 
bakers ruling came in the case of a man who demanded the death 
penalty after being convicted in 1980 of killing two people in 
vermilion county 
appeals on behalf of charles silagy reached the state supreme 
court twice and the us supreme court once but were unsuccessful 
until his case reached baker in one of the last stages of the 
appeals process 
the states capital punishment law allows a trial court to 
consider a death sentence in certain circumstances such as a 
multiple killing but only when requested by the prosecution 
in 1979 the state supreme court ruled 43 that the prosecutors 
authority to seek the death penalty is not significantly different 
than their power to seek criminal prosecution 
but baker sided with the dissenting justices in that case 
our statute contains no directions or guidelines to minimize 
the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action by the 
prosecutor in either requesting or in not requesting a death 
sentence hearing wrote justice howard c ryan whose opinion 
was cited by baker

a mysterious oil spill in march that 
contaminated beaches on two islands has been traced to an 
interisland cruise ship the coast guard announced 
oil samples taken from ss independence matched samples taken 
from beaches on lanai and molokai and from a slick between the 
islands capt gordon piche told reporters monday 
attorney robert frame who represents american hawaii cruises 
which operates the boat said the company was cooperating with the 
coast guard but would do its own investigation to check the 
findings 
the company will abide by whatever laws apply he said 
under federal water pollution control laws the company could 
face a maximum civil penalty of 5000 and would have to repay the 
government for the cost of the cleanup which is estimated at more 
than 100000 piche said 
the findings will be turned over to a coast guard hearings 
officer within six weeks piche said it will be up to the us 
attorneys office to press criminal charges which carry a maximum 
penalty of a 10000 fine he added 
piche said the boat apparently dumped about 10000 gallons of 
bunker fuel oil into the ocean by accident while pumping fresh 
water out of ballast tanks on the night of march 24 
the spill washed ashore along a 10mile stretch of the east end 
of molokai and along 10 miles of the northeast side of lanai there 
have been no reports of any damage to wildlife piche said 
company officials were informed monday of the findings and 
their reaction was they didnt see how it could have happened

she and hundreds of others have crowded into this prince william 
sound community in search of work and hefty paychecks 
they live in mobile homes school buses soggy tents mostly 
they wait 
weve got all our pigs in a poke and our options working 
said clark a gold miner from a town near fairbanks who has been 
here a week she set up housekeeping in her battered green car in a 
gravel parking lot 
things havent gotten savage here yet she said smiling 
they might but they havent its a real boomtown atmosphere 
its so similar to the north slope in the 1970s when they were 
building the pipeline 
exxon has said it will hire 4000 people by early june to help 
clean up the nations worst oil spill 
after loading up at the transalaska pipeline terminal here the 
exxon valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 dumping more than 10 
million gallons of heavy north slope crude oil into prince william 
sound the oil has moved out of the sound soiling gulf of alaska 
beaches 
when word of exxons initial cleanup plan got out a steady 
stream of job hunters headed to valdez 
the alaska department of labor job service office which tries 
to match employers with workers has been forced to bring in three 
additional staff members and stay open seven days a week to keep up 
in the last two weeks the number coming through this office 
has grown daily said the agencys pat wilson were averaging 
500 a day thats in a town with a population of 3000 and the 
volume is growing definitely growing 
before the spill perhaps 20 people a day came looking for work 
she said 
now jobs for waitresses cooks maids go begging a bulletin 
board in the jobs agency is covered with cards seeking workers but 
most of the newcomers are holding out for the big banana an exxon 
job ankle deep in oil 
the job service receives up to 300 telephone calls a day from 
people seeking work the calls come from as far away as mexico 
sweden france and norway 
for those in valdez the agency starts its day early 
wearylooking men and women start lining up down the block at 530 
am waiting for the office to open at 7 a stampede through the 
doors as they opened one day last week pinned two job service 
workers against a wall a security guard was hired to keep order 
don robinson an unemployed painter has been here a week 
living in his car showing up each day at the crack of dawn hoping 
for a 12houraday 16anhour exxon job 
its wait wait wait they dont tell you anything he said 
the job service is providing nonunion job applications for one 
of exxons contractors veco 
wilson said veco will only look at applications submitted by 
alaska residents she said federal law prohibits release of the 
number of people hired by veco or any other employer 
but she said hundreds of people have been hired through the 
agency since the spill 
norcon inc another oil field service contractor is hiring 
union labor for exxon through laborers local 341 
twice a day seven days a week the cramped smokefilled 
hallway outside the tiny union office is jammed with job seekers 
bill mcpheters business agent for the local said 40 people a 
day sign up to join the union more than 700 have signed up 
the local normally has about 65 members 
the union has sent out more than 500 potential workers since the 
spill and about 80 percent went to norcon mcpheters said 
he said the union has been trying to ensure that alaskans with 
at least a year of residency get the jobs 
we want to put our alaskans to work theyve been through some

gen andres rodriguez who ousted 
strongman alfredo stroessner three months ago was elected 
president by an overwhelming margin and his party kept control of 
congress unofficial returns showed today 
the leaders and presidential candidates of four opposition 
parties denounced what they said were shameful irregularities 
in mondays voting and did not concede defeat 
foreign observers and diplomats agreed that there were 
irregularities but said the balloting was reasonably fair and that 
victory clearly belonged to rodriguez who had been stroessners 
no 2 man 
we promise our people that we will carry paraguay on a bright 
path to its destiny of greatness and happiness a grinning 
rodriguez said in a champagne toast to party members late monday at 
his chateaustyle mansion 
his colorado party has ruled this landlocked country of 4 
million people since 1947 
domingo laino the presidential candidate of the authentic 
radical liberal party and a former exile finished second 
in initial official returns released early today rodriguez 
tallied 22201 of the 29293 votes for president or 758 percent 
and the colorados garnered 19883 or 684 percent of 29064 votes 
for congress 
the colorados said their partial count showed that of 1048299 
votes for president rodriguez received 778479 or 743 percent 
official and unofficial tallies gave laino about 20 percent of the 
vote 
the colorados received 741583 votes of 1007548 cast for 
congress or 736 percent according to the partys count 
tallies by the christian democratic party and a coalition of 
sociological research firms had lower totals but also showed 
onesided counts in favor of rodriguez and the colorados 
rodriguez 65 deposed stroessner in a coup on feb 3 and sent 
him into exile in brazil promising broadened civil liberties and 
pledging to move the country toward democracy 
stroessner who seized power in a 1954 coup had arranged to be 
elected every five years through patronage and intimidation 
the voting monday was to replace stroessner and the 36member 
senate and 72seat chamber of deputies that were to have served 
through august 1993 
by law the colorados as the winning party in the congressional 
elections would receive 24 of the 36 senate seats and 48 of the 72 
seats in the chamber of deputies 
the partial colorado vote count represented about 45 percent of 
the 22 million people on official voter registration lists the 
opposition had claimed the list was dated and bloated and even the 
central electoral board said it might contain as many as 600000 
duplicate or fake names 
from the first moment of voting serious difficulties and 
grave fraud occurred which offend our civic culture and test our 
tolerance to the limit said laino 
election observers and local party officials said space wasnt 
always set aside to allow citizens to vote in private ballots for 
a specific party often were missing some voters were not permitted 
to cast ballots and not every station had indelible ink to mark 
fingers and prevent double voting 
euclides acevedo president of the revolutionary febrerista 
party accused the colorados of stealing his partys ballots at 
some voting places 
juan ramon chaves chairman of the colorado party accused laino 
supporters of doing the same to his party 
yes there were irregularities but how significant they were 
im not sure said british ambassador john grant mcdonald i 
think it was a very good attempt at something they have never done 
before 
voters stood in long lines in chilly fall weather and a light 
drizzle to cast ballots 
my party was founded in 1965 this is the first time were 
participating in elections said martin caceres 28 a christian 
democrat 
people are hopeful he said standing in a school courtyard 
the period of stroessner hasnt ended but this is a 
beneficial transition peaceful with people getting used to 
democracy 
rodriguez named himself provisional president after ousting 
stroessner and distancing himself from the regime improved 
relations with foreign governments and the roman catholic church 
to which most paraguayans belong 
in coronel oviedo a large rural town east of the capital ramon 
ramirez a 64yearold peasant said monday i am past the age 
where voting is mandatory but i came to cast my ballot because i 
have hopes that things will change from now on 
voting was mandatory for citizens ages 18 to 60 and failure to 
vote punishable by a small fine

for the second time in three years robert 
and paula sims say someone has swiped their infant daughter but 
few neighbors are rushing to their defense 
it just seems too strange said carol hailer who lives 
across the street we dont have kidnappings here and not two 
in one family 
the simses said 6weekold heather was abducted saturday night 
under circumstances almost identical to the disappearance of their 
13dayold daughter loralei three years ago 
loraleis body was found five days later about 150 feet from 
the simses home in brighton 10 miles from this town of 40000 
residents no cause of death was determined and no arrest was made 
in that case although authorities said the parents were suspects 
on monday police in this mississippi river town across from st 
louis said they were treating heathers disappearance as a 
kidnapping reported by the parents 
but were not ruling anything out said sgt rick mccain 
chief of detectives 
they said they feel someone is out to get them mccain said 
but they dont have anyone specific and havent given us any 
names 
robert sims was approached by reporters as he arrived at his 
home monday night 
i cant say anything he said citing the advice of police 
i dont mean to be rude i just cant say anything 
a steady stream of cars drove past the house monday night with 
most motorists slowing long enough to get a good look neighbors 
were peering out of windows and doors 
mrs sims said she was approached by a gunman outside their home 
saturday night while her husband was at work at a steel plant said 
sgt bud pyatt 
mrs sims told police she was forced back into the house and 
knocked unconscious an hour later she told authorities her 
husband returned home and revived her but heather was gone 
a hospital found no evidence of injury when they checked mrs 
sims no bruises or anything mccain said 
there is nothing that disproves their allegations he said 
but we are not discounting the information from the other case 
even the times of the reported abductions are similar 
in 1986 mrs sims said she was attacked about 1020 pm and on 
saturday she told police the assailant struck at 1030 pm after 
she returned from taking out the trash 
neighbors said the couple who also have a 15monthold son 
have kept to themselves since they moved from brighton to their 
twostory home in alton about two years ago 
all i can tell you is i never saw them mrs hailer said 
i saw her once in two years i didnt even know she had children 
they put up the fence when they first moved in and thats the last 
anybody ever saw of them 
police said the couples young son was sleeping in the house at 
the time but was not disturbed no valuables were reported missing 
from the house 
in jersey county where the simes lived in 1986 when they

most of the west can expect a nearly normal fire 
season after five years of droughtfueled infernos but there is 
still a great potential for fire in the parched southwest 
officials say 
were not in bad shape right now steve brown staff 
meteorologist at the interagency fire center in boise idaho said 
monday i dont think were going to see much until we get into 
the actual summer 
increased precipitation has relieved drought conditions in many 
areas including parts of the rockies that were ravaged by fire 
last year brown said in a telephone interview but uncertain 
prospects for more wet weather in coming months still cloud the 
fire outlook he said 
weather forecasters tell us that from may to july we have 
equal chances of abovenormal or belownormal precipitation and 
abovenormal or belownormal temperatures said rob harper of the 
washington state department of natural resources that basically 
says its unclear what the outlook is 
ironically the improved precipitation could heighten the danger 
of range fires in many areas by promoting the growth of grass that 
could serve as fuel later brown said 
brown who is responsible for outdoor fire danger forecasts 
nationwide said he was compiling data for a report due to be 
released late this week 
the biggest danger area is the southwest much lowerthannormal 
winter snowfall and spring rains pose a fire threat in arizona and 
new mexico and southern parts of california utah nevada and 
colorado 
theres not much question of a great potential right 
now for wildfires in those areas brown said the fuels are 
already drying out 
soil and debris on the forest floor in parts of northern arizona 
are as dry now as they were in august he said 
the next greatest fire potential is in the intermountain region 
northern portions of utah and nevada southern idaho and parts of 
eastern oregon and washington where the snowpack is melting 
rapidly and the longrange forecast calls for warm temperatures 
brown said 
scott kaiser of the national weather service in boise said the 
snowmelt in idaho was 10 to 14 days ahead of normal reducing a 
snowpack that was normal as of midapril to 80 percent to 85 
percent of normal now 
despite four small forest fires during a warm windy spell last 
weekend in washington the outlook for the pacific northwest 
northern california northwest and the northern rockies is near 
normal brown said 
the largest blaze a 308acre fire on washingtons olympic 
peninsula was stopped dead by cooler damper weather monday said 
warren hartman of the us forest service containment was expected 
today 
the rockies including fireravaged yellowstone national park 
have gotten their fair share of precipitation leading to 
quite a decrease in the drought conditions that existed 
earlier brown said 
the situation could deteriorate however as high pressure and 
relatively dry weather is likely to remain over the middle of the 
country for the next 30 days he said 
last year the boise command center recorded 7250 wildfires on 
more than 5 million acres of land an area more than 1 times the 
size of connecticut that was 30 percent more than the 198387 
annual average number of fires and 137 percent more than the 
average annual acreage

largely new york a bill irwin extravaganza 
that he also wrote and directed is a merry marriage of video and 
vaudeville 
the show is tailormade for people who have trouble figuring out 
how to operate their vcrs that means just about everyone should 
enjoy this innovative entertainment which opened monday at 
broadways st james theater 
irwin wearing a mad hatter chapeau baggy pants oversized 
glasses and an eager smile is one of those clowns who knows the 
history of funny business particularly the sublime antics of 
chaplin and keaton but he also has a fascination with the present 
especially the everchanging technology of television that has 
reshaped the performance arena for clown comedy 
what irwin has done with largely new york is bring past and 
present together in the show he plays a goodnatured everyman 
called the postmodern hoofer a character determined to tap 
his way through tea for two if only he could get what sounds 
like the mighty wurlitzer to finish playing the tune 
he never does and the interruptions are what largely new 
york is all about along the way he encounters a variety of 
characters people who inhabit that peculiar cultural environment 
called new york 
during his 75minute adventure the clown meets a pretty modern 
dancer two breakdancing experts a video production crew and a 
gaggle of academics dressed in caps and gowns and looking like a 
convention of angry headwaiters 
irwins journey made without any dialogue is controlled by a 
demented remote control device which he carries he uses it to turn 
on stage lights raise and lower curtains and activate various 
musical soundtracks 
irwin swoons for dancer margaret eginton who spoofs the 
angular jerky movements of modern dance her choreographed actions 
are similar to the precision steps of leon chesney and steve 
clemente two terrific breakdancers who deservedly earn cheers for 
their gymnastic feats of wonder 
the clown a sweet romantic follows miss eginton not only in 
person but on a video monitor provided by someone called a 
videographer and his assistant 
in a way irwin has more of a relationship with this video 
equipment than he does with real people in one instance he 
becomes entangled in a video camera tripod and performs a kind of 
pas de deux with the equipment the tripod leads 
in another the comedian manages to find himself trapped inside 
a television monitor and then needs help from his breakdancing 
friends and a bright orange vacuum cleaner to get out the vacuum 
finally whooshes irwin out of the tube and into his battered old 
actors trunk a nifty trick 
in a third encounter irwin dances with his screen image and 
ends up being reprimanded by his tv counterpart for getting carried 
away 
irwin also battles the stage curtain and loses but not 
before he is carried high above the audience by this maneating 
piece of red cloth 
the clown also is badgered by the disapproving academics who 
follow him around the stage one of them called the dean ends up 
falling into the orchestra pit but hes a game fellow 
particularly as played by jeff gordon who gives new meaning to the 
word pratfall he keeps coming back for more and gets it 
eventually swandiving into the pit 
much of this foolishness gets captured on tape by the 
videographer and irwin ends up appearing in and watching the show 
at the same time the line between reality and illusion blurs but 
they are linked by laughter its a laughter that irwin conjures up 
in the most inventive and dazzling way possible 
in other reviews the new york times frank rich said irwin 
cuts a most human figure on stage and even allows himself a 
finalcurtain kiss but his clowning however slapstick often 
remains austerely intellectual in its preoccupations 
clive barnes writing in the new york post said irwin is an 
enormous talent still trying to find a proper outlet 
howard kissel writing in the daily news said the work 
sometimes seems repetitive and facile but its full of an 
irrepressible impish imagination

the state gaming commission has 
forced billionaire developer donald trump into an agreement that 
will regulate his purchase of stocks bonds or other assets of his 
casino industry competitors 
trump who owns two atlantic city casinos a third under 
construction and has plans for two noncasino hotels acceded to 
the pact monday in an attempt to assure renewal of his gaming 
license by the new jersey casino control commission 
under the agreement trump will have to obtain prior approval 
from state regulators before acquiring interests in gaming industry 
corporations in atlantic city 
a vote on the proposed renewal of trumps gaming license for the 
trump plaza hotel and casino and trump castle hotel amp casino was 
scheduled for may 10 
trump went along with the restriction after regulators 
questioned his investment in an aborted plan to take over caesars 
world inc last year his major competitor in atlantic city 
trump bought 600000 or 25 percent of the shares of caesars 
stock despite a warning in 1987 from casino control commission 
chairman walter n read 
although trump is the dominant force in atlantic citys real 
estate and gaming industries caesars atlantic city hotelcasino 
was the resorts top money winner in 1988 according to state 
figures the trump plaza was second 
caesars posted a 3076 million profit for 1988 a 67 percent 
increase over 1987 trump plaza was next with 3009 million a 23 
percent increase over the previous year 
the agreement on stock purchases was worked out behind closed 
doors between chairman read and trump 
at the meeting read repeated his displeasure with trumps 
attempted takeover of caesars world read and commissioner frank j 
dodd have made it clear they do not want to see the industry run by 
the freewheeling rules of monopoly the board game that made 
atlantic citys street names famous 
besides two operating gaming halls trumps third casino the 
taj mahal is under construction the developer says it will be the 
worlds largest gaming hall when completed next year 
last month trump purchased the abandoned penthouse casino 
project and announced plans to turn it into a 1000room noncasino 
hotel he also has signed an agreement to buy the bankrupt atlantis

a swarm of about 500 africanized honeybees 
popularly known as killer bees has been destroyed at miamis 
port state officials said 
the bees hitchhiking on the outside of a container brought in 
from suriname aboard the freighter werner were discovered april 21 
by workers at the omni terminal in downtown miami agriculture 
commissioner doyle conner said monday 
the bees were destroyed that day by a state inspector but as a 
precaution additional bait hives have been placed in the port and 
surrounding area 
it is the fifth swarm of the highly aggressive bees that has 
been discovered and destroyed in florida in the last four years 
last may a swarm of about 10000 was found at fort lauderdale 
aboard a freighter carrying fruit and vegetables from guatemala 
conner said his department has had about two dozen bait hives at 
miamis port miami international airport and the miami river for 
some time the additional bait hives put in place since the swarm 
was discovered will bring the number to more than 50 
the first bait hive we ever placed was in miami because its 
an area weve always been concerned about conner said there 
is just a tremendous interchange between miami and central and 
south american countries virtually all of which are now infested 
with africanized bees 
state and federal inspectors monitor up to 300 bait hives in 13 
port areas in florida 
the bees have been migrating north from brazil since the 1950s 
and now are in the central part of mexico they are expected to 
reach the texas border sometime next year 
officials in florida are not expecting them to arrive through 
the normal migration process for another four or five years 
meantime they are concentrating their efforts on eradicating any 
accidental introductions 
the africanized bees venom is not more potent than that of 
european honeybees that are common throughout the united states 
but they are more dangerous because they are likely to sting in 
greater numbers due to their aggressive nature 
they are hard to distinguish from domestic bees although 
slightly smaller

as election day draws near 
expressions of hostility between washington and panamas leaders 
are on the rise 
on monday panamas military accused us forces of spying on 
its bases and the us army accused panamanian forces of holding 
some of its soldiers and their families at gunpoint while searching 
their apartments 
us policy toward panama has become a major issue in the 
campaign for sundays presidential election 
washington has tried to oust gen manuel antonio noriega the 
leader of panamas armed forces and the power behind the 
government through economic sanctions and support of the political 
opposition 
a communique monday from lt col aristides hassan an officer 
in the panamanian defense forces said the us southern command 
had been told to abstain from snooping in a suspicious and covert 
manner around military installations of the defense forces of 
panama 
this activity the communique added constitutes a violation 
of the torrijoscarter treaties 
the treaties signed in 1977 regulate relations between the two 
countries and their militaries until dec 31 1999 when the panama 
canal is to be transferred to panamanian control 
maj edgardo lopez spokesman for the defense forces said us 
jets consistently make treetoplevel flights over areas around 
military installations 
they also send people dressed as civilians in rental cars with 
cameras to watch military bases and they have set up electronic 
surveillance just off the coast he said 
the southern command denied all the charges 
all flights out of us military installations have flight 
plans filed any complaints by the panamanian defense forces are 
investigated and so far we have not found any allegation to be 
true said a southern command spokesman on condition of anonymity 
he added that several weeks ago the panamanians arrested a us 
officer who was birdwatching with a camera and field glasses near a 
military installation the officer who was new to panama was 
released after a short detention the spokesman said 
for its part the southern command complained monday that 
panamanian security forces had entered apartments of several us 
service members and held them at gunpoint while saying they were 
searching for weapons 
the command in a communique said panamanian forces surrounded 
the building in a panama city suburb on saturday cut telephone 
lines and forcibly entered the apartments it said panamanians 
live in the building too but only units of us personnel and 
their families were searched 
no one was reported injured or arrested in the incident 
panamanian police declined comment 
they have been carrying out searches recently for what they call 
subversives on april 6 a us citizen was arrested and 
accused of running a clandestine radio station broadcasting 
antigovernment messages 
in the election the government is backing carlos duque a close 
associate of noriega an opposition coalition is backing guillermo 
endara 
noriega has been indicted in the united states on drug charges

gen andres rodriguez the apparent 
winner of his countrys presidential election is a career officer 
with a populist touch 
rodriguez 65 ran monday as the candidate for the colorados 
the powerful and wellorganized party that has ruled this 
semitropical landlocked nation since 1947 
party affiliation aside rodriguez won wide popular support for 
leading the feb 3 coup that toppled gen alfredo stroessner 
ending his 34 years of autocratic rule 
the stocky blackhaired general named himself acting president 
and to the surprise of many paraguayans called for general 
elections accepted the colorado candidacy and campaigned for 
democracy and human rights 
the man seems to have become the latterday saint of 
democracy said fernando vera presidential candidate of the 
opposition revolutionary febrerista party 
rodriguez further surprised his countrymen by legalizing eight 
political parties banned under stroessner approving an extra 
fiveweek voter registration period to allow opposition parties 
time to sign up members and attending 21 political rallies 
his chief rival former exile domingo laino reminded 
paraguayans however that the general served from 1961 to 1989 as 
head of the asuncionbased 1st army corps and was stroessners 
close aide 
rodriguez said he collaborated with the regime out of 
discipline and obedience as a military officer 
the rev ismael rolon the roman catholic archbishop of asuncion 
and a frequent critic of stroessner said it was too early to 
assess rodriguezs ability to govern but he added in the few 
contacts we have had he seems to be a man of good intentions 
born into a rural farm family rodriguez entered the army as a 
cadet at age 18 and quickly earned the nickname tiger for his 
perseverance and willingness to fight to achieve goals 
reports published abroad have suggested rodriguez may have been 
involved in narcotics trafficking he emphatically denies the 
charge 
other reports have suggested the generals luxurious home in 
asuncion and his wealth are due to involvement in contraband and 
questionable business associations 
he is a wealthy man a very wealthy man one of the richest 
men in the country maybe the richest said a foreign diplomat 
who spoke on condition of anonymity the diplomat noted that 
rodriguez owns the countrys largest foreign exchange house an 
aircraft importing firm and has huge cattle and land holdings as 
well as part ownership of a flour mill and brewery 
they say he has an exchange house but that is because the 
owners are his friends said blas n riquelme a businessman who 
says he has known rodriguez for nearly 26 years 
he always has helped businessmen out and so people say he is a 
partner in this or that riquelme said but there is no proof 
nor will there ever be any because he is a simple working man who 
has earned his wealth honestly 
during the campaign rodriguez often cited his humble origins 
and delighted supporters with spontaneous talks in guarani the 
native indian language spoken by most paraguayans 
he knows the psychology of the paraguayan people much better 
than stroessner who always was formal said roman catholic 
bishop mario melanio medina a human rights leader 
rodriguez unlike stroessner included his family in the 
political campaign and reportedly consulted closely with his wife 
nelly and three daughters after speeches he relaxed by playing 
with his 10 nieces and nephews 
rodriguez plays tennis sometimes with us ambassador timothy 
towell and likes to ride horses

a federal judge has ordered immigration 
officials to stop deporting hundreds of salvadorans from a texas 
detention center 
us district judge david v kenyon said the aliens were denied 
a chance to seek political asylum 
kenyon ruled that the us immigration and naturalization 
service violated his previous order to provide help to salvadorans 
at the port isabel service processing center 
out of a group of 67 salvadorans deported from port isabel on 
april 20 none was represented by counsel at their deportation 
hearings he said in his preliminary injunction issued friday and 
made public monday the court finds it difficult to believe that 
each of these individuals learned of and knowingly and effectively 
waived his or her right to counsel 
kenyon also ordered the ins to hold group presentations advising 
the detention center inmates of their rights 
last month an attorney for the los angelesbased central 
american refugee center sought an order requiring that legal 
counsel be provided the immigrants 
activists had argued that a steppedup enforcement program had 
led to the detention of thousands of people at port isabel and 
that many faced deportation hearings without legallyrequired 
access to a lawyer 
kenyons order remains in effect pending a may 30 hearing

louisiana would lose at least five 
medical institutions and some universities under a budget proposal 
drawn up after voters rejected gov buddy roemers tax plan a top 
budget official says 
more closures will be disclosed in the next two weeks 
commissioner of administration dennis stine said monday 
on saturday voters rejected roemers tax revision plan that 
would have offset much of a projected deficit of abut 700 million 
for the new fiscal year beginning july 1 
the cuts will be deeper than i wanted deeper than common 
sense but we will not do business as usual roemer said monday 
the governor was referring to the projecting oil prices high 
enough to balance the budget on paper a routine practice before he 
took office in march 1988 roemer has blamed such practices for 
building up an accumulated 900 million deficit that the state 
covered with a bond issue last year 
each increase of 1 a barrel in the price of oil yields around 
28 million a year in extra state tax revenue 
roemer said the state realistically could increase the 
projection from 15 to 17 per barrel because the price of 
louisiana oil is about 18 but youre only talking about 60 
million if we do that 
having oil companies and other businesses pay a big share of 
state revenues dates back to the days of populist gov huey long in 
the 1920s and 1930s roemers plan would have shifted the tax 
burden away from big business put more of a load on individuals 
through the income tax and cut sales taxes 
stine who heads the daytoday operations of government said 
the state must lay off a minimum of 3000 employees that would be 
in addition to 4100 jobs that had been planned to go through 
attrition and layoffs even if the tax package had passed he said 
stines office issued a report detailing 745 million in 
proposed cuts through the elimination of state programs 
the budget calls for 33 of the states 41 vocationaltrade 
schools to be shut down said stine 
some universities must be closed or a majority of them changed 
from fouryear institutions to twoyear community colleges he 
said the state now has 18 public universities 
we could end up with six fouryear universities said stine 
with higher education contributing 113 million to the deficit 
i think you can expect some closures said stine were not 
ready to name them 
two of the states eight charity hospitals must be closed stine 
said medicaid patients would be transferred to private hospitals 
and indigents without medicaid would be transferred to other 
charity hospitals he said 
also slated for closure is a new orleans nursing home for older 
handicapped patients and homes in columbia and leesville for 
physically handicapped children those patients would be 
transferred to other facilities stine said 
stines report also said another 745 million would be saved by 
eliminating a 7 percent pay raise planned this fall for teachers 
while 143 million would be garnered by denying state employees 
merit pay hikes 
all options are on the table said stine we are trying to 
do the best we can within the means available

a woman who used cocaine hours before 
giving birth was convicted of prenatal child abuse and neglect by a 
judge who compared the drug use to giving a baby razor blades to 
play with in the crib 
this is the first case of this kind to come before this 
court juvenile court judge frederick j kapala said monday in 
finding the mother guilty 
the child was put in the care of social workers pending a may 25 
hearing 
a key element in the case involved the question of whether 
illinois law covers fetal rights including the possibility of 
future health damage to socalled cocaine babies 
the mothers attorney alberto f altamore said the illinois 
juvenile court act defines abuse and neglect of minors but does 
not address the issue of fetus abuse 
kapala said altamore raised a legitimate argument because 
state child abuse laws only speak of minors under the age of 21 
but he said i have to take a stand one way or the other on 
the issue of fetus rights 
we can expect to see a growing body of law on this subject 
he said 
altamore said the case could open the door to child abuse and 
neglect charges being filed against pregnant women who drink 
alcohol or smoke 
but kapala said theres a difference with cocaine since its 
illegal 
the baby born three months ago has shown no signs of addiction 
or serious health problems associated with cocaine babies 
according to testimony 
assistant states attorney gary golian said medical studies 
suggest cocaine babies may be subject to serious health problems 
far into the future 
the judge said effects of the cocaine on the baby may not 
appear for years 
but its the same as if a mother gave a child a pack of razor 
blades to play with in the crib he said the child might drop 
the blades out of the crib and not get hurt but the exposure to 
danger is the same 
kapala delayed a decision on whether the child eventually can be 
returned to the mother she has been participating in a drug 
treatment program 
because it is a juvenile case neither the womans name was not 
released

a popular robot was relegated to the sidelines 
but thousands of excited schoolchildren still watched in awe as a 
7 million science project lit up screens nationwide whisking 
viewers to the bottom of the mediterranean sea 
the satelliterelayed view from a cameraequipped submersible 
robot monday was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an 
expected 250000 students at 13 museums from british columbia to 
florida 
the project suffered a temporary setback last week when jason 
the 7foot long robot whose older brother first explored the sunken 
titanic sank among the ruins of an ancient roman trading ship off 
the coast of italy 
the cable used to lower the milliondollar submersible and its 
mobile garage argo snapped and the pair plunged 2100 feet to the 
soft silty ocean floor 
the robot was recovered apparently undamaged saturday but sat 
out the first 40minute broadcast monday 
the biggest laugh of the morning came when kenneth a grade 
school student from memphis tenn had a chance to question dr 
robert ballard the head of the expedition 
is jason all right he asked his voice crackling over a 
3000mile connection to the support ship star hercules 
jason is fine ballard told his student audience via the 
twoway hookup his prides a little hurt but luckily none of 
his instrumentation is 
ballard sought to reassure the students who have through weeks 
of lessons and classroom discussion developed an affection for the 
little propellerdriven robot explorer 
jason can be remotely driven in and around underwater objects 
its replacement monday medea is merely a sophisticated camera 
platform that is towed to the ocean floor 
broadcasting from his control center on the bridge ballard took 
questions from students at three of the 13 participating museums 
narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and set the stage for 
preprepared films on satellite technology and the ancient greek 
voyager jason for whom the 20th century robot was named 
for some of the kids the show wasnt quite the same without its 
star 
the teachers said it was going to be so real that it would 
seem like the water could come right off the screen said 
10yearold almas rathod of the walter j paton school in 
shrewsbury mass it wasnt like that 
but classmate barry lyall said the field trip had lived up to 
his expectations 
its much more interesting than hearing about it in a 
classroom the 9yearold native of scotland said it was the 
next best thing to being there 
the project whose sponsors include woods hole oceanographic 
institution turner broadcasting system inc the national 
geographic society and electronic data systems was scheduled to 
move 120 miles southwest next week where it will broadcast from 
the site of a 2000yearold roman trading ship 
the participating museums are the boston museum of science the 
museum of natural history in denver the detroit science center 
discovery place in charlotte nc the museum of science and 
industry in chicago the science place in dallas memphis tenn

police offered a 4000 reward 
today for information about the killing of a prominent white 
antiapartheid activist and the countrys law and order minister 
said he was horrified by the murder 
expressions of sorrow and outrage over the death of university 
professor david webster came from both blacks and whites and from 
antiapartheid academic labor and student groups across south 
africa 
max coleman who worked with webster in several organizations 
opposed to racesegregation told hundreds of mourners monday night 
at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg there is 
only one group that stood to gain from this act those who are 
dedicated to perpetuating the brutal and vicious system that david 
dedicated his life to opposing 
white musician johnny clegg whose zulustyle music has gained 
international acceptance despite a cultural boycott against south 
africa sent a message of support to the meeting from los angeles 
webster 44 an anthropology lecturer at witwatersrand was shot 
to death outside his johannesburg home monday by an assailant 
firing from a passing car 
colleagues said they had no doubt he was killed because of his 
political activities he was a prominent opponent of detention 
without trial 
several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent 
years many white activists have received anonymous threats or have 
been harassed by vandals but few have been attacked 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said in a statement i 
want to make it clear on behalf of the government that the murder 
is strongly condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to 
apprehend those responsible 
tributes to webster came from a wide range of organizations 
opposed broadly to apartheid and specifically to various policies 
of the whiteled government the groups assist families of 
detainees keep records of alleged human rights abuses object to 
military conscription and contest eviction of blacks from rented 
houses 
a spokesman for the southern african catholic bishops conference 
said websters life was one of great respect for the human 
dignity of all people 
jay naidoo general secretary of the congress of south african 
trade unions said the killing is a blow to our struggle but it 
will only strengthen our determination to uproot and destroy 
apartheid evils 
the detainees parents support committee banned by the 
government said webster became an authority on forms of state 
repression and also patterns of informal repression his work 
went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover of 
darkness a statement said 
under apartheid the countrys 28 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

nine antiabortion activists have 
been ordered to pay more than 800000 in damages to a doctor who 
said he and his family suffered mental anguish because of 
demonstrations outside their home 
i believe in the right to picket and i am an advocate of the 
first amendment to the constitution dr eduardo aquino said 
after mondays 102 jury verdict but anyone who abuses those 
rights should be penalized 
cliff zarsky one of two lawyers who represented the nine 
defendants without a fee said he will move for a new trial and if 
that fails he will appeal the verdict 
jurors ruled that the peaceful protests caused mental anguish to 
aquino his wife mercedes and their four children 
the damages included 140000 in past and future suffering of 
the couple and 170000 in past and future suffering of the four 
children a half million dollars in punitive damages was awarded 
for gross negligence in picketing the family home 
state district judge jack hunter scheduled a hearing today on 
whether to issue a permanent injunction against future picketing by 
the defendants 
i feel my family will be left alone now aquino said his 
wife said she was very much relieved as she wiped away tears 
the trial ended at a time when the us supreme court is 
considering a case that could cause it to reconsider its 1973 
ruling roe vs wade that women have a constitutional right to end 
their pregnancies 
the question before the supreme court is a dispute over a 
missouri law that limits abortions in that state 
aquino said he has been performing abortions since 1978 and 
antiabortionists had picketed his office since 1982 they began 
picketing at his home in march 1988 the month he filed his lawsuit

a skinhead has pleaded guilty to murder in 
the slaying of a black man whose head was struck so hard with a 
baseball bat that the bat split 
kenneth m mieske 23 who went by the nicknames ken death 
and batman entered the plea monday in the slaying of mulugeta 
seraw 27 an ethiopian national mieske said he and others killed 
seraw on nov 13 because of his race 
mieske also pleaded no contest to racial intimidation in the 
nonfatal stabbing of a black security guard at a supermarket last 
september 
prosecutors plan to seek a life sentence with a mandatory 
minimum term of 20 years on the murder conviction according to a 
plea agreement between mieske and the multnomah county district 
attorneys office mieske agreed not to challenge the sentence 
this sends a very strong message to anyone who wants to commit 
racist crimes in portland oregon and we hope that never happens 
again said deputy district attorney norman w frink jr i 
dont think we could have gotten anything better if wed gone to 
trial 
multnomah county circuit judge philip t abraham set sentencing 
for june 5 mieske was to have gone to trial may 8 
his lawyer randy vogt said mieske agreed to plead guilty 
partly because federal authorities were threatening to prosecute 
him for civil rights offenses that could have resulted in a life 
sentence with no parole 
mieske could have been prosecuted in federal court even if hed 
gone to trial and been convicted on the state charges vogt said 
under the plea agreement federal authorities wont prosecute 
mieske if he accepts the sentencing recommendation the attorney 
said 
kyle h brewster 19 and steven r strasser 20 are still 
awaiting trial in seraws death they are charged with murder 
assault and racial intimidation 
seraw was beaten to death outside his southeast portland 
apartment after two fellow ethiopians brought him home from a party 
according to police testimony mieske hit seraw in the back of 
the head with a baseball bat three times fracturing seraws skull 
and splitting the bat 
mieske wore his hair short in the skinhead style some but not 
all skinheads are racists 
ron herndon a community leader who attended mondays hearing on 
behalf of seraws family called the plea bargain fair but was 
uncertain whether it would help deter racist violence by sick 
people 
i cant predict insanity herndon said

seven people poached nearly 2 million worth of 
giant clams by underreporting harvests and evading state fisheries 
agents a prosecutor claimed 
in opening statements monday assistant prosecutor marilyn 
brenneman said the defendants routinely took thousands of pounds 
of state resources from puget sound without paying for them 
but an attorney for one of the defendants said the trial was the 
result of a bitter feud between those who dominated the geoduck 
clam industry and resentful divers recruited by the state to build 
its case 
youre going to hear two very different stories on this 
industry richard hansen said 
opening arguments were expected to resume today 
the socalled clamscam trial one of the biggest whitecollar 
crime cases in the states history centers on the evolution of the 
geoduck industry which did not exist until 1970 
the geoduck pronounced gooeyduck after an indian word for 
dig deep has a long sinuous neck an oblong shell up to six 
inches long and weighs as much as 10 pounds 
the mollusk is harvested in washington and british columbia 
much of it for export to japan where its flesh can bring 12 a 
pound 
the defendants were officers suppliers and associates of the 
nowdefunct washington king clam inc and related companies they 
are accused of stealing at least 18 million worth of clams from 
statemanaged clam beds 
ms brenneman said testimony would show that brian d hodgson 
52 the companys coowner in the early 1970s conspired to 
underreport the amount of clams harvested to state department of 
fisheries and department of natural resources officials 
also charged was carol k kondo 58 who came to the united 
states from japan in the 1950s and was a pioneer in the harvesting 
of geoducks along with hodgson the two were the first to discover 
a market in japan after a trip there in 1975 
besides falsifying harvest figures brenneman said hodgson 
directed divers to go outside legal clamming areas for the 
desirable whitenecked clams and to share information on how to 
evade authorities 
hansen an attorney for hodgson told jurors the 12 million 
pounds of clams allegedly stolen over a span of 10 years actually 
was just 51 percent of the entitled harvest within that time 
he also said the divers the state will call to testify for the 
most part were angry with the pay given them by hodgson and that 
the divers had done the poaching 
also charged were kondos daugher cindy rommel 28 mark e 
pearce 37 a former employee of king clam fisherman richard 
myers bookkeeper ralph williams and roger hondle who was aboard 
myers boat when it was seized in 1986 
all seven defendants were charged with firstdegree theft and 
conspiracy to commit trafficking of stolen property

nazi holocaust survivor leah zonershein choked 
back tears today as she read aloud the names of her parents chaim 
and hannah who perished in a world war ii concentration camp 
she was one of hundreds of people who took part in memorials 
throughout the country at which names of the 6 million jewish 
victims were being read on israels national day of mourning for 
the holocaust 
sirens sounded at 10 am throughout the country thousands of 
israelis paid tribute by halting traffic or stopping in their 
tracks and bowing their heads for the twominute wail of the sirens 
polishborn prime minister yitzhak shamir who lost family in 
the holocaust was expected to read names later today at parliament 
in keeping with this years theme of personal remembrance 
names also were read aloud at army bases schools and following 
prayers at judaisms holiest shrine the western wall the remnant 
of the ancient jewish temple in jerusalems walled old city 
the dutchborn mrs zonershein 62 said the ceremony at 
parliament helped ease memories of her ordeal i have found that 
talking about it helps she said 
her sister judith ilan stood at her side at the microphone but 
could not speak i still am unable to let it all out mrs ilan 
said afterward 
the sisters spent 15 months in the bergenbelsen concentration 
camp in occupied poland where their parents died the women were 
freed by soviet troops in april 1945 after a forced death march 
by nazi soldiers who fled the allied invasion 
i dont know how we went on to live normal lives after what 
happened somehow life wins out over everything said mrs 
zonershein a retired teacher 
several elderly survivors wept as they pronounced names of 
brothers sisters and cousins who died 
difficult as it was most survivors agreed the readings were an 
effective way to keep the memories alive for young israelis now 
two generations removed from the holocaust 
holocaust day became a routine thing here the number 6 
million says nothing to most people but name after name after 
name that gets the message across mrs zonershein said 
in jerusalems outdoor ben yehuda shopping mall hundreds of 
vendors and shoppers paused to bow their heads in tribute when the 
siren rang out for holocaust martyrs and heroes rememberance day 
they included orthodox jews who read from the torah and a 
palestinian in an arab keffiyeh headdress who bowed his head in 
silence 
to many israelis the holocaust has become a symbol of jewish 
suffering that also reflects their security fears amid continued 
arab enmity 
this is a very important show of respect and an act of 
remembering because it could happen again devora feinstein 17 
said after the collective silence 
another namereader at parliament was lithuanianborn parliament 
speaker dov shilansky a survivor of dachau concentration camp in 
germany who lost aunts uncles and grandparents to the nazis 
now we have our own jewish state with our own parliament and 
i am speaker as a remnant of your flesh shilansky said in a 
brief speech after laying a wreath of flowers by a stand of 
memorial torches 
shilansky criticized the construction of a roman catholic 
convent just outside the former auschwitz death camp 
in auschwitz in poland they have built a kind of monument to 
your graves a carmelite convent with a big cross 
the church agreed to move the convent in 1987 but the agreement 
has not been implemented 
holocaust day is timed by law in israel to fall half way between 
the start of a 1943 jewish uprising against german troops in 
warsaw poland and israeli independence day which this year is on 
may 10

the leader of a longshoremens union says his 
members might stop unloading ships from drugproducing countries 
as members of the cargo industry work out a plan to fight 
trafficking in illegal drugs 
wed rather lose wages than lose our children john bowers 
president of the international longshoremans association said 
monday 
bowers statement came monday as us customs commissioner 
william von raab announced a proposed agreement by customs air 
lines and sea carriers and unions to combat drug trafficking none 
of the carriers had signed the agreement monday 
this is the first time that industry labor and government 
have joined together to put together a plan to combat drug 
smuggling von raab said before a meeting with representatives of 
about 100 air and sea carriers where the plan was outlined 
the agreement still in draft form calls for carriers to 
impose strict security standards at foreign and domestic docks 
terminals and facilities and aboard their planes and ships 
von raab said on cbs this morning today that one thing 
weve started to do very effectively is to deal with the pilots 
that use small airplanes and the guys that use small speedboats to 
smuggle drugs 
theyre really losing that war as it were so the theater of 
war is shifting to commercial cargo he added that will be the 
last theater of this war itll be a tough one but with the help 
of the shipping companies the airline companies and labor all 
together were going to win it its just going to take time 
the ilas bowers swore that his membership 110000 from 
maine to texas puerto rico and canada would help out i 
told the commissioner well have 110000 pairs of eyes out there 
looking to help him he said 
he noted that the longshoremen had refused for 25 years to 
unload cargo from the soviet union and recently paid 9 million in 
fines because the union lost a supreme court decision over the 
boycott 
bowers declined to say whether any countrys cargo or ships 
already had been targeted for a possible boycott or what criteria 
the union would use to refuse to unload ships 
bowers assured the sea carriers representatives that he would 
make sure there would be swift and sure if rough justice for any 
union member found helping drug traffickers 
if we take him down there you wont need a court for him 
bowers said anything with my people ill make sure they never 
work on the waterfront again 
some of the carriers representatives wanted a tariff imposed 
that would cover their costs for the new security measures the 
agreement would demand so they would remain competitive with 
carriers that dont participate 
lou razzino the customs program manager for narcotics 
interdiction in commercial cargo said such a decision would have 
to be made by congress 
as part of the agreement customs will provide security 
training surveys of foreign and domestic sites and help in 
identifying potential smuggling opportunities if a carrier is 
found to be carrying illegal drugs customs will weigh the 
companys degree of general compliance before deciding on a penalty 
under the antidrug abuse act of 1986 penalties for carrying 
illegal drugs went up to 1000 per ounce of heroin and cocaine and 
500 per ounce of marijuana the act also authorized the seizure of 
the carrier 
if you help us prevent drugs from getting aboard your 
conveyance youll have no problems with penalties and seizures 
razzino said 
von raab estimated that 30 percent of the cocaine now entering 
the country is coming in by shipping container and said he 
expected that to increase to 50 percent in the next two years and 
up to 80 percent to 90 percent by 1992 because of a crackdown on 
other forms of trafficking

electricity flowed into atlantis 
today beginning a new countdown toward a thursday afternoon 
blastoff after crews fixed fuel system problems that caused a 
lastminute launch postponement 
the shuttle is to carry into space five astronauts who are to 
propel a robot spacecraft to explore the planet venus 
the countdown began on time at 8 am when a test director 
summoned the launch team to work stations 
nasa said the new launch plan was optimistic but officials 
were confident enough to move ahead 
liftoff was scheduled for 148 pm thursday with the 64minute 
launch opportunity extending until 252 pm 
the countdown which normally lasts more than three days is 
being compressed by 24 hours this time by eliminating some work 
done in the first count that need not be repeated 
the astronauts who had returned to their training base in 
houston after the scrub were to fly back here late today after a 
practice session in a shuttle simulator 
commanding the mission is david walker the pilot is ron grabe 
and the mission specialists are mary cleave mark lee and norman 
thagard lee is the only one who has not flown a previous shuttle 
flight 
scientists monitoring the magellan spacecraft in atlantis cargo 
bay reported it was healthy the astronauts are to release the 550 
million probe toward venus to map the planets cloudveiled surface 
the two bad parts that forced fridays postponement were a 
hydrogen fuel pump that shortcircuited and a 4inchdiameter fuel 
line that sprung a small leak small metal particles found in the 
pump may have caused the shortcircuit the national aeronautics 
and space administration said 
the speedy fashion in which the parts were replaced prompted the 
agency to set a thursday launch date officials had said sunday 
they did not expect to be able to try again before friday 
warren wiley deputy director of engineering at the kennedy 
space center credited the repair crew 
this is a very dedicated team here he said when the 
chips are down they really get out and hustle they did a bangup 
job 
the delay meant a loss of valuable days in starting magellan on 
its voyage because of the shifting positions of earth and venus 
there is only a 32day period when the spacecraft can be launched 
toward earths sister planet 
if the shuttle cant get off the ground by may 28 the mission 
would have to be put off two years at a cost of more than 100 
million until the two planets are again properly aligned

it still may be living in sin but unrelated 
people can live together throughout denver after city council 
revoked a law that had caused years of controversy and forced some 
to carry marriage certificates 
the council late monday voted 76 to abolish the law that had 
covered more than half the city 
there are no longer any zoning districts where two people 
cannot live together said councilwoman cathy reynolds who 
worked to change the ordinance since she was first elected in 1975 
im delighted 
councilwoman mary degroot also voted to abolish the law 
zoning i believe should be used to determine land use and 
density but not relationships she said 
supporters of the law argued that revoking it could hurt family 
values 
the family is the fundamental structure that preserves our 
society said councilman bill roberts 
the vote is a step toward destroying our city said 
councilman ted hackworth councilman bob crider called the passage 
a sad day in the city of denver 
the livinginsin law had covered about 60 percent of the area 
of denver which has a population of more than 500000 
under the law neither boarders nor unrelated people were 
allowed to live in the same house in areas zoned r0 in areas 
zoned r1 a homeowner was required to obtain a 20 boarders 
permit to cover a nonrelative 
after reviewing the sales prices and the square footage of the 
homes there did not appear to be a significant difference between 
an r1 and an r0 in my district degroot said 
cathy donohue another supporter of change on the council said 
the law forced people to carry their marriage certificates with 
them and zoning inspectors complained about having to count 
toothbrushes in homes 
donohue said some neighborhood arguments turned nasty and people 
were forced to move after being turned in to authorities 
the penalty for violating the ordinance was 999 a day people 
had six months to appeal but when told they faced a fine for every 
day of violation most sold their houses often at a considerable 
loss because of denvers soft housing market donohue said 
several churches turned out previously to oppose any change to 
the law but most opposition this time came from families and a 
real estate agent who sold houses based on the zoning restrictions

the government should develop 
trade relations with the soviet bloc as a counter to punitive 
economic sanctions imposed by western countries state radio said 
today 
the south african broadcasting corp commentary also diverged 
from previous government statements by depicting the soviet unions 
presence in southern africa as legitimate and permanent 
it was one of the most explicit expressions of a major new 
development in south african foreign policy triggered by the 
diplomatic initiatives of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachevs tactics have forced pretoria to revise its 
decadesold view of moscow as an arch enemy orchestrating black 
nationalist guerrillas in a total onslaught to overthrow south 
africas whitedominated government 
in recent months the two countries have found a common interest 
in seeking to keep an independence plan for namibia on track south 
african officials also have been pleased by soviet statements that 
moscow seeks peaceful change in south africa 
the soviet union appears to have accepted that south africa is 
the regional power in southern africa the radio said south 
africa for her part must accept that although southern africa is 
not a traditional sphere of influence for the soviet union she has 
been allowed by other governments in the region to establish a 
presence that is a permanent presence 
because of this the commentary said a certain degree of 
interaction is consequently inevitable and in certain areas could 
be fruitful 
trade relations with eastern bloc nations can be expanded 
without south africa diluting her firm and longstanding resistance 
to the inhumanity of communism it said diversified trading 
relations are all the more important given the hostile action of 
western nations such as the united states in instituting economic 
sanctions 
last week there was an official soviet visit to south africa 
for the first time since the countries broke diplomatic ties in 
1956 soviet diplomat viacheslav ustinov came to cape town with 
us angolan and cuban officials to assess accords calling for 
south africa to end its rule of namibia and cuba to withdraw troops 
from angola 
ustinov emphasized that moscow will not consider restoring 
relations with pretoria until it dismantles its policy of legal 
race discrimination and grants political rights to the black 
majority 
the radio said as a christian nation south africa in turn 
must condemn the oppression of religious and ethnic minorities 
under the communist system 
this having been said it added there are certain 
realities that have to be taken into account

a judge refused a new trial for the man 
convicted of stabbing kitty genovese to death 25 years ago as her 
neighbors reportedly ignored her screams for help 
winston moseley 54 is serving a 20yearstolife sentence for 
the 1964 murder he sought a new trial on the ground that his trial 
lawyer sidney sparrow had once represented genovese 
state supreme court justice charles thomas rejected the appeal 
monday saying a significant possibility of conflict of 
interest had not been shown 
thomas noted that the fact that sparrow represented both 
genovese and moseley doesnt automatically result in a conflict 
of interest 
in his appeal which queens district attorney john santucci 
opposed moseley claimed he never knew that sparrow had represented 
genovese on a bookmaking charge 
but according to thomas sparrow declared in his summation 
before the jury i knew kitty genovese and represented her for 
years 
neither the defendant nor the trial court thought it necessary 
to pursue the issue at that time thomas said in his sixpage 
decision 
genovese 28 was killed march 13 1964 on a street in queens 
in a case that became a nationwide symbol of urban fear and 
indifference

shells crashed into the largest 
cambodian refugee camp in thailand today the latest in a recent 
surge in border assaults western relief officials said 
three rounds flew over camp known as site 2 striking a road 
and two shells landed in the camp 30 minutes later said patrick 
van de velde deputy director of the un border relief operation 
no casualties were reported 
van de velde said that in the past 10 days 15 shells or rockets 
have landed in or around site 2 three seriously wounded refugees 
were sent to the hospital of the international committee of the red 
cross a red cross official said 
we are concerned by the repeated instances of shelling of 
civilian encampments and appeal to concerned parties to refrain 
from harming innocent civilians van de velde said 
site 2 houses about 180000 refugees it is in prachinburi 
province near the border with cambodia and about 50 miles north 
of the thai border town of aranyaprathet 
the camp is controlled by the khmer peoples national liberation 
front one of three guerrilla groups fighting the forces of vietnam 
and of the government it installed in cambodia after invading in 
late 1978 
it is not clear who is responsible for the recent shellings 
which have forced the temporary evacuation of all but the most 
essential relief personnel 
whoever is doing the shelling the aim is clear they want to 
disrupt the relief services they want to disrupt normal life in 
the camp said the red cross official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
some officials theorized the provietnamese cambodian forces 
were shelling the camp to pressure the refugees to abandon the 
resistance and return to cambodia others theorized that the 
guerrillas were doing it to convince the world they needed more 
weapons to defend the camp 
in the past shellings of the border camps also have escalated 
as the two sides maneuvered diplomatically prince norodom 
sihanouk leader of the resistance coalition has been holding 
talks in indonesia this week with hun sen premier of cambodia 
vietnam has said it will withdraw its forces by the end of 
september sihanouks threeparty resistance coalition includes the 
khmer rouge which was blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of 
people when it ruled cambodia from 1975 until vietnams invasion

house speaker jim wrights use of the 
congressional record to plug a home video product made by his 
wifes employer follows a long capitol hill tradition just about 
anything can be printed and is at taxpayers expense 
for more than 100 years the congressional record has provided an 
uncritical compilation of remarks said and unsaid by members of 
congress 
it is printed five days a week every week and runs 200 or so 
pages on average it costs 18 million a year and is produced by 
more than 500 government printers working through the night 
its like producing the sunday new york times five times a 
week said duane nystrom editor for the congressional 
publications office it is not a small project 
the embattled speaker already fighting allegations he violated 
house ethics rules was the object of fresh reports monday in the 
wall street journal about remarks he had included in the 
congressional record of dec 9 1985 
his 350word statement amounted to an effusive endorsement of 
the pacific institutes series of video motivational programs 
designed to enhance family togetherness and conversation 
marvelously useful wright gushed and available at a 
nominal price within the range of most american families 
wright didnt mention the 36000 a year annual salary that the 
company was paying his wife betty her job with another company is 
the basis for some of the ethics charges now facing the speaker 
the seattlebased pacific institute said it didnt ask for 
wrights remarks but it reprinted them later in promoting sales of 
the tapes at 3495 each or 400 for a full set of 21 
the revelation cant help wright in the fight for his political 
future but no one is suggesting this is the first the time 
congressional record provided an officiallooking plug 
nor is it the first embarrassment involving the record 
sen jesse helms rnc can vouch for that in 1986 helms 
inserted into the record a legal brief filed by a group opposing 
dialaporn telephone services citizens for decency through 
law 
that issue of the congressional record became a bestseller 
included in the brief and printed in the record was the full 
xrated text of one of the tapes hi im nellie from high 
society it began 
both episodes were possible because of the way the record is 
edited it isnt 
or at least it isnt edited for content copy is edited for 
errors and grammar but little else said nystrom 
there is virtually no censorship of comments put on the 
record he said the only thing that would be excised from the 
record would be obscenities 
content he said is governed by the rules of the house and 
senate the record prints what is said on the floor of the house or 
senate and members are free to submit additional statements 
remarks that violate the rules such as attacks on another member 
would be edited out 
in an effort to make the record more faithfully reflect what was 
said congress a few years ago decided to have remarks that were 
edited or added later appear in a different typeface 
but inserts can be as lengthy as a member of congress wants 
much of the pentagon papers for example was included 
the record is printed through the night and available the next 
morning and it is also available electronically by computer it 
has a press run of 24000 copies and nystrom figures it costs 
about 500 per page to print 
congressional rules generally bar members from receiving 
benefits as a result of improperly exerting their position and 
guidelines caution lawmakers against becoming so affiliated with 
a particular enterprise that it creates an appearance of 
impropriety 
wright declined to answer questions monday about his video plug 
but nystrom says he doubts wrights use of the record was unique 
if there was something wrong with that every member of 
congress would be guilty of doing that he said everyone 
uses the record to promote or call attention to some activity 
within their district 
i would see it as a matter of degrees he said

president daniel arap moi has replaced his 
vice president in a shakeup that leaves kenyas major tribe out of 
the governments top two jobs for the first time since independence 
moi named george saitoti the finance minister and a former 
professor of mathematics at the university of nairobi as the 
countrys sixth vice president since this former british colony won 
black rule 25 years ago 
he replaces josephat karanja who resigned as vice president and 
vice chairman of the ruling party after receiving a unanimous vote 
of no confidence from parliament saitoti retains the finance 
portfolio 
the change leaves both the presidency and vice presidency 
occupied for the first time by men who are not members of the 
dominant kikuyu tribe 
karanja is a kikuyu but his successor calls himself a masai a 
tribe of largely nomadic cattle herders moi the countrys second 
president since independence is a member of the small kalenjin 
tribe 
moi who had been expected to dismiss karanja if he did not 
voluntarily step down after the parliamentary vote announced the 
changes monday evening they included reshuffling the portfolios of 
nine ministers abolishing one cabinet post and creating a new one 
thursdays vote of no confidence came after nearly two months of 
attacks on the vice president 
they began with a relatively lowlevel politician telling a 
village gathering that an unnamed politician had been ursurping 
the authority of the president 
from then on accounts of verbal attacks on an unnamed 
politician appeared almost daily in nairobis three 
englishlanguage newspapers 
speculation quickly centered on karanja who it was said 
arrogantly forced others to kneel before him and was appealing to 
tribal animosities 
but it was not until two weeks ago that karanja finally was 
identified by his detractors 
through it all moi kept silent leading to widespread 
speculation that he sanctioned or even orchestrated the attacks 
kenya by law is a oneparty state and opposition is firmly 
suppressed 
in announcing his resignation karanja again denied the 
allegations against him which included charges of corrupt business 
practices and receiving money from neighboring uganda to 
destabilize the government 
most other cabinet changes were minor but moi scrapped the 
ministry of national guidance and political affairs and created a 
new ministry of reclamation and development of arid semiarid and 
waste land

jury deliberations at oliver norths 
irancontra trial resumed for the 10th day this morning a day 
after the presiding judge said a court challenge by the news media 
threatens the proceedings 
the panel which had met for nearly 46 hours in the nine 
previous sessions has given us district judge gerhard a gesell 
no notes in a week 
while the nine women and three men went about their work monday 
attention in the courtroom focused on a dispute in which 10 news 
organizations want access to a trial document that summarizes 
highly secret intelligence intercepts of a ciaassisted shipment of 
hawk missiles to iran 
the government says national security would be jeopardized by 
disclosing the stipulation which is part of the evidence before 
the jury and gesell says the matter could force a mistrial 
it is highly unusual to supply documents to the jury which are 
not part of the public record in the case gesell has already ruled 
against releasing the document and mondays proceedings were 
designed to create a record so that an appeals court court review 
his decision 
if you prevail in this matter gesell told a lawyer for the 
10 news organizations one possibility is i must discharge the 
jury 
the judge did not elaborate on how forced disclosure could lead 
to the mistrial 
but one possibility might be a protest by the justice department 
that national security secrets were about to be disclosed that 
would force gesell to withdraw the document from the jurys 
consideration which in turn could lead norths lawyers to say he 
could not get a fair trial 
after the court session lawyer timothy dyk told reporters that 
the jury has no security clearance the jurys free to discuss 
it then the rest of the country ought to see what the jury has 
under the classified information procedures act the government 
may file an affidavit with the court if it fears disclosure of a 
classified document would harm national security that act can lead 
to dismissal of the indictment or the specific charge affected by 
the information 
the stipulation of facts agreed to by the government and north 
summarizes messages intercepted by the national security agency on 
the shipment of hawk missiles in november 1985 from israel to iran 
with the help of the cia 
north is charged with claiming in a false chronology that no one 
in the us government knew until january 1986 about the missiles 
part of his defense is that thencia director william casey and 
national security adviser john poindexter knew about the missiles 
from the intercepted messages but perpetuated the false story 
north also said former national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
orchestrated the false chronology 
the news organizations disclosure motion was rejected by gesell 
on april 22 on grounds that the stipulation is a classified 
document 
the ruling was appealed and the higher court sent the matter 
back to gesell for a hearing on national security issues involved 
saying it could not make a decision without having such a record

problems with the sikorsky aircraft sh60f when he scrapped plans 
to order 18 of the antisubmarine helicopters in the 1990 budget 
says a congressman from the state where sikorsky is headquartered 
they were blown out of proportion rep john g rowland 
rconn said monday there were really no big problems at all 
cheney last week cited operational problems in the two sh60fs 
already delivered by sikorsky the stratford connbased division 
of united technologies corp cheney did include funds to keep the 
program going until future purchases can be made 
but according to briefing papers the navy provided to rowland a 
member of the house armed services committee most of the problems 
either have been fixed or are being resolved the navy said none of 
the failures pose a serious enough problem to prevent safe use 
the problems included improper installation of a warning light 
and damaged sonar cables according to the documents the navy said 
the helicopter has no substantial design flaws 
sikorsky officials also were fixing problems discovered during 
the previous years testing including an overly sensitive 
automatic altitude control designed to keep the craft at 50 feet 
above the water the system apparently forced the helicopter up and 
down with the motion of the waves below according to rowland aide 
david boomer 
the sh60f is a modified version of sikorskys sh60b seahawk 
the sh60f expected to replace the sikorskybuilt sh3h is made 
to be based on aircraft carriers for antisubmarine missions the 
sh60f lowers sonar equipment into the water and pulls it in search 
of enemy subs 
capt barton strong the navys program manager told rowland in 
the private briefing monday that the sh60f was performing well and 
would be a significant improvement over the older sh3h according 
to the congressman 
strong assured rowland that the pentagon still supported the 
sh60f program 
navy officials told the congressman that the administration 
plans to buy a total of 175 sh60f helicopters over 13 years seven 
were ordered in 1987 and 18 each in fiscal 1988 and 1989 the navy 
plans to return to a request of 18 in 1991 then 12 a year through 
1995 17 in 1996 24 in 1997 and 25 in 1998 
the helicopters cost about 158 million each 
the 1990 budget which originally called for 3136 million in 
sh60f spending was reduced by cheney to 94 million to cover 
spare parts and advanced procurement to keep the program alive no 
sh60fs would be purchased in 1990 under cheneys budget but 
congress still has to approve that plan

sales of new homes fell 55 percent in march 
and registered their first backtoback declines in more than a 
year the government said today 
the commerce department said sales of new singlefamily homes 
dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 587000 in march 
following a 105 percent decrease during february 
it was the first time sales had declined for two consecutive 
months since they fell for five months in a row from september 1987 
through january 1988 the months surrounding the october stock 
market crash 
the declines left sales in march at the slowest annual rate 
since the 576000 level of january 1988 
the report was another indication of the impact with which 
rising interest rates have hit the housing industry earlier 
reports on housing activity in march showed sales of existing homes 
declining for the third straight month and construction of new 
homes and apartments dropping for the second month in a row 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus 
reduce inflationary pressures 
fixedrate home mortgages last week were averaging 1103 
percent and lenders were asking an average initial rate of 938 
percent on oneyear adjustable rate mortgages according to a 
national survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the biggest drop in new home sales in march was in the west 
where sales dropped 205 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 155000 
sales in march were down 127 percent in the south to an annual 
rate of 199000 and declined 28 percent in the midwest to 105000 
sales surged 433 percent in the northeast to a rate of 129000 
after plunging 269 percent during the previous month 
the drop in sales was accompanied by a 47 percent increase in 
the median price of the homes sold as lowerincome buyers 
apparently were the first ones to leave the housing market 
the march median price for a new home was 126000 meaning half 
the homes sold for more and half for less 
the average price which is pulled up by sales of expensive 
homes was up 4 percent to 152200 
for the first three months of the year new home sales were 18 
percent lower than in the same period a year earlier

president francois mitterrand today urged plo 
leader yasser arafat to rewrite the groups original charter so 
that it no longer calls for the destruction of israel a spokesman 
for the french president said 
jewish merchants in paris garment district turned on their 
burglar alarms in unison today to protest arafats visit which has 
caused outrage in frances jewish community 
a point frequently made by israel is that despite the decision 
by the palestine national council the plos parliament in exile 
to recognize israel and renounce terrorism the organizations 
charter still calls for the jewish states destruction 
mitterrand told the palestine liberation organization chief to 
alter the charter 
during the meeting mr francois mitterrand noted that the 
continuation in force of the charter of the plo adopted in 1964 
was contrary to important points of the political program adopted 
by the palestine national council in algiers on nov 15 1988 and 
that in his eyes things should be made clear said a statement 
read by mitterrands spokesman hubert vedrine 
arafat later met with several other french political figures 
including pierre mauroy leader of the socialist party mauroy told 
reporters he also raised the article in the plo charter on the 
destruction of israel 
according to mauroy arafat replied that this text has existed 
for many years and is now outdatedmauroy said arafat reaffirmed 
the plos recognition of israel and abandonment of terrorism 
arafat after the 90minute meeting with mitterrand smiled and 
posed for photographers on the steps of the presidential palace 
urged to comment he said only it was a very successful and 
useful meeting 
he added that all would be explained at a news conference 
wednesday 
arafat met with mitterrand on the day his personal 
representative and the plos senior official in lebanon issam 
salem was shot and seriously wounded in an ambush in the lebanese 
port of sidon police there said 
plo officials with arafat in paris said salem died the source 
of their information was not known and there was no claim of 
responsibility for the attack 
about 2000 police including sharpshooters and helicopter 
patrols were mobilized for arafats visit during which he also 
was to meet with premier michel rocard and foreign minister roland 
dumas 
vedrine read the french statement about the meeting and said he 
would take no questions from reporters 
the statement said mitterrand questioned arafat on his position 
concerning elections proposed by the israeli government in the 
occupied west bank and occupied gaza strip and expressed french 
concern about the serious present situation of the inhabitants of 
these territories 
he indicated to mr yasser arafat that france would continue 
to act with all interested parties so that an international 
conference on the middle east can be held under the terms which he 
himself mitterrand has already suggested the statement 
concluded 
israeli leaders were critical of the visit prime minister 
yitzhak shamir said this man says a lot of things to the jewish 
people hes following the same tradition of the nazis 
today is israels national day of mourning for the 6 million 
jewish victims of the nazis during world war ii 
in the jewishdominated garment district in paris jewish 
manufacturers and shopkeepers set off their burglar alarms and 
private car alarms for five minutes to protest arafats visit 
it is ridiculous to officialize arafat before getting any 
guarantees said protester victor gotajner a clothing 
manufacturer 
frances jewish community is largely opposed to arafats visit 
and planned a demonstration today at the copernic synagogue where a 
bomb in october 1980 killed four people 
the united states began talks with the plo in december for the 
first time since in 13 years after arafat said he recognized 
israels right to exist and renounced terrorism

christian army commander gen michel aoun 
said today he would consider lifting a blockade of illegal ports 
run by syrianbacked moslem militias to end an eightweek conflict 
that has killed 278 people 
aoun made the offer in a 90minute news conference a few hours 
after fierce shelling duels today between christian and syrian 
gunners in and around beirut killed two people and wounded eight 
the ports are no longer the basic issue aoun said at the 
presidential palace in suburban baabda east of beirut syrian 
military presence in lebanon is the issue 
aoun said he might lift the blockade after talks with arab 
league representative lakhdar ibrahimi of algeria who was due in 
lebanon wednesday to try to salvage a shaky 4dayold ceasefire 
mediated by the league ibrahimi had been scheduled to arrive today 
but postponed his arrival according to sources in syria 
todays casualties raised the overall toll to 278 people killed 
and 1010 wounded since march 8 when fighting broke out between 
aouns christian army units and an alliance of syrian and druse 
forces 
a police spokesman said syrian gunners targeted the coastal 
strip north of beirut and prevented the french tanker penhors from 
approaching the power station in the suburb of zouk to unload fuel 
oil 
the barrage damaged the main power cable connecting the zouk 
plant with beirut and stripped the capital of its daily twohour 
ration of electricity said the police spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing rules 
the christian voice of lebanon radio blamed the ceasefire 
violation on syrian gunners and said aouns troops responded in 
selfdefense 
voice of the people radio of the prosyrian lebanese communist 
party blamed aoun for the renewed fighting 
aouns gunners started the barrage the radio said without 
elaboration 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across beirut and the 
flashes of artillery explosions lighted up the dark skies most 
civilians deserted their apartments and sought refuge in 
underground shelters 
the police spokesman said there was almost no traffic in beirut 
as the warring factions traded sniper fire and rocketpropelled 
grenades across the green line that divides the christian and 
moslem sectors 
it seems most civilians have decided to remain in basements 
and bomb shelters pending the outcome of ibrahimis mission the 
spokesman said 
ibrahimi was to meet wednesday with acting premier salim hoss 
head of the moslem cabinet in lebanons dual government and 
complete arrangements for the deployment of arab military observers 
to oversee a new truce 
an aide to hoss said ibrahimi and the sunni moslem leader will 
discuss a compromise to the sticking point of the truce aouns 
blockade of ports run by syrianbacked militias south of beirut 
the compromise calls for the deployment of arab observers at the 
ports to guarantee that they are not used for illegal 
activities said the aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the aide said it was ibrahimis responsibility to convince druse 
warlord walid jumblatt and shiite moslem leader nabih berri to 
accept the proposed solution 
berris shiite amal militia operates a singledock harbor in 
beiruts fishermens suburb of ouzai and jumblatts progressive 
socialist party runs two facilities at khaldeh and jiyeh south of 
the capital 
aoun on march 6 blockaded the three facilities that deny the 
state treasury of about 100 million in lost customs dues annually 
aoun also said the ports were used to smuggle drugs and 
terrorism 
jumblatts forces responded to aouns blockade by shelling the 
310squaremile christian enclave northeast of the capital syrian 
gunners later joined in the fighting but amal did not take part 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of failing 
to achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league by 
siding with the moslems in lebanons 14yearold civil war

emperor akihito and his mother the empress 
dowager will be the only heirs of the late emperor hirohito in 
order to keep together the royal treasures news reports said today 
kyodo news service said the imperial household agency asked nine 
other imperial successors to waive their rights of inheritance 
the palace declined comment however saying a public 
announcement now would be premature 
hirohito japans emperor for 62 years died jan 7 at age 87 
akihito his eldest son succeeded him and hirohitos wife nagako 
became empress dowager 
under japanese law legal heirs to property must claim their 
inheritance within six months of the owners death this would mean 
by july 7 in hirohitos case and the tax administration office 
must announce the claims within four months 
it will be the first public accounting of the imperial familys 
private finances since shortly after world war ii the government 
reported then that the imperial familys wealth amounted to the 
equivalent of about 113000 
such things as three sacred treasures a mirror sword and 
jewels handed down from emperor to emperor are taxexempt and 
the family owns no land but bank savings stocks and bonds under 
hirohitos name and paintings are subject to inheritance taxes 
kyodo said the palace will donate the art works to the 
government and continue to use them as governmentowned imperial 
property the land where the imperial family lives is owned by the 
government 
the imperial family formerly exempt from taxes was the 
wealthiest family in japan until us forces occupying this country 
after the war forced it to give up most of its property its 
wealth including real estate stocks and bonds reportedly 
amounted to about 29 million before it surrendered most of its 
holdings to the government

jury selection began today in the trial 
of a man accused of killing his two sons in a redhot foundry ladle 
on thanksgiving day 1987 
muskegon county circuit judge james graves jr rejected a motion 
by an attorney for defendant bartley james dobben for a nonjury 
trial 
dobben 28 who has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic 
has been shuffled among the states psychiatric centers since his 
arrest on nov 26 1987 
on that day dobben his wife susan and their children 
2yearold bartley and 15monthold peter were on their way to a 
family thanksgiving dinner when dobben pulled into the parking lot 
of the cannonmuskegon corp foundry where he worked in norton 
shores 
he left his pregnant wife in the car telling her he wanted to 
retrieve a bible and show his sons the operation 
minutes later dobben allegedly placed the boys in a huge 
foundry ladle used to hold molten metal and turned on the gas jets 
until the ladle reached 1300 degrees the boys quickly suffocated 
as the ladle became a searing cauldron autopsies showed 
dobbens attorney terry nolan contends his client should be 
found innocent by reason of insanity 
brett gardner an assistant muskegon county prosecutor says 
ample evidence exists to show dobben was criminally responsible for 
the slayings 
dobben has a long history of mental illness court records show 
that family members had him committed to the kalamazoo regional 
psychiatric hospital because they were frightened by his actions 
a september 1985 probate court order said dobben could be 
reasonably expected within the near future to intentionally or 
unintentionally seriously injure himself or others 
those suffering from paranoid schizophrenia live in a fantasy 
world and may have hallucinations or false perceptions and hear 
voices psychiatrists say 
after his release from the hospital dobben was given 
prescriptions for powerful drugs to control his behavior but 
family members said he often refused to take them especially after 
his religious views moved increasingly out of the mainstream 
he began to associate with a small fundamentalist group called 
emmanuel fellowship led by rood vaughan an unordained preacher 
and used car salesman 
vaughan who was to be called as a witness checked himself into 
the kalamazoo regional psychiatric hospital saturday one day after 
police said he attacked his mother she suffered a sprained wrist 
in the altercation 
it isnt known how vaughans hospitalization might affect 
dobbens trial which has been postponed several times as 
psychiatrists debated the defendants competency

president bush was deciding today whether to 
approve a us subsidized sale of 3 million tons of grain to the 
soviet union top congressional republicans said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said bush did not 
indicate which way he was leaning during a breakfast meeting with 
gop leaders but that the lawmakers strongly advised him to go 
ahead with the deal 
it would be bushs first approval of a major agricultural 
subsidy the sale has been the subject of intense disagreement both 
within the administration and in congress 
dole told reporters after the meeting that several lawmakers 
made strong pitches to the president on behalf of the sale 
the point being if were going to trade with soviet union which 
we are then we have to be competitive we have to meet world 
prices 
we made our case to the president said dole whose state is 
a leading grain producer i think there was general agreement 
among those this morning that if were going to be in this trade 
game weve got to be competitive the subsidys not very great in 
this case probably not as much as the storage costs 
the bush administration following the lead of the reagan 
administration has called for eventual elimination of all export 
subsidies it has said however that it would not unilaterally do 
away with such government farm support so long as other trading 
nations subsidized their exports 
dole and other participants said bush indicated he would make up 
his mind on the subsidies later today amid reports that the 
president might decide on partial subsidies for the grain sales 
the administration is divided on the proposed grain sale with 
the agriculture department supporting it and the office of 
management and budget and the national security council reportedly 
opposing it 
the sale would be made under a 1985 law the export enhancement 
program under which nations that buy us agricultural goods 
receive bonus quantities of commodities from government stockpiles

the united states has proposed that 
nato make unilateral cuts in its shortrange nuclear weapons in an 
effort to bridge sharp divisions in the western alliance over the 
missiles a nato official said today 
under the proposal the soviet union would be challenged to meet 
the lower levels of the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the weapons would be trimmed as part of nato plans to modernize 
the aging lance surfacetosurface missile a project that has 
sparked opposition in many european countries 
further cuts in nuclear arms would be considered after progress 
was made in recently opened arms talks in vienna on slashing 
conventional or nonnuclear forces in europe the official said 
in washington a us official confirmed the account but said it 
was one of several options under consideration the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said another option would be west 
germany resuming research and development of a nonnuclear missile 
that could attack airfields and other targets now covered by the 
lance 
west germany where the lance launchers are based last month 
demanded early talks with the soviets on reducing shortrange 
nuclear weapons the united states and britain strongly oppose the 
idea 
the us ideas put forward last week to nato representatives in 
brussels could serve as elements of a possible way to resolve the 
issue prior to a nato summit may 2930 
the nato official described the american plan as a proposal 
for a working document for how to proceed on the issue it doesnt 
offer any compromise with the german proposal 
nato officials have been trying to find satisfactory language on 
the weapons issue to include in a longawaited blueprint of natos 
strategy in arms control and force planning that is to be presented 
at the summit 
a senior us official suggested last month that nato may fail 
to resolve the differences over the shortrange weapons he raised 
the possibility that the alliance would not reach a common position 
in time for the summit 
such an outcome would likely lead to speculation about serious 
divisions in nato the western nations are trying to present a 
united front in the face of defense cuts promised by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
the nato official said the american plan draws together several 
ideas that have been put forward in the alliance 
it would take reductions proposed by us gen john galvin 
natos supreme military commander in europe in a recent study of 
his nuclear weapons requirements and challenge the soviets to meet 
the lower levels 
galvin has pressed for nato to agree to upgrade the lance 
missile arguing its modernization would permit a substantial 
reduction in nuclear artillery 
the lance missile was introduced in 1972 and will become 
obsolete in 1995 military analysts say it has a range of a little 
more than 60 miles the new one would be extended to more than 250 
miles just under the limits of the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany said earlier in the year 
that a decision to deploy the new missiles should be delayed until 
1991 or 1992 which would be after elections next year in germany 
nato defense ministers at a nuclear strategy session last 
month gave only lukewarm backing to the modernization program 
saying nuclear forces must be kept uptodate where necessary 
us defense secretary dick cheney said he was satisfied with 
the endorsement and was reasonably confident congress would 
provide more money to continue development of the new generation 
lance 
there are currently 88 lance launchers most of which are based 
in germany officials have said the warsaw pact outnumbers nato by 
about 12to1 in shortrange nuclear missile launchers 
the alliance contends it needs to maintain its nuclear stockpile 
to balance the enormous superiority the east has built up in 
conventional arms 
nato and the seven warsaw pact countries began talks in march on 
cutting conventional forces in europe

but the fire department had one last duty 
the firefighters paused last week to conduct a brief service for 
madeline murrays cat 
the simple grave near the charred home was the latest in the 
departments long tradition of burying pets who die in fires 
weve always had the custom of burying them but in the past 
year or so weve started having a little service making it real 
dignified said lt jerry allen it is just a simple thing we 
do but people seem to appreciate it 
when firefighters discover that a pet has died they ask the 
owners if they would like them to bury the animal allen said 
owners always accept 
it is hard enough losing your couch your paintings your 
furniture he said 
for the ceremony the firefighters gather and take off their 
helmets one will say a few words allen said the site is not 
marked but the owners if they are not present are told of the 
general area of the burial 
i have always thought of it as part of my job allen said 
i have a dog at home i have kids at home this sort of shows the

president bush today called for all us 
allies to condemn anticipated massive election fraud in panama 
where the administration predicts manuel antonio noriega will steal 
sundays vote 
all nations that value democracy that understand free and 
fair elections are the very heart of their democratic system 
should speak out against election fraud in panama bush said in 
remarks to the council of the americas an organization of business 
people that means the democracies of europe as well as nations 
in this hemisphere struggling to preserve the democratic systems 
theyve fought so hard to put in place 
in a speech touching on the economic political and social 
situation throughout the hemisphere the president also said that 
unless nicaraguas leftist government changes the ominous 
actions leading to its elections next february it will be a 
tragic setback and a dangerous one the consolidation of tyranny 
will not be peace it will be a crisis waiting to happen 
he said paraguay where mondays elections led to victory for 
gen andres rodriguez is on its way to joining the democratic 
mainstream 
we congratulate presidentelect rodriguez on his electoral 
victory and look forward to working with him bush said 
however white house spokesman b jay cooper later told 
reporters there were several instances of questionable but not 
illegal procedures in the paraguayan elections 
there were also administrative problems according to 
embassy and international observers he said but not a pattern of 
overall fraud 
the small number of votes affected by these irregularities 
would not make a significant difference in the overall election 
results in which rodriguez got 70 percent of the vote cooper 
said 
bush continued to step up the adminstrations antinoriega 
rhetoric as the panamanian election nears he repeated his promise 
that the united states will not recognize the results of a 
fraudulent election engineered to keep noriega in power 
the government controlled by noriega is backing the generals 
close associate carlos duque for president an opposition 
coalition is backing guillermo endara 
bush said it took great courage for the opposition to enter 
the campaign 
a free and fair vote in the elections bush said would 
enable panama to take a significant step towards ending the 
international isolation and internal economic crisis brought on by 
the noriega regime 
but added bush it is evident that the regime is ready to 
resort to massive election fraud in order to remain in power 
in nicaragua where the bush administration is supplying 
nonlethal aid to the contra rebels until the elections next year 
the president blasted the election laws recently passed by the 
sandinistacontrolled national assembly 
he accused the sandinistas of imposing a stacked deck 
against their opposition by unilaterally setting the rules giving 
excessive enforcement powers to the interior ministry and barring 
private ownership of television stations 
bush praised the recent elections in el salvador and said the 
new president alfredo cristiani has our support

vermont has been courting movie makers 
but the state almost blew it when it sent don johnson a fat tax 
bill for his work here 
the miami vice star got a bill in february for more than 
50000 of the money he earned in 1987 while filming the movie 
sweethearts dance in hyde park 
he was upset because he felt he was being singled out said 
don lyons a spokesman for the state film bureau which promotes 
vermont as a movie location 
on monday the state senate finance committee considered a tax 
exemption for outofstate actors and film crews who are in vermont 
for under four months 
the proposal would be retroactive to jan 1 1986 which would 
let johnson off the hook 
the state administration believes the money the film industry 
brings to vermont far exceeds what could be raised by taxing actors 
and crew members

the county has broken the sound barrier in 
court by paying for a signlanguage interpreter for a partly deaf 
person called to jury duty 
at least deaf people now have the option of serving on a jury 
just like everybody else said nathan shapiro an engineer who 
was assigned the interpreter monday because of a settlement reached 
in october of a lawsuit 
the council for the deaf sued los angeles county in 1981 for 
refusing to pay the 4000 shapiro spent to hire an interpreter to 
help him serve as a juror in 1980 hearing impairment had been a 
valid excuse for being excused from jury duty 
shapiro was summoned again in 1987 for jury duty and the county 
still refused to pay for an interpreter said marcella meyer 
council executive director 
the new interpreter service will cost the county 30000 for a 
fulltime coordinator plus 171 a day for each interpreter 
its about time that deaf people had the right to serve as 
jurors if they want to meyer said this is one step forward 
we hope this will encourage other deaf and hearingimpaired 
people to become jurors said ed johnson director of the 
countys interpreter services we now have seven others in our 
jury pool waiting to be assigned to a court

pope john paul ii who has flown the 
equivalent of the distance between the earth and the moon and more 
than halfway back broke another barrier tuesday by becoming the 
first supersonic pontiff 
like the seasoned traveler that he is the pope took it in 
stride quietly reading a book about animal behavior as the air 
france jetliner flashed across the indian ocean toward africa at 
1350 mph twice the speed of sound 
hes showing mild curiousity said vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro as the needlenosed concorde carried the pope from the 
french island of reunion to lusaka zambia on the third leg of his 
fournation nineday pilgrimage 
the chief cabin steward said john paul read during his two hours 
and 34 minutes aboard but he also took time out to learn some 
details of the 1920mile flight 
he was very interested he asked us about the speed and the 
altitude said the steward who declined to give his name 
the crew served 1983 vintage perrierjouet champagne but the 
pope opted for mineral water and orange juice 
he said he had a long day ahead of him and he wanted to keep 
a clear head the steward said adding that the pontiff only 
picked at lunch of goose liver pate with truffles lobster in 
sauterne sauce potatoes rice creole cheeses and lemon meringue 
dessert 
the concorde left reunion and rocketed out over the ocean at a 
speed of 225 mph in 30 seconds about 10 minutes later the digital 
speedometer in the cabin showed the concorde had reached mach 1 or 
675 mph 
after another 10 minutes the speed doubled to mach 2 as the 
concorde reached 50000 feet 
since the concorde does not fly at supersonic speed over land 
it detoured around madagascar and gradually slowed to subsonic 
before reaching the african continent over mozambique the plane 
touched down at 170 mph 
prior to the flight vatican officials said the pope would fly 
only at subsonic speed to africa but the crew evidently wanted to 
show their distinguished passenger what the concorde was capable of 
john paul returns to a lessexotic form of air travel wednesday 
taking an air zambia art42 passenger plane to the northern city of 
kitwe 
easily the most traveled pope in history john paul has flown 
more than 370000 miles in the 10 years of his papacy 
he has far surpassed pope paul vi who became known as the 
apostle on the move in nine overseas journeys between 196470 
john paul is on his 41st trip

the high price a las vegas casino owner 
paid for throwing a party on hitlers birthday has revived the 
question why dont casino employees have the same constitutional 
rights as everyone else 
ralph engelstad owner of the imperial palace agreed in 
february to pay a 15 million fine after the nevada gaming 
commission ruled that a party he held at the hotelcasino on april 
20 1988 disgraced nevadas gambling industry 
this was just a good excuse to have a party for the family as 
he calls the employees at his hotel said engelstads lawyer 
george dickerson who maintains that the private party celebrated 
the restoration of a world war ii truck in engelstads historic 
vehicle collection 
commissioners dropped claims of damaging nevadas reputation in 
the hitler party case and of destroying evidence in an unrelated 
case after engelstad agreed to pay one of the highest fines ever 
levied by the casino regulators 
officials said the party featured a picture of engelstad in a 
nazi uniform and bartenders in tshirts bearing hitlers picture 
and the label adolf hitler european tour 193945 
gaming control board lawyer scott shearer said the fine was 
appropriate because engelstad damaged the reputation of nevada 
dickerson said fining his client clearly violated engelstads 
first amendment right to free expression but dickerson said 
engelstad made a pragmatic business decision not to take the 
matter to court 
dickerson joins a growing group of lawyers and civil liberties 
activists who contend that the state tramples the rights of casino 
owners and workers in its zeal to protect the image of nevadas 
largest industry 
nevada law says gaming is vital to the state and its continued 
growth depends upon public trust that can be maintained only by 
strict regulation under that policy the state can deny or limit a 
casino operators license 
grounds for denying or revoking a license or levying a fine 
include such obvious violations as cheating players or skimming 
profits other grounds include a criminal background associations 
with criminals lack of integrity or lack of business sense 
theyll do whatever they want to do until some court tells 
them they cant do it said lawyer oscar goodman the las vegas 
attorney in 1979 won a us supreme court ruling that commissioners 
couldnt order a casino worker to apply for a license after he left 
the gambling division of a hotel and became entertainment manager 
goodman complained that a rule letting commissioners punish 
licensees for associating with persons of notorious or 
unsavory reputation forces aspiring casino operators to give up 
rights to free association 
every day these folks when they appear before the commission 
for licensing they arewilling to say give me my license and i 
wont talk to buddies ive known all my life and had into my home 
and broken bread with said goodman 
gaming commission chairman john f oreilly said a gaming 
license is a privilege not a right 
there is a balancing process any time you have a case where a 
persons constitutional rights guarantee the right to free 
expression as opposed to whether that person is doing something 
inconsistent with maintaining the privilege to operate in the 
gaming industry he said 
oreilly said commissioners have guaranteed constitutional 
protections to license holders including freedom of association 
i think what has to be looked at is the degree of association and 
the significance of association he said 
the us supreme court has often ruled it has no power over 
nevada casinos because gambling isnt an interstate industry 
shelley chase spokeswoman for the nevada chapter of the 
american civil liberties union said the group hasnt opposed any 
state gaming rules but she said the aclu believes it could 
successfully challenge many as too sweeping 
this is a heavily regulated industry and gaming is certainly 
a privileged industry she said however we are worried about 
laws that are arbitrary capricious and vague and these laws are 
certainly vague especially the one which says you may not bring 
disrepute on the state what does that mean what you wear 
ms chase said aclu officials were surprised that dickerson 
didnt approach them for help because engelstad could claim added 
legal protection since he lives at the imperial palace where the 
party took place 
what you do in your own residence is your own business she 
said

workers today began tearing town a 
barbed wire fence and electronic alarm system that separates 
hungary from austria 
the event marked the closing of an era in hungarys 
relations with the west said andras koevari of the interior 
ministry 
hungarian glasnost has many faces and one of them is the 
world passport which moved hungary closer to western europe he 
said referring to laws instituted last year that allow hungarians 
to go to the west as often as they can afford to do so 
because hungarians do not require visas to visit austria 
millions have taken advantange of the new regulations to travel 
regularly 
the work begun today to dismantle the fence on hungarys 
220mile border with austria is to be completed by dec 1 1990 
the fence an electronic alarm system which is about a mile from 
the actual border once was used to help prevent hungarians from 
escaping to the west 
a border official tibor vidus said about 97 percent of those 
who recently have tried to flee across the hungarian border to 
austria are not hungarians when work is completed he said there 
will be no fence on the border with austria 
balazs novoki another border official said the border was 
tightly secured until 1955 and was resecured with minefields after 
a failed 1956 antisoviet revoltthe mines were removed because 
austria complained floods sometimes washed the explosives across 
the border killing farm laborers 
the electronic signal fence was installed by 1972 
the communist party leadership decided in february that 
considering hungarys improved relations with the west the 
electronic fence should be removed

the famous bonneville salt flats the dry 
hardpacked lakebed where thrill seekers for decades have gone to 
set world land speed records are losing salt and the government 
wants to know why 
the 100squaremile area of smooth uninterrupted surface where 
even jetpowered cars can run flat out for miles has been 
shrinking 1 percent a year for 28 years said us bureau of land 
management district manager deane zeller 
given this longterm trend its apparent that the salt flats 
as we know them today are in trouble clearly some hard questions 
need to be addressed he said in a statement monday 
the blm is asking state agencies the us geological survey 
racing interests and a potash company to join in a threeyear 
330000 study of what can be done 
zeller said that while other salt flats exist in australia and 
africa none are of the quality and accessibility of the bonneville 
salt flats 
the blm has the backing of the southern california timing 
association for the study the group organizer of the largest of 
the annual speed trials held on the salt has complained for years 
about deterioration of the racing surface 
many suspect a wendover companys practice of draining brine

the postal service is facing a financial 
crunch with revenues running short of what was expected following 
last years rate increase postmaster general anthony frank said 
tuesday 
the mail service still expects to finish this fiscal year in the 
black but with a significantly smaller margin than had been 
planned officials said 
frank told the agencys governing board that changes must be 
made to hold down costs and improve revenues 
so far in the fiscal year which began in october the postal 
service took in 185 billion and spent 176 billion leaving net 
revenues of 847 million reported senior assistant postmaster 
general comer s coppie 
but that was 104 million less than expected in the wake of the 
postal rate increase that took effect in april 1988 
because it is required by law to break even over the long run 
the postal service counts on showing a surplus in the period right 
after a rate hike in order to balance losses which will occur as 
its costs rise 
lately rate hikes have come every three years and frank has 
said he hopes to maintain that cycle with the next increase in 
1991 
income has been less than expected because of changes in the 
mix of mail said coppie in other words many large mailers 
have switched from more costly first class mail to the presorted 
first or third class which costs them less and brings in less 
revenue for the post office 
while managers expected some of this switch it has occurred 
faster than they expected with the resulting decline in revenue 
said coppie 
at the same time continuing efforts to cut costs have not been 
as successful as had been hoped for he added 
frank told the postal board of governors that he is continuing 
to press forward with automation of the postal system as a means of 
cutting costs and speeding delivery 
also he said he is trying to improve employee relations and is 
looking for ways to broaden product lines and make prices more 
competitive 
the postal service cannot change its domestic rates without 
seeking approval from the independent postal rate commission an 
agency which frank criticized for micromanaging his service in 
changing some rates requested a year ago 
the postal service is free to revise international rates and 
recently did so cutting the price of a halfpound interntional 
express mail shipment to 1075 with an introductory rate of 875 
to try to attract new business depending on destination the price 
had ranged from 15 to 18

female alligators that have no qualms 
about going for a romantic tumble in the wilds are having trouble 
breeding behind bars 
sometimes captive girl gators just need a good tranquilizer 
before being artificially inseminated said paul cardeilhac a 
wildlife reproduction specialist at the university of florida 
college of veterinary medicine 
we were literally rodeoing the female gators before and they 
would rebel by not laying eggs for us said cardeilhac who 
conducts his research at gatorland zoo in kissimmee the worlds 
largest alligator farm 
but weve found that a tranquilizing drug like valium will 
restrain them without interfering with the reproductive process or 
affecting the hatchlings 
reproduction in farm alligators is only 10 percent to 20 percent 
as effective as in the wild where females produce about 22 
hatchlings each he said 
cardeilhac who has studied reproductive problems in captive 
alligators for nearly a decade made alligatorbreeding history in 
1981 when 11 healthy baby gators hatched as the result of 
fertilization by his artificial insemination technique

the government reported tuesday that sales of 
new homes dropped 55 percent in march after plunging 105 percent 
in february as higher interest rates took their toll in the 
housing market 
it was the first time sales of new singlefamily homes had 
posted backtoback declines since they fell five times in a row in 
the months surrounding the october 1987 stock market crash 
the new declines left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 587000 in march the lowest level since the 576000 pace of 
january 1988 the commerce department reported 
earlier reports on activity elsewhere in the housing sector also 
pointed downward in march as interest rates on fixedrate 
mortgages hovered around the 11 percent mark more than a 
percentage point above levels of a year earlier 
the other reports showed that sales of existing homes dropped 
for the third straight month in march and that construction of new 
homes and apartments was down for the second month in a row 
as long as mortgage rates stay high or move a little higher 
the housing market is not likely to improve much said economist 
david berson of the federal national mortgage association any 
improvement in housing will almost certainly have to come from a 
decline in mortgage rates 
the federal reserve for a year has been pushing interest rates 
upward in an effort to slow economic growth and thus restrain 
inflationary pressures 
housing has been among the sectors of the economy most affected 
and some analysts believe further declines in sales and 
construction are likely 
we expect further weakening in the second and third quarters 
of the year and then hopefully a rebound beginning late in the 
year said david seiders chief economist for the national 
association of home builders 
the association is forecasting newhome sales of 616000 for all 
of 1989 down 89 percent from last year 
john tuccillo chief economist for the national association of 
realtors said that interest rates are near their peak and that the 
high rates have taken as big a toll as will be taken on the 
housing market 
when rates start to come down the people who have been forced 
out of the market will come off the sidelines he said 
the march decline in sales reflected decreases in most regions 
of the country and occurred despite a 433 percent sales surge in 
the northeast where sales rose to an annual rate of 129000 
analysts said the northeast gain was a rebound from a 269 percent 
decline in that region during the previous month 
the biggest drop in march was in the west where sales dropped 
205 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 155000 units 
sales were down 127 percent in the south to an annual rate of 
199000 and declined 28 percent in the midwest to 105000 
the shift in sales activity to the higherpriced northeast and 
the dropoff in the less expensive south contributed to a 47 
percent increase in the median price of homes sold in march 
the march median price for a new home was a record 126000 
meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less the average 
price which is pulled up by sales of expensive homes was up 4 
percent to a record 152200 
for the first three months of the year newhome sales were 18 
percent lower than for the same period a year earlier

nepals washington ambassador said tuesday his 
landlocked country will continue expanding its relations with china 
and might complain to the united nations about economic pressure 
from its other big neighbor india 
indias monthlong cutoff of necessities to nepal causes great 
human hardship and threatens the stability of nepal said 
ambassador mohan man sainju 
nevertheless he told an audience at the national press club 
his nation is still open to any dialogue any approach suggested 
by india for solving the crisis 
sainju described as beyond comprehension statements by 
indian external affairs minister pv narasimha rao and indias 
washington ambassador that there is no economic blockade and nepal 
has itself to blame for reduced supplies of necessities such as 
oil baby food salt and medicine 
petroleum shipments have been held up since march 23 a week 
before india declared that a treaty with nepal had lapsed he said 
sainju also said that the nepalese finance minister bb 
pradhan plans to talk about a longterm arrangement with china 
on economic matters pradhan is in beijing for meetings of the 
asian development bank and the nepalchina joint economic 
commission 
if nepalese policy openings to china upset india let india say 
so openly sainju suggested 
rao in a long report to the indian parliament last week about 
relations with nepal did not mention nepals recent arms purchases 
or other contacts with china but sainju asked if nepals 
redefinition of political and military relationships is at the root 
of the dispute with india replied i think so 
the realities that exist in 1989 have got to be taken into 
account he said nepal was isolated for so long it never 
wants to be isolated again 
asked if nepal would formally request help from other countries 
the united nations or other international agencies sainju said 
we may the un is a very important organization for small 
countries and nepal is one of the countries really committed to 
un values 
but we still believe good sense will prevail on the part of 
india we do not want to believe india is bullying its 
neighbor 
the state department last month urged india and nepal to 
negotiate their differences and declined comment on the relative 
merits of this bilateral issue

the aids crisis has generated nationwide support 
for sex education but taken attention away from other important 
sexual topics like pregnancy prevention according to a survey 
released tuesday 
support for sex education is strong not only does a large 
majority of the american public support it but so do most state 
education agencies and large school districts concluded the 
study risk and responsibility teaching sex education in 
americas schools today 
but the report found that of the nearly 63 million states 
spent in 198788 on sex education curricula 51 million was 
specifically for aids instruction 
forty states either support or require sex education said the 
study by the alan guttmacher institute 
but jeannie rosoff president of the institute said that states 
have abdicated their role in sex education by giving districts 
only vague guidelines on how to teach it and by not setting teacher 
certification standards 
the study also found that nearly one third of sex education 
teachers said their biggest problem was pressure from parents the 
community or administrators especially when dealing with 
homosexuality condoms or abortion 
the 323000 study funded primarily by the carnegie corp of 
new york examined teaching policies and methods in grades 712 
the findings were published in family planning perspectives a 
bimonthly publication of the guttmacher institute a private 
nonprofit research group that studies reproductive health 
the study consisted of three nationwide mailed surveys conducted 
in the spring of 1988 one polled 4241 of the estimated 50000 
public school teachers who teach sex education a second surveyed 
all 50 state education departments and the district of columbia 
regarding sex education laws policies and curricula the third 
asked similar questions of 162 large school districts 
it concluded that the crisis orientation created by aids has 
led educators to stress the negative outcomes of sex while 
often neglecting other important issues 
in only six states connecticut hawaii massachusetts 
michigan new jersey and vermont are condoms discussed 
explicitly michigans curriculum discusses where condoms can be 
bought and new jerseys suggests ways of teaching students how to 
use them 
five other states alabama new york north carolina ohio and 
oklahoma discuss condoms but in a negative light usually 
stressing the failure rate new yorks curriculum extols abstinence 
as freedom from the bother and dangers of the pill iud and other 
contraceptives 
the curricula leave something to be desired in terms of 
balance said asta m kenney a coauthor of the study 
eight out of 10 teachers surveyed said they could use help in 
teaching about pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted 
diseases 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association said the study demonstrates the need for better 
teacher training 
our public schools must provide teachers with the necessary 
tools and resources to conduct effective sex education at all 
levels she said 
twentynine percent of teachers complained of inadequate 
materials and 25 percent said students were a problem because they 
were embarrassed or ignorant about sex 
among other findings 
46 states plus the district of columbia support aids education 
and 43 plus the district of columbia support instruction about 
other sexually transmitted diseases fortythree support the 
teaching of abstinence 
32 states require or encourage instruction on pregnancy 
prevention alabama discourages such instruction and utah prohibits 
it only delaware and georgia specify contraception methods and 
outline the risks and benefits of each 
half the states require some kind of training or certification 
to teach sex education but only michigan ohio utah and the 
district of columbia require teachers to have taken a course in 
human sexuality 
87 percent of large districts have sex or aids curricula and 96 
percent cover the negative aspects of teenage sex more than 70 
percent of the districts discuss abstinence as the best alternative 
in grades 710 but such lessons drop off to 50 percent in grades 
11 and 12

the fbi said tuesday it may release some 
details of agents visits to the nations libraries to monitor 
soviet and east bloc intelligence agents the program has been 
questioned by those who say it violates the confidentiality of 
library users 
the bureau has been conducting what it calls an awareness 
program in the new york city area telling librarians that soviet 
and east bloc agents use libraries to seek technical data and to 
approach potential recruits 
the fbi also goes into libraries elsewhere in the country in 
response to specific counterintelligence investigations of 
suspected east bloc agents who have used those facilities 
the bureau says the program is a narrowly focused effort which 
does not infringe on the publics use of the nations libraries 
there is not a widespread investigation tromping on the 
rights of individuals engaged in the use of american libraries 
said fbi spokesman milt ahlerich 
the fbis comments are in connection with an agreement reached 
with a private group which had sued seeking access to some of the 
information the bureau gathered in its investigations the suit was 
filed under the freedom of information act 
a stipulation reached between the bureau and the national 
security archives was signed monday by us district court judge 
louis f oberdorfer 
the bureau will begin processing more than 3000 pages of 
documents related to library visits in at least 13 states said 
archives director scott armstrong 
the archives is a nonprofit research facility that collects 
declassified information on national security issues 
civil liberties and library groups have objected to the 
surveillance program they say it has a chilling effect on 
constitutional free speech rights and violates state laws and 
library rules designed to protect the confidentiality of library 
users 
quinlan shea special counsel for the archives group said the 
stipulation is an important step toward responding to the concerns 
of groups which have questioned the fbis effort 
we sensed in discussions that the bureau would like to sort of 
reassure the library community that this isnt some halfcrazed 
search and destroy mission by the fbi in the nations libraries 
said shea

hungary on tuesday began cutting 
down the barbedwire fence and alarm system that divides it from 
austria removing one more barrier between this increasingly 
liberal socialist country and the west 
a crowd in this border town watched as bulldozers removed one of 
the concrete pylons that hold up the winding 8foot high fence 
rusted barbed wire lay in bundles nearby 
hungary says it expects to have all the fencing which has a 
builtin electronic alarm system that was used to detect people 
escaping to the west by dec 1 1990 
hungary said last year it would remove the fence it built 40 
years ago because of fewer travel restrictions a desire for closer 
ties with austria and the cost of maintaining a barrier that has 
become obsolete 
the event marks the closing of an era in hungarys relations 
with the west said andras koevari of the interior ministry 
hungarian glasnost has many faces and one of them is the 
world passport which moved hungary closer to western europe 
koevari said 
hungary last year instituted what are among eastern europes 
most liberal travel laws allowing its citizens to travel to the 
west as often as they can afford it 
because hungarians do not require visas to visit neutral 
austria millions have taken advantange of the new regulations to 
travel regularly 
but the travel rules also have made hungary a key escape point 
for refugees from other less liberal east bloc countries such as 
czechoslovakia east germany and romania 
tibor vidus a hungarian border official said 97 percent of 
those who try to flee across the hungarian border to austria are 
not hungarians 
balazs novoki a senior border guard official estimated the 
cost of dismantling the system at between 500000 to 660000 
he said civilians living in the border region were being asked 
to help tear down the barriers 
the fence stands about a mile from the actual border between 
the two are field that authorities used to keep plowed so fleeing 
refugees could be more easily spotted 
once during the 1950s hungarian authorities planted mines in 
the no mans land between border and fence the electronic 
system was installed in 1972 
with the fence gone novoki and vidus both said the military 
would have a greater responsibility to watch for illegal crossings 
hungary is among the most liberal of the soviet bloc nations 
the communist party leadership in february endorsed a multiparty 
system but leaders remain split over the pace and scope of reforms

defense secretary dick cheney has approved 
plans submitted by another 36 states or territories to step up use 
of their national guard units in fighting drug trafficking the 
pentagon said tuesday 
the additional approvals bring to 48 the number of plans now in 
place for the expanded use of guard units it also expands to 252 
million the amount committed to the druginterdiction program for 
the national guard 
the pentagon action makes the states eligible for extra federal 
funds from a special congressional appropriation of 40 million 
approved last year to finance such national guard operations 
cheney announced the first approvals on march 30 concentrating 
then on 12 highpriority border states those 12 states together 
were authorized to use 294 percent of the 40 million or 118 
million 
on tuesday the pentagon said cheney approved commitment of 
another 1343 million to 34 states puerto rico and the virgin 
islands of those on the latest approval list new york will 
receive the most 18 million followed by puerto rico with 11 
million and the virgin islands with 873835 
remaining plans are in the final review process the 
pentagon said 
the pentagon said the plans of each state varied to some extent 
but in general the state and territorial governments are 
planning to increase national guard operations by emphasizing more 
aerial photography and other imagery radar surveillance 
longrange reconnaissance assistance in searching containers and 
the transportation of law enforcement personnel equipment and 
seized substances 
in addition the pentagon said some of the state governments 
planned to expand training of law enforcement personnel and 
increase the loans of military equipment 
this expanded role does not include direct participation by 
guard personnel in police activities such as arrest and seizure 
the pentagon stressed adding its goal is supporting civilian 
drug law enforcement agencies in the nationwide crusade against 
drugs 
besides new york the other states and the amounts their guard 
units are receiving include

an antiapartheid activist was 
assassinated outside his home just days after completing a report 
contending death squads are stalking government opponents his 
editor said tuesday 
david webster a university lecturer was shot in the chest 
monday by an assailant who fired a shotgun from a passing car 
police said tuesday police spokesman col frans malherbe said 
doctors removed 16 pellets from websters body 
police offered a 4000 reward for information leading to the 
killers and released sketches of three unidentified white male 
suspects 
glenn moss coeditor of south african review said an article 
by webster and a close friend maggie friedman was to appear in 
the political journals next edition in august 
assassinations are used as one of the methods of controlling 
government opposition when all other methods such as detention or 
intimidation have failed the article says it is a very rare 
event indeed when such assassinations are ever solved 
the past 12 months have witnessed a steady tempo of 
kidnappings and assassinations of antiapartheid activists 
carried out by clandestine groups presumably a death squad 
expressions of sorrow and outrage over the white activists 
slaying came from blacks and whites and from antiapartheid 
academic labor and student groups flags were flown at halfstaff 
tuesday at the university of the witwatersrand where webster 44 
taught anthropology 
max coleman who worked with webster against race 
discrimination told hundreds of mourners at the johannesburg 
campus monday night there is only one group that stood to gain 
from this act those who are dedicated to perpetuating the brutal 
and vicious system that david dedicated his life to opposing 
a statement in london from the african national congress 
guerrilla movement said websters death is the latest in a long 
chain of such acts carried out by supporters of the apartheid 
regime determined to silence their opponents by whatever means 
the congress of south african trade unions said webster was 
not just a sympathizer in our struggle he was a friend a comrade 
an active participant 
several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent 
years many white activists in south africa receive anonymous 
threats but few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing 
of political science lecturer rick turner 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said i want to make it 
clear on behalf of the government that the murder is strongly 
condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to apprehend 
those responsible 
but south african archbishop desmond tutu said i would be 
surprised if the assassins are apprehended 
in a statement from an anglican church meeting in cyprus tutu 
said it was yet another example of the methods used against those 
who stand for justice in south africa 
the south african council of churches said websters death has 
tragically demonstrated the vulnerability of antiapartheid 
activists in south africa given the fact that those who murder 
opponents of the apartheid system are never brought to book 
the banned detainees parents support committee said of webster 
his work went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover 
of darkness

president bush urged us allies tuesday to 
denounce massive election fraud anticipated in panamas 
presidential voting sunday saying it is time for the plain 
truth 
in particular bush called on european democracies to raise 
their voices against alleged electionrigging by panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega to ensure the victory of his 
figurehead candidate carlos duque 
let me be clear bush said the united states will not 
recognize the results of a fraudulent election engineered simply to 
keep noriega in power 
bush made his remarks in a speech at the state department before 
the council of the americas an organization of businessmen with 
interests in latin america 
the address marked another step in the united states yearold 
failed campaign to force noriega from power following his us 
indictment on drugsmuggling charges fearing that noriega will 
steal sundays election the bush administration is trying to 
discredit the outcome 
it is evident that the regime is ready to resort to massive 
election fraud in order to remain in power bush said the 
noriega regime continues to threaten and intimidate panamanians who 
believe in democracy 
its also attempting to limit the presence and freedom of 
action of international observers and to prevent journalists from 
reporting on the election process in panama said bush who has 
not yet announced the makeup of the us observer team 
all nations that value democracy should speak out against 
election fraud in panama bush said and that means the 
democracies of europe they should be speaking out about this 
 
he said it is time for the plain truth the day of the 
dictator is over the peoples right to democracy must not be 
denied 
in panama maj edgardo lopez a spokesman for the pronoriega 
panamanian defense forces said the opposition has been demoralized 
and they know they are going to lose the election 
they have sent an sos to the white house urgent president 
bush to take immediate action or noriega will stay lopez said 
touching on developments in other nations of the hemisphere 
bush accused nicaragua of enacting restrictive laws to thwart the 
opposition in elections next february 
the result is a stacked deck against the opposition and 
stacked rules of the game bush said 
setting out guidelines by which the united states will judge 
whether nicaraguas elections are free bush said the government 
must allow outside observers to have free access to all election 
places and proceedings 
it means a secret ballot on election day the freedom to 
campaign to organize to hold rallies and to poll public opinion 
to operate independent radio and tv stations as well bush said 
it means the absence of intimidation either from a politicized 
sandinista military or police or from those neighborhood block 
committees that control peoples ration cards he said it 
means an end to the arrests and bullying of opposition leaders 
bush called on the soviet union to end its support of the 
leftist sandinista regime 
the soviet union must understand that we hold it accountable 
for the consequences of this intervention and for progress toward 
peace in the region and democracy in nicaragua the president 
said 
bush said that paraguay is on its way to joining the 
democratic mainstream following the presidential election monday 
of gen andres rodriguez 
we congratulate presidentelect rodriguez on his electoral 
victory and look forward to working with him bush said 
later white house spokesman b jay cooper later told reporters 
there were several instances of questionable but not illegal 
procedures in the paraguayan elections 
the small number of votes affected by these irregularities 
would not make a significant difference in the overall election 
results in which rodriguez got 70 percent of the vote cooper 
said

tragedy that presaged the founding of the jewish state

palestine alone in 1935 he helped found a resistance group known 
as the israel freedom fighters or the stern gang which staged 
raids against the british rulers in palestine 
he has seldom spoken about his personal loss although he 
frequently refers to the holocaust and compares israels current 
adversaries to the nazis 
earlier tuesday shamir condemned french president francois 
mitterrands meeting in paris with plo chairman yasser arafat 
israel considers the palestine liberation organization a terrorist 
group and refuses to deal with it 
this man says a lot of things to the jewish people shamir 
said of arafat on israel radio he is following the same 
tradition as the nazis

at the observance at the parliament dutchborn leah zonershein 
a survivor of the bergenbelsen death camp in germany recited the 
names of her deceased parents chaim and hannah then could not 
continue 
she said later she felt it was necessary to summon bitter 
memories to ensure the tragedy is not forgotten 
holocaust day became a routine thing here said mrs 
zonershein 62 the number 6 million says nothing to most 
people but name after name after name that gets the message 
across 
holocaust day is observed midway between the anniversary of the 
start of a 1943 jewish uprising against german troops in warsaw 
poland and israeli independence day which this year is may 10

drug pushers arent dealing across the street 
and gunshots no longer interrupt services at a small baptist church 
since the congregation bought a few abandoned buildings used as 
crack houses 
the 293 members of third shiloh baptist voted unanimously in 
february to put down 80000 for five houses with money they 
started saving 20 years ago for a new church 
we were afraid to come out said emma snowden a church 
board member and they werent ashamed the street had more 
traffic than canal street the citys main business thoroughfare 
the church and the houses are a block from the desire public 
housing project the citys largest and one of its most notorious 
for drug use and violence 
church complaints led to two busts in the last five months and 
the sound of gunfire sometimes punctuated services snowden said 
the congregation is now using federal money to renovate the 
dwellings so the church can rent them out and stabilize the 
neighborhood to keep dealers out 
a bank was asking 90000 for the properties but sold them for 
much less officials said benjamin edwards church board chairman 
said shiloh is negotiating to buy two other houses from another 
owner 
the maximum federal grant for fixing up a threebedroom house is 
8500 and the landlord must rent it for 10 years to a lowincome 
tenant said shelia danzey director of the city office of housing 
and urban affairs 
danzey said 1000 units have been renovated in the city under 
the program but third shilohs five are the first owned by a 
church or community group 
the tenants will pay about 125 a month for a threebedroom 
apartment and there is already a waiting list edwards said each 
house has two units 
some of the rent money will go to a scholarship fund and 15 
percent to 25 percent toward building the new church members were 
saving for he said

us coast guard commandant paul a yost 
today faulted exxons revised plan to clean up the nations largest 
oil spill but promised the effort will be completed this summer 
the plan is very thin theres not a lot of backup or 
substantiation said yost an admiral chosen by president bush to 
track the cleanup effort for the federal government 
we are going to be done this summer yost also said at a 
news briefing after arriving for a weeklong tour some beaches 
are going to be sparkling some beaches are going to be far from 
sparkling 
yosts comments followed the release monday of exxons revised 
strategy to clean up the oil spilled by the tanker exxon valdez 
exxon wants to burn or bury the sludge recovered and says 
environmental laws may have to be bypassed to allow the disposal 
the plan submitted only hours before a deadline requires yosts 
approval before it is put into effect he said he will make that 
decision within a week 
exxon faced protests today in at least three states consumer 
groups in alaska and new york state asked for boycotts of exxon 
products in oregon 20 state legislators joined in the call for a 
oneday boycott and demonstrations were planned at the port of 
portland where the crippled tanker is expected to be repaired 
exxons proposal immediately drew the scrutiny of alaskan 
environmental officials who contend that exxon failed to act 
quickly to clean up the more than 10 million gallons of oil spilled 
when the tanker hit a reef march 24 in prince william sound 
the plan estimates that poor weather and logistical problems 
will force a slowdown in the cleanup through september cutting by 
50 percent the number of days the crews can actually spend on the 
beaches and water 
exxons twopart strategy on cleanup and disposal makes no 
provisions for continuing the operation beyond midseptember 
its our objective and were convinced with the plan that 
we currently have that well get the major part of this spill 
cleaned up by the middle of september 1989 lawrence rawl chairman 
and chief executive officer of exxon said in an interview on cbs 
this morning 
the plan also notes that 191 miles of moderately fouled 
coastline may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally by the 
environment 
traces of the spill have been found 500 miles southwest of 
valdez along the alaska peninsula 
lightly oiled areas might not require cleaning the report 
said if environmental considerations indicate that allowing 
natural forces to operate produces a better result than the 
mechanical process 
we are going to have to take a hard look at that said bill 
lamoreaux the ranking state environmental official monitoring the 
cleanup 
pete wuerpel of the states division of emergency services said 
the plan did not help newly fouled communities like chignik 525 
miles southwest of valdez 
i think there is an element of arrogance i think there is an 
element of patronizing i think there is an element of 
unwillingness to redress the injury said wuerpel who is 
coordinating the efforts of the numerous state agencies involved in 
the cleanup 
exxons proposal a revised version of an earlier plan that 
government authorities rejected as incomplete divides 364 miles of 
alaskas oiltainted shores into four categories based on the 
amount of pollution 
it covers areas within prince william sound as well as those 
outside the immediate spill zone and calls for nearly 3400 
workers to participate in the cleanup the cost was not disclosed 
but exxon reportedly is paying cleanup workers 1667 an hour 
the worst areas three miles of sludgecovered beaches on 
several small islands in the sound would be targeted immediately 
with the others scheduled for gradual cleansing through sept 15 
the recovered waste would be strained for usable oil that can be 
refined and the oillaced wastewater could be treated at the 
alyeska pipeline service cos disposal plant in valdez 
the gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be 
burned or buried exxon proposed both methods likely will require 
exemptions from local environmental laws which exxon says may 
arouse opposition from environmentalists and others 
we are concerned about the approval process the study said 
adding that exxon would seek permission to have the laws bypassed 
temporarily 
im sure there is a portion of it which indicates that some of 
the material thats been picked up or described as sludge 
burning would be one way of disposing of that which might require 
as indicated some relaxation of some air quality rawl said on 
cbs

a spinytailed little creature with a big 
appetite a water flea that may have hitched a ride from europe 
aboard soviet freighters is threatening to disrupt the food chain 
in the great lakes a federal scientist said tuesday 
only a halfinch long the predator called bythotrephes is a 
variety of water flea with a long spiny tail said henry a 
vanderploeg a scientist with the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
what bythotrephes lacks in size it makes up for in appetite 
vanderploeg said his research showed one of the little creatures in 
a day can clear 1 quarts of water of the native water fleas that 
provide food for newborn fish 
for an animal this small it represents a high rate of 
clearance vanderploeg said at noaas great lakes environmental 
research laboratory in ann arbor mich 
the water fleas native to the great lakes provide food for 
juvenile alewives bloaters and perch which in turn are food for 
salmon trout and other large predatory fish 
because of bythotrephes in future years it is possible that 
for example alewives certain forage fish could be less abundant 
and since these forage fish would be less abundant salmon and 
trout could also become less abundant vanderploeg said 
however a more precise forecast of the effect of the european 
predator must await a better understanding of the great lakes food 
chain he said 
bythotrephes were first found in lake huron in 1984 and by 1986 
had spread to lake erie and lake ontario they are now found in all 
the great lakes 
the predators may have been brought from europe in water ballast 
aboard empty grain freighters from the soviet union and dumped into 
the lakes noaa said 
bythotrephes are found in freshwater throughout northern europe 
there however it is not disruptive to the food chain in the 
sense that it has been there for a long time vanderploeg said 
all the plankton and fish that have evolved there are used to 
having it around 
although the european predator can damage the great lakes food 
supply for very young fish at a certain stage in the life cycle 
of a fish bythotrephes would then become food for that fish 
vanderploeg said

denver residents will no longer have to carry 
around their marriage certificates and housing inspectors can stop 
counting toothbrushes 
denver has abolished its living in sin law 
the ordinance dating from the 1960s when residents feared 
hippie invasions and communal living would ruin their 
neighborhoods was repealed by the city council 76 monday night 
after spirited debate 
zoning laws are here to regulate density not relationships 
said councilwoman debbie ortega who voted for the change 
under the law boarders and unrelated people were not allowed to 
live in the same house in areas zoned r0 in areas zoned r1 a 
homeowner was required to obtain a 20 boarders permit to cover a 
nonrelative 
the two classifications covered about 60 percent of the city 
which has a population of more than 500000 
although residents frequently ignored the law officials 
enforced it when a complaint was filed fines were 999 a day in 
many cases if a homeowner was caught violating the law he or she 
had to sell the house sometimes at a loss to avoid paying the 
fine 
councilwoman cathy donohue said the law forced people to carry 
their marriage certificates around with them and that zoning 
inspectors complained about having to count toothbrushes in homes 
the onevote margin reflected strong support for keeping the 
measure on the books 
the family is the fundamental structure that preserves our 
society said councilman bill roberts 
the vote is a step toward destroying our city said 
councilman ted hackworth councilman bob crider called passage a 
sad day in the city of denver 
eight years ago when there was an attempt to change the law 
many churches had opposed the action this time however most of 
the opposition came from families and a real estate agent who sold 
houses based on the zoning restrictions 
the agent tells buyers that no one can move in next to them 
that isnt married this appeals particularly to families 
donohue said 
three nuns who lived together were among those who had been 
targeted as violators before the law was rescinded 
they wanted all but one of us to move out said one of the 
nuns who asked that her name not be used to me its wasteful 
to have just one person living in a dwelling with four bedrooms 
its very sinful 
the mexican consul students sharing expenses and unmarried 
couples also were affected by the law

a committee appointed by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to work out details of his palestinian elections proposal is 
discussing ways to involve the united states in observing the 
balloting a spokesman said tuesday 
us involvement which could answer one palestinian objection 
to shamirs plan was among various tactics being studied on how to 
conduct the proposed vote in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip said shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir 
in the occupied territories tuesday 12 arabs were wounded in 
clashes with troops according to arab reporters and hospital 
officials 
one of the reported victims was a 7yearold girl shot in the 
head in a clash in the gaza strips shati refugee camp 
the worst confrontation was in the crowded market in the west 
bank city of nablus where soldiers opened fire on dozens of 
stonethrowing protesters the reporters said six people suffered 
gunshot wounds hospital officials said 
about 3000 police were deployed around jerusalems old city for 
leilat el kadr the moslem night of prayers marking the prophet 
mohammeds receiving the holy koran 
soldiers were reported to be stopping young palestinians in the 
occupied territories from entering jerusalem to prevent a 
repetition of rioting that occurred on the first day of the moslem 
holy month of ramadan 
the main prayer takes place at the al aqsa mosque compound one 
of islams holiest sites and the location of the rioting israel 
radio said 10000 worshipers were expected at al aqsa compared 
with up to 50000 in previous years 
israelis also marked a national holiday tuesday to mourn the 
jewish victims of the nazi holocaust and shamir compared plo 
leader yasser arafat to the nazis as he protested french president 
francois mitterrands meeting with arafat in paris 
shamir said on israeli radio that jews everywhere should beware 
of arafat 
this man says a lot of things to the jewish people he is 
following the same tradition as the nazis he said 
the polishborn prime minister later read the names of his own 
family members killed by the nazis hundreds of other israelis 
recited the names of other victims in memorial events throughout 
the country 
arafats visit sparked several protest demonstrations outside 
the french consulate in jerusalem 
the largest group 50 members of the temple mount faithful 
carried the french tricolor flag marked with a black stain 
the groups leader gershon salomon said mitterrands meeting 
with arafat soiled frances honor and urged france to extradict 
arafat as a murderer the group advocates rebuilding the jewish 
temple on the site now covered by the dome of the rock and al aqsa 
mosques 
ahimeir said tuesday the premier has appointed a team to work 
out a blueprint for elections in the occupied territories despite 
palestinian demands that israel withdraw its troops before any vote 
shamirs plan calls for elections to chose palestinians from the 
territories to negotiate with israel on a fiveyear period of 
autonomy to be followed by talks on the final status of the lands 
occupied since the 1967 middle east war 
the palestine liberation organization and palestinians in the 
territories have rejected the idea of limited autonomy under 
continued israeli control since it was first suggested more than 10 
years ago 
shamir made his plan public last month in washington after 
international pressure built on israel to find a way to end the 
16month palestinian uprising which has taken the lives of 458 
palestinians and 18 israelis 
ahimeir said one idea considered for the balloting was some form 
of active us participation in overseeing the elections which 
would answer palestinian and arab demands for international 
supervision of the vote 
i think that us participation and help can be considered 
ahimeir said we are always ready to be assisted by the united 
states which is genuinely interested in achieving peace and 
enjoys the trust of both sides 
israeli news reports said the blueprint might be presented to 
us officials by defense minister yitzhak rabin who is due to 
visit washington in three weeks a rabin spokesman declined comment 
rabin told representatives of israels collective farms in tel 
aviv that israel should not rush into elections out of the 
blue but should agree on an entire process for the vote 
facing complaints about stonethrowing attacks on the cars of 
jewish settlers in the occupied territories rabin suggested israel 
consider subsidizing protective windows in the vehicles of the more 
than 70000 settlers 
it would cost 67 million to 83 million and we will 
suggest this to the residents of the territories and we should 
offer to subsidize it if necessary he said

the state department on tuesday stepped up its 
campaign against the khmer rouge rebels by saying that close ties 
with a future cambodian government would not be possible if it is 
heavily influenced by that marxist group 
the statement by spokeswoman margaret tutwiler came amid an 
intensification of efforts by the vietnamesebacked government in 
cambodia and noncommunist rebel forces to reach an accommodation 
on the shape of a future government 
with vietnam planning to withdraw the remainder of its forces 
from cambodia by this september the united states has become 
increasingly concerned about the possibility that the khmer rouge 
could regain power there 
the khmer rouge the most militarily powerful of the three 
resistance forces are estimated to have killed more than one 
million cambodians during their 3 years in power in the late 1970s 
the united states is totally opposed to a return to dominance 
in cambodia by the khmer rouge ms tutwiler said 
we believe that the best means to achieve this goal would be 
acceptance by all parties of a comprehensive settlement agreement 
under which the cambodian people were able to determine their own 
future through a process of free choice 
she reaffirmed the us view that an interim coalition 
government should be formed to organize elections and that prince 
sihanouk the former head of state is a logical leader of such an 
arrangement 
she said that whether the khmer rouge minus discredited leaders 
such as pol pot are permitted to participate in such an interim 
government is one thing the cambodian factions themselves will have 
to decide 
but she said that american ability to work with any future 
cambodian government would be related to the level of khmer rouge 
participation in that government 
ms tutwiler said it is imperative to have a settlement that 
includes effective safeguards to keep the khmer rouge from 
dominating cambodia once more 
we are convinced that in free and fair elections the 
cambodian people would reject the khmer rouge she said 
as part of steppedup us diplomacy in the region vice 
president dan quayle met on monday with sihanouk during a visit to 
indonesia 
sihanouk said later after a meeting with indonesian president 
suharto said he was optimistic a settlement was within reach 
the noncommunist resistance is eager to reach a political 
settlement with the vietnamesebacked government before the 
withdrawal of the vietnamese forces without an agreement there is 
concern that khmer rouge will regain power in phnom penh because of 
their superior military capability 
the bush administration has reflected its concern by considering 
for the first time the provision of military aid to the two 
noncommunist factions

pope john paul ii condemned south africas 
system of apartheid on tuesday and urged zambia to keep trying to 
resolve its neighbors racial turmoil 
church choirs tribal drummers and a military honor guard 
welcomed the pontiff here the third stop of a nineday pilgrimage 
to four african and indian ocean nations 
john paul was flown from the island of reunion in an air france 
concorde the first time a pontiff has traveled in the supersonic 
passenger plane 
president kenneth kaunda one of africas elder statesmen bowed 
and shook hands with john paul after the pontiff customarily knelt 
on the tarmac and kissed the ground 
the pope was expected to discuss south africas racial policies 
during his threeday visit to zambia and to speak out about the 
rapid spread of aids in this largely christian southern african 
country 
thousands of zambians including women who wore sarilike 
cloths emblazoned with john pauls portrait gathered to hear the 
pope commend their government for fostering constructive 
dialogue with pretoria 
he also mounted a harsh attack on apartheid 
your continuing efforts to promote constructive dialogue by 
the parties involved must be your response to the unacceptable 
system of apartheid john paul said racism stands condemned 
but it is not enough to condemn he said 
south africa where the white minority wields political and 
economic power over 24 million voteless blacks is high on the 
agenda of talks between the pope and kaunda officials said 
kaunda 65 is head of the frontline states regional group 
spearheading african efforts to end apartheid the other members 
are angola botswana mozambique tanzania and zimbabwe 
kaunda told john paul that black nations neighboring south 
africa were confronted by the affliction of apartheid an 
allround human degradation declared by the international community 
as a sin against humanity itself 
the frontline states were unhappy during the pontiffs last 
africa travels in october when his plane was diverted by bad 
weather to johannesburg 
foreign minister pw botha welcomed the pope despite vatican 
statements that the pope would not visit south africa while 
apartheid remains entrenched 
kaunda a former church of scotland mission teacher who led the 
former british colony of northern rhodesia to independence as 
zambia on oct 24 1964 is a lay preacher for the 
methodistrelated united church of zambia 
he outlawed political opposition by declaring zambia a oneparty 
state in 1972 and since has survived several coup attempts 
zambia is heavily in debt to foreign lenders unemployment and 
inflation are at record levels urban crime is rampant shortages 
of basic commodities are commonplace and the incidence of aids has 
been rising rapidly 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome has killed 900 zambians in 
the last four years including one of kaundas sons masuzgo kaunda 
died at age 30 in december 1986 
there are about 17 million catholics among zambias 7 million 
people 
the pontiff leaves zambia on thursday for neighboring malawi 
while on the indian ocean island of reunion earlier tuesday the 
pope beatified a 19th century french missionary considered the 
apostle of the islands slaves 
the beatification represented a first step towards possible 
sainthood for jeanbernard rousseau known as brother scubilion 
who died in 1867 rousseau spent 34 years on the island teaching 
catechism to the african slaves brought to the island by the french 
colonists

the head of the state office for church 
affairs who was associated with strong government control over 
church life has been forced to retire an austrian roman catholic 
newsletter said tuesday 
the retirement of state secretary imre miklos as president of 
the office as of monday was confirmed by the hungarian news agency 
mti which said miklos duties were taken over by deputy president 
barna sarkadi nagy no new president was appointed 
mikloss retirement came after what mti described as crucial 
changes in hungarian church policy 
it said the essence of the change is that state control is to be 
withdrawn from all fields of church a life so as to finalize the 
separation of the state and churches 
mti said the change in church policy serves the purpose of 
expanding the cooperation between the state and churches in the 
social political cultural and educational spheres 
the official report made clear the existing church affairs 
office would be completely overhauled and given a new name in the 
spirit of hungarys political and social reforms 
there is a need for open political activity in order to create 
a forum for coordination of interests that would attract 
church state and party officials as well as independent and 
prestigious politicians mti said

the navy has found the mechanical problem that 
caused a trident 2 missile to explode last march but corrective 
design changes will contribute to a threemonth delay in 
deployment a military official said tuesday 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said a navy board of 
inquiry had blamed the failure on a mechanical linkage in the 
firststage nozzle 
we now expect the first operational missiles to be at sea on 
the submarine uss tennessee in march of 1990 he said 
the mechanical linkage is responsible for moving the rocket 
nozzles back and forth during the early seconds after a launch the 
pentagon previously had disclosed preliminary findings made final 
by the navy board 
they the navy have decided that they have to do some 
redesign and modification of the mechanical linkage that transmits 
the nozzle position commands to the nozzle exit cone at the base of 
the missile howard said 
incorporating these changes will allow us to conduct the next 
test in july 
howard declined to estimate the cost of the design changes but 
described them as fairly simple the navy said the missiles 
builder the lockheed corp would have to bear the cost 
the navys investigation began march 21 shortly after a trident 
2 missile fired from the tennessee blew up just four seconds after 
launch the missile popped to the surface as planned and the first 
stage ignited properly but then the missile began spinning like a 
burning pinwheel and exploded 
it was the first submarine launch of the navys newest and most 
powerful nuclear weapon 
howard said tuesday the delay in deployment was based on two 
other factors in addition to the design change 
first there has been a cessation of all propellant casting 
including the trident secondstage motors due to the explosion 
at the hercules plant in magna utah on march 29 he explained 
second theres an ongoing strike at the kaiser aerotech 
plant in san leandro calif which has resulted in stoppage of 
delivery of nozzles for both the second and third stage of the 
trident rocket motors we anticipate that the delivery of those 
will resume by june 
on capitol hill rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee praised the navy for its willingness to 
delay the tridents deployment singling out program manager rear 
adm kenneth malley 
i hope everyone will heap praise on the program manager for 
striving to make his missile work rather than damning him for 
failing to meet an arbitrary deadline the great crime of the b1 
bomber aspin said 
the threestage trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon 
that is the heart of americas naval nuclear deterrent the trident 
1 the new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to 
individual targets up to 6000 miles away 
the navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its 
undersea predecessors polaris poseidon and trident 1 and can 
match the targeting ability of landbased missiles even though it

christian leader gen michel aoun said 
tuesday he may compromise with moslem militiamen to end the 
fighting in beirut but will pursue diplomatic channels to oust 
syrian troops from lebanon 
the commander of lebanons mainly christian army said he will 
consider lifting a blockade of three illegal ports run by 
syrianbacked moslem militias to end eight weeks of fierce fighting 
that has killed 278 people 
as he made the offer at a news conference shelling duels 
continued between christian gunners and an alliance of druse 
militiamen and syrian troops who have ignored fridays ceasefire 
call by the arab league 
police said two people were killed and eight wounded tuesday 
bringing the toll of wounded to 1010 since the current fighting 
erupted march 8 
asked about the blockade aoun said it could be suspended 
the ports issue is no longer the basic issue syrian military 
presence in lebanon is the issue he said 
aoun had declared a war of liberation against 40000 syrian 
troops deployed across 70 percent of lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate 
but he added the hot phase in the war of liberation is over 
we are prepared to pursue liberation through diplomatic means 
he said he was waiting to discuss the ports blockade wednesday 
with arab league envoys due to arrive from syria 
league official lakhdar ibrahimi of algeria and ahmed abdelaziz 
jassem kuwaits ambassador to syria will try to salvage the 
ceasefire and finalize deployment of a multinational arab observer 
force 
on tuesday aoun called the arab plans a breakthrough 
the observers will be watching the syrians here and our 
problem will be discussed by the forthcoming arab summit 
conference this month aoun said 
he and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of breaking 
their peacekeeping mandate by siding with the moslems against the 
christians 
in damascus syria diplomatic sources said the syrian 
government told the arab league representatives that fighting would 
persist until aoun lifted the blockades 
ibrahimi was to meet wednesday with acting premier salim hoss 
head of the moslem cabinet in lebanons dual government 
an aide to hoss said they will discuss a compromise calling for 
the deployment of arab observers at militiarun ports to 
guarantee that they are not used for illegal activities 
the aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was 
ibrahimis responsibility to convince druse warlord walid jumblatt 
and shiite moslem leader nabih berri to accept the proposed 
solution 
syrian gunners maintained a sporadic bombardment of lebanons 
310squaremile christian enclave throughout tuesday each side 
accused the other of starting the barrage 
a police spokesman said syrian gunners targeted the coastal 
strip north of beirut and prevented the french tanker penhors from 
approaching a power station to unload fuel oil 
a main power cable was damaged in the barrage stripping the 
capital of its daily twohour ration of electricity said the 
spokesman who customarily is not named 
most civilians deserted their apartments and sought refuge in 
underground shelters as they have most of the time since the 
fighting began 
a un report published tuesday said the battles have caused 
250 million in damage destroyed twothirds of lebanons fuel 
storage facilities hit 150 factories and 3000 residential blocks 
and paralyzed industry 
the genevabased office of the un disaster relief coordinator 
said the priority is setting up an emergency food reserve for 
50000 families and supplying drugs for the chronically sick 
it said twothirds of lebanons population is affected by the 
strife which has caused more than 100000 people to flee abroad 
and 500000 to escape beirut for safer parts of the country

soldiers at sri lankas largest army 
garrison tuesday repelled an attack by sinhalese militants who may 
have been searching for weapons and killed at least three raiders 
a military official said 
five soldiers were injured in the raid which came during a 
heavy downpour said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
at least 100 militants attacked the panagoda army garrison 12 
miles southeast of colombo with grenades and automatic weapons he 
said the garrison usually holds between 10000 and 15000 soldiers 
it was the biggest raid on an army post by militants since they 
launched a bloody campaign to protest government peace overtures to 
tamil rebels who are fighting for a separate homeland the 
official said 
the sinhalese militants who belong to the leftwing peoples 
liberation front said a 1987 indiabacked peace accord giving the 
tamil minority limited autonomy made too many concessions they 
began killing government officials and ruling party members 
india sponsored the accord sending troops to northern and 
eastern sri lanka because of the sympathies of its own 60 million 
tamils to the rebel cause 
indian foreign secretary shailendra kumar singh met tuesday with 
president ranasinghe premadasa to discuss the withdrawal of indian 
peacekeeping troops 
sri lankan officials were to meet wednesday with tamil rebel 
leaders for talks on ending their 6yearold separatist war

sinhalese militants have been blamed for more than 3000 killings 
since january 
the militants have attacked army camps and police stations to 
get weapons the military official said the attackers of the 
panagoda garrison penetrated the camps perimeter and came within 
yards of its armory before being beaten back 
army soldiers searched rice paddies and jungles near the camp 
for the militants he said 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists form 75 percent of sri 
lankas 18 million people they control the government and the 
military 
tamils predominantly hindus make up 18 percent of the 
population and allege discrimination in jobs and education by the 
sinhalese

defense secretary dick cheney was just 
speaking his mind and not representing the bush administration when 
he forecast failure for kremlin chief mikhail s gorbachev 
administration officials said tuesday 
there is widespread hope inside the government that the united 
states can seize on soviet arms control concessions according to 
official spokesmen 
cheney has been defense secretary for just over one month and 
his prediction in a televised weekend interview that gorbachev 
would fail and be replaced by a hardliner caused a stir in official 
washington 
president bush secretary of state james a baker iii and white 
house chief of staff john sununu quickly stepped forward with more 
optimistic assessments although they did not publicly rebuke 
cheney 
despite the official optimism there was cause to worry about 
the future of gorbachevs reform officials said cheneys 
pessimistic predictions came just a day after the soviet communist 
party newspaper pravda in an unprecedented development published 
five pages of speeches by party officials saying gorbachevs 
reforms had damaged the economy and were undercutting the kremlins 
authority 
and the central intelligence agency declassified a report on 
april 23 saying gorbachev had been forced to alter or postpone many 
planned reforms including a key one decontrolling prices 
a significant segment of the us intelligence community 
believes that gorbachev faces limited chances of success although 
many government analysts think the united states ought to take 
advantage of his arms control concessions according to 
administration and congressional sources 
cheney predicted in a weekend interview that gorbachev would 
fail in his effort to reform the soviet union and likely would be 
replaced by a hardliner therefore he said the united states 
should not take any unilateral steps such as removing any of the 
324000 us troops stationed in western europe 
a pentagon official speaking anonymously denied that cheney 
was trying to offset west german pressure on the united states to 
negotiate with moscow to eliminate shortrange nuclear missiles 
he was not trying to be machiavellian said the pentagon 
official he was just saying what he believes in his mind he is 
still on capitol hill where cheney served congressman from 
wyoming for 12 years and was no 2 in the republican leadership 
bush speaking monday in new york said the united states 
wanted to see perestroika reform succeed in the soviet union 
and likewise we want to see success for the economic reforms in 
china 
success for gorbachev would give the bush administration a 
chance to capitalize on the kremlin leaders sweeping offers to cut 
soviet conventional forces in europe and overall strategic arsenal 
by half 
baker reaffirmed us hopes for gorbachev by reissuing the text 
of a speech he gave last month 
we very much want perestroika to succeed and we very much 
want the general secretary gorbachev to succeed we think thats 
in the best interest of the united states and the best interest of 
the world because it will result in a more open stable and secure 
soviet union said bakers statement 
cheney sparked the controversy by saying in an interview 
broadcast last saturday that if i had to guess today i would 
guess ultimately he would fail and would be replaced by a leader 
far more hostile to the west 
cheney said much the same thing last tuesday telling congress 
he had become convinced gorbachevs reforms were sincere because it 
was clear that the soviet system has been a failure 
i think its going to be extremely difficult for him to 
succeed and i think there is a very real likelihood that hell 
either have to reverse course or that or one reason or another 
ultimately have to resort to force perhaps in eastern europe 
perhaps in terms of dealing with the ethnic unrest inside the 
soviet union cheney told the house armed services committee 
cheneys remarks mirrored an assessment voiced last october by 
robert gates then the no 2 official at cia and now the deputy 
white house national security adviser gates comment sparked a 
similar controversy because thenpresident reagan and george 
shultz who at the time was secretary of state publicly had placed 
great faith in gorbachev

a man who was arrested after being 
videotaped flinging cash to children through the sunroof of his 
fancy car has been sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined 2 
million for dealing cocaine 
kevin allen walker 28 had pleaded in march guilty to 
possession with intent to distribute more than two pounds of 
cocaine 
on occasion he made wellpublicized drives through the area in 
a flashy expensive car passing out currency to the children thus 
brandishing to the citizenry and especially to the pliable young 
that drug dealing was a profitable activity to be emulated us 
district judge edward j devitt said monday 
police found cocaine in a van walker was driving and in his 
mercedesbenz they also found more than 57000 in cash and three 
semiautomatic weapons 
walkers arrest in november was precipitated in part by 
community outrage over accusations he sent children into frenzies 
by throwing bills as large as 50 from his car 
a neighborhood activist capture the act on home video and turned 
the tape over to police and tv stations 
defense attorney earl gray said the controversy prompted police 
to investigate walker who had a long record but never had been 
prosecuted for a drug offense 
the judge said walkers defiant display of wealth justified the 
maximum sentence 
gray appealed the sentence with time off for good behavior 
walker could be released in 13 years

tuesday about the rising tide of violence in the west bank and 
gaza strip as it offered its first public comment about recent 
assassinations of arabs accused of collaborating with israeli 
occupation troops 
the killings of palestinians by other palestinians occurring 
amid the backdrop of the uprising in the occupied territories have 
increased after a palestinian underground group issued a call for 
steppedup action against collaborators 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the killings 
on either side frustrate the search for peace 
the palestinians attacked as collaborators were accused of 
working with the israeli army the occupation administration or the 
israeli intelligence service 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens has accused the palestine 
liberation organization of conducting a wave of terror to 
undermine israels proposal for elections in the occupied 
territories 
israel plans to hold elections among the 14 million 
palestinians on the west bank and gaza to choose leaders to 
negotiate an interim selfrule arrangement prime minister yitzhak 
shamir has barred negotiating with the plo which last year 
declared a palestinian state 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii have 
endorsed the proposal as a step toward an overall settlement of the 
arabisraeli conflict

we are alarmed by the rising tide of violence and are shocked 
by the increasing human toll in the west bank and gaza 
the spokeswoman pointed out that during the past two weeks 20 
palestinians have been killed and about 200 others wounded in 
clashes with the israeli defense forces 
fourteen palestinians have been killed by other palestinians 
during the same period these actions by both sides frustrate the 
search for peace ms tutwiler added 
she said the united states urges all sides to exercise 
restraint and replace violence with a climate conducive to 
political dialogue 
asked if the killings could make it more difficult for israel to 
conduct the elections ms tutwiler said any type of violence 
was not conductive to moving the peace process forward 
some 458 palestinians and 18 israelis have died since the 
uprising began in december 1987

solidarity leader lech walesa will visit the 
united states for the first time in november to address an aflcio 
convention federation leaders said tuesday 
walesa has been denied permission in the past to visit the 
united states but an adviser in washington to attend the spring 
meeting of the aflcios governing body said walesa would be 
allowed to travel to the convention 
aflcio president lane kirkland whose efforts to visit walesa 
in poland have also been stymied by warsaw has accepted a 
reciprocal invitation to visit poland next year a kirkland 
spokesman said 
kirkland said that with the polish governments recent 
recognition of solidarity and announced plans for democratic 
election reforms the aflcio will support bush administration 
plans to give new economic aid to poland 
the federations support he said was dependent on continued 
progress in the area of human rights 
still while calling the apparent approval of walesas us 
visit a welcome step kirkland could not disguise his contempt for 
the polish government which had outlawed solidarity since its 
inception in the early 1980s 
i dont give a damn about the backing of the polish 
government kirkland said when asked whether walesa would be 
addressing the convention as a representative of warsaw he is 
not an emissary of his government im not interested in dealing 
with emissaries of his government he all his life has been a 
fighter for free and independent trade unionism and thats what he 
represents and what he stands for in the world today 
jacek kuron a walesa adviser and candidate for parliament in 
the june 6 polish elections met with the aflcio executive council 
tuesday afternoon to discuss the walesa visit and ways us unions 
could assist solidarity 
aflcio spokesman rex hardesty said that support in the past has 
been limited because solidarity was banned but has included basic 
printing and office supplies 
now hardesty said the federation and a number of its member 
unions were interested in providing solidarity with additional 
financial support and equipment as it works to recruit members and 
support candidates in elections

the bush administration asked congress on 
tuesday for authority to give away weapons to help western 
hemisphere armies fight drug traffickers 
lt gen charles w brown head of the defense security 
assistance agency said weapons furnished without charge would be 
excess defense articles he told the senate foreign relations 
committee that they would be given to military forces in latin 
america and the caribbean 
he said the administration is asking 21 million for the purpose 
in the year that begins oct 1 beyond the present spending level 
the biggest increase in this group is for colombia where the 
activities of drug barons and insurgent groups sometimes working 
together threaten the very survival of the legal system and 
democratic government he said 
he added that the next largest increase would go to peru because 
it is in a similar situation and there would also be increases for 
bolivia and the eastern caribbean drug traffickers often use 
caribbean islands as relay points for drugs from south america 
his prepared testimony did not mention mexico another major 
source of narcotics nor did it list the arms to be given under the 
new program 
the intention would be to make equipment available at the 
lowtech end of the spectrum that is basic military equipment 
suitable for use in lowintensity conflict against drug 
traffickers he said 
brown said that us efforts at cooperation had been mostly with 
local police with occasional use of us military transport 
we believe that local military forces are ready to and must 
take a larger role in these efforts he added 
they are the only forces large enough to do it they have the 
infrastructure they can act as a disciplined and trained force 
and it is far better that they take this role rather than us 
combat forces 
at home the pentagon has resisted any move to have its forces 
take part in drug arrests or investigations though it cooperates 
in the battle against narcotics by lending its equipment to law 
enforcement agencies 
brown said that in latin america the armed forces need us 
money for equipment training and support if they are to do more 
against drugs 
this is not to say that the military can supplant the local 
police forces but they have a role to play he added 
he noted that the colombian and peruvian forces are also 
fighting insurgents who have roots and objectives independent of 
drug dealers though he said there are tactical alliances between 
them

the environmental protection agency proposed 
on tuesday to limit the maximum amounts of 38 types of 
cancercausing chemicals and other pollutants found in drinking 
water a move that will cause increases in household water bills 
but the epa said it cant meet a congressional deadline on two 
dozen other water pollutants because it is short of money and staff 
the 38 chemicals including many widely used pesticides and 
other highly toxic carcinogens must be monitored and kept below 
the required levels in all public drinking water under the epa 
regulations issued tuesday the rules will be made final after a 
period for public comment 
michael cook director of the epa office which deals with 
drinking water contaminants said most public water systems already 
meet the proposed requirements but additional purification 
equipment will probably be needed in about 2500 public systems 
most of them in rural areas 
in some cases a household water bill could go up as much as 
460 a year although the increase will generally be much lower 
cook said the additional costs will chiefly be because of 
equipment 
the epa estimated that the cost of public water in areas where 
additional pollution controls are required could increase from 10 
to 460 a year depending on the size of the water system and the 
contaminant and treatment technology involved 
the water systems likely to be in violation of the federal 
standard will account for roughly 3 percent of all the water 
systems in the country and provide water for 2 million people said 
cook 
private wells are not covered by the regulations 
cook said that when the regulations covering 17 pesticides and 
21 other pollutants take effect the epa will have established 
maximum allowable levels for 55 of 83 dangerous drinking water 
contaminants singled out for action by congress nearly three years 
ago 
many of those federal standards probably will not go into effect 
for another year or more however 
three years ago congress told the epa to establish federal 
standards on all 83 pollutants by june 1 of this year but cook 
said the agency wont be able to meet the deadline on the 28 
remaining chemicals he said the process is expected to take 
another year as maximum safe levels and water treatment techniques 
for each of the remaining contaminants are worked out 
if we had more money and manpower we could have sped those 
calculations up said cook blaming agency budget constraints 
and staff shortages for not being able to meet the deadline 
the proposed standards cover 17 pesticides including alachlor 
aldicarb and atrazine which are widely used in agriculture 11 
synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to cause cancer or 
damage to the nervous system and eight inorganic chemicals 
including asbestos mercury cadmium nitrates and nitrites and 
two chemicals used to treat drinking water 
the regulations also will require local water officials to 
monitor the chemical levels in their water supply at times as 
frequently as every three months and to make public those 
occasions when the federal standards are exceeded 
while most of the nations water supply is already thought to be 
in compliance with the federal standards cook said about 2500 
small mostly rural water systems likely will violate the 
regulations unless they install additional equipment 
officials operating about 80000 water systems likely will have 
to increase monitoring activities to comply with the federal rules 
the requirements are important steps in the continuing effort 
to assure that americans have the safest drinking water in the 
world said cook 
but some epa critics maintained that the regulations while slow 
in coming are also too weak 
jacqueline warren an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the maximum levels required by the epa is 
significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of 
states 
furthermore she said the epa is lifting some water pollutant 
standards including the ones for aluminum and silver both pose 
health risks she said

a team of navy specialists has concluded that 
the gun turret aboard the battleship iowa damaged in last months 
deadly explosion can be repaired but no decision has been made to 
do so the pentagon said tuesday 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman said a 
35member navy damage control team began its work aboard the 
battleship last week by determining that the materials and 
expertise are available to repair the turret 
the answer to that basic question had not been clear in the 
immediate aftermath of the april 19 tragedy because of the vessels 
age the iowa was commissioned in 1943 during world war ii and no 
vessel of its type has been built since that war 
fortyseven sailors died in the explosion inside the no 2 gun 
turret while they were loading a 16inch gun with powder 
the fact that repairs are technically feasible however does 
not mean the navy has decided to make repairs howard said no cost 
estimate has been developed yet nor is any estimate available on 
how long such repairs might take he said 
the iowas skipper capt fred p moosally has said the vessel 
would be ready for battle even if the damaged turret was never 
repaired the huge battleship still has two other turrets each 
with three 16inch guns 
preliminary examination indicates that it can be repaired 
howard said tuesday but there are a lot of factors that go into 
a final decision 
its too early yet to give you either a cost estimate or the 
amount of time it would take to make repairs all i can give you is 
the preliminary judgment that they can repair it 
the spokesman said one of the first indications repairs might be 
feasible came recently when the huge guns above the damaged turret 
were swung back on centerline using their own internal machinery 
in related developments howard said the battleship had been 
moved to a new anchorage near norfolk va to unload the gunpowder 
and shells from the damaged turret 
you may recall that as part of the safety procedures they 
flooded the magazine on the ship immediately following the 
explosion now they have to take out the powder and projectiles to 
examine them and see if they were damaged by the water 
the spokesman also said he had investigated but could not 
confirm a published report that one of the iowas victims issued a 
terse verbal warning that there was a problem just before the 
blast 
the washington post said tuesday a crew member reportedly made 
the comment over a soundactivated phone circuit just before the 
explosion saying uh oh weve got a problem here 
i cant get any corroboration for that story howard said 
i just dont know

the government tuesday broadened a 
probe into the deaths of aborigines in police custody to discover 
why proportionately more of the native people than other 
australians end up in jail 
the royal commission of inquiry said it was concerned by 
government statistics that show aborigines about 1 percent of the 
16 million population are six times more likely to go to jail than 
white australians 
while investigation of aboriginal deaths in custody is 
important so too is learning the lessons of the past and acting to 
prevent further deaths said elliott johnston who is heading the 
inquiry 
johnston a lawyer this week replaced judge james muirhead on 
the commission which was established by prime minister bob hawke 
in mid1987 
muirhead in an interim report issued in december urged states 
to abolish drunkenness as a criminal offense indicating this was 
perhaps a chief reason aborigines were arrested in february the 
government pledged the equivalent of 8 million to set up 
dryingout facilities as an alternative to jail for people arrested 
on drinking charges 
the commission is investigating the deaths while in police 
custody of 104 aborigines between 1980 and may 31 1987 some 
activists blame police brutality and others have said the jailing 
causes despair which often leads to suicide johnston said 
conclusions will be reached by years end he said 
in adelaide a spokeswoman for the south australian aboriginal

senate democrats launched a campaign tuesday 
to wean american farmers from dependence on pesticides and 
fertilizers arguing that new practices are needed to protect food 
and water from chemical contamination 
the centerpiece of their effort is legislation sponsored by sen 
wyche fowler dga and endorsed at a news conference by senate 
majority leader george mitchell of maine sen patrick leahy 
dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee and 23 farm 
and environmental groups 
fowler chairman of the agriculture subcommittee on conservation 
and forestry said the goal is to provide through the 1990 farm 
bill programs to give incentives to farmers who voluntarily reduce 
reliance on chemicals 
there have been methods time proven for 3000 years where a 
proper combination of conservation practices stewardship 
practices crop rotation practices along with an appropriate use 
of chemicals and fertilizers have proven effective he said 
the legislation would require that the department of agriculture 
inform farmers about advances in lowinput farming integrated pest 
management and any other practice reducing reliance on chemicals 
without sacrificing production 
it also would remove existing disincentives in federal farm 
programs that prevent farmers from taking advantage of new 
lowinput farming methods and it would provide incentives to 
encourage farmers to make the transition from an overreliance on 
chemicals to lowinput methods 
for too long industry and agriculture policies have promoted 
practices that degrade our natural and agricultural resources and 
pose threats to the health of our people fowler said we have 
already waited longer than we should to reverse this trend and 
restore american agriculture to a safe sound course for the 
future 
both fowler and mitchell said they expect farmers eventually 
will support the legislation even though the transition might 
initially reduce crop yields and profits 
farm families will benefit from this bill mitchell said 
by helping to reduce pesticide use this legislation will help 
protect the quality of drinking water in rural areas 
the bill would create a drinking water welltesting program to 
detect contamination by pesticides or nitrates in areas where 
testing finds contamination federal aid would be provided to help 
farmers establish groundwater protection plans 
mitchell said encouraging farmers to reduce use of pesticides 
and fertilizers also will help protect the nations food supply 
while the vast majority of our food products are free of 
pesticide contamination we must do everything we can to expand and 
improve our food quality programs he said this bill will take 
us in that direction

corrosion of the nuclear reactor aboard a 
soviet submarine that sank off norway april 7 may eventually lead 
to the release of huge amounts of radioactivity the environmental 
group greenpeace said tuesday 
the group said a study done for it by john large and associates 
a nuclear engineering consulting firm in london concluded that the 
submarine may release up to 20 million curies of radioactivity if 
the vessel is not recovered 
that is equal to about onethird of the radiation released by 
the april 1986 explosion at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in 
the soviet ukraine greenpeace said thirtyone people died in the 
chernobyl accident 
the soviet submarine caught fire and sank in 5000 feet of water 
off northern norway soviet officials said 42 of the 69 sailors on 
board were killed 
moscow said earlier this month that a decision on whether to 
attempt to raise the sub will not be made for several months it 
said the vessels two nuclear reactors were shut down before the 
crew evacuated and that there was no danger of radiation leaks but 
greenpeace took issue with that assertion 
even if the reactor containment structures werent damaged by 
the fire the collision with the ocean floor or the deep water 
pressure the protective structure will erode before the reactors 
are safe said steve shallhorn a greenpeace representative

prime minister brian mulroneys trip to the 
united states this week puts the spotlight back on the canadaus 
free trade agreement while his government faces heated debate over 
efforts to cut the budget deficit 
he receives an award wednesday in boston from the private world 
affairs council in large part for his role in leading canada to 
sign the sweeping trade agreement that eases investment barriers 
and phases out all remaining tariffs between canada and the united 
states over the next decade 
on thursday he visits the white house where he will meet with 
president bush for the second time this year the talks are 
expected to concentrate on the trade pact and acid rain always a 
major topic in canadianus relations 
mulroney led his progressive conservative party to a second 
consecutive majority government last fall in a campaign dominated 
by the issue of whether to proceed with the trade agreement he 
signed in january 1988 with president ronald reagan 
with mulroneys victory clinching the way for the pact to take 
effect as scheduled jan 1 the attention of the prime minister and 
other senior officials turned to the budget deficit which is 
higher per capita in canada than in the united states 
his opponents who charged that free trade would force canada to 
cut its traditional network of social protection for its 
population now say the election did not give mulroney a mandate to 
tackle the soaring public debt 
it is a fullscale allout assault on the weak the poor the 
disadvantaged the dispossessed liberal party leader john turner 
said after the budget for the 198990 fiscal year was released last 
week 
this budget is proof that nothing they said nothing the prime 
minister committed himself and his government to during the last 
election is true turner said 
the budget raises taxes and cuts federal spending in areas from 
the military to rail service and child care plans although it 
still leaves a deficit of 256 billion among the most unexpected 
steps was the elimination of the controversial program to spend 
67 billion for a fleet of nuclearpowered submarines 
the prime minister has said repeatedly that the effort to bring 
the deficit under control is critical to canadas future 
only by measures to reduce the burden of the debt can 
canadians avoid a repetition of the excessive unemployment and 
inflation rates of the early 1980s he wrote in the speech that 
opened the new session of parliament last month 
the debt now stands at 273 billion after the government ran a 
252 billion deficit in the 198889 fiscal year the amount is 
about 5 percent of gross domestic product about double the us 
ratio 
bush made ottawa his first foreign stop after his inauguration 
with a halfday visit to meet with mulroney in february the us 
leader promised to move quickly with congressional legislation to 
control acid rain which canada blames for killing 14000 lakes in 
the eastern part of the country 
the two nations are each others largest trading partner with 
twoway trade amounting to more than 150 billion annually

nearly half of the nations children are 
taking or being given medicines improperly according to a report 
tuesday that called the misuse americas other drug problem 
the report by the national council on patient information and 
education said parents physicians and pharmcists must communicate 
better about safe and effective use of medicines and children must 
be educated about the importance of taking prescription and 
overthecounter medicines properly 
health secretary louis sullivan and food and drug administration 
commissioner frank young who joined council officials at a news 
conference endorsed the councils campaign to educate health care 
providers parents and schools about the problem 
studies show that 46 percent of the time children or their 
parents are either administering too much of a medicine stopping 
the medication too soon not taking enough or the medicine or not 
taking the medicine at all sullivan said 
this misuse is occurring not only for minor afflictions but for 
serious illnesses including cancer kidney disease and other 
chronic conditions he said 
the conditions for which medicines are most likely to be 
administered improperly are asthma and epilepsy the two most 
common chronic diseases for which children take medication young 
said 
the report said studies have shown that up to 46 percent of 
pediatric hospital admissions are related to medicine use and up 
to 44 percent of those problems are severe or fatal 
in a typical twoweek period 13 million children take medicines 
prescribed or recommended by a physician said the report titled 
children and americas other drug problem 
young said the misuse of medicines is a major problem in the 
health care of children but requiring package inserts for 
prescription medicines with specific directions for use would 
probably not help 
detailed directions already included in overthecounter 
medicines havent improved compliance he said 
this is everybodys problem said young theres a lot of 
parental responsibility physician responsibility and i dont want 
to leave out the pharmacists and the media focusing on this as 
well 
i dont think a simple package insert will solve the 
problem he said this is an attitudinal and behavior problem 
in the whole health care system

the united states is discussing with the 
troubled west german government a potential compromise to the 
dispute over shortrange nuclear missiles that involves development 
of a nonnuclear west german rocket us officials said tuesday 
the missile could target airfields and other warsaw pact 
military installations now covered by the nucleararmed lances that 
chancellor helmut kohl is trying to persuade nato to scale back and 
eventually eliminate 
the west german government decided in february to suspend 
research and development of the fk90 which is classified as a 
tactical weapon with a range below 300 miles but in seeking a 
compromise in the dispute over the lance missile going ahead with 
the german missile is under discussion said the officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
gen henning von ondarza the commanderinchief of the west 
german army is in washington holding talks at the pentagon and the 
state department on options intended to ease the strains in the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
britain has lined up with the united states in trying to 
persuade kohl to agree to expand the range of the aging lance and 
to drop his demand for us negotiations with the soviets on 
reducing shortrange nuclear weapons norway denmark and other 
nato countries are siding with west germany 
the nonnuclear missile known also as technex was supposed to 
be coproduced with the united states 
gro harlem brundtland the prime minister of norway is visiting 
washington and said she would discuss nuclear issues with president 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii when they meet 
wednesday at the white house 
i think what we need now is to look for the common ground 
look for what will be a sensible and coherent way of handling the 
issues of both arms control and disarmament she said tuesday at 
a news conference 
failure to heal the rift could cloud bushs summit meeting in 
brussels may 2930 with the leaders of the nato countries 
another option is to have nato make unilateral cuts in its 
shortrange nuclear weapons while challenging the soviets to meet 
the lower levels us and nato officials said 
nato is already retiring tactical nuclear artillery weapons 
cutting back on the lances after the range of the missile is more 
than tripled to about 250 miles was suggested in a recent study 
by us gen john galvin the alliances supreme military commander 
in europe 
the idea was quietly proposed to kohls government several weeks 
ago but the chancellor persisted in demanding a delay in 
modernizing the lances for three years and speedy us negotiations 
with the soviets over them us officials said 
kohl who is up for reelection next year is under considerable 
political pressure from a west german electorate with growing 
concern over the concentration of nuclear weapons in the country 
the development of a nonnuclear missile might ease some of 
those pressures and also permit nato to get by with fewer lances a 
us official said 
in brussels a nato official who insisted on anonymity said the 
us proposal for unilateral reductions after the lances are made 
more potent was designed for a working document for how to 
proceed on the issue presumably it would be taken up by bush and 
the other allied leaders at the summit meeting 
the western nations are trying to present a united front while 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev carries out unilateral cuts 
in soviet defense spending and armored divisions and troops in 
eastern europe 
the bush administration considers gorbachevs initiatives and 
the inroads they appear to be making in west european public 
opinion one of the biggest challenges to us foreign policy 
nato defense ministers at a nuclear strategy session last 
month gave only lukewarm backing to the lance modernization 
program saying nuclear forces must be kept uptodate where 
necessary 
us defense secretary dick cheney said he was satisfied with 
the endorsement and was reasonably confident congress would 
provide more money to continue development of the new generation 
lance 
there are currently 88 lance launchers most of which are based 
in west germany officials have said the warsaw pact outnumbers 
nato by about 12to1 in shortrange nuclear missile launchers 
the alliance contends it needs to maintain its nuclear stockpile 
to balance a superiority the east has built up in conventional arms 
nato and the seven warsaw pact countries began talks in march on 
cutting conventional forces in europe

secretary of state james a bakers threat to 
cut all us financial support to the world health organization if 
it admits the plo is beyond comprehension a representative of 
the arab league complained on tuesday 
clovis maksoud arab league representative to the united states 
and united nations said in a statement that bakers position was 
deeply regrettable 
on monday baker said he would recommend to president bush that 
the united states withhold contributions to any un organization 
that votes to admit the palestine liberation organization 
baker argued that plo admission would harm the middle east peace 
process and the un itself 
the plo has applied for full membership in the who the un 
agency that oversees health programs around the globe the 
166member organization is due to vote on the matter next week in 
geneva 
meanwhile hiroshi nakajima the head of the organization 
visited the state department to discuss the matter according to 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
ms tutwiler said nakajima a japanese physician met with the 
acting assistant secretary of state for international 
organziations n charles smith 
nakajima also met with some of more than 50 members of congress 
who have written a letter to baker saying they favored cutting off 
funds to the who or any other un agency that admitted the plo 
nakajima has said he has tried to persuade plo chairman yasser 
arafat to withdraw the application apparently as a means to defuse 
the situation 
maksoud of the arab league argued in his statement that 
inclusion of the plo would contribute to the whos universality 
and effectiveness and that the plo was seeking to benefit from 
membership in these humanitarian agencies 
the threat to make no further contribution voluntary or 
assessed might be the language of a big power but not the 
parlance of a great power we in the arab world would want to 
preserve our assessment of the great united states maksouds 
statement said 
the united states pays about 25 percent of world health 
organization expenses this amounted to about 150 million in the 
past two years 
the plo is recognized by all 21 arab governments as the 
legitimate representative of the palestinian people 
last year the plo declared statehood on land held by israel 
however the state department contends the plo is not a state 
failing to meet the criteria of being a state such as control of 
territory

the bush administration is reviewing its 
policy on boarding foreign vessels on the high seas after us 
personnel were barred for three days from searching a taiwanese 
ship suspected of illegal salmon fishing a state department 
official said tuesday 
ed wolfe the state departments ambassador for oceans and 
fisheries told a house subcommittee that an interagency task 
force was examining the policy which allows for the boarding of a 
foreign vessel only after receiving permission from the government 
whose flag the ship flies 
because of the recent incident invovling taiwan we are 
reviewing our highseas boarding policy wolfe said i am 
confident we will come up with something 
wolfe said the united states has jurisdiction over such fish as 
salmon that were born in us waters and return there to spawn 
after several years in the ocean 
the problem is what we do with that jurisdiction wolfe said 
during a hearing before the fisheries wildlife conservation and 
environment subcommittee of the house merchant marine and fisheries 
committee 
wolfe said the present policy is based on customary 
international law and in a brief interview after the hearing 
declined to discuss possible alternatives 
we are exploring various possibilities wolfe said 
northwest lawmakers said that fishermen in alaska washington 
and oregon are becomming increasingly angry over what the illegal 
catch of us salmon by foreign driftnet fleets from tawian south 
korean and japan 
alaska republican rep don young said the only way to get the 
attention of the three countries with driftnet fleets would be to 
impose trade sanctions 
coast guard rear adm ted leland told the subcommittee that us 
personnel who boarded the taiwanese vessel in the north pacific 
last month found no conclusive evidence it had been illegally 
fishing for salmon 
the cutter jarvis shadowed the taiwanese ship for more than 700 
miles before coast guard personnel were given permission from the 
government of tawian to board efforts to find the ships net 
which was abandoned after the vessel was first spotted by the 
jarvis were unsucessful 
under various diplomatic agreements driftnet fishing has been 
limited to areas well away from the migration routes of salmon 
since congress enacted a law in late 1987 the state department 
has been trying to negotiate driftnet monitoring and enforcement 
agreements with each of the three countries 
if such agreements are not concluded by june 29 the president 
can then impose trade restrictions on imports of fish products from 
those countries 
american fishermen claim that vessels from taiwan south korea 
and japan are using driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons 
of salmon under the guise of squid fishing fishing groups have 
said the illegal fishing has already affected salmon runs in 
alaska washington and oregon 
an estimated 700 fishing boats from taiwan south korea and 
japan use driftnets which can stretch 35 miles in length and cover 
more than 30000 square miles of ocean on any given day 
environmentalists have likened driftnet fishing to clear cutting 
a forest and charge the nets are responsible for the deaths of 
thousands of porpoises seals seabirds and other marine life 
annually

a world conference demanded on tuesday 
a total ban on production of ozonedepleting chlorofluorocarbons by 
the end of the century 
the representatives from 86 countries also asked for an 
international fund to help third world countries replace 
environmentally hazardous equipment 
the resolution adopted at the unsponsored conference advanced 
the timetable of the 1987 montreal protocol which requires 
industrial nations to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons or 
cfcs to half of 1986 levels by 1999 
the declaration said developing countries should be helped in 
finding and financing alternatives to cfcs which are used in 
refrigeration cleaning aerosol cans and other industrial products 
the resolution was drafted by finland and was accepted with 
unexpected speed on opening day of a scheduled fourday meeting of 
government ministers and experts which was called to bring the 
montreal document up to date 
the ozone layer ranges from nine to 18 miles high it is the 
atmospheric layer within the stratosphere in which an appreciable 
concentration of ozone gas occurs absorbing much ultraviolet 
radiation and preventing some heat loss from earth 
scientists say the destruction of the ozone layer is causing 
increased skin cancer and eye damage and poses a danger to the 
worlds food chain 
environmentalists said depletion of the ozone layer is occurring 
at a much faster rate than foreseen when the montreal protocol was 
signed 
finnish president mauno koivisto said in his opening speech 
the industrial nations must spend much more on new technologies 
and be prepared to transfer applicable technologies and knowhow to 
the developing countries 
as the conference opened police detained six greenpeace 
protesters outside the hall members of the environmental group 
from switzerland sweden and finland had illegally placed a banner 
reading ozone destroyers 100 percent halt now on flagpoles 
outside finlandia hall police said 
they were later released 
the closeddoor conference opened in disarray when the draft 
declaration was leaked to reporters before delegates had a chance 
to discuss it 
the declaration called for agreement to phase out the dangerous 
gases listed in the montreal protocol as soon as possible but 
not later than year 2000 and for that purpose to tighten the 
timetable of the montreal protocol 
it urged all nations to join the 36 countries and the 12nation 
european community that have ratified the document signed in 
montreal 
norway called for creation of an international climate fund 
under united nations auspices to make new technologies available to 
developing countries 
norways environment minister sissel roenbeck said her country 
would allocate to the fund 01 percent of its gross national 
product or about 88 million provided other industrialized 
countries do the same 
the annual production of cfcs is 114 million tons two thirds 
of which is produced by the united states and western europe japan 
produces about 12 percent of cfcs and the soviet union an estimated 
10 percent 
differences between east and west on the causes of ozone 
depletion were resolved at a separate meeting of scientists and 
government officials last week delegates said

consumer activist ralph nader on tuesday said 
exxon corp should not be allowed to forget the alaskan oil 
spill and called for a consumer boycott of the giant oil companys 
products 
nader joined representatives from several environmental and 
consumer groups in denouncing exxon for its failure to be prepared 
for and rapidly respond to the oil spill that has fouled hundreds 
of square miles of pristine water and shoreline along alaskas 
southern coast 
exxon should not be allowed to forget this oil spill said 
nader suggesting exxon and the entire petroleum industry must be 
made aware of public outrage over the spill 
americans can take action now by voting with their steering 
wheel and dollars against all exxon products nader said at a 
news conference called in connection with a protest against the oil 
company in several cities across the nation 
an exxon spokesman bill smith said in a telephone interview 
from new york that more than 10000 exxon credit cards have been 
turned in since the alaska spill but he could not speculate on how 
the spill has affected exxon sales 
there are about 7 million exxon credit cards in circulation 
smith said 
other groups represented at the press conference included 
citizen action a consumer organization that often deal with 
petroleum related issues the environmental policy institute a 
coalition of three environmental groups public citizen and us 
public interest research group both advocacy groups founded by 
nader and clean water action an environmental group 
brent blackwelder chairman of the league of conservation 
voters a lobbying organization that represents a variety of 
environmental groups suggested that a successful boycott of exxon 
products would also send a message to congress 
from the original authorization of the alaska oil pipeline in 
1973 to the current state of affairs in which exxon is making 
taxpayers and consumers pay for its negligence the damaging role 
of big oils big money in american politics is all too apparent 
said blackwelder 
before a boycott is ended the consumer and environmental groups 
said exxon must pay all damage and cleanup costs from the spill 
into alaskas prince william sound establish an additional 1 
billion trust fund for environmental protection in alaska promise 
to conduct no oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge 
if its opened for oil and gas development and pay for development 
of safer oil tanks and better spill contingency programs 
although oil industry leaders have said rising gasoline prices 
are not directly related to the spill nader called on exxon to 
roll back recent price increases

transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
tuesday that some of the alaskan oil spill will have to be left to 
the cleansing forces of nature but he said an allout cleanup 
effort still is needed 
skinner who is to make his second trip to alaska wednesday as 
overall coordinator for cleanup of the march 24 oil tanker spill 
said he expected forces involved in the effort to double or triple 
in size by the end of the month 
in a speech at the national press club skinner called the 
spilling of 11 million gallons of crude oil into prince william 
sound the most significant environmental disaster this nation has 
ever faced but he said the cleanup operation to be paid for by 
the oil industry could add 100 million to 500 million to 
alaskas economy which he said is more than the effect of the 
fishing industry 
skinner said he would reserve judgment on exxons latest plans 
for the cleanup which include burning and burying recovered sludge 
and leaving some lightly soiled beaches to the cleansing forces of 
nature 
the plan requires the approval of the coast guard commandant 
adm paul a yost who criticized some aspects of it tuesday as 
thin the transportation secretary who oversees the coast guard 
said he would decide within a week whether to approve the plan 
skinner said that on some beaches nature will do its work 
but he said the state and exxon will have to focus all summer on 
cleaning up as much as possible 
my position is that we cant do enough cleaning up he 
said if its anywhere close to being a viable opiton we ought 
to do it 
skinner cautioned against cleanup efforts that may do damage to 
the environment but did not point to any specific plan of exxon 
when you are dealing in an area that is remote and has a lot 
of nature at work you want to be sure you dont cross the line 
he said 
the oil industry will have to demonstrate that it is capable 
of cleaning up its mess skinner said if they dont it will 
be very difficult for them to develop domestic reserves 
the secretary said he was traveling to alaska with officials 
from the coast guard white house and congress

a masked gunman burst into a gift shop 
tuesday and critically wounded plo chief yasser arafats personal 
representative to lebanon police said 
issam salem the palestine liberation organizations top 
official in lebanon was in critical condition and undergoing 
surgery to remove a bullet from his head doctors said 
plo officials in paris where arafat met with frances president 
francois mitterrand initially said salem 48 died in the attack 
arafat later said salem was in a coma 
we must not let ourselves be terrorized by this incident but 
do all we can to put into effect the arab resolutions on lebanon 
arafat said referring to an arab league call for a truce in the 
countrys 14yearold civil war 
the latest outbreak has pitted christian forces against an 
alliance of syrian soldiers and druse moslem militiamen 
arafat said he thought the shooting was a message for us to 
put up our hands and stop helping our lebanese brothers 
the plo chief who has longstanding differences with syria had 
voiced support for the christians in the current fighting which 
police say has killed 278 people and wounded 1010 
a police spokesman in sidon a port city 25 miles south of 
beirut said the attack came after salem got out of his white 
mercedes and entered a gift store on fakhreddine street his two 
bodyguards waited in the car 
a lone assailant wearing a plastic mask stormed into the 
shop shouting issam salem when salem turned to face the gunman 
he fired two 9mm bullets into salems head and shoulder and 
escaped said the spokesman who cannot be identified under 
police rules 
the bodyguards chased the gunman but he disappeared in the 
narrow alleys leading to sidons ein hilweh refugee camp the 
spokeman added 
salem was taken to sidons hammoud hospital where he underwent 
surgery to remove the bullet that pierced the left side of his 
forehead 
he stands a 5050 chance of making it but even if he does he 
will be suffering from a neurological defect said one of the 
surgeons dr hussein mansour that means possible partial 
paralysis

opponents complained of voting 
irregularities but it was clear tuesday that most paraguayans were 
solidly behind the general who overthrew dictator alfredo 
stroessner 
official returns gave gen andres rodriguez nearly threefourths 
of the vote for president in mondays election and his colorado 
party won firm control of congress 
half the vote for rodriguez was a thank you for overthrowing 
stroessner said aldo zuccolillo editor of the newspaper abc 
color his paper resumed publishing in march five years after 
stroessners regime closed it 
susana jara a 50yearold fruit vender at the asuncion public 
market said after 35 years of dictatorship you could not 
expect any other result because the people are very grateful to him 
for putting his life in danger to bring us freedom 
rodriguez who has been provisional president since the coup 
feb 3 said tuesday he was pleased and happy that i have the 
affection of the people and that they showed their confidence in 
me 
maybe there were small flaws he said in response to 
opposition charges of irregularities but our intentions always 
were the best and we wanted the general elections in paraguay to be 
free and clean 
speaking to reporters at the national palace he said the nine 
cabinet members he appointed immediately after the coup had offered 
their resignations he said no decision had been made on the 
resignations 
fernando vera presidential candidate of the revolutionary 
febrerista party said in spite of the irregularities i 
recognize that he won and i would say it was a landslide 
victory 
the central electoral board said tuesday that rodriguez got 
178313 of the 240379 votes counted for president or 7418 
percent 
domingo laino a former national deputy who returned from exile 
after the coup was second with 43148 votes or 1795 percent 
vera was third and six other candidates divided the remainder the 
board announced 
rodriguez 65 led by similar margins in unofficial tallies by 
opposition parties and monitoring groups also with laino and vera 
running second and third respectively 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the us embassy and international election observers saw 
several instances of questionable but not illegal procedures 
she added however that us diplomats saw no pattern of 
centrally directed fraud 
rodriguez coup ousted 76yearold stroessner a year after the 
dictator won his eighth presidential term stroessner also a 
general went into exile in brazil 
voting monday was for a successor to finish the fiveyear 
presidential term and to fill the two houses of congress which 
rodriguez dissolved after the coup the elections were the most 
democratic this south american nation has held in decades 
partial official results gave the colorado party 156247 votes 
or 6643 percent of the 235203 counted for the 36member senate 
and the chamber of deputies which has 72 seats 
unofficial tallies gave a similar edge to the colorados who 
have been in power since 1947 and were a bulwark of the stroessner 
regime 
under paraguayan law the party getting the most votes is 
awarded twothirds of the seats in congress 24 in the senate and 
48 in the lower house 
rodriguez the colorado candidate has pledged to reform the 
constitution and electoral law and not to seek reelection 
laino and vera were elected to the senate both headed their 
party slates for congressional seats in addition to running for 
president 
flaws cited by international observers and party officials 
included lack of privacy at some voting stations ballots for all 
parties not available everywhere some registered voters not 
permitted to cast ballots indelible ink to prevent multiple voting 
not always available or applied properly 
no official figures on voter turnout were given the election 
board acknowledged before the election that the registration list 
of 22 million voters in this nation of 4 million people might 
contain up to 600000 extra names 
paraguayans voted in large numbers often standing patiently 
outdoors on a drizzly day chatting and drinking mate a bitter 
herbal tea 
the president and new congress are to be sworn in may 15

legal workers seeking refugee status for 
salvadorans declared a small victory tuesday after a judge ruled 
that salvadorans may not be deported from south texas before being 
apprised of their rights 
us district judge david kenyon in los angeles issued the 
preliminary injunction made public monday after finding the 
immigration and naturalization service violated his previous order 
to provide salvadorans access to legal counsel 
this is a small victory jonathan moore a paralegal with 
the harlingenbased central american legal advocacy group proyecto 
libertad said tuesday its a recognition that there is a 
problem i think its significant 
both sides in the case said they expect the number of 
salvadorans actively fighting deportation to increase as a result 
of the judges order 
in the injunction kenyon noted that none of 67 salvadorans 
deported april 20 from the ins minimumsecurity port isabel service 
processing center at bayview near the mexican border had lawyers at 
their deportation hearings 
the court finds it difficult to believe that each of these 
individuals learned of and knowingly and effectively waived his or 
her right to counsel the judge said 
the order is part of a 1982 classaction suit accusing the ins 
of failing to provide salvadorans access to legal representation 
the plaintiffs in march had asked that the ins be held in contempt 
and ordered to comply 
fridays injunction remains in effect until a may 30 hearing 
the 1471 aliens detained at bayview as of monday included 495 
nicaraguans 334 salvadorans 194 hondurans and 173 guatemalans 
basically it says we wont be able to deport any salvadorans 
until one of the immigrant rights groups proyecto libertad has a 
chance to talk to them as a body said duke austin an ins 
spokesman in washington 
austin said the ins has encouraged groups such as the american 
bar association to provide legal representation for salvadorans and 
other detainees 
proyecto libertad eadvocates refugee status for salvadorans on 
grounds that they are fleeing war and political persecution the 
united states deports most salvadorans ruling that they are coming 
to this country for economic reasons only 
proyecto libertad was designated by the plaintiffs to conduct 
the legal briefings proyecto held its first session monday night 
for men at the port isabel center a second session was held 
tuesday for the women he said 
even though the ins is slowly complying the judge recognizes 
that for several months they have been out of compliance said 
mark schneider a proyecto attorney 
our concern is that for over two months over 1500 people 
have been deported many of whom were never advised of their 
rights who may have had strong cases he said 
us officials have granted refugee status to only six 
salvadorans and 78 nicaraguans in the harlingen district since feb 
21 
the ins last month installed cellular telephones for the bayview 
detainees and added pay phones in an effort to comply

prisoners awaiting trial smashed down 
walls and flooded cell blocks tuesday the third day of a riot 
against conditions at the risley holding center in northern england 
chief guard graham harrison said inmates used tornoff cell 
doors to break down walls and threw bricks and rubble at guards who 
tried to intervene 
it was an orgy of destruction he said 
guards and police with riot gear watched from below as prisoners 
on the jail roof displayed banners protesting conditions in the 
25yearold center near warrington 10 miles east of the port city 
of liverpool 
guards said 55 rioters controlled the roof and two top floors of 
dwing and had absolutely obliterated the top floor of bwing 
smashing all 48 cells water damaged an additional 60 cells on two 
floors below they said 
the riot started sunday paul lynch a recently released 
prisoner said the main complaints were overcrowding and 
atrocious food 
the complex which also holds women prisoners was opened in 
1964 as a shortstay prison for inmates who could not get bail 
home office minister douglas hogg who is in charge of prisons 
said in a radio interview that plans called for risley to be 
completely rebuilt and within eight years it would be an entirely 
new prison 
he called risley a particularly difficult establishment 
hogg said the inmates could not be made to work because they were 
awaiting trial he said he was satisfied with staffing levels 
but john bartell the guards national association chairman 
said there were 25 staff on duty for 550 prisoners we are 
short of resources and staff and we are afraid that this incident 
may presage a summer of discontent throughout the prison system 
after seven suicides in 18 months judge stephen tumim the 
government chief inspector of prisons described risley last summer 
as barbarous and squalid a poorly designed institution where 
many inmates are kept in appalling and unacceptable conditions 
tumim said risley and other prisons built in the 1960s were 
constructed without cell toilets just like the victorian prisons 
which still hold most of the countrys 50000 inmates 
the government began rebuilding risley after tumims report

nine antiabortion protesters have 
been ordred to pay 810000 in damages and stay away from the house 
of a doctor who said demonstrators at his home made life miserable 
for him and his family 
state district judge jack hunter on tuesday issued a permanent 
injunction barring pickets from coming within 400 feet of the home 
of dr eduardo aquino 
on monday a jury decided 102 that the picketers should pay 
aquino 810000 in damages 
i feel my family will be left alone now aquino said 
abortion opponent cliff zarsky one of two attorneys who 
represented the defendants without a fee said he will ask for a 
new trial 
jurors ruled monday the protests caused mental anguish to 
aquino his wife mercedes and their four children protesters 
carried placards that suggested aquino was a murderer but both 
sides described the demonstrations as peaceful 
aquino testified his wife suffered from depression and ulcers 
that one son was institutionalized and that his three schoolage 
children suffered academically after the picketing began 
zarsky who said the demonstrators actions were protected by 
the constitution argued that the pickets broke no laws and felt it 
was their duty to protect unborn children 
the damages included 140000 in past and future suffering of 
the couple 170000 in past and future suffering of the children 
and 500000 in punitive damages 
it was not clear if each defendant would be able to pay the 
damages aquinos attorney tony bonilla said he would pursue the 
award 
aquino said however that he was not really interested in the 
money 
aquino said he has been performing abortions since 1978 and 
antiabortionists had picketed his office since 1982 they began 
picketing at his home in march 1988 the same month the suit was 
filed 
the phone at zarskys office went unanswered tuesday

the pentagons star wars program has 
selected five sites for consideration as the home of an 
experimental system for storing huge amounts of electrical energy 
the defense department said tuesday 
the sites in wisconsin new mexico texas and washington will 
now be studied more closely for their environmental suitability and 
a final decision will be made sometime next year 
the star wars project is known formally as the superconductive 
magnetic energy storage program or smes and will involve the 
construction of huge coils the size of a football field 
the idea behind the project is similar to that used by some 
utilities that have built excess generating capacity by using 
elevated water reservoirs the magnetic coils would be designed to 
hold huge amounts of electricity that can be pumped in when 
demand is low then discharged when needed 
the coils would utilize new breakthroughs in fashioning 
materials that can conduct electricity with little or no loss of 
current 
the star wars program is interested in the idea because of the 
problem of powering large groundbased lasers that are being 
studied as one possible defense against nuclear missiles 
among the advantages smes has to offer a groundbased laser 
are instantaneous response for vast power requirements extremely 
high energy conversion efficiency relatively low cost fuel 
independence siting ease high availability low maintenance 
costs and insensitivity to earthquake and blast the pentagon 
said 
the defense department identified the five finalist sites as the 
badger army ammunition plant near baraboo wis orogrande nm 
near the southeastern edite of the white sands missile range a 
laser experiment site already set up inside the white sands missile 
range a site near monahans texas located about 35 miles 
southwest of odessa texas and the energy departments hanford 
reservation near richland wash 
the pentagon previously had selected two contractors bechtel 
national inc and ebasco services inc to compete in developing a 
design for the smes that phase 1 work is be completed in may 1990 
at which point the pentagon plans to select one of the two 
contractors and at the same time select a construction site for the 
prototype 
the star wars program is a research program aimed at developing 
lasers and other exotic weapons that could automatically shoot down 
any nuclear missiles fired at the united states

the jury in the oliver north irancontra trial 
deliberated for its longest day tuesday but failed again to reach 
agreement on the guilt or innocence of the former national security 
council aide 
there has been no word from the jurors about progress in the 
nearly two weeks since us district judge gerhard a gesell 
admonished them that in order to return a verdict on any aspect 
of this case it is necessary that each juror agree to the verdict 
the jury which is sequestered in a downtown hotel while not 
meeting worked nearly 7 hours on its 10th day of deliberations 
for a total 53 hours 
no one outside the jury room knows what is going on inside but 
the requirement of unanimity for reaching a verdict on any 
aspect seems a likely difficulty 
your verdict must be unanimous gesell said on april 20 when 
he sent the jury from the courtroom with orders to begin weighing 
the case the next day a friday 
the jurors were told to communicate with the judge only through 
notes and were told you are never to reveal to any person not 
even the court how the jury vote stands numerically or otherwise 
on the question of guilt or innocence until the verdict is in 
in the first three days there were eight notes they dealt 
mostly with office supplies the jurors wanted legal pads paper 
clips and sharpened pencils but not with any substance that would 
give a clue to possible problems in agreeing on a verdict 
juries especially those that are arguing about a particular 
point often ask to have a particular piece of testimony reread to 
them an activity that takes place in open court with lawyers and 
defendant present in those cases spectators have an inkling about 
why the jury finds it difficult to reach a verdict 
the last note from the north jury was sent to the judge a week 
ago monday since then there has been no communication from the 
courtroom where the jury sits surrounded by 1300 pages of 
documents the 363 exhibits introduced in the trial 
the sheer volume of those exhibits the two months of testimony 
and the 12 felony charges in the case made it certain that a 
conscientious jury would take time 
but courthouse observers many of whom had predicted a verdict 
would be reached last week now are discussing the possibility that 
the jurors may be unable to agree on one or more counts 
if the jury reported itself deadlocked on all counts gesell 
most likely would send them back to try again until they reported 
there was no hope of agreement if they still could not get a 
unanimous vote on one or more counts prosecutors would have to 
decide later whether to bring the charges again 
ten days is not a record it is not even close in the federal 
court in the district of columbia a trial of black hebrews in 1986 
on racketeering charges set a modern deliberation record of 200 
hours over 36 days 
meanwhile a lawyer for 10 news organizations seeking access to 
a document that the jury was allowed to see filed a memorandum with 
gesell saying that the fact that the document at issue here has 
been designated classified is no reason to withhold it from the 
public 
gesell had questioned the right of the news organizations to 
intervene in the case attorney timothy b dyk told gesell that the 
supreme court and courts of appeal have recognized that the press 
may assert the rights of public access to proceedings and records 
in criminal cases 
the document in question is a summary of hundreds of 
intelligence intercepts through which the national security 
agency tracked a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles from israel to iran 
the news organizations involved in the case are the associated 
press cable news network inc capital citiesabc inc cbs inc

ten years after the may 3 1979 election that 
brought margaret thatcher to power most britons want her to step 
down soon and think her rightwing revolution has gone too far 
according to new polls 
but while britons questioned ahead of wednesdays anniversary 
say they dont like her the likelihood is they will go on voting 
for her because they respect the woman who always has led what the 
economist weekly calls a reluctant nation 
the economist noted that virtually throughout mrs thatchers 
tenure gallup polls have never registered more than 24 percent 
support for a basic thatcher doctrine tax cuts rather than 
increased state spending particularly on welfare 
soundings published sunday and tuesday are part of a nationwide 
assessment of thatcherism prompted by the anniversary of the 
conservative partys triumph over former prime minister james 
callaghans labor party government 
she took office may 4 1979 
europes first woman prime minister was elected by a nation 
weary of strikes and inflation and yearning for strong government 
to reverse a national decline she has won two more elections since 
and is britains longest continuously serving prime minister this 
century 
in the opinion polls she scores high for qualities such as 
determination and courage her most popular policies polls 
indicate are curbing trade unions and allowing public housing 
tenants to buy their homes 
britons see their country as having gained respect abroad while 
becoming a more aggressive violent and selfish society 
the leader who determined to wipe out socialism from britain 
also appears in most polls to preside over a nation that has not 
taken her message to heart 
a market opinion and research international poll published 
tuesday in the independent a london daily indicates only 30 
percent of those asked support the notion that private interests 
and a free market economy should dominate 
according to a harris poll in londons liberal observer 
newspaper 58 percent of respondents think 10 years of mrs 
thatcher is enough and 66 percent agree mrs thatcher has gone 
too far in her policies 
forty percent of those questioned said they think she should go 
immediately and 18 percent want her to make way for a successor at 
least a year before the next general election due mid1992 
but just 7 percent of the 1040 voters questioned by harris 
actually expect mrs thatcher to resign in the next few years 
and 28 percent apparently cant imagine being without her asked 
when they think mrs thatcher 63 will retire they said 
never 
the soundings also indicate a generally subdued reckoning by 
voters of the thatcher revolution for example only 37 percent of 
1001 voters questioned by gallup for the conservative sunday 
telegraph said they think that overall britain is now a better 
place in which to live 
and while 67 percent dislike mrs thatcher personally 63 
percent respect her 
the polls also have most britons citing soccer hooliganism and 
street crime to back their belief that the country has become more 
violent 
but in a notable victory for a leader who has spent a decade 
preaching selfreliance among other values most britons no longer 
expect the government to put it right 
however mrs thatcher continues to be the party leader most 
think makes the best prime minister she has won big majorities of 
around 42 percent of the vote while the leftofcenter is split 
and when it comes to casting a vote she ends the first 10 years 
with a 2 to 3point lead over labor in most polls 
she has lacked the sunny charm that president reagan brought 
to his most controversial policies said the economist 
perhaps lots of people had to be made unhappy for the country 
to face the future with some confidence well they have been and 
it does

a woman who was stripped of custody of her 
child and convicted of prenatal child abuse for using cocaine 
during pregnancy is a victim of the courts pushing the law to 
outrageous limits a lawyer said tuesday 
but a law professor said the conviction monday in juvenile court 
was likely to be endorsed by doctors because of compelling evidence 
that pregnant women who use cocaine endanger their unborn babies 
prosecutors said it apparently was the second case in illinois 
this year in which a woman had been convicted of prenatal child 
abuse because of drug use 
judge frederick j kapala who found the woman guilty of 
prenatal abuse and neglect said he was forced to take a stand 
on the issue of fetus rights after testimony showed she had used 
cocaine up to a few hours before the birth 
the child in the care of social workers shows no sign of 
cocaine addiction or other serious cocainerelated health problems 
officials said 
paul logli winnebago county states attorney said the woman 
faces no jail time or fine because the case was tried only to 
determine custody of the child 
the child born three months ago will remain in the care of 
social workers pending the mothers treatment at a drug 
rehabilitation center a hearing may 25 will determine if she is 
fit to regain custody of the child 
neither the mother nor the child was identified 
j steven beckett an attorney in the state bar associations 
individual rights and responsibilities section said the judges 
ruling will allow headlinegrabbing prosecutors another 
opportunity to practice their trade 
if prenatal abuse happens with cocaine it can happen with 
alcohol it can happen with drunken driving and it can happen with 
pregnant speeders he said 
kapala rejected the claim that his ruling could apply to 
pregnant women who smoke or drink the difference he said is that 
cocaine is illegal 
richard epstein professor at the university of chicago school 
of law and a fellow at the universitys center for clinical medical 
ethics said that a lot of medical people will breathe a sigh of 
relief at kapalas decision 
if you have an unborn child inside you the evidence is 
overwhelming that using cocaine is a form of abuse and neglect 
epstein said 
logli said he was considering filing criminal charges against 
women whose babies die of cocaine addiction were talking about 
a very dangerous illegal substance he said we have no choice 
but to take serious steps to battle it 
the prosecutor said that the infants exposure to cocaine puts 
it at risk of kidney and developmental problems and increases the 
risk of sudden infant death syndrome 
a key element in the case involved the question of whether 
illinois law covers fetal rights 
the mothers attorney alberto f altamore said the illinois 
juvenile court act defines abuse and neglect of minors but does not 
address fetuses state child abuse laws only speak of minors under 
21 he said

cambodian premier hun sen reported 
quite big progress with resistance leaders on tuesday in talks 
to end a decadelong war but he said the resistance appeared split 
on key issues 
in thailand shells crashed into the largest cambodian refugee 
camp in the latest in a recent surge in border assaults western 
relief officials said 
three rounds flew over a border camp known as site 2 and two 
shells landed in the camp 30 minutes later said patrick van de 
velde deputy director of the un border relief operation no 
casualties were reported 
it was not known who is responsible for the recent shellings 
van de velde said 15 shells have landed in the past 10 days near 
the camp home to 180000 refugees 
in jakarta resistance coalition leader prince norodom sihanouk 
and anticommunist faction chief son sann negotiated separately 
with the premier who said the two faction leaders differed on key 
issues 
the khmer rouge the largest and best armed faction in the 
threeparty resistance were not directly represented in jakarta 
sihanouk said their absence was a consensus decision 
sihanouk son sann and their aides were not available for 
comment tuesday both canceled news conferences 
hun sen did not indicate whether he considered the split a 
barrier to further progress he said the talks would resume 
wednesday with further negotiations in paris or jakarta 
sihanouk expressed willingness on sunday to drop his demand that 
a un force supervise the withdrawal of vietnamese troops from 
cambodia and keep the peace after hun sens government was 
dismantled hun sen said sihanouk agreed to maintain the present 
constitution and make a few more amendments to it 
but son sann still insists on the un force suspension of the 
constitution and a foursided coalition government until elections 
are held hun sen said 
hun sen said the first day of talks achieved quite big 
progress if we compare it with the recent and not so recent past 
we recognize that both of us made concessions 
sihanouk and hun sen agreed to stop receiving military aid from 
abroad as soon as the vietnamese troop withdrawal is completed it 
was not clear whether son sann also agreed to that 
us officials estimate that 60000 to 70000 vietnamese troops 
remain in cambodia vietnam has promised to withdraw them by the 
end of september 
hun sen said the government would invite sihanouk home to head 
the government the 67yearold prince agreed to return to cambodia 
after vietnamese forces departed hun sen said 
speaking through an interpreter hun sen said he favors the 
creation of a supreme national council headed by sihanouk with 
leaders of the other three factions as deputies 
the council would draft election rules and supervise the 
election hun sen said 
our government will remain only to maintain social order he 
said after the votes are counted his government would be 
dissolved 
the armed forces would remain at the same strength and in the 
same places until after the elections 
millions have been killed in cambodia since 1970 when a coup 
ended sihanouks 30year rule cambodia became engulfed in the 
vietnam war and then the khmer rouge won a civil war in 1975 
the current war erupted when vietnam invaded cambodia in late 
1978 and pushed out the khmer rouge which was blamed for killing 
hundreds of thousands of people

an abbreviated countdown began 
tuesday for launching atlantis on a oncedelayed planetary mission 
and the astronaut who will command the flight said this time 
were going to see if we can get it right

walker told reporters were extremely pleased the folks here at 
the cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready 
to go again 
the other crew members are pilot ronald grabe and mission 
specialists mary cleave mark lee and nornman thagard 
there are no major issues in sight robert crippen nasas 
deputy director for operations said after a mission management 
meeting were pressing on toward a thursday launch 
liftoff is scheduled for 148 pm 
the shuttle will carry into space the 550 million magellan 
probe a robot spacecraft bound for venus it will be the first 
us planetary mission in 11 years and the first to be launched 
from a space shuttle 
fridays launch was scubbed because of a short circuit in a fuel 
pump 
technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a 
leaky fuel line in half the time expected and nasa scheduled

they originally thought they could 
air force capt thomas strange the shuttle meteorologist said 
the weather outlook for a thursday launch was favorable with only 
a 30 percent chance there would be a condition that would violate 
weather constraints 
the biggest problem and it was slight he said might be high 
crosswinds that could be dangerous if atlantis had to make an 
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad 
shuttle test director ronald phelps said the new countdown was 
compressed from three days to two by eliminating some hold time 
that is built into the countdown in case of problems and by not 
repeating some tasks completed in the first attempt 
the astronauts will release the magellan six hours after 
liftoff and a rocket will hurl it on a 15month journey to venus 
the 7600pound craft will orbit the planet and map its 
cloudveiled surface with highresolution radar

lawmakers on tuesday urged vice president dan 
quayle as chairman of the national space council to try to reverse 
a pentagon decision to scale back funding for a futuristic 
highspeed plane 
nineteen members of the house said that defense secretary dick 
cheneys plan to cut the projects fiscal 1990 budget from 300 
million to 100 million and place it under exclusive nasa 
jurisdiction will result in the planes demise the project has 
been a joint effort of the defense department and nasa 
nasa officials have made it clear that withdrawal of dod 
support for nasp national aerospace plane would ultimately kill 
the program the seven democrats and 12 republicans said in a 
letter 
they said the plane a transport that could fly around the world 
in just two hours is a natural product of our intense need to 
return to the forefront of space technology 
cheney determined that the plane is a civilian aviation program 
but the lawmakers argued it represents technology that will provide 
national security well into the 21st century 
as vice president as chairman of the national space council 
and as one who advocates us competitiveness in the world you 
have a key role in us technological development the lawmakers 
wrote quayle to cancel the national aerospace plane in 1990 is 
to ensure our technological mediocrity beyond

congress on tuesday began consideration of the 
fiscal 1990 budget with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for 
getting ones teeth drilled 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee said he disagreed with those who characterize the 
deficit reduction plan as smoke and mirrors as deception as 
sleight of hand or even worse 
but i sympathize completely with the frustration behind it 
he said as the senate began debate on its version of the 117 
trillion spending late tuesday this resolution simply doesnt go 
far enough we all know it 
there is something in it for everyone to hate yet without it 
were in big trouble said rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior 
republican on the house budget committee testifying in favor of 
the house plan 
both plans are based on the deficitreduction agreement 
announced last month at the white house the pact claims about 28 
billion in deficit reduction through limits on federal spending 
growth combined with revenues from selling government assets 
raising fees and about 53 billion in stilltobenegotiated new 
revenues 
the budgets promise to bring the deficit down below the 100 
billion goal of the grammrudman law for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 but critics contend that claim is based on overly 
optimistic assumptions and much of the savings is illusory 
i believe we are doing a great disservice said rep anthony 
beilenson dcalif a member of the house rules committee said 
tuesday as that panel prepared to prescribe a house debate to 
assure passage of the plan 
the votes are not there to do more lamented rep leon 
panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget committee he and 
others said perhaps more could be done next year 
house minority leader bob michel rill said after a white 
house meeting that the budget was close to what the 
administration had asked for he and the democratic leaders were 
working to make sure there would be no amendments allowed that 
would upset the whole apple cart 
obviously this budget has been heavily criticized said 
sen pete v domenici rnm i know of no one who has a better 
plan 
under the white house pact both the house and senate budgets 
envision 2992 billion in military spending next year about the 
same as the current year the pentagon would be given total 
spending authority of 3055 billion a figure which includes some 
outlays which stretch past the end of the fiscal year 
foreign aid spending would be set at 17 billion 
entitlement programs would be allowed to grow so that individual 
benefits and their costofliving increases would escape cuts 
however a variety of costcutting actions some of them just 
bookkeeping changes would allow for 83 billion in total savings 
from medicare agriculture federal pensions and other 
entitlements 
the white house agreement set an overall spending cap but not 
specifics for nonentitlement domestic programs 
the house and senate budget committees took somewhat difference 
approaches to dividing that pie with the house favoring education 
health and veterans programs compared to more senate emphasis on 
agriculture energy and law enforcement 
in the house the rules committee was limiting amendments and 
debate so that the package could be completed on thursday in the 
senate the rules allow individual senators the right to offer 
amendments at any time but budget supporters were confident the 
plan would survive essentially intact 
well have substantial help for the cause domenici said 
once the house and senate complete their budgets the two 
chambers must agree on a single resolution the document then 
serves as the guide for the annual spending and tax legislation 
produced by the congress

the senate voted tuesday to reauthorize the 
martin luther king jr federal holiday commission after prohibiting 
the panel from training people in the nonviolent protest tactics 
which king used successfully in the civil rights movement 
the 907 vote to give the commission five more years of life 
and its first infusion of federal dollars ended two days of 
debate in which sen jesse helms rnc a leading opponent of the 
1983 legislation creating the king holiday was beaten in four 
attempts to weaken the reauthorizing bill 
but sen sam nunn dga the bills sponsor joined with helms 
in an amendment adopted 960 which prohibits the commission from 
engaging in training activites for protest or civil disobediance 
campaigns 
nunn said the amendment was not an attempt to stifle information 
about kings tactics or the civil rights movement and its history 
but because the commission now will be receiving federal money he 
said it should not be permitted to engage in such training 
activities 
helms said the commissions 1988 annual report provides evidence 
it has been training students to wage nonviolent protest campaigns 
against social injustice he said the federal government has no 
business encouraging protest movement campaigns civil disobedience 
and those sorts of things 
the senate bill which would provide the commission with 15 
million in federal money over five years must be reconciled with a 
similar bill the house passed last month the house version makes 
the commission permanent and authorizes an annual federal 
appropriation of 500000 
the commission was created in 1984 to promote state national 
and international activities relating to the observance of the 
federal holiday in honor of the slain civil rights leader its 
activities previously had been financed with private donations 
before approving the legislation the senate voted 8611 to 
defeat a helms amendment that would have eliminated all federal 
money for the commission and 926 to defeat another helms proposal 
to terminate the commission after two years 
another helms amendment which would have prohibited the 
commission from lobbying state and local governments was defeated 
8019 and helms proposal to prohibit the panel from exercising 
direction control or supervision over school curriculum or 
programs was rejected 917 
the senate accepted one helms amendment requiring that the 
bronze replica of the declaration of independence which was moved 
from the capitol rotunda last year to make way for a bust of king 
be returned to a place of prominence in the rotunda 
voting against the bill in the senate were sens bill armstrong

the us international trade commission ruled 
tuesday that the domestic bearing industry has been harmed by 
lowpriced imports clearing the way for the final imposition of 
antidumping duties on certain imports from europe and asia 
in one of the nations largest antidumping cases ever the 
commerce department will decide the amount of duties that the 
customs service will levy on an estimated 531 million in imported 
bearings from nine nations 
in a series of six rulings the commission found injury to us 
bearing producers from lowpriced imports of ball cylindrical 
roller and plain bearings and rejected claims of injury from 
imports of spherical needle roller and slewing ring bearings 
the action was hailed by the torrington co of torrington 
conn which had filed a petition on behalf of the us bearing 
industry in march 1988 claiming that massive dumping by foreign 
countries was damaging domestic manufacturers of antifriction 
bearings 
torrington president thomas e bennett said the commissions 
action should help create conditions of fair competition in the 
us market he said domestic producers lost an estimated 700 
million in sales a year because of unfairly priced imports 
bennett said the company was disappointed that not all 
categories of imported bearings were found to be injuring domestic 
manufacturers and that torrington will not hesitate to take 
strong action again to challenge additional unfair trade practices 
that are identified 
terence stewart a washington attorney representing the company 
said torringtons petition covered 625 million in imports a year 
and that the commissions action would result in the imposition of 
duties on 85 percent of those imports torrington a subsidiary of 
ingersollrand co is the nations largest producer of a range of 
bearings 
stewart said the ruling was significant because for literally 
thousands of americans it will provide employment opportunities in 
a highskilled industry he said an estimated 30 us plants had 
closed and 14000 jobs had been lost because of unfair competition 
from abroad 
stewart said that while the itc ruling was the last step before 
final imposition of duties the decision still could be challenged 
in court and that litigation was not unlikely given the hardfought 
nature of the case to date 
itc spokesman jim craig said the customs service would probably 
begin collecting duties by the middle of the month the decision 
covers certain imports from germany france italy japan romania 
singapore sweden thailand and the united kingdom 
stewart said most of the affected imports were ball bearings 
and that the largest share of the imports came from germany and 
japan 
in earlier rulings on the case the commerce department had 
found final dumping margins ranging up to 212 percent for some 
imported bearings meaning that us prices for the imports would 
have to be raised by that amount to bring them to a fair value 
the itc estimated there were 95 domestic producers of 
antifriction bearings in 1988 with plants located in alabama 
arkansas california connecticut georgia illinois indiana 
iowa kentucky michigan new hampshire new jersey new york 
north carolina ohio oklahoma pennsylvania south carolina 
tennessee virginia and wisconsin 
antifriction bearings are used in the aircraft automotive 
machinery and electronics industries 
commission chairman anne brunsdale recused herself from all 
votes on the bearings to avoid any potential conflict of interest 
given certain family holdings in affected industries

a retired british spy writes in his memoirs that 
british intelligence has been irreparably damaged by soviet agents 
and he names another mole among its ranks the independent reported 
tuesday 
desmond bristows book a game of moles may face the same 
government ban attempted on former agent peter wrights book 
spycatcher 
bristow spoke of his memoirs in an interview at his home in 
malaga spain the newspaper said 
he was quoted as saying british intelligence officials already 
have tried over a bottle of claret wine to have him scrap the 
book or submit it to government censors 
bristow 73 once was chief of counterintelligence for southwest 
europe for mi6 the independent said mi6 is britains foreign 
intelligence agency mi5 handles domestic affairs 
the cia and mi6 were equals before the newspaper quoted 
bristow as saying now theyre not the cia doesnt share its 
supersecret stuff with us anymore personally i dont blame them 
bristow said he left mi6 in 1954 after his cover was blown by 
kim philby the notorious british traitorspy but continued to do 
occasional work for the agency the independent reported 
philby guy burgess donald maclean and anthony blunt were 
upperclass englishmen who were unmasked in the 1950s and 1960s as 
soviet agents 
the independent said that in a game of moles bristow claims 
the late david footman a chief of mi6s political section for 
central europe also worked for moscow 
bristow the paper said claims footman tore up a report written 
for him in 1951 on burgess suspicious activities fired a spanish 
agent of bristows who was uncovering kgb plots in spain and 
buried topsecret files on links between the kgb and communist 
parties in southern europe 
the paper did not say whether footman has any family to respond 
to the allegation and the home office said we dont comment on 
security matters 
the independent did not say when the book was to be published 
but reporter sarah helm told the associated press the book is not 
yet completed and bristow is talking with publishers 
the government fought a threeyear court battle to suppress 
wrights book saying it violated the lifelong oath of secrecy 
taken by intelligence employees 
the courts eventually lifted an injunction banning newspapers 
from serializing spycatcher but its publication in book form 
remains banned in britain although its publishers can distribute 
the australian edition here

senate and house negotiators quickly agreed 
tuesday on legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to 455 by 
1991 and promised to move for swift congressional passage of the 
bill which president bush has vowed to veto 
there were 18 areas in which the terms of house and senate bills 
differed but the conference committee took only about an an hour to 
complete work made easier by staff negotiations during last weeks 
congressional recess 
fourteen of the differences were worked out between 
representatives of each chambers labor committees the senate 
conferees then met with representatives of the house ways and means 
committee and stripped off four taxrelated senate amendments 
including a proposal to raise the amount of outside income a social 
security recipient can earn before losing some enefits 
democrats from both the senate and house conference teams 
pledged swift final legislative action on the compromise with a 
consensus prediction that the bill would reach the white house in 
about two weeks 
between bush and labor secretary elizabeth dole the 
administration has vowed more than a dozen times to veto the 
measure which has a final minimum wage target 30 cents higher than 
the president proposed and contains a socalled training wage far 
more restrictive than the sixmonth provision demanded by bush 
sponsors said they had scaled back their bill considerably to 
meet administration concerns and would go no further without 
concessions by bush 
we are hardpressed to offer any further compromise said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio even tried to strip the 
twomonth training wage democrats reluctantly added to their bill 
in hopes bush would then accept it 
unless we can work out a compromise with the white house we 
ought to dump the training wage metzenbaum said but he withdrew 
the attempt after house democrats told him the provision was 
essential to maintain support among moderate democrats and a small 
number of republicans who voted for the original house bill 
bush appears to have the votes to sustain a veto but democrats 
promised nonetheless to try to override to assist that effort the 
aflcio is contemplating an advertising campaign in hopes of 
rallying the public behind the legislation the federations 
governing body also issued a statement tuesday supporting the 
legislation 
the sponsors on both the house and senate side however concede 
bush likely will win the first confrontation between the congress 
and the white house over domestic policy but they have promised to 
try to send bush another minimumwage bill this year if that 
happens 
the final product endorsed by the conferees would raise the 
hourly minimum from 335 its level for more than eight years to 
455 through three increases beginning oct 1 and ending on oct 
1 1991 
both the house and senate bills contained those targets the 
major issue resolved in conference was the trainingwage provision 
allowing employers to pay some new workers a subminimum wage for 60 
days 
the house bill allowed a subminimum only for firsttime entrants 
in the job market while the senate language adopted by the 
conference requires once a person held a job at the submininum 
wage for 60 days he would be no longer eligible for the subminimum 
even if he changes jobs

the outgoing chairman of the federal 
communications commission pointed with pride tuesday to an opening 
up of competition in broadcasting during the seismic change of 
his six years at the agency 
in a swan song address to industry executives dennis patrick 
ticked off a list of benefits he said broadcasters had received 
since he joined the fcc in 1983 
he thanked his audience at the national association of 
broadcasters convention for being courageous soldiers in this 
battle for freedom and for unflagging support of his policies 
against critics in congress and nonbroadcast media 
through this period of seismic change i have held firmly 
to the notion of open entry to create a competitive marketplace for 
the media he said this policy has led to a proliferation of 
information outlets unimaginable even six years ago 
the average american home today has access to 25 video channels 
he said and half of all americans receive at least 28 radio 
stations 
we have tried to foster competition at the fcc by lowering 
barriers to entry and by permitting broadcasters to compete as 
freely as those with whom they compete namely cable patrick 
said 
while saying that more competition can be a doubleedged sword 
for broadcasters he said the competitive genie is out of the 
bottle and neither congress nor the commission will stuff her 
back in 
patrick anounced last month he had resigned from the agency 
where he has been chairman for the past two years but would stay on 
until his replacement is confirmed 
during patricks tenure the fcc repealed the fairness doctrine 
that required broadcasters to air opposing views in controversial 
issues congress is expected to vote to reinstate the policy this 
year posing a possible veto fight with president bush 
the fcc also revised the means by which stations renew their 
licenses to bar sham competitors who just want money to drop their 
challenges to licensees 
no longer will you be held hostage to petitions to deny filed 
because you refuse to concede to extortion nor will we tolerate 
those who seek to extort cash payments by masquerading as competing 
applicants patrick said to a round of applause 
he also noted the fccs decision last year to make sure that a 
us standard for highdefinition television will not make obsolete 
the huge investment tv stations have in current equipment 
american industry is racing to adopt standards with which to 
build an hdtv system and stave off the expected appearance in the 
next couple of years of foreignmade hdtv vcrs and movies 
he urged the broadcasters not to delay reaching agreement on an 
hdtv transmission standard so america can regain the lead in 
broadcast technology 
he also said broadcasters need further protection from the cable 
tv industry in the form of a requirement that cable systems pay for 
the overtheair programs they feed to their subscribers 
they should no longer be permitted to take the product that 
you have bought you have promoted you have earned and pass it 
off without asking as theirs patrick said to more applause 
he said the future holds new challenges for broadcasters 
fiberoptic cable and telephone entry into video programming 
competition from foreign media further loss of audience and the 
shifting of advertising from video to point of sales 
he said network affiliates and networks may have to forge 
stronger bonds and broadcasters may have to work with cable to 
survive against global competitors 
in this complex future he said may you have convictions 
may you have the courage of your convictions may you succeed 
patricks address concluded the 67th annual nab gathering which 
was attended by a record 50136 broadcast executives and exhibitors

a food and drug administration advisory 
committee on tuesday recommended approval of a drug used to treat 
an aidsrelated condition that can lead to blindness 
the panel of outside experts based its decision on new data that 
came from several recent studies conducted in the united states and 
in other countries that found the drug ganciclovir is effective in 
treating cytomegalovirus retinitis in aids patients 
this is the second aids drug the advisory committee has 
recommended for approval in two days of hearings on monday the 
panel recommended approval of the aerosolized version of 
pentamidine to ward off initial and recurring bouts of pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia which kills 60 percent of aids patients 
fda approval of ganciclovir is expected this summer and 
approval of aerosol pentamidine is likely within weeks said an fda 
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
advocates of programs to fight aids have been pushing the fda to 
move quickly on approving the drugs 
ganciclovir has been widely available to aids patients since 
november when the fda approved use of the drug for treatment of 
patients who were in the immediate sightthreatening stage of 
cytomegalovirus retinitis 
in early march the fda made the drug available to patients 
whose cytomegalovirus infection was in an early stage 
the advisory committee recommended against approval of the drug 
in october 1987 citing the need for more safety and efficacy data 
in recommending approval this time the panel also strongly 
urged that extensive followup studies be conducted after the drug 
is on the market the committee specifically recommended a study to 
determine the drugs proposed use in children and a study comparing 
ganciclovir with foscarnet another experimental drug for 
cytomegalovirus retinitis 
the panel also urged a study be conducted to determine whether 
ganciclovir can be used in patients who are receiving zidovudine 
or azt which has been shown to prolong survival of aids patients 
because the two drugs have similar toxicity they arent used 
together

six white candles each symbolizing a million 
lost lives were lit in the rotunda of the us capitol on tuesday 
in a memorial to the six million jews killed in the holocaust of 
world war ii 
our memories are of the millions who died and the many many 
others who though they survived carried with them throughout 
their remaining lives the permanent scars of the horrors they 
suffered said senate republican leader bob dole rkans 
himself a wounded veteran of the war 
with the division flags of the us military units that 
liberated the nazi concentration camps posted as sentinels in the 
background the eisenhower liberation medal was presented 
posthumously to general of the army omar n bradley who was 
present at the liberation of the ohrdruf concentration camp in 1945 
the medal was accepted by bradleys daughter mrs benjamin 
henry dorsey who said that when he returned from the war the first 
thing the general told his wife was about his visit to the camp 
saying he had been almost overcome by the stench of death 
nothing he had seen during the war had prepared him for this 
horror mrs dorsey said the memory of what he saw stayed with 
my father all his life 
the general died in 1981 
speakers at the ceremony noted that construction will begin next 
month of the united states holocaust museum near the mall leading 
from the capitol to the washington monument 
harvey m myerhoff chairman of the us holocaust memorial 
council said its purpose will be to tell the story of the 
victims in their own words with a few material remnants of their 
destroyed culture 
he issued an appeal for the donation by governments and 
individuals of artifacts of the holocaust period so that we can 
tell the story accurately and powerfully 
this museum will rise like a phoenix from the ashes to be a 
symbol of remembrance for all americans myerhoff said 
each of the six candles were lit by two people one a member of 
congress the other a survivor of the death camps 
later at a meeting called to present a progress report on fund 
raising for the museum senate majority leader george mitchell of 
maine said the new institution will be a symbol of a certain kind 
of hope hope that no other such memorial need ever be built 
anywhere on the earth

the united states has agreed to move 
its military headquarters in south korea from central seoul to 
rural areas the defense ministry announced tuesday 
under an agreement with south korea the headquarters and other 
us bases in central seoul will be moved by the mid1990s the 
ministry said 
south korea wants to relocate the bases to help meet growing 
demands for new offices and homes in the crowded capital the 
americans promised to move the bases if south korea provides 
comparable facilities elsewhere 
the first element of this plan calls for the early return of 
the 8th us army golf course during 1990 with the full relocation 
of the affected forces in the mid1990s the announcement said 
south korean officials said they probably will convert the 
course into a public park 
the seoul barracks have been headquarters of the 8th us army 
and other american forces since the united states backed south 
korea in the 195053 korean war 
us and south korean officials agree political and economic 
changes have caused south korea to reassess its relationship with 
the united states 
the two sides are negotiating the future of us bases in south 
korea and south korea wants to revise agreements to secure greater 
jurisdiction over the 43000 us soldiers stationed under a mutual 
defense pact 
a majority of south koreans support the presence of us 
soldiers in their country us officials say the forces will 
remain as long as their presence is desired by a majority of south 
koreans 
dissidents and radical students demand the immediate withdrawal 
of the us troops contending they hamper unification with 
communist north korea 
korea was divided in 1945 when us and soviet soldiers 
terminated japans colonial rule at the end of world war ii

american bar association officials took 
exception tuesday to a statement by attorney general dick 
thornburgh that the aba had agreed to stop assessing the political 
and ideological views of judicial nominees 
harold r tyler jr chairman of the abas standing committee on 
federal judiciary said no formal agreement with the bush 
administration has been reached on changing the wording of the 
screening panels guidelines 
tyler said the aba has expressed a willingness in informal 
discussions with thornburgh to change or delete a sentence from its 
guidelines which says political or ideological philosophy are 
not considered except to the extent they may bear upon the other 
factors 
i dont think we have reached any agreement on the exact 
language of the changes to be made tyler said 
even if the sentence is changed or deleted tyler said we 
dont think there has been any change at all in the way the 
committee will screen candidates for the federal bench 
earlier in the day thornburgh told a house committee that we 
are pleased that the american bar associations standing committee 
on the judiciary has seen fit to withdraw from an area not only 
contentious but in my view improper for their consideration that 
is to say the political and ideological views of the prospective 
nominees 
tyler also expressed puzzlement at thornburghs characterization 
of the role of robert b fiske jr in forging the agreement 
i dont know what to say about fiske i am in the peculiar 
position of being a friend of fiske 
tyler acknowledged he had discussed the issue and others with 
fiske the problem is i didnt realize i was in any 
negotiation tyler said 
the attorney generals statements crediting fiskes role in the 
discussions appeared to be an attempt to mollify conservative 
opposition to the new york lawyers anticipated nomination as 
deputy attorney general 
fiske whom thornburgh told the committee is his choice for the 
job has been criticized by conservatives for subverting reagan 
administration judicial nominees when he chaired the aba panel 
the attorney general told the house judiciary committee that 
largely through the efforts of robert fiske we have reached 
agreement with the aba that they will revert to their prior role 
in handling judicial assessments and will henceforth restrict 
their examination and assessment only to those areas where they 
have special expertise 
the attorney generals aide david runkel said fiske played a 
central role in mediating the issue and in getting the 
committee to agree to the points raised by the attorney general 
told of tylers statements runkel said it is our 
understanding based on personal discussions between aba leaders and 
top aides to the attorney general that the group had agreed to 
delete the phrase except to the extent they may bear upon other 
factors 
runkel said this understanding was based on an exchange of 
letters between the attorney general and the aba last week 
thornburgh said the abas judicial screening unit had agreed to 
restrict its review to judicial competence temper and integrity 
following the senate defeat of robert borks nomination to the 
supreme court the abas committee has been the object of 
criticism particularly but not exclusively from republicans 
that it improperly considers a nominees political views 
tyler told the senate judiciary committee in 1987 that four of 
the panels members voted against recommending bork because of his 
comparatively extreme views respecting constitutional 
principles 
but aba officials deny that ideology or politics are sole 
factors except insofar as they might influence judicial 
candidates temperament 
we have never gotten into political ideology so there is no 
change aba president robert raven said when told of 
thornburghs remarks 
thornburghs comments about fiske appeared to be aimed at 
mollifying sen gordon humphrey rnh and other conservatives 
who could make trouble for fiske if he is nominated for deputy 
attorney general 
in an april 17 letter to president bush humphrey charged when 
fiske chaired the aba standing committee there is evidence that 
that committees evaluations were tainted with ideological bias 
against conservative nominees selected by president reagan 
humphrey said that careful consideration be given the 
complaints raised against him

in a foiled plot to return exiled king zahir shah of afghanistan to 
power a broadcast report said tuesday

kings return by cutting off kandahar airport in southern 
afghanistan in a fierce battle the independent commercial network 
did not say when the battle took place 
in rome where the 74yearold king now lives his spokesman 
gen abdul wali said of the report its absolutely new to me i 
know nothing about it 
itv quoted the moslem rebels fighting afghanistans marxist 
government as saying the plan was discussed when british foreign 
secretary sir geoffrey howe met with them during his march visit to 
pakistan where major guerrilla groups are based 
it said the rebels also believe it was discussed during soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs trip to london last month and 
between howe and indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
a spokesman for the foreign office said we havent seen it 
the report ourselves so were not in a position to comment he 
spoke anonymously in keeping with british custom 
the kabul government and some of the moderate traditionalist 
rebel groups have tried to work out a role for the former monarch 
who has lived in rome since he was ousted in a 1973 coup 
but hardline rebel leaders reject any role for the king in 
future afghan governments the king has said he is willing to help 
end the fighting but has refused to serve in any marxistdominated

country musics popularity seems to be ebbing in 
the northeast where it was never very strong to begin with and 
you cant even find it on the fm dial anymore in boston 
wbos the only fm country music station in boston switched 
formats last week joining several other stations in the northeast 
that have hopped off the countrywestern hayride and onto an 
accelerating oldies bandwagon 
however the city still has two country stations on the am band 
the last boom in country music in new england was in 1981 after 
the release of urban cowboy the john travoltadebra winger 
flick that sent sales of bolo ties and oval belt buckles soaring 
the last year or couple of years theyve really been 
struggling to get big sales in country and western records said 
russ johnson president of tower records a sacramento 
califbased chain of 54 music stores 
nationally country is still the most popular radio format 
bolstered by president bushs wellpublicized fondness for the 
nashville sound and by the continuing appeal of crossover artists 
like emmy lou harris and kenny rogers 
there are 2421 country stations in the united states compared 
with 2325 adult contemporary stations the next biggest category 
according to the national association of broadcasters in washington 
but in new york and new england contemporary dominates country 
249 to 69 
several stations that still provide western fare for yankees 
said they can survive on their loyal base of listeners but will 
have to wait for the next boom to get rich 
everything in this business is cyclical and we know it will 
come back eventually said bill mccarthy general manager of 
wdlw one of two boston am stations sticking with the format 
wboss owner ackerley communications of seattle hired program 
director bob brooks from wjfkfm in washington to design the new 
album classics format for middle and upperclass listeners 
over age 25 the group advertisers most want to reach 
brooks declined to comment on the stations finances but said 
ackerley had concluded that country music was not commercially 
viable in this market 
not everyone agrees worcam in worcester had less than 250000 
in annual billings and was losing 20000 a month until it switched 
from top 40 to country 4 years ago now it is approaching 1 
million in billings and racking up solid profits said programming 
director and announcer dave ogara 
its a hip sound ogara said if youre a 40yearold man 
or woman and youre not into heavy metal but you want something 
more snappy than what you hear on the elevator then country music 
provides a good answer

a joint argentineiraqiegyptian project to 
produce mediumrange ballistic missiles has fallen far behind 
schedule due to allied export controls a top state department 
official said tuesday 
other officials said the missile known as condor 2 is several 
years away from being tested we expected it to be tested two 
years ago at least said one official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the official said part of the technology required for the 
missile which is being developed in argentina and bankrolled by 
iraq and egypt was withheld by the united states other parts were 
held back by us allies 
but we worry some technology did manage to get through the 
official said 
israeli officials have accused west german firms of helping the 
condor 2 which could eventually be used to carry nuclear or 
chemical warheads 
allen holmes assistant secretary of state told a senate armed 
services defense subcommittee that the condor 2 is far behind 
schedule and we believe this can be traced to problems in acquiring 
technology from signatories of the missile technology control 
regime mtcr 
the mtcr was established to limit the spread of missiles in the 
third world it includes the united states japan west germany 
britain france italy and canada 
ballistic missiles relatively expensive and relatively 
difficult to acquire are spread throughout the third world 
testified jim e hinds deputy assistant secretary of defense to 
the subcommittee on defense industry of the senate armed services 
committee 
cruise missiles are generally cheaper and will become more 
available as the hardware for large unmanned aircraft and more 
accurate guidance systems becomes increasingly widespread we will 
be faced with a new kind of threat 
ballistic missiles can be large and highly destructive cruise 
missiles are smaller and easier to hide 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said there is already enough 
tension in the middle east without the introduction of cruise 
missiles 
just in this area egypt iraq iran israel libya saudi 
arabia north and south yemen all have ballistic weapons 
capability he said this is a frightening situation 
holmes said the bush administration is trying to get the soviet 
union and china to cooperate in controlling the sale of missiles 
but he made plain he doesnt think such cooperation will solve the 
problem 
india israel and others have independent technological 
capability to construct large rockets he said 
deconcini said india is planning to test a new missile called 
the agni which could carry a nuclear warhead 1000 to 1500 miles 
india exploded a single atomic device in 1974 
deconcini suggested that countries getting us aid be told that 
such missiles cost billions which could be used for development

yasser arafat said tuesday the plo charter which 
calls for the destruction of israel is outdated and he favors a 
middle east peace settlement based on the existence of both israel 
and a palestinian state 
the plo chairman was asked about the charter provision during a 
television interview on the first day of an official visit to 
france and he replied 
i was elected on a political program which is founded on the 
basis of two states israel and palestine as for the charter 
there is an expression in french it is caduc caduc means 
outdated or void 
initial reaction from israel and from a major us jewish 
organization was that arafats statement was angled at public 
relations and changed nothing 
president francois mitterrand took the occasion of a 90minute 
meeting with arafat at the beginning of his twoday visit to 
express concern that the charter still contains a provision for 
israels destruction 
pierre mauroy leader of the governing socialist party met with 
arafat later and said he too brought up the charter 
he said the plo chief responded this text has existed for 
many years and is now outdated the leadership of the plo was 
elected with a program that includes recognition of israel and the 
abandonment of terrorism 
israel frequently cites the charter provision as reason it will 
not deal with the palestine liberation organization which it 
considers a terrorist organization last december the plo chief 
publicly renounced terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
arafat smiling and in uniform arrived in paris on tuesday to 
an official greeting just below that for a chief of state red 
carpets at the airport but no palestinian flags highlevel talks 
but no greeting on the tarmac by the head or government or state 
frances jewish community largely disapproved of the visit in 
the jewishdominated paris garment district shopkeepers and 
manufacturers set off their burglar alarms simultaneously for five 
minutes to show displeasure 
israeli activists protested outside the french consulate in 
jerusalem and the embassy in tel aviv 
tuesday is israels national day of mourning for the 6 million 
jewish victims of the nazis 
hubert vedrine spokesman for mitterrand read a statement 
implying the president urged arafat to drop the charter article 
about the destruction of israel 
during the meeting mr francois mitterrand noted that the 
continuation in force of the charter of the plo adopted in 1964 
was contrary to important points of the political program adopted 
by the palestine national council in algiers on nov 15 1988 and 
he believed things should be made clear the statement said 
acting as the plo legislature the council declared an 
independent palestinian state at the algiers meeting and implicitly 
recognized israel by accepting pertinent un resolutions in 
december arafat explicitly renounced terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist 
the statement read by the presidential spokesman said arafat was 
received in his position as head of the plo executive committee and 
in the context of the plos adoption of un resolutions 
concerning the recognition of the state of israel and its rights 
and to the renunciation by the plo of any form of terrorism 
avi pazner spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
commented in jerusalem we do not have to take with seriousness 
every utterance from the mouth of arafat he has a rich record of 
making false declarations for public relations 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman allon liel said as far as 
israel is concerned there still has not been a specific decision 
by the palestine national council to void the charter it still 
exists 
in new york chairman seymour d reich of the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations also remarked 
that only the palestine national council can change the plo charter 
by a twothirds vote at a special meeting and refused to do so 
in algiers 
reich called arafats statement meaningless and said it was 
clearly meant to give president mitterrand some comfort for 
embarrassing himself and france by receiving with honor the worlds 
ranking terrorist

gen manuel antonio noriega has been 
burning up the campaign trail even though he remains an issue not 
a candidate in sundays presidential elections 
noriega whose command of the panamanian defense forces gives 
him de facto control of panama is supporting a business associate 
carlos duque against an opposition coalition headed by guillermo 
endara 
he cannot stay impartial in this campaign said maj edgardo 
lopez a defense forces spokesman impartiality at this time 
would be irresponsibility on his part 
but noriega has made few joint appearances with his candidate 
instead he has been working on his own image with regular visits 
to hamlets labor unions and civic groups 
on tuesday noriega laid the cornerstone of a housing project 
for the poor in panama city a truck stopped by and served free 
beer to the estimated 200 people who showed up for the generals 
appearance 
noriega has survived all attempts to oust him from us 
economic sanctions to a failed coup last year he has retained his 
grip through government political parties and the defense forces 
whose members are the only visible authority in most rural towns 
he has also tried to build an image as a panamanian nationalist 
persecuted by the us government and as a champion of the poor 
in his visits to small towns noriega mingles with residents and 
listens to their complaints and requests for help with community 
projects many of those projects are then carried out by the local 
defense forces unit 
in his speeches noriega has said the 500 municipal councilmen 
to be elected sunday must be turned into a peoples power 
assembly 
noriega went from a close friend and associate of intelligence 
agencies in the united states to a wanted man last year after he 
was indicted in florida on drugtrafficking charges 
he denies the charges saying they stem from his refusal to 
cooperate with us government plans to train nicaraguan rebels 
here for an invasion of nicaragua 
former white house adviser adm john poindexter came to try to 
convince the general in 1985 said maj lopez a close associate 
of the general when he left he refused to shake noriegas hand 
and told him be prepared to face the consequences 
shortly thereafter lopez claimed the campaign against noriega 
began in the united states 
washington demanded noriegas ouster last year after he was 
indicted but president eric delvalle who had been handpicked by 
noriega was deposed when he tried to fire the general 
the us government imposed economic sanctions and the 
opposition has echoed demands that the general must leave 
noriega personally answered charges by opposition vice 
presidential candidate ricardo arias calderon the only time he got 
directly involved in the campaign 
arias had called noriega a nail in the side that had to be 
removed noriega said he would drive the nail deeper it became a 
government slogan 
arias also angered noriega and the military recently when he 
said publicly that a opposition government could live with any 
military leader except noriega it was seen as an invitation to a 
coup 
on april 21 noriega joined duque on a fourhour march at the 
head of the largest demonstration held by progovernment groups 
but the rally was not overtly political it was organized by the 
defense forces under the banner march of friends of the defense 
forces

lawmakers fed up with junk mail clogging 
fax machines nationwide on tuesday called for a federal ban on 
unsolicited ads transmitted to companies that say they dont want 
the materials 
not only are unsolicited fax transmissions costly and 
annoying but they are also an invasion of privacy said rep 
christopher shays rconn 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house energy and 
commerce telecommunications subcommittee introduced legislation 
tuesday that would require direct marketing firms and other 
advertisers to maintain lists of targeted customers who specify 
they do not want to receive fax advertisements 
this bill would return a measure of control to fax machine 
owners said markey who noted that advertisements range from 
real estate offerings to facsimile supplies 
the facsimile advertising regulation act also would require ad 
senders who buy new fax machines to use machines that identify the 
senders and provide the time of transmission and telephone numbers 
on each page 
the united states has experienced an explosion of fax machines 
in recent years an estimated 1 million were sold in 1987 15 
million last year and an anticipated 25 million machines this 
year according to the american facsimile association 
with that has come a proliferation of direct marketing groups 
using facsimile machines tying up already overused fax machines 
and limiting companies ability to transmit urgent documents in 
addition receiving companies have to pay for the paper used by 
unsolicited advertisements 
coupled with a computer or automatic dialer an advertisers 
fax machine can deliver tens of thousands of unsolicited messages a 
week to other fax machines across the country markey said 
receiving companies have little recourse while manufacturers 
continue to search for a design that would deny access to senders 
who do not know a special password 
but margaret gottlieb director of state government affairs at 
the direct marketing association which represents 3000 direct 
marketing firms denied that unsolicited fax advertisements are 
causing problems 
she said the federal communications commission has received only 
20 complaints about unsolicited fax transmissions compared to 
8000 complaints on telephone solicitations 
we really think that its premature for an issue to be 
legislated where theres no real problem she said 
gottlieb also argued against a federal ban on legal grounds 
saying it would violate 1st amendment guarantees of freedom of 
speech 
the question is can speech in this form be regulated or 
restricted completely she asked we would say an outright ban 
would be unconstitutional gottlieb said the association 
considers the markey bill an outright ban 
more than a dozen state legislatures are weighing similar 
measures including connecticut vermont new york new jersey 
maryland florida california washington new mexico illinois 
michigan ohio and pennsylvania all the measures were introduced 
for the first time this year gottlieb said 
none has been enacted although the maryland bill has been 
passed by the legislature and awaits action by the governor she 
added 
markeys subcommittee is expected to have a hearing on the 
federal fax bill along with other telemarketing issues 
congressional aides said

involuntary manslaughter and insurance fraud in a plea bargain with 
the prosecution 
dolores doyle 36 had been accused along with dr milos klvana 
of bungling highrisk outofhospital baby deliveries in which 
mothers should have been hospitalized 
mrs doyle who has been in jail for more than two years while 
awaiting trial was immediately sentenced to eight years in prison 
the sentence was stayed and she was to be released within 24 hours 
on five years probation according to deputy district attorney 
brian kelberg 
klvanas trial in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus 
between 1982 and 1986 will continue kelberg said it is in recess 
because klvana 47 is ill and undergoing medical tests in jail 
mrs doyle pleaded guilty to three counts of involuntary

unlawfully practicing medicine without a license and one count of 
conspiracy to practice medicine without a license 
mrs doyle had been charged in three of the eight baby deaths

coast guard commandant paul a yost on 
tuesday attacked exxons plan to clean up the alaskan oil spill 
consumers politicians and environmentalists expressed their anger 
in a oneday boycott exxon campaign 
yost the top federal official tracking the environmental 
disaster said exxons plan was poorly drafted and lacking in 
specifics but he stopped short of rejecting it saying he wanted 
to meet with exxon and state officials 
in washington consumer activist ralph nader said exxon should 
not be allowed to forget the spill and that a boycott would send 
the oil giant a message 
he and others blasted exxon for failing to be prepared for the 
spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled 
hundreds of miles of alaskas coast they also questioned 
subsequent increases in gas prices 
we are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil 
company that doesnt understand its responsibility to protect the 
environment massachusetts state sen carol amick told a boycott 
rally in boston 
in anchorage about 400 chanting and signwaving protesters 
rallied in front of exxons alaskan headquarters to urge a consumer 
boycott 
j edward surette jr executive director of the bay state 
gasoline retailers association in billerica mass said it was too 
early to assess the boycotts impact 
exxon spokeswoman sarah johnson said 10000 credit cards out of 
7 million have been cut up and returned to the company since the 
spill 
the oil companys cleanup strategy must gain yosts approval 
before being put into effect yost said he would make a decision on 
the proposal within a week 
the plan is very thin he told a news briefing theres 
not a lot of backup or substantiation it was quite light very 
thin there must have been a lot of figures there that i havent 
seen 
we are going to be done this summer yost said some 
beaches are going to be sparkling some beaches are going to be far 
from sparkling 
transportation secretary samuel skinner who is to make his 
second trip to alaska on wednesday as overall coordinator for the 
cleanup said he expected the size of the operation to double or 
triple by the end of the month 
in a speech at the national press club in washington skinner 
called the spill the most significant environmental disaster this 
nation has ever faced 
however he said the cleanup to be paid for by the oil 
industry could add 100 million to 500 million to alaskas 
economy which he said is more than the effect of the fishing 
industry 
exxon released a statement that called the boycott unjust exxon 
president william d stevens said the company was turning heaven 
and earth to set things right 
exxons 60page twopart revised strategy to cleanse some 364 
miles of alaskas coastline of the oil spilled march 24 by the 
tanker exxon valdez was released monday the tanker struck a reef 
25 miles from valdez spilling more than 10 million gallons of 
crude oil into prince william sound 
about 300 miles from the spill site an observer saw thousands 
of dead birds in a wide tidal basin in the hallo bay area 
we saw 2000 to 3000 dead birds you cant really tell 
what they are theyre one big blob of oil said ray bane 
superintendent of katmai national park about 275 miles southwest 
of valdez 
we found large oil debris washing and slopping up on our 
shores it was very bad bane said we saw eagles carrying 
oilcovered birds we saw one eagle so coated in oil that it 
couldnt fly 
state and federal officials said the focus of the cleanup is 
moving southwest following the drifting oil along the alaska 
peninsula through the shelikof strait east of kodiak island oil 
has tainted the coast at least as far as chignik 525 miles 
southwest of valdez 
the tanker is undergoing preliminary repairs in the sound and 
is to be moved next month to portland ore home of the only 
drydock on the west coast capable of handling the 987foot ship 
in its proposal exxon said it wants to burn or bury the sludge 
recovered in the cleanup which may require exemptions from alaska 
environmental law 
but bill lamoreaux the ranking state environmental officer at 
the spill said the laws would not be relaxed the general 
feeling is that we would expect that they would comply with the 
environmental laws lamoreaux said 
exxons plan also notes that 191 miles of coastline it describes 
as lightly oiled may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally 
by wind and water 
lamoreaux said when we talk about light oiling it doesnt 
mean it wont have a devastating effect on wildlife 
us sens james exon and bob kerrey both nebraska democrats 
called on us attorney general dick thornburgh to investigate 
potential price gouging by the oil industry they noted that gas 
prices in nebraska rose 20 percent from the first of march until 
midapril 
state attorneys general in washington oregon and idaho echoed 
the call 
since the exxon valdez accident gas prices have increased an 
average 10 percent nationally while the northwest saw surges as 
high as 25 percent in less than a month said marla rae executive 
assistant to oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer 
at a news conference in houston exxon president stevens said it 
showed shocking naivete to blame the price hikes on his company 
as you know he told reporters the market for petroleum 
products is set by thousands of markets thousands of independent 
dealers across the nation

supported governor baliles request for federal mediation 
we are ready to begin mediation under the auspices of the 
federal mediation and conciliation service and we will make every 
effort in that process to resolve the dispute odom said he also 
called on trumka to end the strike violence 
it is the continued violence which is distasteful dangerous 
and ultimately destructive of the mediation process odom said 
the injuries came during a rockthrowing confrontation along a 
road leading to the plant where coal from nearby mines is cleaned 
sorted and loaded into railroad cars 
according to miner larry stanley about 20 miners were standing 
in the rain watching coal trucks drive around a tree downed in the 
road when the driver of a fourwheeldrive escort vehicle rammed 
into the crowd 
he done his best to run over all he could said stanley 
he punched it 
but state police spokesman charles vaughn said troopers told him 
the injured strikers were in a parked vehicle that was hit by the 
coal truck as the driver attempted to flee a hailstorm of rocks 
thrown by miners 
two miners were taken to the russell county medical center in 
nearby lebanon said nursing supervisor debbie hall one was 
treated and released and the other was admitted for treatment of 
bruises 
odom said a passenger in the escort vehicle suffered a broken 
jaw while the driver of one of the trucks owned by the jamb mining 
co suffered serious cuts to the head both were being treated at 
local hospitals 
the 140 people arrested some of them miners wives sat in 
front of the moss no3 plants entrances to block coal trucks that 
were coming and going they were charged with trespassing said lt 
cf eaton of the state police 
after four busloads of arrested demonstrators were driven away 
others hit the road in their own cars to make the 15mile drive 
between moss no 3 and pittstons lambert fork mine in an attempt 
to slow coal trucks traveling between the two operations hudson 
said 
hudson estimated about 24 trucks carried coal into the plant 
which did not appear to be operating about 570 trucks usually make 
the trip each day he said 
about 1500 miners in virginia and west virginia are on strike 
miners worked at pittston for 14 months without a contract before 
calling the strike april 5 
strike leaders say pittston the nations 15th largest coal 
company and second biggest coal exporter has refused to take part 
in contract negotiations and violated labor laws both sides agree 
that wages are not a major part of the dispute

he said all members of congress have been asked for 
recommendations he added that officials will not know how much the 
antidrug program will cost until various agencies provide 
projections involving the various aspects 
no policy decisions were made at the meeting 
rep charles b rangel dny the house committee chairman 
said he had wanted assurances from bush that bennetts drug policy 
coordinating energy is not consumed by the push bennett 
announced for the capital city 
it was pointed out that when we were drafting the bill that 
created the drug coordinator position we hd considered him to 
lend his expertise to developing a domestic and foreign policy and 
not one for the district rangel said 
rangel avoided direct criticism of bennett and said he was 
satisfied that the administration has promised to have an 
international conference on drugs after the drug policy review is 
finished in early september 
rangel previously voiced objections that the administration was 
not taking enough of a global approach he said the state 
department should include drug policy in the governments foreign 
policy considerations with drugproducing countries 
the meeting ended with a pledge of cooperation on antidrug 
policy between the bush administration and congress the 
participants said 
rangel predicted there will be no sharp conflict as long as the 
administration keeps congress advised rather than waiting until a 
policy is complete and then going to congress to consult 
bennett said the governments effort in washington is not a 
substitute for a national strategy which is being developed by the 
government now but is part of the overall strategy he said he 
personally is spending little time on the washington effort 
leaving that to various government departments

students at the london school of economics failed 
to muster the twothirds majority they needed tuesday to oust the 
convicted murderer of a policeman as honorary president of their 
union 
school and government officials responded with anger to the 
vote which allows winston silcott to keep the honor given to him 
by the students on thursday the colleges governors said they were 
reviewing the schools annual 439000 grant to the union 
education secretary kenneth baker speaking to the house of 
commons called the vote shameful and despicable 
this is the loony left hijacking a great institution he 
added 
the students voted 530305 in favor of removing the jailed man 
from the post however that tally narrowly failed to meet the 
twothirds majority that would have overturned his election 
in a separate vote the students agreed to raise money to buy 
flowers for the family of the murder victim 
silcott 29 is one of three men jailed for life for hacking a 
policeman to death during a riot in a north london housing project 
in 1985 
amnesty international the human rights organization and lord 
gifford a leading jurist have investigated the case and cast 
doubt on the convictions 
silcott was nominated for the oneyear post by a member of the 
schools socialist labor club just 150 of the schools 4000 
students voted him in to show their belief he may have been wrongly 
convicted 
after the initial vote the colleges afrocaribbean society 
said the election of silcott who is black was deplorable 
insensitive and patronizing to the black race 
on tuesday heated exchanges broke out among students after 
their new vote amanda hart the general secretary of the student 
union said she had received several death threats after last 
weeks vote 
obviously i am scared but i will stand by the unions 
decision she said 
sir peter parker chairman of the schools governors termed the 
students decision to keep silcott as their honorary president 
appalling 
he said the school could not overturn the decision under the 
unions constitution 
but he added it is very embarrassing and damaging to the 
school 
whatever happens in the union nothing must happen there that 
will damage the worldwide reputation of this school he said 
the schools director indraprasad patel said he was seeking 
ways for the college to reverse the decision 
they have got to use every device in the rule book to overturn 
this disgraceful decision said sir marcus fox a lawmaker from 
the governing conservative party

the leftist sandinista government on 
tuesday rejected an opposition demand to negotiate for more 
legislative reforms to guarantee fair elections next year 
but both government and opposition representatives agreed to 
meet again and present their cases to a panel charged with 
evaluating whether the sandinistas have fulfilled promises made in 
regional pacts 
to accept negotiations is to accept that the government has 
not fulfilled its part of the el salvador accords rene nunez 
minister of the presidency said after a twohour meeting of the 
committee for national reconciliation 
the step previous to acknowledging this request is for an 
evaluation to be made on whether the el salvador accords have been 
met he added 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the archbishop of managua and 
president of the committee said the panel would meet again may 10 
to hear both sides and would then issue its evaluation 
nunez attended the meeting representing vice president sergio 
ramirez a committee member representing the sandinistas 
mauricio diaz leader of the popular social christian party and 
panels opposition representative presented the demand in a letter 
addressed to obando that he read to reporters 
president daniel ortega and the presidents of el salvador 
honduras costa rica and guatemala signed an agreement in el 
salvador feb 14 in which nicaragua promised electoral and other 
legal reforms to ensure fair general elections which ortega moved 
up by 10 months to feb 25 1990 
the sandinistacontrolled national assembly passed the reforms 
to electoral and news media laws in march but the opposition said 
their demands were ignored and that the laws passed give the 
sandinistas unfair advantage in balloting 
ortega is now on a 10country tour of western europe to seek 
financial and political support for nicaragua some of those 
governments have said more money to this central american country 
depends on the sandinistas fulfillment of regional peace accords 
at a news conference tuesday in athens greece ortega said he 
was trying to find a way to improve relations with the united 
states and declared we are not its enemy 
he expressed hope that president bush would change the policies 
toward nicaragua pursued by president ronald reagan 
bush must know that policy failed and that is why he should do 
something different he said 
nicaragua is suffering a severe economic crisis and badly needs 
foreign aid 
the government blames the crisis on eight years of war with the 
ussupported nicaraguan rebels known as contras a fouryear us 
economic blockade and devastation wrought by hurricane joan in 
october 
the opposition says the sandinistas managerial ineptness has 
had much to do with the countrys economic problems

a us proposal for resolving the 
internal nato dispute over shortrange nuclear missiles does not 
address west german demands for eastwest negotiations on the 
weapons an alliance official said tuesday 
in rome chancellor helmut kohl of west germany said he was open 
to reasonable compromise but wants talks to begin soon the 
united states and britain have rejected such negotiations 
kohl however expressed hope the allies could reach a unified 
position on the issue during a summit at the end of this month he 
said nato could negotiate on the battlefield weapons at the same 
time it discusses strategic arms conventional forces and chemical 
weapons 
the comments came after a meeting with premier ciriaco de mita 
who said italy supports linking the proposed talks on reducing the 
shortrange nuclear weapons to progress in conventional arms talks 
in paris foreign ministers roland dumas of france and 
hansdietrich genscher of west germany told reporters it is 
essential that a common position emerge from the nato summit 
most of the shortrange lance missiles are in west germany and 
a battle fought with such weapons would take place on its territory 
the nato official said the american plan suggests the 16member 
north atlantic treaty organization announce unilateral reductions 
in its shortrange nuclear arsenal and challenge the sovietled 
warsaw pact to meet those levels 
in london a british defense ministry policy paper said the 
soviets have modernized or replaced 95 percent of their shortrange 
nuclear missile systems in eastern europe in the past five years 
a separate fact sheet said the soviet union has been 
aggressively pursuing modernization of its shortrange forces and 
now has a 161 advantage over nato west of the ural mountains 
as described by the alliance official the us plan calls for 
reducing the number of weapons as part of a nato program of 
modernizing the lance missiles 
additional reductions in those arms would be linked to progress 
in eastwest negotiations in vienna on conventional forces in 
europe the official said 
a us official in washington confirmed the account but said 
several other options were under consideration he said one was 
resumption of research and development by west germany on a missile 
that could attack airfields and other targets now covered by the 
lance 
in bonn a german official said the german position remains 
clear and unchanged no decision on modernization until 1992 and 
prompt superpower talks on the shortrange missiles 
he dismissed the us suggestions as old stuff that people are 
using to divert the discussion from the real issues 
none of the three officials would let his name be used 
alliance members are seeking acceptable language on the weapons 
issue to write into the comprehensive concept a blueprint for nato 
strategy to be presented to the may 2930 summit at nato 
headquarters in brussels 
the nato official said the american plan pulls together several 
ideas that have been put forward in the alliance 
it would take reductions proposed by us gen john galvin nato 
supreme military commander in europe and challenge the soviets to 
meet them 
galvin has urged nato to upgrade the lance arguing that its 
modernization would permit a substantial reduction in nuclear 
artillery military analysts say the missile introduced in 1972 
will become obsolete in 1995 
it has a range of a little more than 60 miles which would be 
extended by modernization to more than 250 miles

genoa and a perennial candidate for the papacy died at home 
tuesday evening of a heart ailment an official at the diocesan 
chancellery said he was 82 
siri a cardinal since 1953 attended four conclaves the 
meetings in which popes are elected he was described as pope pius 
xiis choice to succeed him and in the last two conclaves was a 
leading votegetter in early balloting 
he was frequently depicted as an archconservative who opposed 
many of the reforms of pope john xxiii and who tried to block 
progressive initiatives during the vatican ii council held from 
196265 
but siri rejected the conservative label in a rare interview 
with the genoa newspaper il lavoro 
if i had to describe myself i would describe myself as an 
independent a man who walks alone and is not a member of any 
group he said 
a staunch anticommunist he nonetheless maintained working 
relations with the socialistcommunist alliance running genoa 
siri believed that laymen must obey the clergy and that the 
clergy had to make all possible efforts to be available anywhere 
at any time to laymen in genoa he made sure chaplains were on 
duty in major factories and he encouraged priests to celebrate 
mass in parishioners homes 
siri was born in genoa on may 20 1906 the son of a stevedore 
he attended the pontifical gregorian university where he earned a 
doctorate in theology 
ordained a priest at 22 his early career was mainly in the 
framework of catholic action a church organization that seeks to 
involve laymen in church activities 
he wrote several books the best known being theology for 
laymen 
siri was particularly remembered for his resourcefulness during 
world war ii when as auxiliary bishop of genoa he negotiated 
with nazi forces surrounding the city and met secretly with 
partisan leaders eventually arranging a nazi surrender that 
avoided further bombardment of the city 
he became archbishop of genoa in 1946 at the time of his 
resignation in july 1987 he was the last remaining active cardinal 
named by pope pius xii

whose parents said was abducted under circumstances almost 
identical to the disappearance of their other daughter three years 
ago officials said

by tracking dogs have been looking for heather sims since sunday 
police sgt rick mccain told a news conference

utah scientists who captured worldwide 
attention with their claim to have achieved cold nuclear fusion 
were probably fooled by faulty calculations researchers from two 
of the nations most prominent science institutes say 
researchers from both the massachusetts institute of technology 
and the california institute of technology are challenging the cold 
fusion claim made at the university of utah 
nathan lewis said monday that he and other caltech researchers 
conducted the most precise effort yet to duplicate the utah 
experiment and found that no fusion took place he said the utah 
scientists calculated a gain in heat but that precise measurements 
at caltech showed no such gain 
papers prepared by mit researchers for presentation today at the 
american physical society meeting also reported that verification 
experiments conducted over a fiveweek period failed to detect any 
fusion reaction

the aids crisis is giving a boost to sex 
education but is also crowding other critical sexual topics out of 
the curriculum concluded a nationwide survey released today 
forty states either support or require sex education said the 
study conducted by the alan guttmacher institute but it concluded 
that the current crisis orientation spawned by concern over 
aids has led educators to stress the negative outcomes of sex 
while often neglecting other important issues such as pregnancy 
prevention 
thus while birth control is dealt with by most school districts 
it is usually from the standpoint of disease rather than pregnancy 
prevention according to the report 
support for sex education is strong not only does a large 
majority of the american public support it but so do most state 
education agencies and large school districts said the study

life in the fast lane is screeching to a halt 
as too many cars jam too little concrete in americas motor mecca 
angelenos still love their cars but using them is pushing many to 
the braking point 
traffic planning took a wrong turn somewhere along the road 
drivers spend more time reading bumper stickers than getting where 
they want to go even a flat tire or passing shower can turn a 
commute into an hourslong ordeal 
and the onetime showcase of topdown freeway living now faces 
the nations worst traffic conditions and related ozone pollution 
it is as bad as it seems said dave roper of the california 
transportation department congestion is growing at 15 percent a 
year 
with southern californias population expanding 3 percent a year 
and vehicle mileage jumping 4 percent gridlock is changing the way 
people live 
the freeways have been operating reasonably well in a lot of 
areas but close to full roper said now additional travel is 
taking it over full and the break point has occurred 
although segments of metro rail and two regional light rail 
transit projects are under construction the citys status as the 
largest metropolitan region in the country without a mass transit 
system is assured for years 
the three systems will have 46 miles of track by 1993 the most 
optimistic estimates put daily ridership at 213000 passengers by 
the year 2000 in los angeles county today there are 25 million 
daily trips 97 percent in cars and the rest in buses thats in a 
county with 86 million residents 65 million registered vehicles 
and 504 miles of freeway 
i dont know whats going to help la congestion at this 
point but it cant hurt said cindy marion an executive in a 
law firm who faces a 40mile oneway commute and a 130amonth 
parking bill if it came to my neighborhood id take it she 
said of the planned subway 
some experts argue that the billions going to the hightech 
subway would be better spent on buses carpools and other traffic 
improvements 
but even with rail transit in place transportation planners 
face limited options and dwindling funds as they try to negotiate 
ideas through the regions hodgepodge of federal state regional 
and municipal agencies 
there isnt enough money there isnt enough land and the 
environmental constraints and financial constraints are such that 
its no longer possible to exclusively build our way out of the 
problem said bob remen chief deputy director for the california 
transportation commission 
the commission has selected 7 billion in transportation 
improvement projects statewide for the next five years but remen 
said the primary funding source the state gasoline tax is being 
eroded by inflation 
gov george deukmejian an antitax crusader tried to solve the 
problem in june with a 1 billion bond measure for highway 
improvements voters rejected the idea deukmejians fallback plan 
was a series of transportation summits with business labor 
government transit advocates and others 
on april 4 he called for a special election in november to let 
voters decide on a detailed 10year 20 billion transportation 
improvement plan that includes a 9centpergallon gasoline tax 
hike 
the governor however refused to firmly pledge his support for 
the plan and political analysts show little enthusiasm for a 
costly special election when voter turnout is usually low but 
antitax sentiment usually high 
funding problems aside transportation planners agree that 
costly capital projects such as doubledecking freeways are 
financially prohibitive and politically impractical if not 
impossible 
as a result transportation officials are concentrating on 
wringing more efficiency out of an overloaded system 
what weve had to do in the city is focus our efforts on 
traffic management options and also on demand said s edwin 
rowe general manager of the los angeles city department of 
transportation 
remen said state officials are considering not just projects to 
expand capacity but techniques to improve freeway efficiency and 
landuse management to encourage commuters to live closer to their 
jobs its going to require everything he said its going 
to require all means available 
hanging over the entire process is a threatened crackdown of the 
federal clean air act which orders the us environmental 
protection agency and regional state agencies to meet federal air 
quality standards 
drastic measures already have been enacted by the regional south 
coast air quality management district which has power to enforce 
air quality standards and more stringent steps are being taken 
under state legislation were authorized to mandate companies 
to offer ridesharing programs and weve done that said tom 
eichhorn a district spokesman we can regulate truck traffic 
during peak hours and we can require owners of fleet vehicles 
to start buying vehicles that burn clean fuels 
another regional agency the southern california association of 
governments has been working to improve air quality by studying 
land use regulations and by developing a regional mobility plan 
but the task is daunting as reflected by the executive summary 
of a draft of the air quality management plan released by scag in 
september the 20year plan is estimated to cost 42 billion a 
heartstopping aspect is that its goal is to restore the degree of 
mobility motorists had in 1984 
meanwhile drivers are coping with worsening traffic in a 
variety of ways on any given morning motorists can be seen using 
cellular phones applying makeup shaving eating breakfast 
talking back to language tapes and flirting 
in fact there are several dating services specializing in 
roadway romance including drive me wild of simi valley which uses 
bumper stickers to facilitate matchmaking

this symbol of urban sprawl and americas car 
addiction is at long last inking a few mass transit lines on its 
tangled road map 
theyre ripping up the downtown streets to put in the first 44 
miles of a subway and trollylike light rail lines are being built 
between downtown and long beach and across a patchwork of south 
side neighborhoods 
thats a dramatic departure from tradition for a city that 
stands alone among major us metropolises in having no rail 
transit whatsoever 
heres a look at the projects under construction 
metro rail a 44mile 12 billion subway scheduled to open 
in 1993 will start at union station in the northeast pass under 
the civic center and financial district and terminate near 
macarthur park a 13mile extension into the san fernando valley 
suburbs is tentatively scheduled to be done in 1998 it will be 
financed 55 percent from the federal government 17 percent from 
the state 14 percent from a sales tax surcharge 11 percent from 
merchant assessments and 3 percent from the city 
long beachlos angeles light rail a 752 million 215mile 
trolly style line mostly on existing tracks and powered by overhead 
wires is meant for both commuters and as a local train for those in 
largely lowincome neighborhoods it will be funded through sales 
tax 
norwalkel segundo light rail a 400 million 195mile

to most of us its an innocuous strip of blue 
that separates the united states and europe on the world map or 
that tedious nothingness that takes hours to go by outside the 
window of an airplane 
but the atlantic ocean a shifting churning lifegiving 
living character is the star of an ambitious new threepart 
series atlantic realm beginning tonight on pbs 
the first episode island arks examines the origins of the 
ocean from its beginnings some 165 million years ago as little 
more than a river separating two continents before they began to 
drift apart 
the series offers scientific and historical data on the 
evolution of the ocean but is thankfully taken up more with superb 
photography of wildlife the ocean has spawned than by maps and 
charts one of the highlights of the first episode is the birth of 
a litter of lemon sharks in the shallows near the bahamas an event 
never before photographed in the wild 
life above the sea is featured in the first episode especially 
the myriad sea birds that live on islands off the coast of africa 
where the delicate ebb and flow of the ecology is easily observed 
such as the environmental upheaval caused when mariners introduced 
domesticated cats to one small island 
the series is engrossing and lovely to watch despite 
occasionally overwrought narrative such this sample from a segment 
on iceland solidified lava is one of the raw materials of the 
earth forged in fire its stern but ready to accept the life that 
pioneers its surface below the atlantic marine organisms would 
exploit this new territory but here laid bare to the winds of the 
air lichens mosses and herbs have taken hold along this broad and 
rolling swath of the salt that is part of the midatlantic ridge 
phew narrator marty robinson manages to read such passages with 
aplomb if not a breath 
the series a joint production of wttw in chicago and the bbc 
was created by rod redfern who wrote the book the making of a 
continent on which a previous sixpart pbs television series was 
based 
i was looking for something to follow the making of a 
continent said redfern in a statement about atlantic realm 
and the obvious thing was the making of an ocean redferns 
book on the atlantic is due out soon 
next weeks episode ocean of light focuses on the effects 
of the winds that brush the top of ocean and the life forms that 
live near the surface including whales the cameras go the 
antarctic for firsttime pictures of the underwater ballet of 
weddell seals later they capture the flow of translucent animals 
that drift along the surface of the open ocean 
into the abyss is the series big finish with cameras 
diving a halfmile below the oceans surface to examine the strange 
creatures that dwell in the lightless depths the cameras also take 
viewers to the longest submerged mountain range on earth and take a 
peek inside an underwater volcano

economic ideologies with their code words and 
slogans may persist in the abstract long after they have been 
questioned and sometimes even abandoned in practice 
it happens in every system but nowhere more dramatically at the 
moment than in eastern europe where the centrally planned 
economies of the soviet union poland and hungary have been 
flirting with private enterprise 
in the soviet union a fifth of the nations 50000 farms have 
begun leasing land and equipment to individuals and families 
poland has authorized 23000 private coops in hungary the 
budapest stock market has been reopened 
less abrupt changes are under way in bulgaria and in the soviet 
republics of estonia lithuania and latvia where national identity 
has remained vitally alive there has been pressure for the 
legalization of private property 
privatization is a worldwide trend says the reason foundation 
which exists to promote private enterprise in 1988 it says 
governments shifted 43 billion of functions and responsibilities 
to the private sector 
when that happens in the united states which sold conrail for 
16 billion in 1987 or in britain where the british airport 
authority was privatized it isnt startling news because such 
things have been proposed for years 
eastern europe where governments scorned private enterprise 
since world war ii is another matter seeking to raise production 
through individual initiative some startling changes have 
occurred these are excerpts from reasons 1988 report 
soviet union 
in a reversal after 50 years of collectivized agriculture the 
soviet union began allowing individual farmers and groups of 
farmers to rent land from the state in a move that essentially 
marks a return to family farming 
legislation was enacted allowing farmers to buy tractors trucks 
and other socalled means of production that formerly could be 
acquired only through state enterprises farmers were permitted to 
hire workers as long as they met wage levels in state enterprises 
the government also authorized the sale of stateowned homes to 
tenants apartments can be sold on receipt of 50 percent of the 
units value with the remainder to be paid over 10 years 
poland 
commencing in 1988 some 23000 private cooperatives were given 
permission to operate though only half had become operative by the 
end of the year they include restaurants butcher shops shoe 
repair shops and plumbing services 
in another broadening of reforms polish enterprises can employ 
up to 50 workers per shift formerly private enterprises had been 
limited to only 10 workers per shift 
poland also is removing import duties on some western goods and 
will allow foreign investors to own 100 percent of some polish 
enterprises theres a downside a graduated income tax takes 90 
percent on upper incomes 
hungary 
in addition to the opening of the budapest stock market in 1988 
private stock ownership is now possible previously only state 
banks and cooperatives could purchase shares in the 40 stateowned 
companies that have issued stock 
private individuals also may form limited companies these 
companies can employ as many as 500 workers just last year more 
than 100 joint ventures were set up with foreigners 
such changes in eastern europe might be phases or experiments 
but the motivation for them contains an ideological message 
underlying all of them is the belief that if unleashed individual 
initiative produces wondrous things

suppose they gave the tony awards and nobody won 
after the worst season for broadway musicals in years the 1989 
tony nominations will be announced monday and the possible 
contenders for top musical honors include only six shows they are 
jerome robbins broadway black and blue chu chem and 
starmites as well as such alreadyclosed flops as legs 
diamond carrie and welcome to the club 
jerome robbins broadway would seem to be a shooin for a 
best musical nomination as well as the leading contending for the 
top prize which carries a lot of clout at the box office 
the robbins musical a collection of numbers from such shows as 
west side story gypsy fiddler on the roof and other 
hits may not need the boost as much as the other musicals still 
running its already doing near capacity business and has a 
healthy advance 
chu chem billed as the first chinesejewish musical has 
been limping along at the box office despite an extensive 
television ad campaign by its producer and composer mitch leigh 
black and blue a celebration of blues singing and tap dancing 
has done better business although it has not approached the 
sellout status of the robbins show 
starmites is another iffy proposition the spaceage 
comicstrip musical was panned by most major critics except for a 
favorable review in the new york times 
the picture is brighter for the best play category which has 
several respectable candidates for nominations the heavy favorite 
is wendy wassersteins the heidi chronicles which already has 
captured the pulitzer prize as well as the outer critics circle 
award 
other likely candidates include shirley valentine willy 
russells onewoman play starring pauline collins lend me a 
tenor a farce by ken ludwig ghetto by joshua sobel and 
two plays that have already closed eastern standard by 
richard greenberg and michael wellers spoils of war 
bill irwins largely new york a comedy with no dialogue 
might also be a possibility for best play although the tony 
administration committee has not yet ruled if it will be eligible 
there will be also be an absence of big names in the acting 
category categories only one possibility mikhail baryshnikov who 
plays kafkas tormented clerk in metamorphosis has superstar 
status best acting nominations could go to philip bosco and victor 
garber of lend me a tenor bill irwin in largely new york 
and peter friedman of the heidi chronicles and if they want a 
name recognized by television audiences the committee could 
nominate ed asner of born yesterday 
the competition for best actress may be the most lively likely 
candidates include pauline collins of shirley valentine last 
years winner joan allen for the heidi chronicles kate 
nelligan for the alreadyshuttered spoils of war and madeline 
kahn who plays billie dawn in the revival of born yesterday 
the situation gets more desperate when you consider other 
musical categories after jason alexander the genial emcee of 
jerome robbins broadway and peter allens critically panned 
portrayal of the title character in legs diamond there were no 
real star roles for men on broadway this season 
for best actress in a musical the nominating committee could 
reach back to betty buckley as the demented mother in longgone 
carrie marilyn sokol the angry wife in welcome to the 
club or the trio of ladies ruth brown linda hopkins and carrie 
smith who star in black and blue 
to save embarrassment several musical categories might be 
eliminated during the 198485 season the year that brought 
theatergoers such shows as grind leader of the pack and 
quilters there were no nominations for best actor and actress 
in a musical as well as for choreography 
the awards show will be broadcast sunday june 4 on cbstv with 
angela lansbury serving as host for the third straight year

the musically chic irish basking in the 
glory of the grammywinning u2 rock band are exporting an eclectic 
mix of talent typified by the distinctive styles of three female 
singers 
from the hightech lyricism of enya to the seductive quasijazz 
of mary coughlan and the punkedged punch of sinead oconnor irish 
music has gone far beyond fiddles folksiness and lilting brogues 
i dont think its anything to be feeling guilty about that 
were not all carrying green leprechauns on our backs when we go on 
the road said coughlan who sings about adultery religious 
tyranny and urban chaos 
the propulsion of dublins u2 by the 1985 live aid music 
extravaganza to the top of the rock music heap helped open the door 
for other irish favorites seeking world stardom 
this used to be a culture of begrudgers successful people 
always had to leave because they couldnt live with the smallness 
the conservatism that has changed changed forever says eamon 
dunphy author of unforgettable fire the story of u2 
disc jockey paul mckenna of londons capitol radio says irish 
pop musics appeal is its originality and thoughtfulness 
it is a backlash against designer pop he said in an 
interview radio listeners hear that and say wow thats the 
way music is meant to sound its predominantly music that is 
fresh more natural less imageconscious 
u2s triumph has fueled a multimilliondollar domestic music 
industry which enables those irish who succeed on the world stage 
to keep roots at home recording in dozens of newly built music 
studios 
despite a time magazine cover and inspiring millions of 
youngsters with their highly contemporary songs about drug abuse 
and racism the fourman group remains based in the irish capital 
so do pop balladeer chris de burgh the van morrisonstyle 
mysticism of hothouse flowers and emerging rock bands such as aslam 
and something happens 
windmill lane dublins leading music studio handles the home 
stars plus such major overseas talents as def leppard status quo 
elvis costello steve winwood and terence trent darby 
irish artists used to have to beat down agents doors in london 
and new york now a concert at the baggot inn dublins grimy 
atmospheric music mecca may attract half a dozen british and us 
talent scouts 
the spotlight on ireland also has brought irish traditional 
music to a wider recordbuying audience but often fused with rock 
jazz and other influences by artists as varied as paul brady enya 
the pogues and davy spillane 
spillane mixes the rhythms of celtic reels rock and bluegrass 
using uillean bagpipes and boghran drums with saxophone and 
electric rhythm sections the londonirish pogues combine 
traditional acoustics with postpunk irreverence 
enya draws on traditional and classical styles in her album 
watermark an electronic soundscape that has sold more than 2 
million copies worldwide one track orinoco flow topped the 
british pop singles chart in november 
her crystalline voice is often layered as many as 100 times 
with harmonies and counterpoint melodies and wrapped in synthesizer 
swathes of instrumentals varying from clarinet and tin whistle to 
burundi drums 
enya 27 short for eithne ni bhraonain started out with 
clannad a folkrock family band famous for its electrifying theme 
music for an adult tv version of robin hood 
she works from a backyard studio in the dublin suburb of artane 
with sound recordist nicky ryan and his wife roma who writes 
lyrics sung in english gaelic and latin she shrugs off 
descriptions of her music as celtic new age transcendental 
or commercialized irish mysticism 
there isnt a category for it enya said in an interview 
for me personally its got every title thats possible 
sinead oconnor 22 who also defies pigeonholing has won 
plaudits for her selfproduced debut album the lion and the 
cobra a largely autobiographical exploration of adolescence her 
trademarks are a shaved head and a harrowing defiant voice that 
expresses emotions in tonal leaps and swerves 
coughlan 32 who sings soul with a galway accent has built a 
solid reputation across northern europe through three albums and 
frequent touring 
the likes of u2 and sinead and myself work hard to build up a 
live following first she said from her new base of howth a 
fishing village overlooking dublin bay i dont think any of 
those bands that are successful in the charts have ever gigged in 
their life its purely magazines videos and disco 
theres always been pop music around but i dont think its 
ever been as bad anything thats good thats been in the charts in 
the past five years has been rereleased oldies 
coughlan sings about prostitution junkies alcohol abuse 
relationships theyre all political in their own way in my 
land is too green she pokes fun at the dominance of the roman 
catholic church in a state that outlaws divorce and exports its 
problems for foreign solutions a reference to irish women who 
have to go to england to have abortions 
the northern ireland conflict still provides fodder for 
songwriters but the antibritish republican ballad tradition 
carried on by christy moore is now contrasted with tragic 
nonsectarian interpretations 
the pogues championing the innocence of 10 irish people jailed 
for irish republican army bombings in britain wrote of being 
irish in the wrong place at the wrong time the song was banned 
last year by some british radio stations which feared it might be 
interpreted as giving comfort to the ira 
in sunday bloody sunday u2s lead singer bono laments 
the trenches dug within our hearts and mothers children 
brothers sisters torn apart 
up here we sacrifice our children to feed the wornout 
dreams of yesterday echoes northern irelandborn paul brady in 
his folksoft rock album back to the center 
ireland is able to hold its head up now as much as anywhere 
else said dave fanning irelands foremost rock deejay 
u2 deserve full praise because they opened the door he 
said they put ireland on the map the success the 
stayingathome the doingithere helps other people to realize we 
can do it as well

before agreeing to star in say anything 
john cusack insisted on a few changes 
first of all the script 
the essence was there but it needed to be fleshed out said 
the 22yearold actor who portrays lloyd dobler a downtoearth 
high school senior in love with the class valedictorian ione skye 
i saw things inherent in the structure but i said if you 
want me to do the film im going have to do this this and this 
im not going to do this this and this 
he writerdirector cameron crowe said great bring it on 
i was very flattered and grateful they trusted me enough 
then came the wardrobe 
im at the point where i costume myself i went in and met 
with the costume designer who to me is someone who tries to find 
out what im going for and helps me along that way this costume 
designer had a whole rack full of clothes there were vneck 
sweaters and corduroy pants 
i said i will never wear anything on this rack anything 
like this rack go get me a clash tshirt go get met me a 
trenchcoat get me hats different hightop sneakers 
finally there was the matter of crowe who has written 
extensively about rock music and authored the bestselling account 
of teenage life fast times at ridgemont high later made into 
a feature film cusack hesitated to work with a firsttime director 
but was impressed by crowes enthusiasm 
he was really persistent he flew out to chicago and handed me 
a copy of catcher in the rye he said youre 21 years old 
youre never going to be able to play a younger guy again why not 
end it with a positive note 
cusack who has also starred in the sure thing eight men 
out and tapeheads was determined to make lloyd believeable 
wanting to avoid another angry young man such as sean penn or the 
so hip and so cute teenagers portrayed by michael j fox and 
kirk cameron 
heres a guy who knows whats going on in the world whos 
emotionally political cusack said of his character 
hes a pretty smart guy who just doesnt have the skills to 
express himself he doesnt buy into the hype he doesnt believe 
the hype hes not negative hes not going to be a negative force 
in the world he cant live his life in a negative way 
we cusack and crowe had a great rapport about what was right 
for lloyd by the end of the film he would start a sentence and i 
would finish it 
cusack the brother of actress joan cusack working girl 
broadcast news and son of documentary filmamker richard 
cusack grew up in chicago and was just 9 when he began taking 
classes at the piven theatre workshop in evanston ill he had 
minor roles in the movies sixteen candles and class before 
being cast by director rob reiner for the lead in the sure 
thing 
i was amped just ready to go i wasnt smart enough to be 
nervous i was just excited to be working with rob recalled 
cusack who would later work with reiner on stand by me 
i just really dug his work process it was real similar to 
mine rob is this guy who directs by saying match my passion 
there was great energy on the set 
but cusack went on to appear in a series of poorly received 
films including better off dead and one crazy summer he 
became frustrated from reading an endless number of bad scripts 
and admitted that his career was in the pits 
i remember reading the script for some kind of wonderful 
they wanted me do that at the end of the film the guy takes all 
this college money to buy a jet a cadillac a helicopter he 
completely woos this girl with material possessions and symbols of 
wealth what kind of story is that 
he was happier making films such as tapeheads a parody of 
the music video business that starred cusack and his friend tim 
robbins as a pair of sleazy producers 
we were so sick of these runofthe mill scripts same 
characters same plots not funny not fresh somebody sent me this 
script called tapeheads and we saw the name and said lets do 
it 
it sounded really sick he said it was a black comedy on 
the music business and i got to finally play a guy who wasnt a 
good guy who would sell out his mother for the right price

editors note when movie stars headed for the wideopen spaces 
to film their westerns they often stayed at the el rancho hotel in 
new mexico but just as the westerns faded in popularity so did 
the old hotel now its trying for a comeback counting on 
nostalgia for the golden age of hollywood and a cowboy motif

its a roster of the stars of yesteryear 
with names like errol flynn humphrey bogart john wayne maria 
montez tom mix virginia mayo ronald reagan lucille ball 
the names adorn the doors of guest rooms throughout the el 
rancho hotel which owes its birth to hollywood 
the hotel was built in 1937 by the brother of movie magnate dw 
griffith to house the actors and actresses who were then flocking 
to the wideopen spaces and red bluffs of northwestern new mexico 
to make movies mostly westerns 
on famed route 66 the hotel played host to the famous the 
nearfamous and the oncefamous for decades but as westerns faded 
so did el rancho 
it went through a series of owners finally ending up on the 
auction block in a bankruptcy foreclosure 50 years after its grand 
opening 
gallup businessman armand ortega bought the onetime showplace 
for 500000 and spent about another 500000 restoring it says 
his daughter amelia ortega crowther managerbookkeeper for el 
rancho 
the hotel which looks a bit like an oversized ranch house 
reopened in may 1988 its original motto of charm of yesterday 
convenience of tomorrow intact in neon above the entrance 
the hotels huge brickfloored twostory lobby was restored to 
its western flavor a lariat surrounding the mirror behind the 
checkin counter silver dollars embedded in the counter itself 
the lobbys centerpiece is a huge arched rock and brick 
fireplace into which the original mason cut a cardplayers diamond 
club spade and heart appropriate since there once was open 
gambling at the big hotel 
near the lobby on a wooden bench and a chair made of steer 
horns sit wooden indians the lobby walls and railings are 
festooned with big game trophies navajo rugs and indian and 
western art 
a rustic curving double staircase the carpeted steps made of 
logs sawed in half flows gracefully up either side of the 
fireplace to a wide balcony that encircles the main room 
the walls of the balcony are lined with blackandwhite 
photographs there are scenes from movies filmed in the area such 
as texas ranger starring fred macmurray jean parker and lloyd 
nolan ambush with robert taylor the streets of laredo 
starring william holden and william bendix rocky mountain 
with errol flynn colorado territory with joel mccrea 
pursued starring robert mitchum 
there are photographs dozens of them of stars such as the 
marx brothers alan ladd humphrey bogart katharine hepburn kirk 
douglas lew ayres john russell of the television show the 
lawman robert taylor and the fondas henry and jane across the 
balcony from each other 
some photographs are autographed often to martin hanks the 
hotels first manager 
at one end of the balcony is a picture of clair gurley a 
salesman he was the first person to stay at el rancho when it 
opened in 1937 ms crowther says that when ortega reopened the 
hotel in 1988 he invited gurley back and charged him the 
original 5anight price 
todays rates range from 32 to 49 
the threestory hotel still serviced by its original 
handcranked elevator has 70 rooms each room is labeled with the 
name of a star who research shows probably stayed in that very 
room ms crowther says 
however theres at least one exception 
ronald reagan stayed at el rancho a couple of times while making 
a movie and filming death valley days for television but ms 
crowther says todays ronald reagan room is one that probably isnt 
labeled accurately 
el rancho originally had a hierarchy of rooms the best ones in 
an area by themselves one of the best is now the reagan room but 
that probably has more to do with him being president than being a 
star 
id guess ronald reagan never stayed in the ronald reagan room 
because he wasnt an a star ms crowther says he was a 
bmovie star 
the hotel keeps jelly beans reagans favorite snack in the 
room and if someone orders the ronald reagan sandwich from the 
dining room that too comes with jelly beans 
there are rooms with the names of jimmy stewart robert taylor 
groucho marx wc fields doris day jack benny 
ortega ms crowther says once joked about ordering a pay phone 
for the jack benny room in keeping with the running gag about the 
stars stinginess 
ms crowther says guests often ask for a room named for a 
particular star 
the choices also include the names of lee marvin lee remick 
claude akins betty grable rosalind russell burt lancaster 
elizabeth scott william holden irene manning 
ms crowther admits she doesnt know who all the stars are 
irene manning for instance 
the rooms have been refurbished to closetooriginal state ms 
crowther says one of el ranchos previous owners had paneled them 
but ortega had the paneling ripped out and the walls replastered 
white 
he also had the rooms furnished with rusticlooking furniture 
such as beds with wagonwheel headboards 
several rooms have the original furniture the light oak oiled 
after being rescued from under a thick coating of chocolate brown 
paint 
all the rooms have ceiling fans since airconditioning was not 
put in when the hotel was originally built half a century ago 
it does have airconditioning now so guests no longer must go 
out onto the roof to get a breath of cool air as they did in the 
old days 
among the photographs displayed on the secondfloor balcony is 
one showing katharine hepburn and spencer tracy stars of the sea 
of grass sitting on el ranchos roof with the movies director 
who is not identified 
the guest rooms now have tiny bathrooms added in an early 
renovation except for rooms for big stars the original hotel did 
not have bathrooms in each room but rather had baths down the 
hall ms crowther says 
since its reopening el rancho mostly has played host to 
ordinary folk but there have been a couple of stars 
michael gross of televisions family ties ate at the hotels 
dining room one day and goldie hawn stayed at el rancho last 
summer on her way from santa fe to california 
she was very nice ms crowther says she stood in front 
of the fireplace and let people take pictures and signed 
autographs

in a move that may test the limits of federal 
regulation of the telephone industry pacific telesis group hopes 
to become the first of the old bell system companies to buy into 
cable tv 
the nations cable system operators vow to fight pacifics 
plans fearing that the phone companies far greater financial 
resources will muscle aside competition and concerned that 
telephone companies may if allowed by the federal government to 
buy in be able within a few years to provide phone and television 
service through a single cable 
the initial battleground is chicago pacific announced last 
month it intends to buy an interest worth more than 100 million 
in a system serving 97000 homes in the windy city 
before that can happen though pacific must win approval from 
the federal communications commission and from the federal judge 
who oversees operations of the seven regional telephone companies 
that were created with the breakup of the bell system in 1984 
the seven baby bells have been barred by us districe judge 
harold greene from generating information services including cable 
tv programming out of fear they could use their vast financial 
resources to compete unfairly 
but the regional companies including pacific are allowed to 
enter the cable television business outside their telephone service 
areas if they can show they will not use their monopoly powers to 
impede competition in the cable market they enter 
pacific announced april 20 it had reached a tentative agreement 
to buy through a series of transactions a 68 percent interest in 
the chicago system now owned by group w the system would be 
purchased for 198 million by an affiliate of prime cable of 
austin texas prime would operate the system which serves 97000 
customers in a franchise area of 410000 homes 
one telecommunications industry analyst berge ayvazian of 
bostons yankee group said the chicago deal had been very 
carefully structured to test the limits of greenes 
restrictions on the baby bells operatons 
this is a breakthrough for them if they get away with it he 
added 
the justice department has already approved pacifics plans the 
company intends to ask greene for a waiver this summer 
the bell companies particularly pacific have been pecking away 
at the fringes of the cable business while hoping that someday they 
will be free to compete fully in cable tv 
pacific must persuade greene that a waiver would not impede the 
operations and profit potential of other chicago cable systems 
they stand a pretty good chance of getting the waiver said 
henry geller a former federal communications commission official 
and director of duke universitys center for public policy 
research theyre clearly going to argue they dont have a 
monopoly in chicago 
an association representing cable operators will argue before 
greene that granting pacific a waiver would substantially undercut 
his 1984 decree 
we support the consent decree which is premised on 
justifiable fears of telephone companies using their huge monopoly 
phone business to crosssubsidize cable operations and otherwise 
impede competiton said james mooney president of the national 
cable television association an industry trade group 
one of the baby bells has a gross revenue base that is as 
large as the entire cable television industry said stephen 
effros president of the community antenna television association 
another cable operators trade group 
besides concerns that the phone companies very size could 
radically alter their industry cable operators fear that the 
fiberoptic cables being installed by phone companies to replace 
copper wires could one day eliminate the need for a separate cable 
to deliver television signals to customers 
telephone companies are replacing thousands of miles of wire 
each year with fiber cables those pencilthin bundles of glass 
strands capable of transmitting enormous amounts of information on 
beams of laser light 
if extended directly to customers homes a single fiberoptic 
cable could at the same time carry television signals telephone 
calls and computer data 
southwestern bell and sammons cable are testing new cable 
technology in the fort worth texas area and the fcc last week 
allowed a nonbell company general telephone of california to 
construct a system using both conventional coaxial cable made of 
copper and fiberoptic cable in cerritos calif a los angeles 
suburb that also gets its phone service from the gte subsidiary 
cable industry critics say that it will cost telephone companies 
500 billion to completely convert to fiber optics and that selling 
tv programming would be a fine way to make up the expense 
raymond w smith of bell atlantic another of the baby bells 
told broadcasters last week in las vegas that only by allowing 
telephone companies to provide video programming will a full fiber 
optic network with the cables extending to individual homes be 
completed in this century 
in my view only one factor could accelerate this timetable 
dramatically allowing telephone companies to cover the costs of 
fibertothehome with revenues from a range of services 
including television transmission 
many in congress and at the fcc think it is time to unleash the 
telephone companies to compete in the information service and 
telecommunications equipmentmanufacturing businesses 
members of congress concerned about such things such as reps 
john dingell dmich al swift dwash and tom tauke riowa 
want to relieve greene of his oversight of the bell companies last 
month they introduced legislation to lift those two restraints on 
the bell companies 
while the bill would not let the bell companies into cable tv 
there is a growing feeling that the existing cable tv industry 
could stand a little competition 
fcc commissioner patricia diaz dennis has said repeatedly that 
the federal government should now establish rules to assure that 
fiberoptic phone lines carry a cornucopia of voice video and 
data into the nations homes 
the fcc began relaxing its restrictions on phone companies 
entry into cable television last july when it voted to consider 
recommending to congress that the companies be allowed into cable 
tv even in the regions where they provide phone service 
the commission also suggested it would try to encourge telephone 
companies to enter cable tv if congress fails to act by broadly 
defining good cause for waivers from its existing regulations 
the fcc said it probably would grant waivers if telephone 
companies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use those 
cables to sell video programs too 
with this writing on the wall many cable tv executives are 
looking to involve telephone companies as partners in cable systems 
outside telephone company service areas 
therea major split within the cable industry on that issue 
effros said frankly i dont think many cable operators would 
disagree that we could live with telephone companies outside 
their service areas 
their money is as green as anyone elses and the amounts of 
money needed to continually improve cable tv is massive so it 
would be nice to get a new influx of money effros said

johnson controls inc of milwaukee has agreed to 
buy the security and maintenance unit of pan am corp the 
companies announced monday 
the sale price in cash wont be disclosed until the sale is 
completed sometime during the second quarter the companies said 
monday the transaction is subject to regulatory approval 
pan am strapped by losses from pan american world airways its 
main subsidiary put its pan am world services inc unit up for 
sale in january the subsidiary based in cape canaveral fla 
markets security maintenance and other services to government 
agencies the military and other airlines 
world services with about 10000 employees at over 100 
locations worldwide had revenue of 600 million in 1988 financial 
analysts estimate the units potential sale value at around 200 
million 
johnson controls provides operations services on a contract 
basis to airports sports arenas schools hospitals and other 
facilities the company which had revenue of 31 billion in 1988 
also makes heating and cooling controls automotive seating 
batteries and plastics 
pan ams northeast shuttle service and pan am express a 
commuter airline also are considered profitable operations but 
they are more closely tied to pan ams main airline business than 
is the world services unit 
some analysts hav wondered whether the world services move 
represents a new pan am strategy to sell performing assets rather 
than strip away parts of lossmaking world airways such as routes 
and airport facilities 
pan am officials say the sale of world services is designed to 
help finance the companys planned investments for the near future 
those investments include 61 million for improvements at world 
airways main terminal at kennedy international airport in new 
york 25 million for refurbishing aircraft interiors 20 million 
for improvements in information systems and other programs 
according to pan am 
rival eastern airlines announced plans thursday to lease 14 
boeing 727200s to pan ams world airways for 966 million over

industry analysts expect ogilvy group inc to 
fight a takeover from londonbased wpp group plc but ultimately 
they expect wpp will succeed in creating an ad agency holding 
company that will vie for the title of worlds largest 
wall street reacted enthsiastically monday to the 730 million 
wpp bid disclosed sunday bidding up the price of ogilvys stock 
more that 17 and surpassing wpps bid 
wpp chief executive martin sorrell has proposed to pay 45 a 
share for the parent of the advertising agency ogilvy amp mather 
worldwide 
ogilvys stock soared 1712 a share to close at 4912 monday 
in overthecounter trading 
if the deal goes through it would be the biggest takeover of an 
advertising holding firm ever breaking the record set by wpps 
purchase of jwt group inc parent of j walter thompson co two 
years ago 
ogilvy meanwhile says it wants to remain independent 
mr sorrells proposal letter to ogilvy appears primarily to 
be a sales pitch which suffers from serious flaws in business 
logic ogilvy chairman kenneth roman said in a statement sunday 
analysts said the british firm would likely win the fight 
theres a real possibility that sorrell will succeed said 
fred anschel an advertising industry analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc adding that many shareholders would find wpps 
allcash offer hard to turn down 
they have some defenses said john dougherty an analyst 
with county natwest usa but i dont think they have enough to 
resist a bid that i think ultimately will go into the mid50s 
the deal would create an advertising and marketing holding 
company that would rival britains saatchi amp saatchi plc as the 
worlds largest 
wpp had international billings last year of 78 billion 
ranking it third among the worlds ad agency holding companies 
according to advertising age a trade publication ogilvy with 
billings of 57 billion placed fifth 
combined their billings would have about equaled saatchi amp 
saatchis 135 billion 
an industry source said wpp wants to become the best 
multinational marketing service and not necessarly the biggest 
but wpp may yet achieve that distinction ogilvy would be the 
latest entry on a lengthy list of advertising and marketing firms 
bought by wpp 
in the two years since it picked up jwt wpp has purchased 
einson freeman a sales promotion agency anspach grossman portugal 
inc a corporate identity consultant reese communications and 
target systems two us companies specializing in public affairs 
and direct mail marketing stewart mccoll associates plc a british 
design firm and mendoza dillon amp associados inc an advertising 
firm specializing in the hispanic market 
earlier this year wpp agreed to buy parg public affairs 
resource group of toronto one of canadas largest public affairs 
consulting and public opinion research firms 
wpps acquisitive strategy is much like saatchi amp saatchis 
which comes as no surprise to industry watchers because sorrell was 
the architect of much of that firms expansion including the 
purchase of ted bates worldwide for a thenrecord 450 million in 
1986 
analysts said wpps latest proposal was more a result of 
sorrells expansion plans rather than any problems at ogilvy 
ogilvy seems to fit in pretty well with martin sorrells 
goals said vicki weber an analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
this is not a company that was begging to be taken over 
said anschel the dean witter analyst the biggest knock 
against them ogilvy is their earings have been basically flat 
since 1985 but he said it has a very fine brandname in the 
advertising business 
for sorrell expansion has not been without trouble his 
purchase of jwt which included the advertising agency lord geller 
federico einstein inc led top lord geller executives to defect 
and start their own company thetwo sides are fighting in court 
wpps major clients include ford motor co quaker oats co 
kellogg co eastman kodak co and the kraft operations of philip 
morris cos inc 
ogilvys major clients include american express co polaroid 
corp seagram co ltd the shell oil company and unilever the 
anglodutch consumer products company 
ogilvy earned 329 million last year on revenue of 838 
million wpp earned 381 million on revenues of 9747 million

strikebound eastern airlines downplaying 
proposals from suitors interested in buying the entire carrier 
indicated it was speeding ahead with its plan to sell 18 billion 
in assets separately 
in a filing submitted monday to federal bankruptcy court in new 
york eastern disclosed it had firm sales contracts or received 
acceptable offers for about 11 billion of its assets 
those assets include easterns northeast shuttle service 
already slated to be sold to developer donald trump for 365 
million airport gates in philadelphia and routes between that city 
and others said eastern spokesman robin matell he declined to 
elaborate on the nonshuttle deals 
another 300 million in asset sales are subject to serious 
discussion where reasonable offers have been received while an 
additional 400 million in sales are being discussed with 
responsible and interested parties eastern said in the filing 
the miamibased airline said it expects to announce several 
deals in the coming weeks 
all such sales must be approved by the federal bankruptcy court 
overseeing the airlines chapter 11 reorganization under protection 
from creditors 
easterns machinists pilots and flight attendants unions which 
have been off the job since march 4 have opposed sales of the 
airlines assets us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland has 
pushed to have the company sold in its entirety and has scheduled a 
wednesday hearing for arguments over why such an auction of the 
whole airline including the shuttle should not take place 
in its filing eastern said it recently received an offer from 
billionaire hotel executive jay pritzker to buy all of the airline 
eastern described the offer as at best a generalized expression 
of interest 
on friday a statement was issued on behalf of a group of 
unidentified new york financial institutions that indicated the 
consortium was developing a proposal under which it might pay 1 
billion for eastern if the deal included assets sold by the airline 
since its 1986 acquisition by texas air corp 
an attorney for the group later said the statement was issued in 
error but the group actually was formulating a proposal 
eastern in its filing countered that the group lacks the 
financial resources to consummate any purchase and indeed has 
only the vaguest hope of obtaining such resources 
takeover strategist carl c icahn who owns trans world airlines 
inc has expressed interest and was expected to submit a formal 
bid in the near future 
eastern plans to restructure to operate at onethird its 
prestrike size and raise 18 billion to pay debts by selling 
planes airport gates and landing slots at unspecified locations 
as a first step the airline announced plans thursday to lease 
14 boeing 727200s to pan american world airways for 966 million 
over five years 
all transactions and any sale of the entire airline must be 
approved by us bankruptcy court where eastern filed for 
protection from creditors on march 9 however texas air cant be 
compelled under the bankruptcy laws to sell eastern in its entirety 
if it does not want to 
eastern management has the exclusive right until early july to 
present a reorganization plan for court approval 
easterns machinists union struck the carrier on march 4 after a 
long wage dispute they were joined by pilots and flight 
attendants virtually grounding the airline and forcing it to seek 
bankruptcy protection five days later 
eastern said monday its nonunion employees have delivered 
petitions with more than 6200 signatures to the bankruptcy court 
expressing their support for the plan to rebuild as a smaller 
carrier

as a crippling strike at eastern airlines heads 
into its third month the carriers unions say they remain solid 
although some employees union and management are bailing out 
karen ceremsak a company spokeswoman cant estimate how many 
of easterns 12000 nonunion employees have taken other jobs since 
the march 4 strike by the companys machinists pilots and flight 
attendants virtually grounded the airline 
as more time passes more people will go on to other things 
she said 
the machinists union estimates that departures among easterns 
17000 union workers number only in the hundreds although nearly 
all of the remaining union employees still refuse to work for the 
airline 
eastern has cut back to 10 percent of prestrike operations has 
about 4500 active employees and has entered chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization and protection from creditors 
parent texas air corp plans to rebuild eastern as a smaller 
airline without the unions but the unions are optimistic that new 
ownership for the entire airline still can be found even though 
eastern insists that none of the offers it has received are viable 
wally haber general chairman of the machinists union chuckled 
recently when reminded of his march 4 prediction that the strike 
would last only 10 days easterns march 9 bankruptcy filing 
threw a monkey wrench into the whole system putting the 
company into the slowmoving procedures of bankruptcy court he 
said 
haber noting that few of the 8500 eastern machinists were 
around for the last eastern strike for 42 days in 1966 said 
ive been amazed at the resolve the way the people are really 
sticking together 
united airlines boeing corp and several other companies have 
been wooing eastern mechanics haber said but the union estimates 
departures have been only in the hundreds he said about onethird 
of the union membership is working at some type of job but most 
are temporary or part time 
officials at the pilots union whose members would sacrifice 
seniority that determines their salaries and flight assignments if 
they switched airlines say there have been few departures flight 
attendants union officials say many of their members have taken 
other jobs but would prefer to return o eastern if possible 
strikers have been aided somewhat by their own union benefits 
machinists receive 100 a week in union strike benefits and the 
pilots 2400 a month and from elsewhere in organized labor the 
aflcio has about 1 million for eastern strikers with the 
financiallystrapped flight attendants union set to receive 
twothirds of that amount 
thousands of dollars worth of groceries and frozen meats have 
been donated to the unions haber said and south florida farmers 
have invited crews of strikers to come to their fields for all the 
vegetables they could pick 
the economic situation is different now than it was 23 years 
ago haber said over half of our people have two jobs in the 
family 
many nonunion employees who have no strike benefits cant 
afford to be as patient especially given the uncertainty of what 
the ultimate resolution of the strike will be 
karen madsen former manager of eastern benefits compensation 
moved march 20 to southeast banks for a similar job offering more 
money and more security 
i hope they make it and in a way id sort of like to be 
there said ms madsen after 19 years theres still a place 
in my heart for eastern but i couldnt afford to take the 
financial risk and i got the opportunity to go with a good 
company 
among pilots easterns generally are some of industrys most 
experienced the pilots union says but although other major 
carriers are anxious to hire experienced pilots the eastern 
veterans are reluctant to trade their seniority for new jobs 
elsewhere

and owner of golenberg amp co of cleveland of telling outsiders 
that management was considering a debtfinanced takeover of the 
company before the plan was announced three years ago 
the sec said it was the first time an individual was fined for 
violations of insider trading regulations without having made any 
trades 
seven people or their clients eventually earned a total of 
735000 by trading in revco stock the sec said federal 
securities laws prohibit trading stocks based on nonpublic 
information 
the defendants have agreed to repay their profits and nearly 1 
million in fines without admitting or denying guilt the sec said 
the sec said golenberg agreed to pay a 470000 penalty and 
consented to an sec order barring him from acting as a broker 
dealer or investment adviser for at least four years 
the twinsburgbased revco was purchased through a managementled 
takeover known as a leveraged buyout that was financed mostly with 
borrowed money the company filed for bankruptcy protection last 
july because it couldnt pay its 15 billion debt no other large 
leveraged buyout has run into such serious debt trouble 
kathleen obert a revco spokeswoman said golenberg is a revco 
board member because of his stock holdings amounting to 150000 
revco shares as of last may 28 
revco was the biggest deal of my life he said in a 
statement after the sec filed the complaint it was constantly on 
my mind something i lived and breathed regrettably i talked 
about it with a few people who did not have any right to know what 
was going on i now realize the seriousness of that lapse of 
judgment 
in the same complaint the sec accused golenberg of providing 
information to steve s saltzman of cleveland about the proposed 
merger of two smaller firms magnetics international inc of maple 
heights and hk porter inc saltzman made 6850 buying and 
selling 2000 shares of magnetics common stock and made 27326 
purchasing and selling revco stock the sec said saltzman agreed 
to repay the money and an equal fine 
i should have known better golenberg said of the portion of 
the complaint dealing with magnetics 
ms obert declined to comment on golenbergs settlement saying 
thats entirely between the sec and mr golenberg she said the 
company has prepared a fiveyear business plan for reorganization 
but it has not been filed with the federal bankruptcy court yet 
the other investors accused in the complaint of profiting from 
inside information about the revco buyout are 
bernard shavitz of woodcliff lake nj a business associate

of lightly oiled beach may be left untouched to be cleansed by the

the only gasoline station in the small 
town of echo ore has closed and the same fate may be in store 
for a string of others a result of tougher federal regulations on 
underground storage tanks 
dennis gronquist arlington mayor and texaco franchise owner 
said there soon may be no stations in the 160 miles between the 
eastern oregon communities of arlington and john day 
he said station owners and consumers are just beginning to feel 
the effects of us environmental protection agency regulations 
intended to prevent gasoline leaks from underground storage tanks 
the epa estimates 43 percent of all service stations in the 
nation with underground tanks will close within the first five 
years the policies are in effect 
gasoline station owners are being required to upgrade tanks 
install leakage detection devices and obtain leakage accident 
insurance estimates of the cost range from 12000 to 50000 per 
station not including insurance 
were going to lose all our service stations because nobody 
can afford it said herb wright owner of wrights chevrolet in 
fossil 
but ronald moyer a state department of environmental quality 
tank specialist noted that leakage from underground tanks has 
sometimes resulted in buildings being blown up or in contamination 
of a citys water supply 
entire communities could be left without water if somebodys 
tank leaked moyer said 
dave barnett who owns the only station in ione ore said 
congress and epa are taking the wrong approach 
i think these people are kind of like the ostrich they hide 
their heads in the sand and think its going to go away but it 
isnt he said 
the town needs this service barnett added 
in order to continue operating barnett said hed have to spend 
about 12000 to install leakage detection devices on his two 
underground gasoline storage tanks 
barnett also would be required to hold a 1 million insurance 
policy 
quite frankly its not good its going to close a lot of 
stations barnett said of the regulations 
i think if i had more money id drop everything i was doing 
and go to washington dc and hound them until they hated me

fairchild industries inc says the 
decision by the defense logistics agency to suspend purchases from 
the companys voishan fastener division was an unnecessary 
precaution 
in a statement monday fairchild said it was surprised by the 
dlas decision to suspend voishan from new government contracts 
because of allegations that the divisions employees had falsified 
testing data on aerospace fasteners 
the suspension does not affect fairchilds other federal 
contracts 
fairchild stock fell 1 monday on the new york stock exchange 
closing at 16 thats 1 below the price offered by the carlyle 
group which is seeking to buy the company 
david rubenstein managing partner of the carlyle group 
declined to comment on whether the suspension would affect the 
groups interest in fairchild were studying it carefully he 
said 
voishan fastener sales to the government accounted for less 
than 2 percent of fairchilds total 1988 revenues however a 
source quoted today by the washington post said the suspension 
could scare away commercial customers 
the suspension comes in the wake of a widespread pentagon 
crackdown on faulty bolts several congressional and pentagon 
investigations have revealed that bad fasteners in all types of 
military hardware and vehicles is a major problem 
the pentagon said former and current employees have told 
investigators that they falsified test data when testing equipment 
did not work when tests could not be accomplished in the allotted 
time and when parts failed tests but management decided to approve 
them anyway 
fairchild said that shortly after learning of the allegations 
it placed three voishan employees on administrative leave and 
conducted an extensive review of inventories fairchild said that 
no parts failure were found by fairchild or its customers

u s west communications inc has begun enforcing a 
new smoking ban in its 2900 buildings including about 400 offices 
in colorado 
company officials said monday that smoking will no longer be 
allowed in any of its buildings nor at sites it rents for employee 
meetings 
the policy is designed to protect the health of its 57500 phone 
company employees in 14 western states as well as eliminate the 
cost of providing smoking lounges company officials said 
at the same time u s west is offering to reimburse employees up 
to 150 if they enroll in programs to end smoking 
about 26 percent of the companys employees smoke said u s west 
spokeswoman debbie thomas 
u s west communications the telephone services unit of u s 
west inc of englewood employes nearly 12000 workers in 
colorado including some 9800 in the denver metropolitan area 
alone 
besides company facilities in colorado the ban went into effect 
monday at locations in montana idaho wyoming utah new mexico 
and arizona smoking already was prohibited at company sites in the 
seven other states where us west operates 
the bottom line is theres so much evidence that secondary 
smoke is harmful to those who dont smoke that this is the way to 
go thomas said 
the ban drew immediate criticism from the communications workers 
of america a spokesman said the ban could become an issue in talks 
on a new labor contract scheduled to begin next month 
mark belkin a spokesman for communications workers of america 
local 7777 which represents 6500 u s west workers is concerned 
the ban will be enforced unequally between hourly workers and 
corporate officers 
we hope to monitor the situation to make sure the company 
enforced things in an equitable fashion belkin said the 
question is whether theyre concerned about productivity or whether 
its a means to control peoples individual choices 
all the corporate concern failed to convince diehard smokers of 
the danger 
clustered in twos and threes monday sitting outside the 
downtown denver building monday a contingent of employees grabbed 
a puff 
i like to smoke and ill quit when i want to not because of 
some rule said jan charles a 16year employee of the phone 
company and a 17year smoker

the nations purchasing managers predict inflation 
will total 38 percent this year down from the 5 percent they 
reported last year a trade association said today

forecast by the national association of purchasing management 
which represents 30000 purchasing agents around the country the 
group is holding its annual conference in boston this week 
fortyfive percent of the members surveyed said they expected 
their capital expenditures to rise in 1989 while 24 percent said 
they expected their expenditures to drop below the 1988 level 
although this ration of almost 2to1 predicts a strong year 
for capital expenditures the increase over 1988 is not expected to 
be as great as 1988 was over 1987 the forecast said 
most of the purchasers said they were paying higher prices in 
midapril than at the end of last year the forecast said the 
purchasers saw prices increase an average of 29 percent in the 
first 4 months of this year but expect inflation to be more 
moderate during the rest of the year

build a museum for his 250 million art collection rather than 
donate it to the los angeles county museum of art

under an agreement settling a classaction 
lawsuit participants in united airlines frequent flier program 
can regain credits lost when rules of the plan were changed for 
part of 1987 a lawyer says 
its a deceptive business practice when customers have 
followed the rules and accrued the necessary mileage but cannot 
collect the awards promised that originally led them to join and 
participate in the program in the first place said the 
plaintiffs chicago attorney gilbert w gordon under such 
programs accumulated miles flown can be cashed in for free flights 
or service upgrades 
the lawsuit filed in march 1987 alleged that united was unfair 
when it increased mileage requirements for some awards in january 
1987 most original rules were reinstated in july of that year a 
united spokesman said the old rules were restored due to consumer 
complaints and competitive reasons not because of the lawsuit 
in mailings last week united provided applications for those 
who believe they may be entitled to more program credits 
under the 1987 changes for example mileage required to earn 
one free firstclass ticket to hawaii was raised to 60000 from 
50000 
the settlement to the cook county circuit court case was reached 
in december 1988 said united spokeswoman sara dornacker who 
speculated that attorneys may have delayed the announcement because 
of similar lawsuits against two other carriers american and delta 
airlines 
the 1987 united changes applied to new members as well as to 
qualified members who had already accumulated the necessary mileage 
for such awards under the old program 
lawyers estimate that only a small portion of uniteds 5 million 
mileage plus program members would be eligible for extra credit 
the resolution depends on each individual case ms 
dornacker said no direct compensation is being made to the 
flyers in cash 
attorney michael j freed said lawsuits against american and 
delta are still in cook county circuit court freed contends that 
changes in the frequent flyers programs by american and delta 
constitute a breach of contract and a violation of the illinois law 
gordon said american has set up limits on the number of people 
who can claim free trips on some flights while delta has designed 
such capacity restrictions but hasnt instituted them 
spokeswomen for delta and american said they couldnt comment on 
pending litigation

officials meeting at the 21st annual offshore 
technology conference said oil companies can do little to end the 
price fluctuations that have crippled the industry but can 
influence their own costs of doing business 
energy industry executives must remember that oil is a 
commodity subject to the same pressures as other commodities 
said thomas c theobold chairman of chicagobased continental 
bank a major industry lender as a lender to your industry we 
can only predict volatility 
theobold representing the financial sector monday on a panel 
kicking off the weeklong conference said oil companies must build 
in more economic flexibility 
i know it isnt a lot of fun but we might as well admit its 
happening he said 
joining him on the keynote panel were h laurance fuller 
president of amoco corp of chicago jose napoleon lista vice 
minister of energy and mines for venezuela and john c crosbie 
canadian minister for international trade 
the conference is primarily a technical gathering of some 25000 
engineers and executives involved in offshore oil and gas 
exploration and production more than 15000 people attended monday 
lista the panels representative of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries by virtue of his countrys membership 
in the cartel said opec countries are concerned about the recent 
sharp increases in the price of oil 
he complained that the energy consuming countries too often view 
opec members as wearing black hats noting that the opec 
charter allowed members to receive a fair return on their oil 
maybe we can wear the white hats too he said none of 
the happenings that have caused this jump in oil prices is under 
the control of opec 
theres nothing we can do about the spill he said 
referring to the recent oil spill in alaska theres nothing we 
can do about the excessive use of gasoline in europe and the united 
states 
if the opec countries are allowed by the rest of the world 
opec will keep the rest of the world supplied with oil we want the 
consuming countries to benefit as much as producing countries from 
the resource nature has given us 
although lista said he thought opec would keep prices at a level 
where everyone will be happy fuller said there are indications 
several members of the cartel will push for higher production 
quotas when the current 18 perbarrel price agreement expires 
later this summer 
the underlying facts of the world supply and demand argue 
against a strong price recovery he said in general the 
industry outlook is restrained 
crosbie said he hoped canada would be viewed as an attractive 
place for investment and that the countrys oil and gas industry 
showed great promise but he downplayed the significance of energy 
price forecasts 
he noted that when forecasts in the early 1980s pointed to 
65perbarrel oil he and his party backed a 30centpergallon 
gasoline tax that canadian voters found abhorrent 
the unpopular stance was reflected in the partys lack of 
success in the next election crosbie said 
fuller said amoco sees the possibility that the domestic oil rig 
count 751 as of monday could double within five years 
while an improvement this increase is not enough to reverse 
domestic production decline he said 
while oil companies cannot control prices fuller said they can 
address their own costs

more than 100 days into his presidency its 
time for george bush to make good on his promise to renew fiveyear 
quotas on steel imports says the outgoing chairman of the nations 
largest steelmaker 
usx corp chairman david m roderick said monday steelmakers 
count 225 sponsors in the house and 56 in the senate a majority 
in both houses for legislation authorizing the president to renew 
the quotas called voluntary restraint agreements 
this should encourage the bush administration to publicly 
announce its plan to extend the vras he told shareholders at 
their annual meeting 
bush said late in the 1988 presidential campaign that he would 
renew the program but has not said how long the quotas might 
continue or what products and countries might be covered 
we havent heard from his lips roderick said 
the quotas are scheduled to expire sept 30 the threemonth 
delay between orders and shipments could make the domestic market 
uncertain and vulnerable to foreign predators he said 
if we dont have a clear definition of the vras and a clear 
definition of when theyre going to be extended youre going to 
find a lot of people in here trying to dump steel he said at a 
news conference before the meeting 
dumping is selling at illegally low prices such as below the 
cost of production 
roderick said usx nearly has finished preparing trade suits 
against steelmakers in japan germany brazil and most other major 
steel exporting nations the suits will be filed if there is any 
gap in the quota program 
usx said 65 percent of its customers support renewal 25 percent 
to 30 percent were indifferent and only 5 percent oppose it 
the bush administration should release terms of the renewal by 
may congress should act by june and negotiations with nations on 
their individual quotas should begin by july 1 he said 
their extension for a fiveyear period is essential to the 
continuing turnaround of american steelmaking roderick said 
failure to extend them would cast a cloud over our steel units 
prosperity 
the quotas were intended to limit foreign steel to around 20 
percent of the us market protecting hardpressed american 
producers from losing customers to predatory pricing by 
governmentsubsidized producers overseas the quotas fell short of 
the goal in the first few years but are now on target 
meanwhile roderick announced plans to spend 240 million to 
further modernize its largest plant at gary ind the keystone of 
the improvements will be a continuous slab caster designed to shape 
16 million tons of molten steel directly into slabs using less 
energy and less time and leaving fewer blemishes in the steel 
the new caster planned to begin operating in mid1991 will 
eliminate 400 to 500 of the 7500 jobs at the gary works roderick 
said attrition will ease the effect of the cuts

a us supreme court decision to review the 
proposed partial merger of detroits daily newspapers spread gloom 
at the detroit free press but competitors at the detroit news 
cheered the ruling 
the high courts announcement monday that it will hear arguments 
on the proposed joint operating agreement set the stage for its 
first review of the 19yearold newspaper preservation act a 
decision isnt expected until next year 
analysts said the wait will force knightridder inc to 
determine how much longer it can absorb losses from its detroit 
free press a major knightridder stockholder the university of 
california said it will reconsider its investment 
after being briefed at a staff meeting free press employees 
trudged back to work at telephones and computer terminals for 
feature writer neal rubin and others the decision means more 
uncertainty 
weve been punched around so many times its like ok well 
waltz with it again rubin said 
a few blocks away at gannett co incs news most employees 
oppose a joa said reporter louis mleczko also president of local 
22 of the newspaper guild of detroit 
the mood today was just ebullient cheering and applause in 
the newsroom mleczko said 
he also said the union will press for new contracts talks amid 
uncertainty over the joa more than 3000 union employees at news 
and free press have been without contract wage increases since 1986 
the newspapers have sought since may 1986 to cut costs by 
merging business advertising and production departments while 
maintaining separate news and editorial staffs they would split 
profits and losses equally for most of the 100year agreement 
the papers said the free press was in danger of failing gannett 
said it would spend as much as needed to force the 157 yearold 
free press out of business knightridder said without the 
agreement it would close the free press 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii approved the agreement in 
august 1988 but challenges by the michigan citizens for an 
independent press and the washingtonbased advocacy group public 
citizen delayed implementation 
no stay is in effect and the newspapers would have the option 
of merging while awaiting the supreme courts decision 
knightridders president and chief executive officer james k 
batten said the organization continues to believe strongly in 
the fairness and justice of our case on behalf of a joa in 
detroit and will decide in coming days what to do next 
clearly from their point of view they would like to 
eliminate the cash drain of the free press said john s reidy 
communications industry analyst with drexel burnham lambert in new 
york 
on the other hand if they wait it out then theyll have half 
interest in a joa which will earn considerably more for them than 
the loss last year so it is a tough decision 
there are some second thoughts said leslie gallaugher who 
manages 21 million shares of knightridder stock owned by the 
university of california were going to take a hard look at our 
investment in knightridder 
the free press lost 185 million in 1988 knightridder said in 
recent court filings gannett has released no annual loss figures 
but has said the 115 yearold news lost 6495 million from 1980 
through 1987 
it would be my hope that we would stay the course free 
press managing editor heath meriwether said he acknowledged 
employees are discouraged 
gannett through spokeswoman sheila gibbons said it was 
reviewing the decision and would not comment 
the michigan citizens group argued that the newspapers losses 
resulted from struggles to force each other out of business rather 
than conditions inherent in the detroit market 
we think that the tendency of these types of monopolistic 
arrangements is negative said state sen john kelly a leader of 
the group 
the newspaper guild first opposed the agreement though it 
dropped opposition in 1988 when knightridder said a joa would mean 
closing the free press 
the newspapers say closing the free press would cost 2200 jobs 
while a joint operating agreement would mean a total of 600 to 800 
jobs lost at the two papers 
gannett based in arlington va is the nations largest 
newspaper publishing group knightridder headquartered in miami 
is the second largest

the controversial practice of dual trading on the 
futures market will be assessed by an outside specialist the 
chicago board of trade announced 
the exchange said monday that it has hired economist sanford j 
grossman of princeton university to study the practice in 
conjunction with the board of trades own review of trading 
practices 
the announcement comes three months after disclosure of a 
federal investigation into suspected fraud that is said to involve 
dual trading at the board of trade and the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
dual trading allows traders to buy or sell futures contracts for 
themselves and customers at the same time dual trading isnt 
illegal but critics call it a conflict of interest and say it 
encourages fraud by unscrupulous traders who trade their own 
accounts first profiting at the expense of their customers 
the chicago board of trade has dedicated itself to evaluating 
all aspects of trading practices and market surveillance said 
karsten mahlmann chairman of the exchange commissioning this 
study is another step in this process 
meanwhile at a meeting monday merc officials told more than 
200 exchange members that they have no choice but to reform trading 
practices or else invite government intervention 
in order to achieve the right to continued selfregulation we 
must act responsibly said leo melamed chairman of the mercs 
executive committee 
merc officials leaving the meeting also said they expect a 
referendum will be held on the most controversial aspects of the 
reform package proposed april 19 by a special exchange committee 
the chicago suntimes reported today among proposals is a ban on 
most forms of dual trading 
but melamed said that much finetuning is required on the 
proposals 
grossman who will assess dual trading at the cbot was a 
contributor to a report on the 1987 stock market crash commissioned 
by the new york stock exchange 
the cbot at the request of the commodities futures trading 
commission had previously conducted a study of dual trading the 
study said the practice of dual trading results in a better price 
for customers and adds to the liquidity of the market 
the study also contended that customers can choose to trade with 
a broker who does not trade for himself

attorneys general of three pacific 
northwest states want the nations chief law officer to investigate 
why oil prices have risen sharply especially since the march 24 
exxon valdez oil spill in alaska 
dave frohnmayer of oregon ken eikenberry of washington and jim 
jones of idaho said in a news release monday they will ask us 
attorney general richard thornburg and daniel oliver chairman of 
the federal trade commission for a federal investigation of 
gasoline prices 
the three also scheduled a news conference this afternoon in 
spokane to announce a joint action of their own in pursuit of an 
explanation of the sudden and extreme increase in oil prices since 
the grounding of the exxon valdez according to a statement from 
eikenberrys office 
the group also planned to ask executives of major oil companies 
to meet with them to explain the price increases 
the oil industry blames the sharp rise in crude oil prices 
which have increased more than 7 a barrel since january for most 
of the higher prices at the gas pumps concerns over tight gasoline 
supplies for the summer driving season escalated following the 
alaska oil spill and an explosion at a north sea oil rig 
more than 10 million gallons of crude oil spilled into alaskas 
prince william sound when the exxon tanker struck a reef march 24 
since then gasoline prices have increased an average 10 percent 
nationally while the pacific northwest experienced price surges as 
high as 25 percent in less than a month said marla rae executive 
assistant to frohnmayer 
but the oil industry says that crude oil prices surged since 
last november while gasoline prices did not experience a comparable 
rise 
the joint action was necessary because of the high costs of 
pursuing such investigations ms rae said noting that some state 
agencies are still involved in antitrust litigation stemming from 
gasoline shortages in the early 70s 
she characterized the proposed action as a consumerrelated 
matter rather than a possible antitrust investigation 
tina kondo an assistant attorney general in seattle said the 
washington state investigation was sparked by consumer complaints 
and requests from members of the state senate transportation 
committee and king county executive tim hill 
the petroleum price increases have hit the regions agriculture 
and tourism industries hard ms rae said 
shannon watts a spokeswoman for the american automobile 
association in seattle said selfserve regular gasoline prices in 
washington state in 10 areas surveyed rose 93 cents between 
march 14 and april 56 
thats a definite increase she said prices were steadily 
going down over the last year but we got our first increase an 
average 22 cents between christmas and easter 
higher prices will surely be reflected in another survey for the 
memorial day weekend planned for the week of may 714 she said

takeover strategist t boone pickens says he has 
been preaching free enterprise for years but now that he is 
involved in a dispute with a japanese company he thinks trade 
barriers may be needed 
something now has to be done and if necessary i think you 
ought to put up some barriers temporarily until we get a level 
playing field pickens said monday 
pickens a texas oilman known worldwide for his corporate raids 
has purchased 202 percent of koito manufacturing co to become the 
largest stockholder of the japanese automobile parts manufacturer 
he has been rebuffed by koito manufacturing in trying to seat 
his representatives on the board he said 
pickens said he spoke recently with secretary of commerce robert 
mosbacher and about a dozen members of congress concerning his 
japanese business venture 
i found a very sympathetic ear to what i was saying pickens 
said of his meetings with key trade legislators in washington 
at the same time i told them im not asking for any help i 
just think that here in america we have been way too lax and too 
easy on letting the japanese come into us markets he said 
pickens said he told koito representatives that he wants to be a 
longterm stockholder and his stock purchase is not part of a 
hostile takeover attempt 
still the attitude is one that we dont want you in japan and 
this is what kind of got my back up in the whole affair i just 
said to hell with this its got to be different than this he 
said 
pickens who is considering a bid for the republican party 
gubernatorial nomination said he has always supported foreign 
companies investing in the united states but that his experience 
with koito convinced him more needs to be done to open foreign 
markets to us businesses 
but pickens said he is not seeking any federal help in his 
struggle with koito 
ive drilled dry holes before and this may be one of them 
he said 
pickens a general partner of mesa limited partnership an oil 
and gas company was in the state capitol monday to testify against 
proposed legislation aimed at making it more difficult for hostile 
takeovers

a bank held 600000 in federal funds for the 
city without paying interest for three months in an account 
established by mayor tom bradley and controlled by one of his 
aides a newspaper reported today 
two months after the situation was discovered bradley started 
earning 18000 a year as a consultant to the bank the los angeles 
herald examiner reported 
bradleys ties to far east national bank and another 
institution valley federal savings and loan association have 
prompted an investigation by the city attorneys office and police 
department into conflictofinterest allegations and spawned the 
formation of a city ethics panel 
the panel of seven civic and religious leaders appointed by 
bradley one day after his narrow reelection april 11 met for the 
first time monday and sought to distance itself from the mayor and 
the city council 
the panel agreed to organize as an independent organization 
probably as a nonprofit corporation and not take any funds from 
bradley his political action committee or the city council 
we will be most effective most credible if we are 
independent said geoffrey cowan former state chairman of the 
political watchdog group common cause cowan was asked by bradley 
to head the panel 
according to records obtained by the herald examiner bradley 
authorized the far east bank account and his top aide anton 
calleia controlled deposits made to the account by the federal 
government in 1987 
on aug 4 1987 600000 in federal transportation funds were 
deposited in the account and on oct 31 1987 789230 was added 
records show 
it was not until nov 9 1987 that the city treasurers office 
discovered far east held nearly 14 million in city funds and 
ordered the bank to return the money to the city the herald 
examiner reported 
the money should have been transferred to the city treasury 
within a day or two said william hoss the city treasurers cash 
management and investment officer 
a spokesman for the federal urban mass transit administration 
which sent the money to the city said the deposit may have 
violated federal regulations because money from federal grants must 
be spent promptly the spokesman asked not to be identified 
phone calls to calleias office for comment were not returned 
bradley has refused to comment on his ties to the financial 
institutions pending the outcome of the city attorneys 
investigation 
the mayor has denied knowing the city was doing business with 
the bank in 1988 at a time far east was paying him 18000 a year 
to act as a consultant the mayor returned the 18000 after the 
matter was made public

the house banking committee today expanded the 
board that president bush wants to oversee the cleanup of the 
savings and loan crisis to include housing and urban development 
secretary jack kemp and a private real estate specialist 
after earlier enacting much tougher capital standards than bush 
originally wanted to impose on the thrift industry the 51member 
committee today provided for more administration oversight of the 
100 billion bailout 
the effort which will involve the largest disposition of 
governmentowned property since the louisiana purchase will be 
overseen by a new agency called the resolution trust corp 
even with the best of intentions well still end up with 
about 1000 new donald trumps said committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez dtexas referring to the billionaire new york developer 
this has been an issue that has raised its head every time in a 
bailout 
trumps acquisition of real estate through the government 
bailout of the penn central railroad in the early 1970s sparked his 
financial rise 
bush had wanted a threemember board headed by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and including attorney general dick 
thornburgh and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to run the 
resolution trust corp 
the banking committee expanded the board to include two more 
voting members kemp and a real estate expert to be selected plus 
one nonvoting member l william seidman chairman of the federal 
deposit insurance corp who will be in charge of the daytoday 
task of administering the cleanup 
lawmakers said their chief aim is providing more administrative 
oversight and expertise in an effort to thwart abuses that have 
characterized other bailouts putting thornburgh on the board will 
help they said 
for example the federal asset disposition association created 
by the federal home loan bank board to dispose of property that 
fell into government hands from sampl failures in the early 1980s has 
been plagued with accusations of inside dealing and political 
croynyism 
there was a lot of talk about fraud abuse and criminal 
activity in the sampl industry said rep chalmers wylie of ohio 
the ranking republican on the banking committee the attorney 
general might be useful in finding some of that property that was 
disposed of in ways that were not all that kosher 
after last week toughening bushs proposed capital standards 
the house panel on monday beat bacrw exemptions from capital 
requirements that have allowed many sampl owners to operate with 
little or no money of their own at risk 
assistant treasury secretary david mullins called mondays 
action another good day for the administration praising 
democrats on the panel for helping defeat accounting devices 
offered primarily by young gop lawmakers to water down what 
bush wants 
however the fight is not over rep claude pepper dfla who 
as chairman of the house rules committee has controlling influence 
over what issues are revisited when a bill reaches the house floor 
last week said in a letter he strongly supports continuation of the 
good will exemptions 
according to industry and government records at least 14 sampls 
in florida with assets totaling 26 billion have little or no 
capital other than good will and half of them have a negative 
net worth when good will is excluded from their balance sheets 
meanwhile jesse jackson spent more than two hours monday 
lobbying lawmakers on the 51member committee for amendments he 
wants to make sampls and banks devote more of their lending to 
mortgages for lowincome families and inner city redevelopment 
specifically jackson wants to make banks and sampls publicly 
disclose the race gender and income levels of mortgage applicants 
as a way of discouraging redlining discrimination 
and he is supporting an amendment by rep barney frank dmass 
that would require 15 percent to 20 percent of the residential 
property that the government is inheriting as a result of sampl 
failures to be offered to local housing authorities at a discounted 
price 
bushs plan would raise an immediate 50 billion for the bailout 
through the creation of an offbudget bond underwriter at an 
estimated cost to taxpayers of 200 billion to 250 billion over 
the next 30 years 
this read my lips slogan that hes adhering to is the most 
costly slogan in history jackson told reporters in a room that 
the committee set aside for his use the reaganbush 
administration got us into trouble by disregarding their charge and 
mandate to regulate 
the key vote monday was on an amendment by rep thomas ridge 
dpa to give regulators authority to continue on a casebycase 
basis the socalled good will exemptions from cash tangible 
capital requirements that the committee had approved last week 
ridges amendment was defeated by a 2823 vote after opponents 
called good will fake capital and said it is worthless as a 
resource 
were trying to be tough and fair and not just tough said 
ridge who cited hundreds of sampls in illinois pennsylvania new 
york new jersey and ohio that lost much of their tangible capital 
in the early 1980s by taking over failed thrifts and absorbing 
their losses 
in exchange the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
itself near insolvency granted those oncehealthy sampls more than 
20 billion in good will exemptions from normal capital 
requirements lasting up to 40 years 
under current accounting practices that good will now accounts 
for onethird of the industrys total capital of 60 billion

incentive costs was the last of the big three to jump into the 
latest incentive pool offering free financing on twoyear loans 
for all of its cars and some trucks gm and ford offer interest as 
low as 29 percent 
much of the cost of those incentives will show up on the big 
threes secondquarter balance sheets

spirit and plymouth acclaim which replaced its compact kseries 
cars and in the moreexpensive models also during the quarter 
chrysler began two shifts of production at its newark del plant

the aflcio today endorsed plans for a 
nationwide labor boycott of american telephone amp telegraph co if 
its unions strike later this month a strategy that could put labor 
in the unusual position of funneling millions of dollars to a 
nonunion company 
the federations governing council approved the plan at its 
spring meeting acknowledging atampts competitors were nonunion but 
promising nonetheless to switch longdistance carriers if asked to 
do so by the communications workers of america and the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers 
the aflcio will be prepared to mobilize its resources to 
assist union workers at atampt and to call for the fullest support 
possible from affiliated unions state federations and local labor 
councils the council said in its resolution 
in an accompanying statement the council said despite the 
fact that most of atampts competitors are nonunion the aflcio 
believes picket lines whether visible or invisible are a 
crucial form of communication to inform union members and other 
consumers about unfair actions taken by an employer 
officials of the cwa and ibew said that in the event of a strike 
and boycott they would urge labor organizations and union members 
who use atampt to instead use nonunion us sprint communications co 
one of the opportunities we have is the power to severely 
impact the enormous revenues generated by electronic services of 
the telecommunications industry cwa president morton bahr said 
monday in touching on the proposal during a speech to the cwa 
convention in los angeles 
labor officials familiar with the plan said that if bahr and 
ibew president jack barry decided to launch a boycott the 14 
millionmember aflcio would urge its affiliate unions and their 
members to switch to sprint by using that companys local access 
numbers that process would allow members to use sprint without 
having to switch longdistance carriers permanently 
aflcio officials said most if not all of its member unions use 
atampt for longdistance service with some of the larger unions 
paying the company about 1 million a month 
its hundreds of millions of dollars a year said ms 
zucker who said she could not immediately provide a more specific 
estimate 
she acknowledged that a nonunion company would benefit from 
such a boycott but said we are prepared to do this if we have to 
win jobs with justice at atampt we dont want to promote sprint 
what we are promoting is the fact that unions can do this that thi 
is one tool we can use at the bargaining table to achieve a fair 
contract 
an atampt spokeswoman said the company considered the proposal 
selfdefeating because it would help atampts competitors and 
therefore possibly cost union members their jobs 
the presentation to the aflcio executive council comes at a 
time when the unions are grumbling about atampts negotiating 
positions primarily a company proposal to shift more healthcare 
costs to workers 
the talks are in recess and due to resume monday three weeks 
before expiration of current contracts it is the first time the 
two unions have negotiated jointly with atampt cwa struck the 
company in 1986 but atampt was able to keep half of its manufacturing 
plants open because ibew workers continued to work

polaroid corp took great pains to avoid 
competition with wellestablished eastman kodak co the polaroid 
chairman testified today as a court tried to determine how much 
kodak should pay for infringing on its rivals instantphotography 
technology 
chairman william j mccune jr the opening witness of the 
trial began outlining the corporate history of his company 
beginning with founder edwin lands quest for instant photography 
in the 1940s after his daughter asked why she could immediately see 
a picture her father had taken 
mccune said throughout its history polaroid had tried to avoid 
direct competition with kodak the leader in the photography field 
he said kodak could have taken the bread and butter from the 
polaroid plate and the firm took pains to avoid a marketing 
competition 
in opening arguments monday before us district judge a david 
mazzone kodak argued that the 12 billion that polaroid is seeking 
in its patent infringement lawsuit against kodak is greater than 
all of polaroids profits from 1947 to 1987 
the kodak lawyers sought to portray polaroid as a corporate 
opportunist looking for a windfall from the 13yearold lawsuit 
polaroids lawyers on the other hand pointed to a kodak 
internal memo as evidence that the rochester nybased company 
knowingly violated seven of polaroids patents when it began 
selling instant cameras in 1976 
they said walter a fallon who was then kodaks chairman and 
chief executive personally reviewed the memo and jotted the words 
big block in the margin next to a paragraph about polaroids 
patents 
kodaks lead counsel richard e carlton did not discuss the 
memo in his opening statement but he argued that kodaks foray 
into instant cameras and film was based on advice from a new york 
city law firm kenyon amp kenyon that turned out to be faulty 
if mazzone awards polaroid anything close to 12 billion it 
will be the largest patent infringement decision in history far 
surpassing the record 207 million that smith international inc 
was ordered to pay hughes tool co three years ago for copying 
drill bit technology 
whether kodak violated polaroids patents is no longer in 
question a judge ruled in 1985 that kodak had done so and the 
us supreme court let that ruling stand monday 
the only issue in the current trial is how much kodaks 
violations hurt polaroid and whether they were deliberate which 
would open the way to punitive damages 
kodak argued in its pretrial briefs that the most it should 
have to pay cambridgebased polaroid is 177 million or 5 percent 
royalties on the instant cameras and film kodak sold from 1976 
until 1985 
polaroid bases its huge damage claim on the grounds that kodak 
deprived it of billions of dollars in sales and started a price war 
that forced it to sell some cameras below cost in addition 
polaroid contends that kodak caused longterm damaged to the market 
by portraying instant cameras as cheap toys rather than serious 
equipment 
kodak contends however that its entry into the market actually 
benefited polaroid because the millions of dollars it spent on 
advertising and promotion increased demand for both brands of 
instant cameras 
the case was been divided into two portions the first dealing 
with whether kodak violated polaroids patents and the second with 
financial compensation 
the first portion went to trial in 1981 and resulted in an 
october 1985 ruling by us district judge rya zobel that kodak had 
infringed some of polaroids most essential patents on her orders 
kodak quit the instant photography business in january 1986 after 
losing more than 600 million 
kodak appealed mrs zobels decision arguing that she had a 
conflict of interest because her motherinlaw owned 1000 shares 
of kodak stock but a federal appeals court affirmed the ruling 
noting that mrs zobel had told both companies in 1981 that her 
motherinlaw owned the shares and neither company had objected 
the us supreme court announced monday it would not review the 
appeals courts ruling which means mrs zobels decision is the 
final word

government and the automotive industry must 
intensify efforts to find new ways of fueling the nations vehicles 
if an oil crisis is to be averted in the 1990s sen john d 
rockefeller iv said tuesday 
we need to think systematically about what must be done by the 
end of the next decade to displace millions of barrels a day of 
imported oil with alternative fuels the west virginia democrat 
told the society of automotive engineers 
it is time for us to get on with the job of making the united 
states energy secure again 
rockefellers remarks came at the opening of the societys 
threeday conference on technical and regulatory issues facing the 
automotive industry including fuel economy safety and alternative 
fuels 
the major us automakers have built prototypes of cars using 
alcoholbased fuels however efforts to promote such vehicles as 
commercial products have been constrained by relatively cheap oil 
prices during much of the 1980s and the lack of a national 
distribution network for fuels other than gasoline 
the assumption that we can become dependent on imported oil 
because it is now cheap will become a very expensive assumption in 
the long run it does not take much imagination to envision an 
energy crisis in the 1990s rockefeller said 
rockefeller said the government must avoid a narrow focus in 
making automotive policy 
we cannot assume that all the worlds problems can be solved 
just by regulating the automobile rockefeller said 
rockefeller said the senate energy subcommittee on research and 
development would hold hearings in june aimed at finding ways to 
encourage the replacement of gasoline with alternative fuels such 
as methanol ethanol and natural gas

americans need to make wrenching changes to 
succeed in the global economy even though there is no crisis 
pushing them to take immediate action an mit panel said tuesday 
taking only small or partial steps to improve the nations 
competitiveness will doom the united states to steady slippage in 
the standard of living according to the twoyear study by 
scientists engineers and economists from massachusetts institute 
of technology 
we are indeed in serious trouble with respect to our 
industrial performance michael l dertouzos chairman of mits 
commission on industrial productivity told a news conference 
unless something is done he said the nation will become 
progressively more impoverished in relative terms 
the authors of the study made in america were scheduled to 
testify on their findings wednesday in washington before the senate 
committee on labor and human resources headed by sen edward m 
kennedy dmass 
restoring us competitiveness demands grassroots changes by 
companies unions schools and workers the study said 
while government has a role to play changes that come from the 
bottom up are essential to improving the nations lagging rate of 
productivity growth it said 
to live well a nation must produce well says the lead 
sentence in the study released as a 344page hardcover book 
among the three principal authors is robert solow who won the 
1987 nobel memorial prize in economic science and is vice chairman 
of mits commission on industrial productivity 
the others are dertouzos a professor of electrical engineering 
and computer science and richard k lester executive director of 
the commission and an associate professor of nuclear engineering 
the study says that if the right steps are taken this nation 
has every chance of entering the 21st century displaying the same 
dynamism that characterized its industrial performance throughout 
much of the present century 
the mit study differs from many others in that it does not focus 
on such economic issues as the high cost of capital in the united 
states and the shortage of national savings 
instead it focuses on what it calls an excessive concern with 
shortterm profits outdated corporate strategies that focus too 
much on mass production and the domestic american market and lack 
of cooperation within and among us companies 
it also puts the blame on neglect of people technological 
failures in translating discoveries into products and unwise public 
policies 
companies that are doing well today often are ones that have 
started from scratch or come through crises the authors said 
they cited xerox corp which fought back after losing most of 
the world copier market in the 1970s and early 1980s and ford 
motor co which has rebounded to become the nations most 
profitable automaker after losing 33 billion from 1980 through 
1982 
the management trick is can you change before you have a 
crisis said lester thurow deal of mits sloan school of 
management it can be done he said 
there isnt something magical here that the rest of the 
worlds got that we havent got thurow said 
for industry the studys main recommendation is to focus on 
steady continuous improvements in the production process 
to hurry things along companies should begin working on 
designing products and the processes for making them before the 
research and development is even complete the study says 
suppliers should be treated as allies rather than adversaries 
the study says because the economy is becoming global american 
managers should know more about foreign cultures and ways of doing 
business it says 
labor representatives should be accepted as legitimate and 
valued partners in the innovation process the report states 
but it also says traditional laborunion stands on work rules 
job security and compensation need to be reconsidered 
for government it recommends taking steps to raise private 
savings and cut the federal budget deficit opening foreign 
markets making labor laws more flexible supporting research and 
development and making military spending more efficient 
it also recommends laws to restrict borrowing for corporate 
takeovers and buyouts 
on education it says government should get schools to promote 
technological literacy and encourage companies to do more 
onthejob education and training 
the study acknowledges that many companies are too small to do 
extensive education and training while others are afraid that 
employees will quit and take their newly acquired skills elsewhere

better onthejob training even more than 
better schools holds the key to helping us workers catch up to 
the japanese and others in productivity concluded an mit report 
released tuesday 
young americans receive most of their job skills in 
institutions of formal learning and what they pick up on the job 
is usually of a limited nature gathered from watching a 
colleague said the report made in america 
japanese and west german corporations invest far more than most 
us firms in training and retraining workers over a lifetime the 
payoff said the study is a workforce prepared and flexible enough 
to adapt to changing styles and technologies 
us firms such as international business machines corp 
digital equipment corp and chaparral industries inc do provide 
effective training the report said but many small and 
mediumsized companies feel they cant afford to establish 
extensive training programs or they are concerned that if they do 
theyd lose their investment when workers transfer to other 
companies 
changing this would require a kind of national political 
leadership that has not yet appeared the report said 
the twoyear study was produced by a 16member mit commission on 
industrial productivity 
the 344page reports principal authors were michael l 
dertouzos professor of engineering and computer science richard 
k lester associate professor of nuclear engineering and robert 
m solow professor of economics and nobel laureate in economics 
neglect of human resources may be the united states biggest 
failing dertouzos said at a news conference on the report 
while critical of us public schools and vocational schools for 
turning out children illequipped in math science and other 
disciplines the report said school reform is only a first step 
toward a more productive workforce 
even if american schools were to be improved there are 
reasons to believe that learning work skills on the job might be 
preferable to learning them in schools the report argued 
skills developed on the job tend to be broader more flexible 
and more relevant to the future needs of the corporation such 
skills are general enough so that they can be useful even if the 
worker switches jobs 
west germany for example offers young workers apprenticeships 
in 400 occupations the apprentice usually 16 years old spends an 
average of three years working in a firm under a supervisor the 
training curriculum is negotiated with government employers 
associations and trade unions 
in japan workers rotate between research manufacturing sales 
and other areas they spend several days a year in corporate 
training centers and are also encouraged to take correspondence 
courses 
the report disputed the notion that us workers are being 
outdone by foreign competitors because of a decline in the work 
ethic 
the issue is not what workers will do when motivated but 
rather what they can do given their weaker basic education and the 
kind of work experiences provided by companies that have low regard 
for training and few institutional resources to provide it it 
said

share prices closed lower on the london stock 
exchange tuesday as renewed inflationary fears and light buying 
interest after a long holiday weekend combined to undo some of the 
gains the market made last week 
the trading session was one of the quietest since early january 
with volume amounting to 3339 million shares 
the financial timesstock exchange 100 index closed 149 points 
or 07 percent lower at 21032 the days lowest level but just 
above the psychologically important 2100 point barrier 
the financial times 30share index closed at 17363 down 141 
the financial times 500share index finished at 119576 down 
742 
dealers said the market was upset by renewed fears of an upward 
drift in world interest rates with much of the concern stemming 
from mondays release of a survey of us purchasing managers which 
pointed to stillbuoyant growth in april 
those fears had receded last week pushing the ftse 100 over 50 
points higher during the five days 
as well as international pressures the british government may 
also be forced to raise interest rates again for domestic reasons 
dealers said especiallly if the pound comes under renewed downward 
pressure

the head of pa bergner amp co said tuesday he 
is inclined to keep the department store companys headquarters in 
milwaukee after acquiring chicagobased carson pirie scott amp co 
bergner and carson announced the 453 million merger monday 
which would create one of the midwests largest retail chains 
we have always had ambitions of being a major player in the 
chicago market alan anderson chairman and chief executive 
officer of bergner said at a news conference tuesday 
the combined companies will control more than 60 stores in 
wisconsin illinois indiana minnesota and iowa and they will 
have a single headquarters anderson said 
we are inclined to leave the headquarters in milwaukee he 
said however before we make a final decision we will see if 
there are significant business reasons for changing our position 
bergner moved its headquarters from peoria ill to milwaukee 
when the company bought the boston store chain which operates in 
wisconsin 
but anderson said officials made that decision because they felt 
they needed to be more attuned to the milwaukee market anderson 
said bergner already operates stores in the chicago area and we 
know the market there 
officials said the merger would have little effect on the 
individual stores which will retain their names 
anderson described the merger with carson as an outstanding 
fit because the two retail companies cater to similar customers 
and because their markets are adjacent to each other 
this isnt like buying a chain spread out across the us 
said john landschulz a retail analyst with the chicago brokerage 
firm of cowen amp co 
the two chains overlap only in one shopping center at randhurst 
outside chicago and anderson said no immediate decision has been 
made on whether to close one of the stores 
anderson said however bergner will sell off carsons specialty 
store operations which include 391 county seat casual wear stores 
and 23 arcadia novelty shops 
we are a department store operator anderson said thats 
the business we know 
bergner owned by the maus and nordmann families of switzerland 
had sales of 470 million last year carson had sales of 102 
billion in 1988 
anderson estimated the merger would bring about 300 million in 
debt to bergner but part of that money would be paid off through 
the sale of the specialty stores

chrysler corps firstquarter earnings rose 91 
percent from last years depressed level pushing profits for the 
big three to a quarterly record according to figures released 
tuesday 
chrysler said it earned 351 million or 150 a share during 
the first three months of the year compared with 1837 million 
or 83 cents a share during the same time last year revenue rose 
16 percent to 995 billion from 856 billion 
the earnings benefited by comparison with last year when the 
no3 automaker closed a number of its acustar inc parts subsidiary 
plants those closings cut profits by 93 million or 42 cents a 
share 
without the reduction last year chryslers firstquarter 
profits would have been 267 percent higher the companys profits 
came on revenues of 995 billion this year up 163 percent from 
its firstquarter revenues last year 
late last month general motors corp reported it made 155 
billion and ford motor co said it earned 164 billion bringing 
the big three profits during the quarter to 354 billion thats 
the best first quarter on record topping the first period of 1984 
when the companies made 322 billion 
analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton of new york 
said some of chryslers increase came because of lower incentive 
costs during the period this year 
in the past chrysler has used incentives liberally to entice 
buyers in very late march and early april each of the big three 
introduced new incentive packages with cash rebates and low or 
in chryslers case no financing charges on some loans 
much of the cost of the new incentive packages which have given 
a boost to car and truck sales will be charged against 
secondquarter profits 
theyre talking a cost of 800 per car versus 600 in the 
first quarter phillippi said tuesday 
chryslers incentive package runs indefinitely fords expires 
may 31 and gms runs out june 5 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca said the company benefited from 
sales of the dodge spirit and plymouth acclaim which replaced its 
kseries compact cars and in its moreexpensive models also 
during the quarter chrysler began two shifts of production at its 
newark del plant which makes the spiritacclaim line 
iacocca also said chrysler is holding its share of the 
sportutility market through its jeep line and in the minivan 
segment where the company commands better than 50 percent of the 
sales 
jeeps and minivans thats the money pump phillippi said 
meantime chrysler financial corp the automakers financing 
arm said it earned 65 million during the first quarter the same 
as the first three months of last year 
the subsidiarys automotive lending operations chrysler credit 
reported the number of new and used vehicles it financed rose 114 
percent during the first quarter from the same period last year

an earlier court decision found infringement occurred 
rochester nybased kodak says it should pay 177 million 
equal to 5 percent royalties on the instant cameras and film kodak 
sold from 1976 until 1985 
mccune said polaroid and kodk had a productive working 
relationship for decades but things soured in the late 1960s he 
said when polaroid was working on its revolutionary sx70 camera 
kodak which for years had manufactured film for polaroid was 
asked to produce the new complex negative that polaroid had 
developed for the instant color camera but kodak demanded a 
license from polaroid mccune testified which would have allowed 
kodak to develop its own instant photography 
there was considerable reluctance to undertake the project 
unless we gave them license mccune said under questioning by 
polaroid attorney herbert schwartz a stumbling block was always 
that we couldnt see how giving kodak a license to make products 
competitive with ours would allow us to stay in business 
polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities 
in massachusetts 
instant photography mccune said is all our bread and butter 
and thats everything weve got 
mccunes testimony before judge a david mazzone ranged widely 
from the origins of instant photography after world war ii to the 
introduction of the sx70 camera in 1972 
the story began during the war mccune said when polaroid 
founder edwin land was in santa fe on a family trip he took 
photographs of his daughter and she asked why she couldnt see it 
right away mccune said he wondered too 
by 1963 with manufacturing help from kodak polaroid developed 
the first color instant photography 
the business grew rapidly in that period mccune said 
revenue of 129 million in 1963 jumped to 571 million in 1972 
polaroids profits after taxes increased from 25 million to 75 
million in that time 
with the introduction of the sx70 mccune said polaroid hoped 
for a dramatic increase in its business 
we viewed it as a revolutionary step and thought it was going 
to dramatically increase the business of the company and increase 
the life of the business mccune said 
but as polaroids lawyers have already argued kodaks 
competition beginning in 1976 cut into profits and forced polaroid 
to sell some cameras below cost 
if mazzone awards polaroid anything close to 12 billion it 
will be the largest patent infringement decision in history far 
surpassing the record 207 million that smith international inc 
was ordered to pay hughes tool co three years ago for copying 
drill bit technology

the government reported tuesday that orders to 
us factories for manufactured goods increased 07 percent in 
march but analysts still saw signs in the report that the economy 
was cooling off 
orders for durable and nondurable goods rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 2329 billion in march after dropping 2 percent in 
february and 12 percent in january the commerce department 
reported 
the gain last month was propelled by a big jump in 
transportation orders which surged 101 percent on the strength of 
a 483 percent increase in orders for aircraft missiles and parts 
excluding transportation a category that is subject to wide 
swings depending on when big contracts are signed all other orders 
were down 09 percent in march after declining 1 percent in 
february 
analysts said the report added to signs that economic growth is 
slackening but also demonstrated the economy still has some 
strength left 
i dont think the economy is as weak as some of the recent 
signs have been showing said economist john hagens of the wefa 
group in bala cynwyd pa calling it a fullfledged slowdown 
right now is a little bit premature 
hagens said that with aircraft manufacturers already holding big 
backlogs of unfilled orders the latest surge in orders in that 
category was unlikely to have much immediate effect on economic 
activity 
he said the report showed some strength in orders for computers 
and other equipment while demand in constructionrelated 
industries remained weak 
orders in the volatile defense category which overlaps 
transportation also showed strength in march rising 288 percent 
after an increase of 197 percent in february 
excluding defense all other orders in march were down 03 
percent after falling 27 percent in february 
economist robert defina of security pacific national bank in los 
angeles said the report was consistent with other recent signs that 
the economy may be slowing down noting that orders for nondefense 
capital goods have fluctuated in recent months and that factory 
shipments were down in march as backlogs of unfilled orders 
increased 
they all seem to fit in with this picture of a slowing 
economy he said 
however economist robert brusca of nikko securities co 
international inc in new york said that while orders last quarter 
were slower than during the strong fourth quarter of 1988 
manufacturing still shows enough strength that inflationary 
pressures could mount 
theres a little bit of a slowdown thats not worth a lot 
brusca said i would still be concerned about the risks of 
inflation here much more than the risk of recession 
the commerce department gave these details on factory orders in 
march 
orders for nondefense capital goods considered a barometer of 
business investment plans were up 24 percent in march after 
falling 78 percent in february and rising 23 percent in january 
boosted by the strong demand for aircraft orders for big 
ticket durable goods were up 09 percent in march to a seasonally 
adjusted 1252 billion after falling in the previous two months 
excluding aircraft durable goods orders declined 36 percent 
orders for nondurable goods were up 05 percent in march to a 
seasonally adjusted 1077 billion after dropping 04 percent in 
february 
shipments of manufactured goods declined 01 percent in march 
to a seasonally adjusted 2281 billion after falling 14 percent 
in february

oil futures prices retreated in active trading 
tuesday reflecting market concerns about overproduction among opec 
members 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude lost 86 
cents to settle at 1980 a barrel after rising 24 cents on monday 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange the 
june contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 136 cents 
lower to 7125 cents a gallon the contract had risen 139 cents in 
the previous session 
june home heating oil which declined 031 cent monday fell 
another 185 cents tuesday to 4761 cents a gallon 
john h oconnell an energy analyst at refco inc said 
profittaking from the recent jump in crude and gasoline prices and 
concerns about opec overproduction largely were responsible for 
tuesdays selloff 
theres a growing belief that opec is producing 22 million 
barrels daily he said 
the 13member organization of petroleum exporting countries 
agreed last year to a daily production level of 185 million 
barrels for the first half of 1989 
quotas for the second half of the year are expected to be 
discussed at a june opec meeting and analysts predict cartel 
members will seek to expand production in light of the recent price 
runup 
adding to the market slump tuesday was speculation that the 
transportation and production system in the north sea would resume 
operations next week following an april 18 explosion at a gasoline 
platform that disrupted operations analysts said 
the north sea accident and the exxon oil spill off the alaskan 
coast in march have helped to significantly boost oil prices 
particularly gasoline and crude

despite record sales eastman kodak cos 
fiscal firstquarter profit fell 23 percent due to costs associated 
with last years purchase of sterling drug co 
the announcement caught many stock analysts by surprise and sent 
the photo giants stock tumbling on the new york stock exchange 
where it closed down 312 a share to 4375 
i was looking for an unimpressive quarter but these numbers 
are definitely lower than i and most everyone else anticipated 
said mark obenzinger an analyst for wood gundy amp co 
for the quarter which ended march 19 the company reported a 
profit of 200 million or 62 cents a share compared with 260 
million or 80 cents a share for the same period a year ago 
sales for the quarter totaled a record 39 billion up 17 
percent from last year when they were 33 billion 
the earnings decline was largely a result of adding in three 
months instead of one month of costs and interest expense for 
sterling drug which kodak bought last february for 51 billion 
thats a major difference said kodak spokesman ron roberts 
for example interest expenses in last years first quarter 
totaled 92 million this year they were 192 million marketing 
and administrative costs were 869 million in this years initial 
quarter they climbed 206 million to 107 billion 
roberts also said less favorable currencyexchange rates and the 
general cost of inflation contributed to higher costs for kodak 
however roberts noted that last years first quarter was the 
best in company history and this years firstquarter earnings are 
the thirdhighest 
the first quarter rarely provides good insight into 
performance expectations due to the seasonality of our business 
said colby chandler kodaks chairman and chief executive officer 
the first three months of the year are generally kodaks slowest 
time because people do not take as many pictures as they do in the 
spring summer and fall 
chandler said he still predicts the company will achieve record 
earnings this year but its not going to be easy

international business machines corp said 
tuesday it will offer a system that can identify incoming phone 
calls and get information about the callers out of the computer 
other companies such as american telephone amp telegraph co 
already offer such calleridentification systems but ibm has an 
advantage in the market because of its close ties to potential 
customers a consultant said 
typical customers for such systems are stock brokerages and 
companies that handle ordering and billing over the phone with the 
system someone who takes a call simultaneously gets a screen full 
of information about the customers account 
similarly a company could list one number in the phone book and 
then route calls automatically to the closest office 
in addition to callpath ibm also announced at a dallas trade 
show new controllers that serve as gobetweens for mainframe 
computers and desktop terminals 
ibm is so familiar with its customers that it can customtailor 
callpath to their needs better than other companies can said 
francis mcinerney senior analyst at northern business 
informationdatapro in new york 
ibms longrange goal is to get a large portion of its revenue 
from helping customers assemble customized information systems 
mcinerney said callpath will help by creating a standard platform 
to build on he said

the dollar finished higher against several key 
currencies tuesday defying central bank attempts to dilute its 
value through coordinated selling on foreignexchange markets 
gold weakened slightly republic national bank of new york 
quoted bullion at 37635 a troy ounce down from 37745 monday 
currency strategists said the dollars behavior reflected a big 
underlying demand for the currency a consequence of what they 
called the resiliently strong us economy and relatively high 
american interest rates that make dollardenominated investments 
more attractive 
they also attributed some of the dollars strength to pentup 
orders for the currency overseas where many markets were closed 
monday for the may day labor holiday 
the dollar fell early in the day when the federal reserve and 
central banks in other key us trading partners sold dollars to 
blunt the currencys appreciation 
but when traders realized why the dollar was falling they 
started buying it aggressively and the dollar rose again finishing 
higher against the yen mark and french franc and nearly unchanged 
vs the british pound and a few other important currencies 
the sentiment is definitely continuing to be bullish said 
scott greene a senior dealer at the new york branch of 
switzerlands bank julius baer amp co unless the intervention gets 
more serious traders will just see it as an excuse to buy cheap 
dollars

petroleum futures prices dropped sharply tuesday on the new york 
mercantile exchange as traders reacted to reports that opec nations 
are exceeding their production limits 
in other markets grain and soybean prices dropped precious 
metals closed lower on light trading and livestock and pork prices 
rallied 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 35 cents to 89 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in june at 1980 a barrel 
heating oil was 119 cents to 185 cents lower with june at 4761 
cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 42 cent to 136 cents lower 
with june at 725 cents a gallon 
it was a bloodbath said jerry samuels an analyst with 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
prices dropped in active trading as traders who bought on the 
assumption prices would go up liquidated their holdings as the 
market broke the 2050 barrier 
there was no fresh news that would warrant such a move down 
said samuels there is continued concern from opec 
overproduction 
word was that in april saudi arabia surpassed its production 
limit of 45 million barrels a day with daily production reaching 
49 million barrels to 5 million barrels 
that is not so much but there are reports the kuwaitis who 
have a million barrels per day limit produced 17 million barrels 
daily samuels said 
gasoline futures were forced down by the selling of crude oil 
futures but overall prices remain steady said samuels adding 
the fall in gasoline prices is likely to be more temporary than the 
drop in crude oil and heating oil 
grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the 
chicago board of trade as traders reacted to shortterm weather 
forecasts calling for aboveaverage rainfall 
wheat prices rose in anticipation of an announcement by the bush 
administration on additional subsidized grain sales to the soviet 
union 
after the close of trading the white house announced the sale 
of 15 million metric tons of wheat to the soviets under the export 
bonus program the wheat is for delivery in may and june 
wheat prices also were helped by word that the condition of the 
red winter wheat crop in kansas and oklahoma has deteriorated 
further 
there was light volume said steve freed an analyst with 
dean witter reynolds inc in chicago the market is nervous about 
the weather 
lower soybean and corn prices followed the release of the 
national weather services 6 to 10day forecast for 
wetterthannormal conditions next week in the midwest and the 
central plains 
wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in may at 426 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents 
lower with may at 273 a bushel oats were a cent to 3 cents 
lower with may at 184 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 5 cents 
lower with may at 734 a bushel 
livestock and pork futures were higher on the chicago mercantile 
exchange with prices buoyed by better than expected cash prices 
traders hadnt expected it to be so strong said tom morgan 
of sterling research corp of arlington heights ill 
pork prices were helped by a commerce department ruling that 
canada was subsidizing pork exports and that may prompt the united 
states to impose duties on canadian pork products 
live cattle settled 18 cent to 60 cent higher with june at 
7205 cents a pound feeder cattle was 30 cent to 65 cent higher 
with may at 7672 cents a pound hogs were 08 cent to 62 cent

gold and silver futures prices dropped in sluggish trading on 
new yorks commodities exchange

not a lot of reasons to buy said david syphen an analyst with 
merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
gold settled 40 cents to 170 lower with may at 37780 a troy

texas air corp the nations largest airline 
company said tuesday it lost 2555 million for the first quarter 
of 1989 most of which was attributed to strikebound eastern 
airlines 
the holding companys loss for the threemonth period came on 
revenue of 19 billion and contrasted with a loss of 1243 
million on revenue of 22 billion during the same three months in 
1988 
texas air owns miamibased eastern and houstonbased continental 
airlines as well as system one holdings an airline reservation 
system 
eastern has been in bankruptcy protection from creditors since 
march 9 five days after the start of a bruising strike by its 
machinists union that was supported by pilots and flight attendants 
miamibased eastern by itself recorded a loss of 2552 million 
on revenues of 6206 million before a 104 million charge for 
dividends payable to its preferred stockholders during the first 
quarter of 1988 eastern had a loss of 31 million on revenues of 
11 billion before a 141 million charge for dividends payable to 
its preferred stockholders 
eastern virtually shut down operations march 4 when its 
machinists went on strike and its pilots and flight attendants 
honored the picket lines 
phil bakes easterns president and chief executive said in a 
statement that while further substantial operating losses should 
be expected for the second quarter the companys business plan 
which was recently submitted to our creditors and 5000 working 
employees shows dramatic future improvements 
additionally cash resources will increase dramatically as a 
result of the planned disposition of certain assets that will allow 
us to pay down substantial amount of debt satisfy all bankruptcy 
liabilities and finish the year with substantial cash resources 
bakes said the airlines cash resources will increase 
dramatically from easterns new plan to rebuild as a smaller 
carrier and sell 18 billion in assets separately 
all such sales must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court in 
new york us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland has called a 
hearing for wednesday on the issue of auctioning eastern in its 
entirety including its northeast shuttle service slated to be sold 
to developer donald trump for 365 million 
continental posted a firstquarter loss of 165 million on 
revenues of 12 billion compared with a net loss of 806 million 
on revenue of 11 billion for the first quarter of 1988 
the losses at eastern and continental were partly offset by 
profits of other units that do not individually report their 
results including system one holdings texas air said

the aflcio pledged tuesday to direct a 
nationwide boycott of atampt if union members strike later this 
month the strategy could cost the longdistance giant millions of 
dollars while giving union business to a nonunion company 
the labor federations governing body approved the plan which 
asks the 14 million members of the aflcio and its affiliated 
unions to route their longdistance calls via nonunion us sprint 
communications co 
you have a choice between a struck company and a nonunion 
company aflcio president lane kirkland told reporters after the 
first day of the federations spring meeting 
if you want to make a telephone call those are your 
choices kirkland said under those circumstances you take the 
lesser of two evils 
by placing calls through sprints fivedigit access number the 
unions and their members could boycott american telephone amp 
telegraph co without permanently changing longdistance carriers 
and could easily begin using atampt again after the end of a work 
stoppage 
some larger aflcio unions pay as much as 1 million a month in 
atampt bills labors total bills amount to at least 100 million 
annually federation officials said 
the boycott plan was drafted by the communications workers of 
america and the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
those unions are negotiating with the atampt but have made little 
progress toward resolving substantial differences over wages and 
health care 
officials of both unions say their talks which opened the last 
week of march snagged immediately over an atampt proposal to shift 
health care costs to workers by making employees pay 20 percent of 
medical bills and by placing caps on lifetime and retiree benefits 
atampt says its current health care plan which fully pays medical 
expenses costs 1 billion a year 
the unions say they also expect major differences with the 
company on wages but havent goten to that because of the health 
care debate 
contracts for 175000 union members expire may 27 longdistance 
charges are atampts largest income source 
cwa spokeswoman francine zucker said both unions in the event 
of a boycott would recommend that unions and the members use us 
sprint because gte owns part of us sprint and workers at gteowned 
regional phone companies are represented by unions 
she said no workers at other longdistance carriers are 
represented by unions or have any link to a unionrepresented 
company 
atampt officials have criticized the plan saying the unions could 
hurt their members by sending business to competitors 
but the unions have said they need such options to mount an 
effective strike because technology would allow atampt to continue 
longdistance service even if both unions walked off the job

allergan optical and minnesota mining amp 
manufacturing co tuesday introduced contact lenses that the 
companies said pose less health risk to eyes than any extendedwear 
soft lenses currently available 
the allergan advent lenses are designed to meet the eyes 
critical need for oxygen the companies said at a new york news 
conference 
the flexible material of the new lens allows virtually the same 
amount of oxygen to reach the eye as when no lens is being worn 
the companies said 
reduced oxygen has been identified as one of key dangers of 
overnight and longterm lens wearing it can cause abnormal 
swelling of the eyes outer coating the cornea and lead to 
permanent visiondistoring eye damage 
the advent lenses which will be available nationally later this 
month establish a new fourth category of contact lens which 3m 
and allergan optical call flexible fluoropolymer existing lenses 
on the market come under one of three categories hard soft or 
rigid gas permeable 
the new lenses also are designed to be more resistant to the 
buildup of deposits making them easier to care for deposits can 
impair the visionenhancing properties of lenses cause discomfort 
and possibly eye infections 
the safety of extendedwear lenses has been the subject of study 
and debate in the eye care industry for years 
last month bausch amp lomb inc the worlds leading maker of 
contact lenses started to advise against keeping in its 
extendedwear soft contact lenses for more than a week without 
removing and cleaning them 
extendedwear lenses which debuted commercially in 1984 
currently have government approval to be worn continuously for up 
to 30 days 
but the food and drug administraion has said it is reviewing its 
policy and the agency is expected to urge contact lens makers to 
voluntarily shorten the maximum period for wearing their lenses to 
a week 
allergan optical a maker of lenses and lenscare products and a 
division of allergan inc based in irvine calif has set seven 
days as the maximum suggested wearing time for the advent lenses 
they are recommended for people who regularly wear lenses for 
extended periods or occasionally overnight the allergan advents 
are expected to compete directly with disposable lenses such as 
the acuvue lens made by a division of johnson amp johnson 
the allergan advents listed for 70 per lens will be 
manufactured by a unit of 3m

a federal judge tuesday rejected a request to 
cut the eightyear sentence of selfstyled financial adviser david 
bloom who admitted diverting 10 million of investors money to 
fund a lavish lifestyle 
bloom 24 of manhattan is serving two consecutive fouryear 
sentences at the allenwood pa federal prison camp after pleading 
guilty to one count each of mail fraud and securities fraud 
bloom who was dubbed the wall street whiz kid by local 
newspapers admitted that money given him to invest by friends and 
relatives was spent instead on expensive artwork luxury cars and 
expensive homes 
he asked us district judge david n edelstein who sentenced 
bloom last december to reduce the prison term because it was 
harsh compared with the sentences of other white collar 
criminals and because bloom is remorseful and undergoing 
psychological treatment 
but edelstein noted that bloom made those claims when he was 
sentenced and that his crime involved cheating friends and 
colleagues while other convicted white collar thieves were 
charged with crimes that although they involved more money 
involved fraud on the system not particular individuals

american airlines and the transport workers union 
reached agreement in principle tuesday on a contract for the 
carriers 23000 ground service workers after 2 weeks of mediation 
details of the contract were not released pending agreement on 
final language and a vote by the membership 
a company news release said the agreement was reached after 27 
hours of continuous bargaining 
the release said american vice president charles pasciuto and 
twu international vice president john kerrigan said the agreement 
benefits both the company and the union and will enable american to 
continue the growth plan that has made the airline an industry 
leader 
the mediation was requested after union members turned down 
americans 610 million offer 
the offer included raises of as much as 99 percent for some 
workers but union leaders objected to a twotier wage scale under 
which it takes new hires as long as 12 years to reach top pay the 
union had sought to reduce that to about five years 
the union also objected to provisions under which employees 
would contribute to the company health plan for the first time 
airline officials complained that the contract was a victim of 
union politics because several locals were in the midst of election 
campaigns and candidates used the contract as an issue 
the fouryear pact became amendable on march 1 
under federal law airline contracts do not expire if the two 
sides cannot reach agreement a mediator is called in to spark 
negotiations if the mediator declares an impasse in the talks 
there is then a 30day cooling off period a strike can be called 
only after that period expires 
the twu represents about 23000 of americans 67000 employees 
its members include the airlines mechanics bag handlers ground 
crews stock clerks guards meteorologists and aircraft cleaners 
also tuesday americans parent company amr corp confirmed it 
is on the verge of ordering about 100 new commuter aircraft in a 
several hundred million dollar deal 
the aircraft seating 3040 people would be used for the 
companys amr eagle inc subsidiary that feeds some of its major 
hubs 
published reports have said the company is leaning toward 
swedish manufacture saab although others mentioned as possible 
suppliers include boeing canadadehavilland division based near 
toronto and atr a frenchitalian company 
fort worthbased amr is coming off its most profitable year 
ever during which it became the nations largest carrier amr 
posted a 1988 profit of 4768 million a 1403 percent increase 
from 1987 and 379 percent higher than the previous record of 
3458 million in 1985 
the company also reported a firstquarter profit of 101 
million a 477 percent jump from 1988s first three months 
operating revenues were 245 billion 
the purchase would be the fourth by american this year in 
march american announced a 309 billion deal with dutch 
manufacturer fokker for 75 f100 planes and options for another 75 
and an approximately 2 billion purchase of 25 boeing 757s and 10

the transportation department gave final 
approval tuesday to federal express corps takeover of the flying 
tigers air cargo service on the condition that federal give up its 
usjapan small package service 
approval came after the white house indicated it would not 
object to the acquisition according to documents filed by the 
department the justice department earlier said it would not oppose 
the 880 million deal announced in december 1988 by both companies 
the acquisition gives memphis tennbased federal express a 
foothold in the international air cargo business 
the department order considered several objections from other 
air freight companies 
it transfers the foreign certificate authorities of the flying 
tiger line inc also known as flying tigers to federal express 
provided that federal surrenders its certificate for small package 
service between the united states and japan effective with the 
start of service by a replacement carrier 
the new certificates are issued both in the names of flying 
tigers and federal express giving the company the option of 
operating under either name 
federal express which serves the united states with 104 cargo 
jets and 137 smaller planes established routes to brussels and 
tokyo before acquiring flying tigers it has 63000 employees 
worldwide 
flying tigers with 6500 employees operates 37 cargo jets and 
two passengers planes with scheduled cargo service to north and 
south america asia europe the south pacific and the middle east 
the flying tiger line was founded in 1945 by pilots who fought 
with maj gen claire chennaults fighter group the flying tigers 
which flew missions over china in 1941 
tiger international tigers parent company almost was forced 
into liquidation in 1986 after a run of losses analysts blamed on 
unsuccessful diversification efforts high salaries and high fuel 
prices but employees agreed to take a pay cut the company showed

ltv corp buffeted by cost increases in aircraft 
programs and a 25 percent decline in steel operating income 
reported a firstquarter profit tuesday of 766 million down 
sharply from a year earlier excluding a onetime charge 
in the first quarter of 1988 the dallasbased conglomerate 
suffered a net loss of 212 billion but that period included a 
onetime charge of 226 billion resulting from a change in 
accounting for postemployment medical and life insurance benefits 
without the charge ltvs income for the first quarter of 1988 
was 1312 million 
first quarter sales declined to 16 billion from 19 billion 
in the first quarter in 1988 sales results for the companys steel 
bar division were being held for disposition 
sales declines in aircraft and energy products were offset by 
higher sales in missiles and electronics 
in releasing its first quarter earnings the company said cost 
increases are expected in its ya7f aircraft development program 
and higher unit costs are projected on production of boeing 747 
commercial aircraft components 
the decline in first quarter sales and operating income 
reflects ltvs continuing rationalization of steel operations and 
the cost increases in the two aircraft programs said raymond a 
hay chairman and chief executive officer 
ltv attributed the decline in steel operating income to the sale 
last year of its warren ohio steel plant 
demand for flat rolled steel remained firm most of our 
facilities are operating at a high percentage of capacity and 
orders are strong through the second quarter hay said

japonica partners and cnw corp the hunter and 
the prey reported little progress tuesday at a meeting between 
representatives of the new york investment group and the rail 
holding company 
japonica has made a hostile bid for cnw and each said the other 
was to blame for the outcome of a meeting monday that was called to 
evaluate the takeover offer 
cnw officials said japonica barred any progress in the talks by 
refusing to supply more information about equity and debt 
commitments that might affect its 44pershare offer for cnws 
outstanding common stock 
japonica shot back calling the threehour session a phantom 
meeting 
we have been informed that cnws directors have not authorized 
their advisers to commence merger negotiations with japonica 
partners japonica said in a statement 
japonica holds 88 percent of cnws 164 million outstanding 
shares 
fredric spar a japonica spokesman said the meeting occurred in 
new york with attorneys and bankers from salomon brothers inc and 
goldman sachs amp co representing a special committee formed by cnw 
to examine the takeover offer 
japonica partners offered to enter into a merger agreement at 
44 within 72 hours while permitting cnw to actively seek higher 
offers both before the agreement is entered into and for a 
reasonable period thereafter japonica said 
it is incomprehensible to us that the board that one year ago 
wanted stockholders to sell their shares at 31 now refuses to 
negotiate in good faith our fully financed offer at a nearly 50 
percent premium japonica said 
cnw countered by saying representatives of its special committee 
had attempted to work out a confidentiality agreement that would 
give japonica prompt access to cnws management and private 
information the chicago company said japonica had been unwilling 
to conclude such an agreement 
cnws principal subsidiary is the chicago and north western 
transportation co which operates a ninestate 6000mile freight 
system with 8500 employees cnw also has real estate holdings and 
runs chicagoarea commuter rail lines 
it earned 81 million on revenues of 9954 million in 1988 
japonica said it would pare cnw to its core railroad freight 
business and consider selling off its real estate excess equipment 
and commuter rail lines

the environmental protection agency proposed 
on tuesday to limit the maximum amounts of 38 types of 
cancercausing chemicals and other pollutants found in drinking 
water a move that will cause increases in some household water 
bills 
but the epa said it cant meet a congressional deadline on two 
dozen other water pollutants because it is short of money and staff 
the 38 chemicals including many widely used pesticides and 
other highly toxic carcinogens must be monitored and kept below 
the required levels in all public drinking water under the epa 
regulations issued tuesday the rules will be made final after a 
period for public comment 
but epa officials said local water officials will have another 
18 months before they will be required to comply even longer 
phasein periods could be negotiated if local officials can show 
economic hardship officials said 
michael cook director of the epa office which deals with 
drinking water contaminants said most public water systems already 
meet the proposed requirements but additional purification 
equipment will probably be needed in about 2500 public systems 
serving about 2 million people mostly in rural areas 
in some cases a household water bill could go up as much as 
460 a year although the increase will generally be much lower 
cook said the additional costs will chiefly be because of 
equipment 
the epa estimated that the cost of public water in areas where 
additional pollution controls are required could increase from 10 
to 460 a year depending on the size of the water system and the 
contaminant and treatment technology involved 
the water systems likely to be in violation of the federal 
standard will account for roughly 3 percent of all the water 
systems in the country and provide water for 2 million people said 
cook 
private wells are not covered by the regulations 
cook said that when the regulations covering 17 pesticides and 
21 other pollutants take effect the epa will have established 
maximum allowable levels for 55 of 83 dangerous drinking water 
contaminants singled out for action by congress nearly three years 
ago 
many of those federal standards probably will not go into effect 
for another year or more however 
three years ago congress told the epa to establish federal 
standards on all 83 pollutants by june 1 of this year but cook 
said the agency wont be able to meet the deadline on the 28 
remaining chemicals he said the process is expected to take 
another year as maximum safe levels and water treatment techniques 
for each of the remaining contaminants are worked out 
if we had more money and manpower we could have sped those 
calculations up said cook blaming agency budget constraints 
and staff shortages for not being able to meet the deadline 
the proposed standards cover 17 pesticides including alachlor 
aldicarb and atrazine which are widely used in agriculture 11 
synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to cause cancer or 
damage to the nervous system and eight inorganic chemicals 
including asbestos mercury cadmium nitrates and nitrites and 
two chemicals used to treat drinking water 
the regulations also will require local water officials to 
monitor the chemical levels in their water supply at times as 
frequently as every three months and to make public those 
occasions when the federal standards are exceeded 
while most of the nations water supply is already thought to be 
in compliance with the federal standards cook said about 2500 
small mostly rural water systems likely will violate the 
regulations unless they install additional equipment 
officials operating about 80000 water systems likely will have 
to increase monitoring activities to comply with the federal rules 
the requirements are important steps in the continuing effort 
to assure that americans have the safest drinking water in the 
world said cook 
but some epa critics maintained that the regulations while slow 
in coming are also too weak 
jacqueline warren an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the maximum levels required by the epa is 
significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of 
states 
furthermore she said the epa is lifting some water pollutant 
standards including the ones for aluminum and silver both pose 
health risks she said

consumers environmentalists and politicians in scattered cities 
joined tuesday in a oneday boycott exxon campaign over its 
huge oil spill in alaska and over rising gasoline prices in the 
industry in general 
state attorneys general in the northwest and us senators from 
nebraska called for a federal investigation of why gasoline prices 
have risen sharply since the march 24 exxon valdez spill 
we are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil 
company that doesnt understand its responsibility to protect the 
environment said massachusetts state sen carol amick at a 
boycott rally in boston 
j edward surette jr executive director of the bay state 
gasoline retailers association in billerica mass said his group 
surveyed dealers tuesday but found that it was too early to assess 
the impact of the boycott 
surette accused exxon corp of obvious negligence but said 
it was unfair for consumers to vent their anger at dealers most of 
whom are small independent businessmen 
consumer activist ralph nader said in washington that exxon 
should not be allowed to forget the alaskan spill and that a 
boycott was the way to send a message to the oil giant 
nader joined representatives from several environmental and 
consumer groups in accusing exxon of failing to be prepared for the 
spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that has fouled 
hundreds of miles of alaskas coast 
consumer groups in alaska connecticut and new york state also 
asked consumers to join the boycott 
in anchorage about 400 chanting and signwaving protesters 
rallied in front of exxons alaska headquarters urging consumers 
to boycott exxon products 
in portland ore more than 100 people rallied in the shadow of 
alaskan oil tankers being repaired at the shipyard where the 
ruptured exxon valdez is scheduled to be inspected next month 
business was off at cross keyes exxon in sicklerville nj 
where some customers cut up their exxon credit cards and turned 
them in 
in the morning you usually get a lot of business here but 
its dropped off said mechanic joseph saiia said aint nobody 
in there 
exxon issued a statement calling the boycott unjust and added 
exxon believes in the basic fairness of the american people and 
is confident that they will see exxons employees dealers and 
owners as victims of human error not as an institution that should 
be discriminated against for an accident that occurred while we 
were doing our job 
concern over tight gasoline supplies for the summer driving 
season escalated following the alaska oil spill and an explosion at 
a north sea oil rig crude oil prices have risen more than 7 a 
barrel since january 
since the exxon valdez accident gas prices have increased an 
average 10 percent nationally while the pacific northwest saw 
surges as high as 25 percent in less than a month said marla rae 
executive assistant to oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer 
exxon spokeswoman sarah johnson said 10000 credit cards out of 
7 million have been cut up and returned to the company since the 
spill 
exxon said it had received no reports from dealers of a loss in 
volume of gasoline sold as a result of the credit card return or 
from boycotts 
about 5 percent or 620 of the 12400 exxon brand stations in 
the united states are owned and operated by exxon the rest are 
independent 
the exxon boycott was endorsed by 16 democratic california 
legislators we want to show exxon that corporations who harm the 
environment will pay a price in the marketplace said assemblyman 
tom bates 
twenty oregon legislators also joined tuesday in a call to 
support the boycott 
attorneys general of three northwest states want the nations 
chief law officer to investigate why oil prices have risen sharply 
especially since the exxon valdez ripped its hull on a reef in 
alaskas prince william sound 
frohnmayer ken eikenberry of washington and jim jones of idaho 
announced monday they will ask us attorney general richard 
thornburgh and daniel oliver chairman of the federal trade 
commission for an investigation of gas prices 
us sens james exon and bob kerrey both nebraska democrats 
called on thornburgh to investigate potential price gouging by the 
industry since the spill they noted that gas prices in nebraska 
rose 20 percent from the first of march until midapril

mcdonnell douglas helicopter co on tuesday 
announced the planned layoff of 450 workers this month with about 
the same number to follow next year 
president bill brown blamed the firings on a slowdown in attack 
helicopter production 
he said temporary and regular employees would be laid off 
including workers at plants in mesa and culver city calif and in 
all divisions 
the helicopter division of mcdonnell douglas corp has 5000 
employees at its mesa plant and 3000 in culver city 
the company has been building about 10 ah64 apache attack 
helicopters a month but the pentagon has ordered that rate cut 
back to six a month beginning june 1990 
mcdonnell douglas has delivered about 460 apaches on a contract 
that called for 975 but president bush said two weeks ago in 
unveiling his defense cuts that the army now wants only 807 a drop 
of 168 
the division also builds the md500 series of light helicopters 
and a variety of automatic cannons 
the apache suffered a major setback earlier this year when the 
commander of the armys 82nd aviation brigade at fort bragg nc 
complained that it was unreliable he said all 12 of the apaches in 
his unit were incapacitated at points during a war exercise and 
only five were in operating condition at the end

northwest airlines a takeover target of los 
angeles billionaire marvin davis on tuesday resumed contract talks 
with its 5000member pilots union 
negotiations were scheduled to continue through friday 
according to a spokesman for the air line pilots association 
northwest chairman steven rothmeier has said a closed contract 
is needed if the airline is to make a deal with friendly investors 
to thwart a hostile buyout bid by davis 
the oil mogul has launched a 27 billion or 90ashare 
tender offer rejected by the board of directors of northwests 
parent nwa inc 
as many as four groups of friendly investors have expressed an 
interest in buying or investing in the airline but dont want to 
face the possibility of a pilots strike rothmeier has said 
the contract would unify the wages seniority rights and working 
conditions of the pilots who have been working under separate 
pacts since northwest acquired republic airlines in the fall of 
1986 
there are more than 100 items that we are in disagreement 
over said jim halvorson an alpa spokesman 
important issues left unresolved include earnings and the right 
for northwest to use nonunion labor 
the pilots want assurances that nonunion pilots wont be hired 
to fly new planes purchased by northwests jet leasing subsidiary 
halvorson said 
any airplanes they buy we fly he said 
rothmeier has said the companys position on the issue is firm 
northwest has offered only small hourly wage increases but has 
said wages for most pilots will increase as much as 38 percent 
under a broad upgrade in classifications for current pilots 
the concept is good but the numbers that they gave us were 
not adequate halvorson said 
talks between the two sides were last held in midapril and 
broke off as scheduled rothmeier pleaded for expedited 
negotiations because of the takeover threat but the pilots 
declined 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said the company would not 
comment on the status of negotiations

el paso electric co blamed the state 
public utility commission as it announced tuesday a 57 million 
loss for the first quarter and a suspension of its commonstock 
dividend for the rest of 1989 
the loss was blamed on disastrous investments in a nuclear power 
plant and in nonutilityrelated real estate a spokesman said the 
companys 20 million in tax writeoffs for the quarter were an 
effort to cut its losses and begin recovering from bad investments 
for the quarter the company lost 57 million on revenue of 
953 million compared with earnings of 139 million or 40 cents 
a share on revenue of 895 million during the first three months 
of 1988
