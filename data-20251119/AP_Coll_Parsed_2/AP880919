lithuanianborn american arbit blatas has returned 
to his homeland to build the first soviet monument to jews killed 
during world war ii his wife former metropolitan opera star 
regina resnik said monday 
lithuanian authorities chose blatas to build the memorial in the 
old jewish section of the ancient city of vilnius the capital of 
the republic on the baltic sea said miss resnik 
she said that blatas a jewish sculptor and painter whose mother 
died in a nazi gas chamber returned to lithuania this month to 
discuss with architects and vilnius city officials plans for the 
monument as part of the first jewish state museum in the soviet 
union 
the monument will be similar to one blatas built in new york 
city on dag hammarskjold plaza near the united nations she said 
that monument depicts seven stages of the holocaust from 
deportation of jews to the final solution hitlers plan to 
exterminate the jews 
miss resnik now a broadway actress spoke in a telephone 
interview from vilnius 
hitlers nazi forces are believed to have killed at least 
220000 jews in lithuania all but wiping out the areas jewish 
population lithuania had one of the largest jewish populations on 
soviet territory and was a jewish cultural and scholarly center 
lithuanian jewish activists began a campaign six months ago to 
restore the jewish ghetto of vilnius and work is now under way 
miss resnik said generally soviet officials portray hitlers 
attack as a common tragedy for all soviet citizens and are 
reluctant to acknowledge the especially heavy toll suffered by jews 
but lithuanian authorities gave their blessing to the holocaust 
monument and museum and several articles on the projects have 
appeared in the staterun local press miss resnik said

before the first shuttle flight in 1981 in 
the whiteknuckle days when space engineers still wondered if the 
engines would fire and the heat shield would hold up for reentry 
nasa had a launch schedule that seemed either very optimistic or 
just plain crazy 48 flights in five years 
as recently as 1985 the agency was scheduling 24 flights in 
1989 alone 
over the years the national aeronautics and space 
administration had given a proud name to its philosophy for such 
ambitious planning success oriented a skeptic would ask how 
can you expect to launch 24 missions in one year and a nasa 
official would respond its a successoriented schedule but 
thats our goal 
now for the first postchallenger launch successoriented has 
given way to safety first 
successoriented is a system in which nasa sets a work schedule 
that allows no coasting and presumes no delays its a sort of 
antimurphys law if anything can go right it will go right and 
at just the right time in lifeordeath circumstances it is a 
calculated method for achieving intensity and maximum results 
from the limited tax resources available for spaceflight 
aim for 48 come as close as you can nasa flew 21 flights in 
those first five years 
before long the real murphys law often took over the 24th 
mission with celebrity astronaut rep bill nelson on board was 
rescheduled a record seven times before the congressman and crew 
finally was launched into space on jan 12 1986 landing was 
delayed three times and then rerouted from florida to california 
the next flight went to challenger and its tragic end on jan 
28 1986 forced nasa to rethink and abandon the successoriented 
work routine 
instead the agency moved slowly cautiously and as quietly as 
possible in preparing discovery for its mission to end nasas 
32month absence from spaceflight 
nasa waited until this past saturday to set its final launch 
date thursday sept 29 959 am edt at one point the agency 
was so intent on not setting a launch date that it cited a 
hurricane off texas not florida to delay its announcement 
another 48 hours 
successoriented not this time 
yet over the years the nasa doctrine had its good days 
success oriented put neil armstrong on the moon 
it is difficult today to recall how outlandish it seemed in 1961 
when president kennedy called on nasa to harness the dedication 
organization and discipline to put man on the moon by 1970 
americas space program was in its bumbling infancy the soviets 
had humiliated the united states with sputnik and then with yuri 
gagarin alan shepard had made a suborbital flight but no american 
had even orbited the earth let alone achieved any of the other 
requirements rendezvous space walks powerful new rocket engines 
lunar landing vehicles that would allow nasa to realize kennedys 
goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and 
returning him safely to the earth 
nasa completed its mercury gemini and apollo programs with a 
successoriented work regime that provided the united states some 
of its proudest moments the approach worked so well that even 
after the apollo 1 launch pad fire while mourning three 
astronauts nasa quickly fixed the problem and the program moved 
forward a 32month delay it was beyond comprehension 
by 1986 though successoriented may have been more of a 
problem than a solution the agency had always operated 
conservatively tolerating launch delays whatever the gentle 
ridicule from the public or the media but there came a tendency 
among some nasa managers to maybe wink at some problems among them 
an inadequate booster rocket design after seven scrubs for the 
bill nelson launch and two delays getting challenger off the 
ground nasa rocketry managers didnt want to hear about orings on 
the morning of jan 28 1986 they wanted to launch cold weather 
or not 
im appalled at your recommendation a nasa rocket manager 
george hardy said in disgust to engineers who tried to block the 
launch 
it wont happen that way next week safety first will rule the 
day 
it wouldnt surprise me at all if it took us two or three 
times to get airborne says richard truly the exastronaut who 
now runs the nasa shuttle program were going to wait until we 
have it right and then were going to do it

a political adviser to president reagan 
described him in 1984 as a candidate who had run out of 
ammunition but whose strength was that he believed he couldnt be 
held responsible for his own administrations record according to 
a taperecorded account reported in a new book 
the book landslide by reporters jane mayer of the wall 
street journal and doyle mcmanus of the los angeles times 
describes a meeting of three reagan advisers on june 30 1984 in a 
conference room of reaganbush campaign headquarters 
the meeting was highly confidential the authors write 
but in this case the discussion was tape recorded and although 
the participants intended that the tapes stay secret they did 
not 
the authors do not say how they obtained the tapes which they 
say ran for four hours 
stuart spencer a veteran reagan strategist who chaired the 
meeting is quoted as saying at the outset the problem is weve 
been talking to everybody at the white house over the past few days 
and the reagan administration fired all its bullets very early 
and very successfully in the first two years 
all their plans all their priorities all their programs 
said spencer theyve run out of ammunition 
spencer is now an adviser to sen dan quayle of indiana running 
mate of republican presidential nominee george bush spencer did 
not immediately return a telephone call sunday seeking comment at 
his office in california 
later in that june 1984 meeting pollster robert teeter is 
quoted as saying that although reagan had run successfully as an 
outsider in 1980 you might have a problem people are beginning 
to believe that whats in place in washington is ronald reagans 
spencer whose association with reagan went back to his days as 
governor of california in the 1960s and 1970s replied he can 
pull it off in 1970 he pulled it off 
in his campaign for reelection as governor spencer argued 
reagan ran against the government he was running 
i mean he believes hes above it all said spencer he 
believes it thats why they believe it i cant believe it but 
they do 
according to the book the tape also shows the strategists 
seeking to overcome first lady nancy reagans resistance to having 
the president do a two or threeday campaign trip before the 
republican national convention in august 1984 
her reasoning is you dont put the actor onstage before the 
show starts spencer is quoted as saying she thinks the 
convention is the show i tried to make her see that youre talking 
about two different shows two different nights i think i finally 
got through to her 
the authors conclude that mrs reagan although the advisers did 
not know it evidently was relying on astrological advice her use 
of an astrologer was revealed earlier this year by former white 
house chief of staff donald t regan in his book for the 
record 
teeter is quoted as saying on the tape that advisers to reagans 
1984 opponent walter mondale were working on some examples that 
he reagan doesnt know what hes doing 
to counter this spencer suggested that the president give three 
or four sophisticated speeches in which he would talk about 
things like sound money constitutional reform education things 
that when he gets through people will think he sure as hell knows 
something without really saying something 
teeter also suggested presidential events with young people to 
help inoculate against the idea that he doesnt know whats going 
on 
as the advisers sought issues for the campaign the authors 
write the tapes show that spencer suggested reagan say something 
about acid rain and all that stuff because he was perceived as 
vulnerable on environmental issues 
speechwriter ken khachigian responded were better off 
without it if you get the old man going on it he does killer 
trees 
the killer trees phrase originated after reagan expressed 
the view in his 1980 campaign that trees cause air pollution

for the first time in seven years americans 
will each consume a smaller portion of meat next year averaging 
about 2 percent less than they did in 1988 according to a forecast 
by the agriculture department 
the 1989 per capita forecast of red meat and poultry consumption 
is 2159 pounds down from an estimated record of 2201 pounds this 
year 
overall total red meat and poultry production is expected to 
decline about 1 percent in 1989 from this years record level 
lower beef output and a leveling off in the pork and turkey supply 
will more than offset increases in broiler production 
even so us total production of red meat and poultry is 
expected to be the second largest on record 
the per capita consumption estimates are all in retail weights 
reflecting cuts as they are sold to consumers the weights do not 
take into consideration further trimming or boning at home prior to 
cooking shrinkage during cooking or table waste 
ron gustafson of the departments economic research service said 
it will be the first time since 1982 that per capita meat 
consumption has not matched or exceeded the previous years average 
in 1982 he said in a telephone interview friday the average 
consumption of red meat and poultry was 2018 pounds for each 
american down from 207 pounds in 1981 
looking at the 1989 projections which were published in a newly 
released outlook report by the agency beef consumption is expected 
to decline further to 667 pounds per capita from 718 pounds this 
year 
pork consumption is expected to average 628 pounds per person 
next year down slightly from 637 in 1988 
including small amounts of veal lamb and mutton total red meat 
consumption in 1989 is forecast at about 1324 pounds per person 
down from 1384 indicated for 1988 total poultry by comparison 
is expected to increase to around 836 pounds in 1989 from 817 
this year 
although some of the decline in per capita red meat consumption 
can be attributed to the health concerns of some consumers usda 
officials say there are many other factors including the economy 
and how much money families have to spend on food the cattle 
cycle with its patterns of supply buildup and then gradual 
liquidation is another factor 
gustafson said that still another recent factor has been the 
closer trimming of retail cuts of beef since 1986 with more retail 
stores removing much of the fat from beef cuts there is less 
moving into consumer use which reduces the poundage compared 
with earlier years

despite this years yieldslashing drought 
people should keep in mind that surplus crop production still is a 
major problem in us agriculture says orville l freeman 
president of the agriculture council of america 
the drought of 1988 bitter as it is for us farmers should 
not obscure the fact that the chronic longterm problem in 
agriculture has been one of overcapacity and that we must continue 
to seek and expand markets freeman said in a council newsletter 
the aca is a privately supported organization based in 
washington its major interests include us agricultural trade 
policy and programs 
freeman who was secretary of agriculture for eight years in the 
kennedy and johnson administrations said it is well to remember 
that world food shortages in the mid1960s and mid1970s were 
followed quickly by surplus production 
true the drought year 1988 is a much greater hardship for 
american farmers than those other years he said but while 
praying for the return of good weather next year we must continue 
to create customers for our products and work toward a world system 
that encourages trade

once again the agriculture department is 
trying to tell us that jack frost really doesnt paint the autumn 
leaves with vivid colors 
another story is that indians kill the celestial bear each 
fall and his blood drips from heaven to give the leaves their 
hues the usda says 
but stan krugman of the departments forest service says frost 
has little to do with the beautiful fall colors although cooler 
weather does enhance them 
heres his explanation 
during the summer the tree continually replenishes the 
chlorophylls it uses up making food and the leaves remain green 
as autumn approaches changes in daylight and temperature slow food 
production and the tree uses up the chlorophylls faster than it 
replaces them 
as the chlorophylls decrease so does the green color 
allowing other pigments that were hidden by the leaves greenness 
to show through

americas troubled atomic power industry has 
started spending millions of dollars on advertising aimed at 
rebuilding public support for nuclear energy 
the advertisements make the argument that nuclear power helps 
reduce dangerous us dependence on foreign oil imports 
antinuclear activists however say the ads are misleading 
because only about 4 percent of us oil consumption goes toward 
generating electricity they contend that the industry is 
belittling or ignoring safety risks involved with nuclear power 
spearheading the pronuclear campaign is the us council for 
energy awareness a washingtonbased trade association largely 
supported by the nuclear industry usceas advertising and public 
relations activities are augmented by other groups including the 
edison electric institute also based in washington representing 
the nations investorowned utilities 
carl goldstein a uscea spokesman said that about 7 million of 
the organizations 17 million annual budget goes to advertising 
the ad campaign includes a 15second spot that ran during the 
cbs evening news and saturday afternoon baseball games on nbc this 
summer 
the cartoonstyle ad depicts a person perched atop oil drums as 
they speed up and down a roller coaster then the person is flung 
into midair and floats back to earth using a parachute emblazoned 
with the words coal and nuclear 
an announcer intones the problem with foreign oil is that 
price and supply go up and down to get off this roller coaster 
america can use its own coal and nuclear energy america can count 
on coal and nuclear energy 
uscea is striving to convey a similar message spelled out in 
greater detail in advertisements in the wall street journal and 
magazines including time newsweek us news amp world report 
readers digest national geographic forbes and sports illustrated 
one ad says even though most americans believe that nuclear 
energy will continue to play an important role in our nations 
energy future no new nuclear power plants are currently being 
planned at present too many financial political licensing and 
regulatory uncertainties stand in the way of americas further 
developing its nuclear energy resources 
criticism of usceas advertising campaign has come from the safe 
energy communication council a washingtonbased coalition of 13 
energy environmental and public interest groups 
current national television and magazine advertisements 
promoting nuclear power as a solution to foreign oil dependence are 
misleading and irresponsible the council said in a statement 
it contended that since nuclear power provides only 
electricity it cannot substantially reduce us dependence on 
foreign oil energy efficiency and conservation provide the 
greatest potential for reducing us dependence on foreign oil and 
helping avert another oil crisis 
according to the organization aggressive energy efficiency 
programs in the transportation industrial commercial and 
residential sectors can yield seven times the oil savings possible 
with nuclear power 
scott denman the councils director said that when compared 
to energy efficiency and conservation the economic and 
environmental costs of nuclear power make it an undesirable 
alternative to oilfired electricity 
to counter the uscea campaign the council is distributing 
public service announcements to radio stations 
in one actor robert redford tells listeners this year the 
nuclear industry is spending millions to sell you on nuclear power 
and also saying solar energy is not practical today yet every year 
more solar energy equipment is being bought by consumers and even 
utilities to power a variety of our energy needs 
nuclear energy creates wastes conservation creates jobs 
dont get sold on nuclear power we cant afford the price 
redford says in the radio spot 
usceas goldstein defended the advertising campaign saying i 
have absolutely no trouble with our ads and neither have the media 
who have carried them 
the content of these ads is very carefully researched and 
tested externally before the ads are prepared he said we can 
back up every statement in the ads 
goldstein said uscea believes that nuclear power is an 
important component of the drive for energy selfsufficiency at 
the same time he added we do not say that energy efficiency or 
other energy sources should be neglected 
according to goldstein uscea is trying to alert the american 
public to a serious looming energy problem growth of the 
demand for electricity outstripping the ability of utilities in 
some areas of the country to provide the power 
many utilities he said are reluctant to invest in nuclear or 
coalburning baseload generating capacity but are resorting to 
oil or gasfired combustion turbines as a shortterm option for 
coping with peaks in electrical demand 
its happening even more than we had expected because oil 
prices have collapsed goldstein said utilities are now being 
seduced by these low oil prices into thinking they should build 
more oilfired capacity

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen waved his hand and his threehelicopter entourage climbed 
into the sky black against the setting sun 
on the ground his staff waved back and the national press corps 
shuffled away for that evening vice presidential candidate 
bentsen had become texas sen bentsen campaigning for reelection 
nearly everywhere he goes in his vice presidential campaign 
travels bentsen makes time to slip away sometimes by helicopter 
or private plane to tend to his senate campaign 
he campaigns publicly for the vice presidency for the senate 
election he is relying on a strong organization millions of 
dollars in advertising and a reputation built over three terms 
bentsen asked once by reporters if his dual campaigns werent 
confusing to the voters of texas said the answer was simple 
vote twice for bentsen he said 
vice presidential campaign manager joseph oneill said this 
awkward system is the result of bentsens effort to comply fully 
with federal election laws which have never been tested in regard 
to texas unusual provision for dual campaigns 
this is virgin territory oneill said 
were working very hard to see that we follow not only the 
letter of the law but the spirit of the law bentsen said in an 
interview 
i leave it up to the lawyers and accountants to be damn sure 
we comply bentsen said then i dont worry about it i go ahead 
and campaign 
as michael dukakis running mate bentsen receives public 
funding for his vice presidential campaign for his senate race 
the sky is the limit in fundraising and hes spending his 
millions in the state on organization and television 
one of the reasons that bentsen is carefully dividing the two 
campaigns is that bentsens republican senate opponent rep beau 
boulter asked the federal election commission to step in and block 
what he contended was an unfair advantage 
the fec declined to act and so did the federal courts but the 
case caused bentsen enough political grief that he bought 
television time in texas to explain his reasoning to the voters 
resigning from the senate seat bentsen said would 
automatically hand a sixyear term to his opponent if he ran won 
and then resigned the voters would get to select a new senator in 
a special election 
boulter has tried to ridicule the dual candidacies with his own 
television spot featuring oldtime cowboys trying to ride two 
horses at one time so far the polls consistently show bentsen 
ahead of boulter by a 2to1 margin but republicans say their 
effort has helped keep bentsen pinned down 
bentsen has been forced to keep separate his senate campaign 
and the 8 million it plans to raise including putting its austin 
headquarters in a building separate from the democratic party and 
the presidential campaign 
if bentsen were not on the ticket we probably would have had 
joint operations said oneill we now dont have that 
advantage to avoid even the appearance of overlap 
since his selection as the vice presidential candidate in july 
bentsen has not made a single public appearance billed as a senate 
candidate 
although legally oneill said there was no question bentsen 
could do a senate campaign trip if he did he would be perceived 
as a vice presidential candidate that might give the republicans 
an excuse to make a charge that had no foundation he said 
we dont expect him to do any senate campaigning oneill 
said 
bentsens campaigns guard against at least any overt 
crosspollination although the division isnt airtight bentsens 
top national campaign aides often tag along to senate events and 
oneill bentsens former top aide in the senate regularly 
consults with the senate campaign as they set up the schedule 
the schedule given to the national press coyly puts those senate 
fundraisers in the category of private meetings 
boulter makes no secret about the fact he wants to tie his 
campaign as closely as possible to george bushs to ride bushs 
coattails and help bush win texas 
boulter sent out a fundraising letter saying that while voters 
cannot legally give directly to bush they can help win texas for 
bush and boulter and defeat lloyd bentsen by giving urgently 
needed dollars to my campaign for the us senate 
jack devore spokesman for bentsens senate campaign says 
boulters actions illustrate the very fine point being pressed 
by the republicans

republican george bush heading to his first 
facetoface encounter with democratic presidential opponent 
michael dukakis has cleared much of this weeks schedule to bone 
up for next sundays debate 
bush is keeping a light campaign itinerary taking day trips out 
of washington and returning in the afternoons to closet himself 
with his debate coaches 
bush today was speaking to the bucks county chamber of commerce 
in pennsylvania after a meeting in philadelphia with roman catholic 
archbishop anthony bevilaqua and retired cardinal john krol 
on tuesday he travels to new jersey to visit the annin flag 
company a business he has cited in speeches as a sign that 
patriotism has been on the rise during the reagan presidency bush 
says flag sales were down when jimmy carter was president but that 
after reagans election business was booming again 
later in the week bush plans a brief campaign trip to texas 
as he prepares for the sunday debate at wake forest university 
in north carolina bush told reporters he is not too good on 
these statistics and needs briefing time to familiarize himself 
with statistical information on various topics that likely will 
come up 
bush and his team have not been hesitant to mention often that 
dukakis is a debating expert and should be expected to perform well 
bush said last week that he isnt nervous about going up against 
dukakis but id like to do well 
hes better than i am on technical style bush said adding 
so ive got to do something else 
he said he hoped he would be able to project who he is as a 
person in keeping with his recent efforts to show a compassionate 
side 
it has to be what you feel and what you are he told 
reporters flying with him last week on air force two 
but bush reflected a calm demeanor toward the debate saying 
i dont view it as make or break or the end of the world or the 
biggest moment of my life

across 20 feet of ankledeep water 
charlie land stares at a brown bear sow 
the bear stares back she scratches her side then lunges at 
land he fills the shrinking gap with a pink cloud of hotpepper 
aerosol a sort of natural tear gas and the bear wheels back to 
her side of the stream 
again she scratches finally she ambles off across the tidal 
flat 
land backsteps up the gravel spit he was defending then turns 
to the three people waiting a dozen steps behind him 
she didnt mean it he says she wasnt serious 
land shrugs off such confrontations as part of his job with the 
alaska department of fish and game enforcing an uneasy truce 
between man and bear at one of the few places where the species 
willingly meet 
pack creek flows into a narrow ocean inlet from a steep valley 
on admiralty island about 30 miles south of juneau the island 
boasts the greatest density in the world of alaska brown bears a 
larger version of the grizzly species 
late each summer about 30 bears congregate at pack creek 
splashing through the shallows after spawning salmon and grazing in 
the surrounding meadow like a herd of cows 
the interlopers game officials say are the increasing numbers 
of wildlife watchers whose eagerness to capture bears on film is 
crowding this corner of wilderness 
pack creek is one of only three observatories in alaska where 
people can readily watch brown bears the two others are so popular 
the state has a visitor limit at one and a lottery for permits to 
the other 
now pack creek is being overwhelmed 
up to 60 people a day hunker on the gravel spit yachts 
congregate offshore bush planes buzz in and out steadily in 1981 
100 people came to pack creek last year the visits topped 990 
until this year visitors and bears chased each other around the 
meadow at pack creek the people in pursuit of photographic 
trophies the bears guarding prime spots on the salmon stream 
but gradually the bears have grown bolder and less intimidated 
by humans they have chased people off the spit and carried away 
packs and food biologists learned from maulings at yellowstone and 
other parks which once had garbage dumps that bears become most 
dangerous when they associate people with food 
we think we have a bomb there and its ticking says ken 
mitchell us forest service director for the admiralty island 
nationl monument 
mitchell backs a plan designed by the forest service and state 
game officials to designate the spit as human turf and leave the 
rest of pack creek to the bears the authorities hope the boundary 
will keep people from being mauled and bears from being killed 
a few bearwatchers are furious 
the bears are all used to people and theyre busy fishing 
they dont mind you says john tillinghast a juneau attorney who 
visited the creek one recent weekend 
tillinghast said it used to be easy to come away from pack creek 
with a standard prize mom and cubs with a 50millimeter lens 
and you didnt have any babysitter from fish and game watching 
you either 
the bear that lunged at land called pest with reason 
prompted the new rule in 1987 a forest service letter file grew 
fat with reports of bold advances by bears along the creek mostly 
pest 
three wildlife watchers reported pest circled them chomping 
and growling then jumped toward them she was turned away by 
hotpepper spray 
a san francisco man told the forest service he was chased into 
the loft of a woodshed the only reason that i did not shoot was 
that there was a similar problem yesterday and the bear did not 
attack he wrote 
tourists abandoned a pizza on the spit while fleeing from an 
approaching bear a researcher recorded the bears reward down to 
the cheese hanging from its snout and paws 
forest service staffers at pack creek pleaded with mitchell to 
do something none of us wants to see pest killed but we feel 
some action must be taken soon to prevent more incidents they 
wrote suggesting the creek be closed to people 
in july 1987 the forest service and alaska fish and game 
announced pest would be killed when the anticipated roar of 
protest came they began work on the less drastic plan adopted this 
year 
enter stan price an irascible 88yearold who loathes 
government officials on principal and who has become a rallying 
point for others opposed to this particular government plan 
price built his cabin and floated it onto the remote banks of 
pack creek more than 30 years ago in the decades since he has 
shared the creek with dozens of bears and raised orphan cubs 
it burns me up price says of the new rules which he feels 
allow game officials to harass the animals i cant say what a 
bears worth i cant say what a bears good for but i know they 
were here before we were 
he reports little conflict with the bears that wander into his 
cabins and woodsheds price calls them tame and says he was injured 
by a bear only once when he mistook a strange animal for a 
familiar one and was swatted on the shoulder as he approached 
price believes the forest service and fish and game have trumped 
up tales of danger so people will believe they need official 
protection at pack creek then in the name of safety the agencies 
can charge admission and turn the creek into a moneymaking 
yellowstone he says 
price knows the bears by name and lineage and becomes distraught 
at thoughts they might be shot or relocated 
state and federal officials have said that if the boundary 
system doesnt work they will relocate pest and if she returns to 
pack creek and causes trouble shell be killed 
the forest service hopes to exercise some crowd control too by 
limiting commercial tours which now account for more than half the 
visitors officials are considering a fee to cover the government 
cost of monitoring pack creek estimated at more than 20000 a 
year they say theres no intent as price suggested of making a 
profit 
someday mitchell predicts therell be need for an observatory 
where hundreds of people can go to watch the bears annual fishing 
binge 
but it wont be at pack creek 
if there are such viewing areas mitchell says they 
probably shouldnt be in wilderness

doctors and relatives 
evelia alvarez gasca goodhumored and playful likes to sing 
and dance her favorite is speedy gonzalez or was before she 
broke the record and pulled the cartridge out of the turntable arm 
sarita valencia corona another of the 19 miracle toddlers 
lives with her grandparents in a community with a view of 
snowcapped volcanos she entertains herself with the chickens 
ducks and cows in the small yard or helps her grandparents tend 
their crops 
jesus manuel figueroa or chuchito possibly the biggest 
miracle of all finally is walking and beginning to talk 
all the babies except chuchito were from a few hours to a few 
days old when the quake struck at 719 am sept 19 1985 
bringing the two hospitals where they were born crashing down 
government figures put the death toll at about 6000 people 
unofficial sources put the toll as high as 32000 including the 
hospitals more than 400 buildings in the city of 18 million were 
destroyed and 5700 damaged the government said 
chuchito was 21 days old when the quake hit in an incubator and 
on intravenous liquids because of problems at birth when the 
12story hospital fell everyone except his mother gave him up for 
dead 
the 19 babies survived amid the rubble from eight hours to 
nearly nine days after the quake cold and almost unconscious 
chuchito was found after a week 
chuchito was just meant to live no matter what happened he 
was going to live said edward sawatzky a canadian who was in 
mexico city when the quake hit and has been helping victims ever 
since 
these babies were under very severe conditions without food 
for a long period with hypothermia hypoglycemia said dr 
barbara hernandez who cares for 14 of them 
they had infected wounds and were dehydrated but only one 
suffered lasting injuries doctors say a boy who suffered a 
deformed hip joint because of infection the boy jesus francisco 
learned to walk four months ago 
hernandez and other doctors say the other babies are normal 
except for one who was born without legs from the knees down and 
chuchito whose slowness in walking and talking they say are due to 
his birth problems 
evelia will have to have surgery on her tear ducts and needs 
orthopedic shoes her aunt said 
about half the children including evelia and sarita lost their 
mothers but all are in what social workers consider to be good 
family situations 
in one sense the babies are lucky they were from poor families 
and have had more medical attention and stimulation than they would 
have had otherwise and they caught the hearts of everyone 
the ones i worry about are the secondary victims who arent 
in the limelight said janet rogozinski head of us private and 
voluntary organizations here the agency channels private donations 
from the united states to earthquake victims 
among them are the six older sisters of lucia another of the 
babies while lucia is cared for by a doting aunt her sisters now 
5 to 12 years old were seriously neglected even though they were 
living in the same household 
with a donation from the united states they are now living and 
going to school in a convent during the week donations also are 
supposed to help build a home for lucias father and sisters on a 
lot left by his wife although neighbors now are claiming the land 
also less fortunate are a boy and his four sisters 3 to 12 who 
lost their parents in the quake and are now in an orphanage 
an american couple was approved as adoptive parents but sources 
familiar with the case say an uncle of the child has blocked the 
process he wants legal custody but does not want the children to 
live with him and denies accusations that he is interested only in 
a trust fund that benefits the children the sources said 
poverty is a besetting problem for the earthquake babies 
families 
saritas father who visits often lives and sells tamales in an 
area of mexico city with no street lighting or other public 
services and dirt streets that are barely passable by car even when 
dry 
evelias aunt uncle and father sell used clothing costume 
jewelry and other items in a market to support themselves and their 
five children 
evelias uncle reynaldo becerra aguillon said sales were down 
and he cant raise his own prices to make up for the higher prices 
they have to pay for food and other items 
we manage to make enough to cover the expenses he said 
not very well but more or less

how israeli arabs vote in the nov 1 election 
may be crucial in deciding a close vote between prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs likud bloc and foreign minister shimon peres 
labor party 
the two major parties are running neck and neck the arabs 
might well decide the election especially if they desert the labor 
party said elihu katz a pollster for the israel institute of 
applied social research 
about 330000 arabs living in israel are eligible to vote this 
year and they could control 14 or 15 seats in the 120member 
parliament if all cast ballots 
in the last elections in 1984 the arab vote gave peres party 
about three seats that turned out to be the margin of advantage 
labor had over likud 44 to 41 seats 
but israeli pundits and arab politicians say labor has lost 
ground with the 800000 arabs with israeli citizenship in the 
nation of 44 million 
this is largely the result of increased israeli arab 
identification with the 15 million palestinians who live in the 
lands captured from jordan and egypt but who do not have the right 
to vote 
since dec 8 266 palestinians have been killed thousands 
wounded and about 18000 jailed as a result of the uprising against 
20 years of israeli occupation 
i believe that the labor party is going to loose 50 percent of 
its traditional arab voters this year because of the situation in 
the west bank and gaza strip said abdel wahab droushe labor 
leaders speak about peace and they do the opposite 
droushe deserted the labor party in april to form his own 
democratic arab party he said he was unable to serve in the same 
party with defense minister yitzhak rabin who ordered the army to 
use bullets clubs and mass arrests to stop the protests 
labor also was embarrassed by the collapse of its peace 
strategy which had relied on jordans king hussein to find 
moderate palestinians acceptable to israel and form a joint 
negotiating team hussein cut most links with the west bank and 
gaza and made clear he was no longer willing to go along with such 
a plan 
emanuel gutmann a political science professor at hebrew 
university said losing the arab vote could be the difference in a 
tight race with likud labor and likud were forced to share power 
after each failed to form a ruling coalition on its own after the 
1984 elections 
the reason there was a government of national unity was 
because there was parity between the left and right it is unlikely 
there will be a repeat of this parity if labor loses two or three 
seats because of the arabs gutmann told an election seminar 
the battle for the arab vote is seen in ads carried by 
arabiclanguage newspapers 
this election is going to decide the future of all of us 
either peace or war states a labor party ad in the weekly al 
sinara in nazareth 
despite its hardline policies and opposition to yielding any 
occupied land likud advertized in the nazareth weekly kol al arab 
stressing its honesty and ability to lead 
likud politicians have argued that the conservatives made peace 
with egypt and are the only bloc that can speak for all of israel 
in peace talks 
in the last elections about 70 percent of the 260000 eligible 
arabs voted and about half of those casting ballots chose israeli 
parties labor garnered 65000 votes to 10000 for likud 
getting a feel for how arabs will vote is difficult because 
israeli pollsters do not survey palesinians in part because 
israeli opinion takers are viewed with suspicion in arab areas 
the only organized opinion sampling is by the bustani 
advertising co and its findings tended to support those of 
israeli analysts such as gutmann and katz who said the arabs would 
shun israeli parties for more radical arab ones 
awad abu sini 52 who owns an appliance store in nazareth said 
he told peres during a visit last month that the labor party was in 
trouble and we hope to hear something new 
abu sini said he would like to see a pledge from labor leaders 
to ease harsh army measures in the west bank and gaza strip 
the west bank is only a halfhour away we have ties of 
religion language and family we are the same people with the same 
feelings and future if they use such force there maybe they will 
use it here he said 
but abu sini said despite such feelings he would still vote for 
labor because it offered the best hope for peace negotiations

pocketbook issues will dominate as voters around the nation 
decide more than 200 ballot issues in november three states in the 
west may cut taxes four others may turn to lotteries to raise 
revenue and california may vote to slash auto insurance rates 
three states may declare english their official language and 
three will consider antiabortion measures 
among the more interesting local issues nevada city calif 
will weigh a ban on steeljaw leg traps voters in fort collins 
colo will consider a homosexual rights amendment oregonians will 
vote on a measure that would impose the nations toughest statewide 
smoking ban and bostonians may choose to create a city within its 
borders named mandela comprising mostly black neighborhoods a 
similar effort to honor the imprisoned south african black leader 
nelson mandela was defeated in 1986 
by far the costliest and hardestfought battle will center on a 
jumble of five conflicting referendums that could require 
california auto insurers to cut their rates to at least 20 percent 
below november 1987 levels and freeze rates until november 1989 
insurance companies are backing two propositions establishing a 
nofault policy for car accidents and limiting lawyers contingency 
fees 
money matters are also uppermost in arkansas colorado south 
dakota and utah 
a proposed colorado taxpayer bill of rights amendment would 
require voter approval to raise state or local taxes and would 
restrict property and other taxes and limit increases in state 
spending but the signatures that put the measure on the ballot 
face a challenge this month that could knock it off 
south dakota proposition ii would limit property taxes to 1 
percent of 1984 values for agricultural property and 2 percent for 
nonagricultural supporters contend that property taxes have gotten 
out of hand and they believe the state should introduce other 
forms of taxation opponents contend the measure would imperil 
school districts 
in utah three initiatives could roll back state and local taxes 
by a combined 320 million one would cut sales gasoline and 
cigarette taxes another would limit property taxes a third would 
provide an estimated 35 million in tax credits for parents who 
send their children to private schools 
in arkansas the secretary of state is to decide in the next 
several weeks whether to place a constitutional amendment on the 
ballot making it harder to raise sales taxes and easier to raise 
the income tax gov bill clinton is a leading supporter 
abortion opponents will take their case to voters in michigan 
arkansas and colorado arkansas secretary of state will rule 
shortly on whether to certify a proposed constitutional amendment 
to ban the use of state funds for abortions except to save a 
mothers life voters narrowly defeated a similar measure two years 
ago 
in michigan antiabortion groups and prochoice advocates both 
plan heavily financed campaigns over whether to end state medicaid 
funding of abortions early polls show antiabortion forces leading 
by a 21 margin 
colorado voters will decide whether to repeal a section of the 
state constitution prohibiting use of state funds for abortion 
colorado arizona and florida have english only amendments 
aimed at declaring english the official state language it is 
unclear what such amendments would accomplish but opponents 
especially hispanics call the measures bigoted and vindictive 
among other key ballot contests 
in massachusetts voters will consider a measure that could 
effectively end production of nuclear power in that state gov 
michael dukakis opposes it and utilities insist they would sue to 
block what they say would amount to an illegal taking of their 
property 
voters in idaho indiana kentucky and minnesota will decide 
whether to clear the way for lotteries despite opposition from 
religious groups and others 
minnesota would use gambling proceeds to protect the states 
natural resources if voters approve a proposed environmental 
resources trust 
in south dakota a proposed amendment would allow limited 
gambling in deadwood the black hills town where wild bill hickok 
was shot while playing poker 
californians will weigh proposition 102 which would impose 
tough guidelines for screening and controlling the spread of aids 
including ending the states ban on aids testing for insurance and 
employment the measure is the latest by paul gann coauthor of 
taxcutting proposition 13 and himself suffering from acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
the oregon lung association is campaigning for what would be 
the nations toughest statewide smoking ban prohibiting tobacco 
use in virtually all public buildings and work areas except 
taverns tobacco stores hotel rooms and offices in private homes 
state law already bans smoking in most public buildings except 
in designated areas 
an initiative in washington state would impose a tax on 
hazardous materials such as petroleum and pesticides to provide for 
their safe disposal a rival issue backed by the legislature and 
business would exempt petroleum products shipped out of state and 
offer covenants not to sue polluters if they take steps to clean up 
hazardous waste sites 
montana residents will consider whether to become the 10th 
state to enact a bottle return bill 
in maryland a ballot measure would repeal that states stiff 
gun control law 
a proposed amendment in rhode island would effectively deny 
bail to those who manufacture or possess illegal drugs

two northern california fires burned at least 15 homes sunday 
and forced evacuation of at least 200 people while in yellowstone 
national park less snow fell than expected but frosty temperatures 
kept flames down 
a storm over westcentral montana produced enough snow and rain 
that fire crews were allowed to begin returning home idaho got 
little precipitation and crews faced some new fires 
the 8700acre brush fire near vacaville southwest of 
sacramento led to the evacuation of 65 people from 12 homes and 
burned at least nine homes in addition to two outbuildings said 
california department of forestry spokeswoman dianne sanders 
the fire apparently was set by an arsonist department of 
forestry investigator loyde johnson said but he would not 
elaborate 
winds which earlier in the day had gusted up to 35 mph 
decreased later in the day making firefighters hopeful they would 
be able to gain the upper hand by nightfall 
its looking better because of the change in the wind down to 
about 12 miles per hour so were able to get in there finally with 
bulldozers and hand crews said john ferreira another forestry 
spokesman late sunday afternoon its laid down quite a bit 
now 
the windswept flames also threatened about 50 other homes in 
the area about 55 miles northeast of san francisco forest 
department spokesman john ferreria said 
vacaville fire chief howard wood said several radio towers were 
damaged by the fire on top of mount vaca two people suffered 
burns he said 
north of vacaville six homes were destroyed as about 7000 
acres burned sunday east of redding and 40 to 50 families were 
evacuated from the small communities of whitmore and oak run 
california forestry spokeswoman lisa chiesa said 
an additional 85 people were evacuated from a private school 
called the cascade school said spokeswoman evelyn dollarhide 
twelve outbuildings were destroyed including a barn containing 
several classic cars officials said 
fighting the fire was difficult because of dry timber and wind 
gusting up to 45 mph chiesa said 
up to 6 inches of snow had been forecast for yellowstone in 
northwestern wyoming but most of the park got only a dusting 
however by midday the temperature was still only 37 degrees 
limiting fire activity and allowing crews to jump on hot spots 
before they had a chance to get out of hand said fire information 
officer judy jennings 
the park has been besieged for nearly three months by dry 
weather and fires that have charred more than half its 22 million 
acres 
jennings said crews on many fires would hold off on building 
containment lines 
theres really no need for it right now fire activity is low 
in most locations throughout the park she said 
and in any event fire managers have said the terrain and access 
around parts of the 335300acre north fork blaze make building 
containment lines there extremely difficult natural barriers 
surrounding the fire were expected to help keep it in line 
in westcentral montana firefighting crews and the soldiers who 
reinforced them began pulling out of the 247000acre canyon creek 
fire sunday while a storm continued to drop snow and rain 
officials said the force would be replaced by 20member 
rapidresponse teams in each of the three national forests that the 
fire affected lolo lewis and clark and helena 
some firefighters also were being released sunday from the 
35400acre red bench fire in and near glacier national park said 
fire information officer jim payne he said hotspots and the 
potential for renewed trouble remained 
glacier officials said snow and rain had reduced fire danger 
enough to allow reopening of backcountry trails and campgrounds 
but with some restrictions 
a weather front that moved over idaho on saturday brought 
disappointingly light precipitation and firefighters had two new 
fires that started friday and saturday one caused by lightning 
said nez perce national forest spokeswoman mary zabinski 
but high humidity and temperatures in the 40s helped 
firefighters in their effort to keep most idaho wildfires within 
the boundaries of the frank churchriver of no return gospel hump 
and selwaybitterroot wilderness areas

in a scene repeated throughout 
the country ethnic germans from eastern europe are crowding into 
the village of koenigstein in hopes of starting a new life in the 
west 
nearly 500 recently arrived ethnic germans are staying in 
koenigstein they are just a small part of a record wave of 200000 
expected to arrive in west germany this year 
most of them come from the soviet union and poland with smaller 
numbers from romania and other east european countries 
sure there are problems and difficulties says koenigstein 
mayor antonius weber our resources are overtaxed but the people 
are there and we have to do what we can he said in an interview 
in koenigstein 483 ethnic germans were crowded into two 
temporary housing facilities last week in this town of 16500 
nestled in the scenic taunus hills near frankfurt 
we simply cant refuse says weber of the new arrivals 
private initiatives are being started the zdf television 
network has announced it is setting up in conjunction with a 
nationwide charity organization a program to find private 
individuals willing to help the newcomers with the numerous 
problems they face 
the incorporation of several hundred thousand ethnic germans 
from eastern europe is one of the biggest challenges of the next 
few years zdf officials said in announcing the program 
officially the federal government welcomes the arrivals as 
german citizens and praises the soviet blocs increased willingness 
to permit their emigration centuries after their forebearers 
settled in parts of eastern europe 
but with red cross estimates saying the number will climb to 
600000 by the turn of the century many towns and cities are 
having trouble coping with the results of bonns opendoor policy 
after arriving at various transit camps such as friedland near 
the east german border the ethnic germans are gradually sent to 
other parts of west germany straining social services already 
kept busy with tens of thousands of asylumseekers from third world 
countries 
eventually the ethnic germans are given help to find their own 
housing and a job 
their difficulty understanding the german language has been a 
major problem especially since the children are required by law to 
attend school almost immediately after their arrival 
many of my colleagues tell me that in many towns and cities 
throughout the country the ethnic german chldren need extra 
attention in the classroom because of language problems says 
gerhard fischer a 36yearold high school teacher in offenbach 
heinrich franke the federal government official in charge of 
overseeing the nations work force was even more blunt about 
language problems 
the language barrier is the largest stumbling block to getting 
a job for the ethnic germans franke told reporters 
franke noted that the government this year will spend 600 
million marks 450 million for language instruction much of it 
for the ethnic germans he said that is double the amount called 
for in the federal budget 
the soviet union alone has granted exit visas to more than 
15700 ethnic germans this year and nationwide the results of the 
influx from eastern europe have been farreaching and dramatic the 
federal government has been hammering out a comprehensive package 
to aid their intergration into german society 
west german federal officials say this years expected wave of 
200000 ethnic germans is more than double last years 86000 
people 
the southern state of badenwuerttemberg has announced a plan to 
build 10000 apartments for up to 40000 ethnic germans this year 
and next year 
it just cant be the case that we welcome these ethnic germans 
but make them live shabbily for years in gymnasiums tent cites 
containers and even on boats state interior minister dietmar 
schlee told a news conference in stuttgart 
in fact officials say that integration is the key word if the 
country of 613 million people is to successfully absorb the influx 
we cant have ethnic german cities says federal building 
minister oscar schneider they should live throughout the country 
and must not be isolated 
schneider called for a speedy progress on a program that already 
has an allocation of 600 million from the federal government for 
new homes and apartments for the ethnic germans 
with the birthrate falling among west germans there has been 
some speculation that the government welcomes the ethnic germans as 
a means to halt the slide 
der spiegel magazine quoted chancellor helmut kohls 
oftenrepeated phrase that our rich land can open its arms to 
germans from eastern europe 
plus theyre hardworking people who are ready to bring a 
bunch of kids into the world der spiegel commented in a major 
report on the newcomers in august

festival where an estimated 30000 people gathered to hear an 
assortment of hispanic bands 
we had bottles thrown broken heads a lot of arrests were 
made said metrodade police spokesman al hidalgogato it was

congress is heading into the final weeks of 
its 1988 session talking optimistically but showing no overt action 
on its biggest piece of unfinished environmental business 
rewriting the clean air act 
its possible to get a good bill this year says rep john 
dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce committee 
where closeddoor negotiations on an antipollution package have 
been moving slowly 
in the senate george mitchell dmaine is more optimistic 
than hes ever been about getting floor time for a comprehensive 
bill that received environment committee approval more than a year 
ago says press secretary diane dewhirst 
house speaker jim wright dtexas and senate majority leader 
robert byrd dwva have clean air legislation on their short 
lists for possible floor debate as congress heads for adjournment 
by midoctober 
wright has not been a major player in drafting a blueprint to 
combat smog and other urban pollution into the next century and 
impose stiffer controls on acidrain pollution and airborne 
emissions of toxic chemicals 
byrd however is the principal factor in the senate impasse 
largely because of his interest in protecting his states coal 
industry which could lose business under a variety of acidrain 
control scenarios 
the lameduck majority leader has said little publicly about the 
situation on friday through press secretary tina evans he said 
theres a lot of pressure to deal with clean air legislation this 
year this is a very difficult and controversial issue and 
whether common ground can be found remains to be seen 
earlier friday wright was asked what byrd had told him about 
the legislations future in the senate this year hes hopeful he 
can steer it to a successful conclusion in the senate wright 
replied 
sources on both sides of the capitol say byrds major concerns 
are gaining more time for coalburning power plants and factories 
to clean up their emissions and providing some sort of economic 
cushion for mine workers hurt by any move away from coal caused by 
acid rain controls 
even the environmental protection agency is stepping up its 
involvement as adjournment nears epa administrator lee thomas who 
favors new efforts against urban pollution but opposes acid rain 
provisions is now telling lawmakers they should consider new 
provisions to control airborne pollutants 
from the lobbying sidelines the environmentalist clean air 
coalition and its rival the industrybacked clean air working 
group both say they want a bill this year but they are far apart 
on its contents 
coalition chairman richard ayres says his side wants the 
strongest bill it can get and wont hesitate to pull the plug on 
its push for a bill this year if the house and senate develop 
proposals too weak to clean up the air in this century 
the industry group opposes acid rain controls as premature and 
not supported by scientific consensus its administrator william 
fay says the group supports a prompt and sensible solution to 
urban pollution from carbon monoxide and smogproducing ozone 
at last count by epa about 100 cities and metropolitan areas 
were not complying with limits on these pollutants congress most 
likely remedy would be to give them more time to clean up but 
require tougher steps 
dingell and other energy and commerce negotiators havent even 
addressed the acid rain question 
they are still hung up on the urbanpollution issue of whether 
vehiclemakers should have to produce lesspolluting cars trucks 
and buses a subject close to the hearts of dingell and auto 
industry constituents 
environmentalists blame dingell and his allies for the 
slowmoving negotiations industry lobbyists point the finger at 
rep henry waxman dcalif the chairman of the energy and 
commerce health and the environment subcommittee an advocate of 
tough tailpipe emissions standards 
for their parts dingell and waxman are throwing no rocks at 
least in public sources close to the bargaining say the overall 
strategy is to mark time until it appears the senate will produce a 
bill before risking any unnecessary showdowns and bloodletting on 
the house side 
one thing the entire process cannot stand with time running out 
in 1988 is a contentious lengthy housesenate conference to 
resolve what likely would be major differences in legislation 
produced by each chamber 
mitchell and dingell have discussed ways of avoiding a rerun of 
1986 when they and others spent tortuous fractious months 
resolving house and senate bills to beef up the superfund 
hazardous waste cleanup program 
the two lawmakers reportedly have reached at least tentative 
agreement on steps to avoid a drawnout conference over clean air 
under the arrangement senate provisions on acid rain would form 
the starting point for conferees who would begin their 
negotiations over urban pollution provisions with what emerges from 
the house

us officials are considering a new proposal 
by philippine foreign secretary raul manglapus aimed at resolving 
military bases negotiations and helping the philippines with its 
28 billion debt 
the proposal according to philippine sources would include 
about 460 million in us aid and another 100 million that would 
be used to buy us treasury bonds in a complex debt swap 
congressional sources have said us negotiators in manila 
offered a package totalling 489 million for fiscal 1989 but it 
was turned down by the philippine panel which reportedly has been 
demanding more than 1 billion a year 
manglapus said the new proposals do not represent a scaleddown 
demand because the two sides always have been fairly close on the 
amount of money the united states actually would have to 
appropriate and another philippine official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the plan would result in longterm 
interest savings that could make the total benefit close to the 1 
billion the philippines wants without costing the united states so 
much 
manglapus who heads the philippine negotiating team told a 
filipinoamerican group saturday night that he was pleased with 
response to his proposal from members of congress and treasury 
department officials he said agreement could come soon after he 
returns to manila early next month 
the usphilippine talks are over terms of the final two years 
of the agreement that allows the united states access to its two 
largest foreign bases clark air base and subic navy base along 
with smaller philippine facilities separate negotiations before 
1991 would have to decide the longterm future of the bases 
i would have to say that i am much more positive manglapus 
said after a week of meetings in washington 
the washington post reported on saturday that the administration 
was considering a new philippine proposal but said state department 
officials were not convinced it was practical or affordable both 
secretary of state george p shultz and defense secretary frank c 
carlucci have said the united states will consider pulling its 
bases out of the philippines if the demands are too high 
rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on asia said manglapus proposal was worthy 
of the most serious and sympathetic consideration the post 
reported 
philippine officials who asked not to be identified by name 
outlined some details of the new proposal after manglapus referred 
to it in his speech 
one official said it would include the issuing of usbacked 
bonds that would be used to buy off some of the philippine debt at 
the market rate which is about 50 cents on the dollar the plan 
has some similarities with that used to help ailing mexico and 
brazil 
the other requested aid would include 160 million in economic 
assistance 200 in military aid and more than 100 million in 
other programs including food aid the official said 
current us aid tied to the bases is 180 million a year 
although total american aid approved by congress has averaged more 
than 440 million annually since president corazon aquino ousted 
ferdinand marcos in 1986 
the philippines considers at least part of the money rent 
for the bases but us officials call it aid and say it is only 
indirectly tied to the bases 
manglapus answering questions at the filipinoamerican 
gathering said soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs proposal for 
closing the soviet base in vietnam in exchange for a us pullout 
from the philippines should be discussed between the superpowers

black political leaders say michael dukakis 
failed to energize blacks but hope drives to register and mobilize 
voters beginning late this month will help produce the winning 
difference for the democratic ticket 
he may not have the charisma of jesse jackson or the charisma 
of a john kennedy said rep john lewis dga but black voters 
can sense the difference between dukakis and bush between a 
republican and a democrat i think were ready to go out and 
mobilize our people 
blacks voters in areas like lewis home state of georgia 
california and throughout the industrial north can provide the 
winning margin for dukakis in november said several members of the 
congressional black caucus interviewed at their annual legislative 
conference over the weekend 
dukakis met privately in washington last week with several 
members of the caucus and endorsed their plans for a 
doublebarreled effort to energize black voters beginning sept 29 
the plans organizer district of columbia house delegate walter 
fauntroy said members of the black caucus and leaders of black 
organizations will travel to 14 targeted states to register voters 
then revisit those states and 42 cities beginning oct 14 to 
encourage blacks to get to the polls fauntroy said the states 
targeted are places where a heavy black turnout can overcome as 
much as a 60 percent to 70 percent gop advantage among white voters 
i am confident that the enthusiasm will be back as we launch 
this drive fauntroy said 
several black lawmakers said the energy generated during the 
partys national convention in july in atlanta which stemmed from 
an effort to give defeated presidential candidate jesse jackson a 
greater role in the campaign had been largely squandered over the 
past two months 
there was not as close a working relationship between the 
dukakis and jackson camps as there should have been said rep 
charles rangel dny as late as it has been in coming things 
are picking up rangel said but added it hasnt trickled down 
yet to rankandfile black voters 
rep george crockett dmich said dukakis appears to be afraid 
that courting blacks too visibly will antagonize the reagan 
democrats white bluecollar voters he has been trying to woo 
back into the democratic column 
i dont see any evidence of going all out to get the black 
vote crockett said 
dukakis sought to generate renewed energy in a speech saturday 
to the gathering of black leaders calling the election a 
struggle for the soul of america with particularly high stakes 
for blacks 
its a struggle we must win and i need your help to do it 
the candidate said i need your ideas i need your energy i need 
your active involvement at every level of the campaign because our 
adversaries are not just george bush and dan quayle our 
adversaries are despair and resignation and indifference and 
complacency 
dukakis acknowledged it will take the largest voter turnout in 
american history for democrats to win in november 
and he acknowledged in a poke at his own relatively dry 
speaking style that he has been unable to excite blacks in the way 
jackson does ive been working with him to sharpen his message 
improve his delivery and develop more charisma he said of 
jacksonand hes getting better 
according to several participants dukakis support is due as 
much to antipathy for the reagan administration as to the 
democrats positive message 
theres a growing feeling on the part of black america that 
bush will be a copy of mr reagan said lewis there is almost 
a hostile feeling on the part of blacks against this 
administration and bush has been a part of that 
added rep major owens dny regardless of what mistakes 
are made by dukakis we decided we have to go ahead and repudiate 
the reagan administration we have to deliver for this ticket 
were putting our differences aside well argue after we win

at issue was the hollywood balance of power 
and the teamsters chief didnt mince words negotiations with 
producers yielded the worst contract offer ever made to a union 
in the history of our great and prosperous business 
the letter earl bush sent wednesday to his 2200 studio drivers 
echoed a familiar refrain for the second time this year a 
hollywood labor leader was telling his membership that television 
and movie producers were picking a fight forcing a strike 
as scriptwriters did in march teamsters are expected to do 
later this month walk off the job though the unions represent 
vastly different talents their disputes share a common theme 
determining the split of the entertainment industrys spoils 
while bigname studios producers actors and agents consolidate 
clout and record income a variety of entertainment industry 
workers such as writers plasterers and screen extras who just 
lost their pension plan are being asked to make do with less 
union leaders say 
we dont have any demands said bush secretarytreasurer of 
teamsters local 399 were trying to stop the takeaways theyre 
taking care of themselves awfully well and theyre talking about 
our demands being high 
theres no question that some hollywood power brokers and power 
hitters are pocketing monumental paychecks last year disney head 
michael eisner took home at least 26 million in salary stock 
options and bonuses actor bruce willis collected more than 5 
million for several weeks work on die hard and the annual 
incomes of any number of hollywood hotshots easily exceed many 
lottery jackpots 
but producers still complain about rising costs tougher 
competition and dwindling television advertising revenues the days 
of doubledigit growth they say are gone 
the urgent need to curb belowtheline behindthecamera 
costs associated with filming motion pictures and television shows 
in los angeles has reached crisis proportions said j 
nicholas counter iii president of the 217member alliance of 
motion picture and television producers 
producers bent on trimming costs are taking their shows to 
nonunion stages states and countries thereby reducing 
transportation as well as other production fees by as much as 
half to stem what it calls forcedaway productions the 
producers alliance is asking the teamsters to take pay cuts up to 
2 an hour and rewrite overtime rules 
the networks have come to us and said weve got to hold those 
costs down that they cant absorb them any longer counter said 
there are teamster rates in other parts of the country that are 
34 an hour less than what we have under our current contract 
we can take on another major strike to change these 
contracts around 
hollywood featherbedding is almost as old as hollywood itself 
hair dressers charge 350 for a days work even if theyre curling 
and teasing for a few hours one union insists that different floor 
sweeping crews be used for when sets are built and when theyre 
torn down and teamsters do occasionally earn 1661 an hour for 
playing cards and eating doughnuts between dispatches 
but bush asserted are the producers going to tell arnold 
schwarzenegger that he has to take a 15 percent pay reduction or 
are they going to tell sylvester stallone you wont get 15 
million anymore 
so why he asked do they tell a driver who does physical labor 
that he has to take a pay cut to bring business back to town 
theyre trying to take the littlest working force in the 
industry and theyre going to cut them just to show everybody 
well work with the producers but theyve gotta cut theirs also 
said veteran director richard brooks one of the reasons costs 
are higher is that the studios themselves perpetuate this whole 
thing they say were going to give this actor 8 million to play 
this picture and the guy driving the truck or my camera 
assistant or the makeup man says eight million bucks what 
are they talking about we work six or seven days a week 
whatever the case the producers hold the cards and its not a 
weak hand the international alliance of theatrical stage 
employees hollywoods biggest union with more than 24000 
behindthecamera members already has pledged that it will not 
strike when its contract expires in january 
although it says its nostrike stance is a matter of contractual 
obligation some observers wonder if the union isnt simply fearful 
of coming up short in a long and damaging strike 
hollywood labor pacts typically mirror previous contract 
negotiations with other studio unions the problem with such 
pattern bargaining hollywood unionists say is that the 
contracts negotiated by a weak guild will be used as a model in 
subsequent negotiations creating a domino effect 
because of this there is concern among industry labor leaders 
that the outcome of the teamsters dispute will have a direct effect 
on negotiations with the mammoth screen actors guild whose 
contract expires next year 
brian walton executive director of the writers guild of america 
west suffered through this years fivemonth strike against the 
producers 
they pick on unions because they believe that they can 
walton said the writers strike was totally avoidable its 
not unreasonable to say the strike cost the producers somewhere 
between 150 million and 200 million and they stand to save maybe 
2 million on the final contract terms 
i think that the evidence of the 80s in hollywood 
demonstrates a conscious longrange agenda to render guilds and 
unions increasingly irrelevant they dont want them to be players 
in the economic picture walton said 
counter dismisses any such motivation its an issue of 
competitiveness he said noting californias loss of production 
to other states canada and mexico we have to remain 
competitive

washington ap the world bank says the united states has 
managed to increase its exports and ease its trade deficit without 
hurting the exports of other nations 
the report released sunday said the us has benefited from a 
muchimproved competitive position with the value of the 
dollar having dropped more than 50 percent against the west german 
mark and the japanese yen over the past two years 
yet the report said the us successes in reducing its trade 
deficit by increasing exports are not being offset by decreases 
in exports elsewhere instead exports of other nations are 
apparently being helped 
exports from the united states grew during 1987 and early 1988 
at over 20 percent a year while current estimates show that 
world trade increased at about 11 percent from the first to the 
second half of 1987 the report said 
the bank also said that wealthy countries have enjoyed a stable 
year of moderate growth in output and low inflation but the growth 
rate slowed in developing countries partly because of continued 
problems in subsaharan africa and drought in india the bank said 
output growth and inflation in the seven largest industrial 
countries canada france the federal republic of germany italy 
japan the united kingdom the united states each averaged about 
3 percent in 1987 the report said 
but the economies of subsaharan africa and other heavily 
indebted countries mainly in latin america on average grew more 
slowly than population resulting in a decline in percapita income 
for those nations it said 
among other highlights in the report 
japan is making a major contribution to stimulating other 
economies 
inflation still could return to the major industrial countries 
and should be monitored carefully 
third world debt increased again in 1987 but some progress has 
been made in finding ways to reduce the burden 
trade protectionism remains a cause for concern 
the japanese contribution has been an investment boom which 
began in 1986 and continued into 1988 the report said the major 
beneficiaries of the increase in japanese imports have been the 
newly industrialized economies of asia such as south korea and 
taiwan it said 
the imports into those countries in turn also have been rising 
rapidly it added 
the major drought in india was the primary factor behind the 
slowing of economic growth in south asia to 27 percent in 1987 
from 47 percent the year before it said 
nevertheless growth trends of many developing countries in 
east asia as well as in the region of europe the middle east and 
north africa were relatively well sustained the report said

saturn but sitting in a los angeles bank vault 
his zamorano 80 is one of just two complete collections of 80 
rare books declared by the los angelesbased zamorano club of 
bibliophiles in 1945 as works best representing early california 
history

had cult following among book collectors a complete zamorano 80 is 
estimated to be worth between 750000 and 1 million 
the book club and the collection were named after agustin juan 
vicente zamorano who in the 19th century was californias first 
printer 
the books include such wellknown titles as mark twains 
roughing it and bret hartes the luck of roaring camp and

although modern americans know chicago as 
the windy city for bellowing politicians and brisk lake 
michigan breezes early native americans knew the community as 
the place of the bad smell 
and 17th century indians gave president reagans birthplace of 
tampico a name with a special meaning it translates as the place 
where there are dogs 
thousands of cities counties rivers and parks were given names 
with special meanings by the ancient north american indians and 
john tenney jr has begun a campaign to recognize the 
longforgotten names 
for six years tenney has worked at his home in williamson 
ny digging through history books reading indian folklore and 
contacting hundreds of postmasters and historians to compile a list 
of 5000 native american names their meanings and origins 
so many beautiful and interesting native american names have 
been disguised and anglosized to the point you cant recognize them 
anymore tenney said i think its sad because most of them are 
very descriptive and conjure up real images unlike more modern 
names 
tenneys public awareness campaign has led him to write articles 
about the native american names found in every state the articles 
contain specific names of cities rivers and lakes of states that 
tenney has individually researched 
if tenney cant find a buyer for his article the 55yearold 
corporate engineer simply donates the work to a state publication 
willing to print it 
such was the case recently in illinois where tenney offered a 
piece to the state department of conservations outdoor highlights 
magazine 
we received a letter unsolicited offering us a story on 
names of cities and places in illinois from this guy in new york 
said gary thomas editor of the stateproduced wildlife magazine in 
springfield 
we told him we were interested and he provided a list of about 
20 pages of names he told us to choose which ones wed be 
interested in and he produced a story we told him we couldnt pay 
him anything and he said it was no problem 
the story revealed the history behind dozens of names like 
chicago which tenney said means place of the bad smell or 
garlic field and came from the algonquin indians 
according to tenneys research illinois means man and 
was used by the illinois indians to describe themselves 
tenney even traced the roots of tiny tampico and found it was 
named after the mexican city and means place where there are 
dogs in mayan 
how many anglo or european names are so descriptive tenney 
asked these are great names and i just think something ought to 
be done to get these names into widespread use and understanding 
tenneys fascination began about six years ago when he was 
hiking on mount marcy in the adirondack forest of upstate new york 
the indian name for mount marcy was a word that means cloud 
splitter thats what they called the highest mountain in new 
york thats a great name its much better name than some old 
governors name said tenny whose research has taken him to a 
halfdozen indian reservations and led him to native american 
languages long forgotten 
its been a fascinating experience if you like history and 
the outdoors you get an enormous feeling for american history and 
indian history from reading about these names he said

correctional facilities gives a grim picture of the home lives of 
those youngsters who commit crimes before adulthood

come from broken homes and were under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol when they committed their offense 
the study by the justice departments bureau of justice 
statistics also found that nearly 60 percent of the 18226 
juveniles in the longterm stateoperated institutions during 1987 
had used drugs regularly once a week or more for at least a month 
seventytwo percent of the boys and girls under 18 said they had 
not grown up with both parents about half of all the juveniles 
surveyed said they had lived primarily with their mothers

a new poll says 60 percent of americans favor 
financial assistance for family planning programs in developing 
nations regardless of whether abortion is legal in those countries 
the poll by louis harris and associates which was done for the 
population crisis committee and the planned parenthood federation 
of america found 34 percent of those surveyed were opposed to such 
aid 
the agency for international development has recently halted 
support from countries where abortion is part of family planning 
programs it has also halted funding to both the international 
planned parenthood federation and the united nations population 
fund contending that their policies promoted coercive abortion 
the two independent population groups paid for the poll of 1250 
americans in order to gauge the support for family planning in this 
presidential election year a poll of that size has a margin of 
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points

the longawaited autumn weather and snow is helping cool a 
record fire season in the northern rockies but officials say the 
worst is yet to come in hotter areas such as california 
wildfires have burned over 41 million acres of forest and brush 
this summer in the west and alaska the worst fire season in 30 
years according to the boise interagency fire center which 
coordinates the firefighting 
if hot dry weather persists in california and southern oregon 
where the peak fire season is just starting more than 5 million 
acres may burn this year a survey of firefighting officials shows 
california has critical drought conditions over most of the 
state says karen terrill a spokeswoman for the california 
department of forestry and fire protection 
conditions rival those of last year when about 800000 acres of 
california timber and brush burned in the states worst fire season 
since the 1920s she said 
a fire near sacramento last week burned more than 52 square 
miles destroying 97 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate 
firefighters said that fire was nearly contained by wednesday but 
two other blazes in northern california this weekend burned 15 
homes and forced hundreds of people to evacuate 
nine homes burned to the ground 15 miles west of vacaville 
southwest of sacramento and six were destroyed 20 miles east of 
redding officials said 
the worst is still to come terrill said before the 
onslaught of those two fires 
californias fire season starts as early as april but usually 
peaks in september or october 
this year it could go well into november terrill warned 
in the northern rockies the autumn chill has taken some fury 
out of the areas worst recorded fire season in history fires have 
charred nearly 15 million acres in yellowstone national park and 
adjacent national forests in montana wyoming and idaho 
up to 6 inches of snow fell last week in parts of yellowstone 
and rain averaged about a quarterinch in the park forecasters 
expected the same amount of snow this weekend but most of the park 
got only a dusting but temperatures remained low limiting fire 
activity officials said 
that doesnt put fires out but it makes them stay put in one 
place until we can get a line around them said lynn young of 
the federal regional incident coordination organization in 
missoula mont 
the force fighting yellowstones fires has dropped to 6700 from 
a peak of about 9500 firefighters and support workers earlier this 
month young said 
i would say that perhaps with luck we are past the peak in 
the yellowstone area but weve still got a ways to go said 
arnold hartigan a spokesman at the boise center 
twentyone fires covering nearly 2 million acres still burn in 
six states hartigan said some of the yellowstone firefighters 
have been diverted to a 257000acre blaze in westcentral montana 
were expecting to make progress on the major fires but they 
are very large and were going to be dealing with them for some 
time to come hartigan said 
here is a breakdown of states hit hardest by fire this year 
alaska nearly 22 million acres of sparsely populated land 
burned in the states worst fire season since 1977 the bureau of 
land management said cool august weather curtailed those fires 
wyoming five major fires still out of control have charred 
more than 12 million acres hartigan said 
montana the forest fire season usually slows down by now but 
five major fires remain uncontained more than 606000 acres has 
burned much of it in forests just north of yellowstone young said 
idaho six major fires covering nearly 200000 acres remain 
uncontained hartigan said 
california six major fires have burned nearly 63000 acres and 
the peak fire season is just warming up officials said 
washington one major fire has burned more than 53000 acres in 
and around the wenatchee national forest 
oregon one major fire has burned about 5000 acres of the 
willamette national forest 
arizona colorado new mexico nevada and utah have had some 
wildfires but have been spared the worst of this years fire 
season officials said 
the acreage burned might have been greater but for the efforts 
of more than 30000 firefighters and support workers hartigan said 
about 69000 fires have been reported this year across the west 
a 45 percent increase over last year he said

troops under orders to halt all public 
gatherings on monday fired into crowds of defiant students 
buddhist monks and other largely unarmed protesters in downtown 
rangoon witnesses said casualties were heavy 
many students are being mowed down cant anything be done 
a reporter telephoning from the scene said before breaking down in 
tears 
the troops were deployed after a military coup staged sunday by 
hardline armed forces commander gen saw maung not long after the 
coups announcement angry demonstrators began moving into the city 
from outlying areas 
battles between the two sides were reported monday around the 
main government administrative building the us embassy sule 
pagoda at a junction leading into the city and other areas 
residents of buildings near the us embassy said demonstrators 
were being cut down by military fire while others saw two monks 
falling to the ground after being hit by bullets around the sule 
pagoda 
total casualties could not be estimated the shooting was 
reported continuing with local residents dragging the wounded 
inside their houses 
a western diplomat contacted by telephone from tokyo said 
soldiers were firing from rooftops at demonstrators in front of the 
us embassy but the embassy building itself had not been hit one 
dead person and three wounded could be seen in front of the 
building located on a major commercial street 
theres a lot of shooting theres been deaths and injured 
its a bad situation here the diplomat said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
although most demonstrators faced troops without weapons some 
carried swords spears crossbows and other primitive weapons 
there were reports that firebombs were being hurled by protesters 
in some areas and demonstrators were seen taking weapons from 
fallen soldiers 
in once instance troops guarding a road junction opened fire on 
a crowd of demonstrators trying to march into the city from the 
working class suburb of north okkalapa 
according to incomplete reports the fighting erupted sunday 
night not long after saw maung seized power and more than 40 
demonstrators and 17 soldiers were reported killed sunday night in 
one area of the city 
sporadic shooting and several large blasts were heard in the 
capital after the new authorities imposed an 8 pm curfew and 
banned public gatherings 
thousands of people immediately surged into the streets after 
the staterun radio announced the coup they called for weapons and 
began erecting barricades from trees and waterpipes against 
military vehicles 
saw maung 59 said over staterun radio rangoon on sunday that 
he overthrew civilian president maung maung to halt economic and 
social chaos and to hold democratic elections after 26 years of 
authoritarian rule by the burma socialist program party the sole 
legal party he immediately abolished key government institutions 
the fate of maung maung was not known 
the sudden announcement came amid speculation the government and 
key opposition leaders were paving the way to an interim government 
and a return to full democracy 
i believe the people will rise up again and this time they are 
going to be angrier its going to be tragic burma expert josef 
silverstein of rutgers university said by telephone 
troops moved in sunday night and sealed the offices of all six 
government newspapers making it unlikely they would be permitted 
to reopen monday although nominally under government control the 
newspapers have in recent weeks been publishing news about the mass 
antigovernment movement in the country 
protests since july have forced the resignation of two burmese 
leaders and more recent strikes demonstrations looting and 
lawlessness have pushed the nation to the verge of anarchy 
saw maung who identified himself as chairman of the peace 
restoration committee has been defense minister since july he is 
widely regarded as a hardline officer and a righthand man of the 
toppled president sein lwin 
sein lwin whom demonstrators called the most hated man in 
burma resigned aug 12 after a week of bloody clashes between 
troops and unarmed protesters left 112 dead by the governments 
count 
a later broadcast named the other 18 military officers in the 
committee including the army navy and air force commanders eight 
of burmas nine regional army commanders and the unpopular 
military intelligence chief col khin nyunt 
the broadcast said all government and state bodies were 
dissolved including local administrations striking government 
workers were told to return to work by sept 26 or face dismissal 
the initial broadcast preceded by martial music said the 
military took over state authority to curb further deterioration 
of the general situation in the country 
it said the military would restore law and order peace and 
tranquillity in the country and ease the daily livelihood of 
the people 
after accomplishing the above objectives the authorities 
will hold general elections under a multiparty system 
political parties which accept and practice true democracy can 
prepare for the general elections from now on 
it said the election supervision commission formed by maung 
maungs government would be retained 
maung maung a westerneducated lawyer on aug 19 became the 
nations first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup that 
installed the burma socialist program party 
maung maung bowed to protests and offered general elections 
under a multiparty system but demonstrators say they do not trust 
the party and demanded formation of an interim government to 
conduct the polling the government gave no indication it would 
agree 
burmas last multiparty elections in february 1960 swept 
former prime minister nu to power over an armybacked party ne 
win the armed forces commander then led the 1962 coup that 
toppled nus government 
after years of little resistance to authoritarian rule students 
rioted in september 1987 to protest the governments decision to 
void much of the currency in circulation without compensation 
security forces killed scores of demonstrators in quelling 
broader studentled protests in march and june ne win resigned 
july 23 taking indirect responsibility for the rioting 
protesters blame the ruling partys rigid socialism for turning 
resourcerich burma into one of the poorest countries in asia

dispelling fears about the creatures met with less than successful 
results 
slimy and icky were the prevailing exclamations after 
many of the young visitors touched them 
they were among 2000 participants in the sixth annual 
herpetological weekend sponsored by the chicago herpetological 
society at the chicago academy of sciences 
the event gave visitors a chance to pet prod and probe snakes 
like pythagoras a 15foot burmese python and about 100 other 
serpents lizards iguanas and turtles 
that thing feels gross said 7yearold alex vassilopolous 
yanking his hand away after reaching into pythagoras cage it 
felt like it had no bones inside 
it kind of feels like this grass said 7yearold timothy 
love of chicago pointing to the astroturf floor of the exhibition 
tent he said he wanted to take a snake like pythagoras home 
some herpetologists cited several reasons people might want to 
keep reptiles as pets 
they have no body odor they smell like the room theyre in 
said tom anton its what makes them such effective predators 
but he added dont expect fido the snake to be waiting for 
you with your slippers when you get home

an idyllic patch of this new jersey 
borough provides a glimpse of what american suburbia could have 
been 
homes are arrayed in superblocks where residents share 
parks quiet culdesacs and a sense of community children often 
play unattended far from busy roads 
radburn a planned community started before the depression has 
gained worldwide renown but few imitators 
just 10 miles from the george washington bridge to new york 
city radburn stands as an anomaly among suburban tracts the 
149acre community has 500 singlefamily homes 48 townhouses 32 
duplexes and a 93unit apartment complex onetenth the size of 
the community planned by architects clarence stein and henry wright 
in the late 1920s 
it was to herald a new stage in development that relegated cars 
to peripheral streets and maintained serenity and social contact in 
residential life 
but the developer city housing corp went bankrupt during the 
depression and stopped building homes in radburn in 1936 
what remains is a comfortable novelty for 2800 residents and an 
enticing model of residential life for professional planners they 
say radburn has inspired some imitations in india england france 
and in a few us communities including reston va in 1974 the 
site was included in the national register of historic places 
it certainly stands out as an oasis within the typical 
tracthouse suburbia that surrounds it said james w hughes 
chairman of the department of urban planning and policy development 
at rutgers university it sort of reverses the traditional 
pattern of suburban houses fronting on the streets 
hughes said architects stein and wright were involved with the 
garden city movement which sought to counteract the congestion 
in urban areas in northern new jersey and new york early this 
century 
in terms of the history of planning its extremely 
significant hughes said essentially it was the first town 
that was attempted to be built for the motor age supposedly to 
tame the automobile 
radburn the name means saddle river in old english after the 
nearby river of that name was innovative in its approach to 
residential block design 
the creators abandoned the traditional gridiron street pattern 
in favor of the superblock a large block of land surrounded by 
main roads the houses mostly colonial and english tudor style 
are grouped around culdesacs served by narrow access roads 
coming from main roads the land inside the area consists of parks 
living and sleeping sections in the houses face the park and garden 
areas service rooms such as the kitchen face the access road 
it envisioned a planned decentralization in american 
society said robert fishman who describes radburn as a model 
community in his book bourgeois utopias the rise and fall of 
suburbia 
the radburn community was to be the center of a whole region 
based on a decentralization of housing and also of industry 
fishman said it would return america to a communitybased life 
that is absent today 
the community is financed by its residents who pay a charge 
based on their propertys assessed valuation residents also pay 
the full borough tax rate radburn fees which go to an 
administrative body called the radburn association pay for the 
maintenance of property and recreation programs 
the association manages a park network of 23 acres two swimming 
pools four tennis courts four baseball fields and three 
playground areas 
an elementary school and a nondenominational church are located 
on the borders of the property most radburn children can reach the 
school without crossing a road 
ernest morris a radburn resident for 36 years pays 3000 
annually in borough taxes and 700 to the association which he 
considers a bargain for a place that he has always considered 
special 
its become an ideal community for senior citizens in that 
everything is within walking distance he said 
the community comprises mainly senior citizens and young 
professionals a big reason price the radburn homes that once 
sold for about 6000 average more than 200000 when they are 
available said ron gatti manager of the association 
planners say that radburn could not be recreated today except 
in very expensive developments but they say the trend toward 
clustered housing and condominium developments in the northeast has 
begun to replicate some of the communal radburn residents feel

people using picks or their bare hands 
dug through rubble where their homes had stood and the search wore 
on for the bodies of people who died when a river overran its banks 
and swept away four buses 
as of sunday rescue workers had found the bodies of 90 of the 
nearly 200 people believed killed the previous day when a flash 
flood spawned by hurricane gilbert caused the normally dry santa 
catarina river to overflow 
the torrent ripped a 40mile path of destruction through 
northern mexicos most populated region on which gilbert had 
dumped about 12 inches of rain in 24 hours after leaving the gulf 
of mexico 
gilbert which killed at least 194 people during its week of 
life was today a tropical depression that was spreading showers 
and thunderstorms from texas to illinois 
in mexico 31 died when the storm slammed into mexicos yucatan 
peninsula wednesday with winds of up to 200 mph one woman drowned 
in floodwaters sunday in the coastal state of tamaulipas 
the storm killed 30 people in haiti 26 in jamaica five in the 
dominican republic and eight in honduras in its deadly rampage 
through the caribbean two people were killed in texas by tornados 
spawned by the storm and a pilot died in oklahoma when his plane 
broke apart in heavy rains 
president miguel de la madrid surveying the destruction in this 
northern industrial city on sunday said mexico has a lot to 
lament 
parts of two major thoroughfares and hundreds of homes built by 
the poor in the dry santa catarina riverbed were swept away by the 
raging waters 
although homes had been evacuated hours before the destruction 
hit most residents lost their lifes possessions officials said 
about 30000 in the region were homeless 
many residents used picks or bare hands to dig through the 
rubble that remained where their tiny concrete and tin houses had 
stood 
rescue workers continued to search for bodies and jose 
natividad gonzalez paras nuevo leon state secretary said a 
considerable number of people still were missing 
journalists saw soldiers uncover the body of one man caught in 
the mangled remains of an electricity tower 
the man who appeared about 20 years old had been covered by 
clothing tree branches and mud trapped by the tower one of 
several downed lines along the santa catarinas bank at the 
hardesthit area 
further downstream two dozen soldiers used cranes to pull the 
crushed and overturned body of an intercity passenger bus from the 
mud and sand of the riverbed 
they hope to find bodies because they dont know exactly how 
many people were in the bus or how many were able to save 
themselves said rescue coordinator lt col vicente gamez of the 
7th military zone 
the first bus yanked from the riverbed and hauled away revealed 
only empty seats twisted metal and piles of shoes and clothing 
the three other buses remained buried upside down sunday night 
gamez said rescue crews were searching for bodies in cadereyta 
about 20 miles downstream where the flood wiped out homes and 
killed more than a dozen people 
hundreds of families farther downstream were evacuated to public 
buildings on higher ground sunday because of flooding said 
fernando gonzalez villarreal assistant secretary in the federal 
water resources ministry 
the situation is critical the rain was very strong he said 
nuevo leon state authorities estimated damages to public roads 
bridges and other facilities alone at 60 million 
thirteen us coast guard airplanes and helicopters flew rescue 
missions on sunday throughout nuevo leon and tamaulipas states 
assisting mexican air forces 
a coast guard helicopter being used for evacuation lost power as 
it took off on sunday and fell about 50 feet brushing a house 
under construction police reported 
the chopper made a forced landing fortunately no one was 
hurt said lt commander john wcislo us coast guard attache in 
mexico 
police said the three americans and one mexican on board were 
taken to the local hospital for a checkup and released 
wcislo said coast guard aircraft would continue ferrying people 
and red cross supplies today if needed

portauprince haiti advocates of democratic reform expressed 
hope that haitis new military leaders would open a dialogue with 
the people after ousting lt gen henry namphy who ran the country 
for more than two years 
brig gen prosper avril the armys chief administrative 
officer went on national television sunday and declared himself 
president of the western hemispheres most impoverished nation 
he said namphy was ousted by the 1000man presidential guard 
saturday night because it was sickened by his rule which was 
marked by a tolerance for the murder of government opponents 
avril was a military adviser to jeanclaude duvalier before the 
dictators february 1986 flight into exile and has since managed to 
ally himself with the prevailing forces in the 7000man military 
the government said an unspecified number of soldiers were 
reported killed in the coup and namphy was sent to the dominican 
republic which shares the island of hispaniola with haiti 
portauprince appeared calm sunday night though the us and 
canadian embassies advised their citizens to stay off the streets 
small groups of people milled in the streets and traffic was light 
television and radio stations resumed their normal programming 
the airport which was closed sunday was expected to reopen 
today 
but for the fourmonth civilian presidency of leslie manigat 
which ended in june with a bloodless coup namphy had run haiti 
since duvaliers departure heading a militaryled junta until 
manigat was elected in january in juntarun balloting that was 
widely boycotted 
on nov 29 independently run elections were thwarted by armed 
thugs supported by the army who killed 34 people at the polls 
and a week before the coup about 20 men armed with machetes 
handguns and steel pikes attacked a roman catholic church during a 
mass being celebrated by the rev jean bertrand aristide a vocal 
critic of the namphy government thirteen people were killed and 77 
wounded 
opposition leaders blamed the government for the attack and 
another church burning two days later 
heavy gunfire was heard in the capital saturday night shortly 
before the coup but susan clyde spokeswoman for the us embassy 
here said it appeared to be mainly celebratory shooting in the 
air nobody shooting at anyone or anything 
frantz lubin haitis director of information said an 
unspecified number of soldiers were killed 
radio stations reported that at least six people were killed in 
the capital in couprelated clashes and that mobs pillaged two 
homes owned by namphy and the home of portauprince mayor franck 
romain 
although motives for the coup were unclear it appeared the 
soldiers and noncommissioned officers of the elite presidential 
guard were disenchanted with namphys authoritarian rule 
a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the presidential guard had given the armys high command a list of 
19 demands for forming a new government including democratic 
reform and better living conditions for soldiers 
all the demands were accepted the diplomat said except the 
nomination of col jeanclaude paul as military commanderinchief 
paul has been indicted on federal drugtrafficking charges in 
florida 
paul commander of the dreaded 700man dessaline unit had been 
regarded as the most powerful figure in haiti after namphy it was 
not known if paul played a part in the coup but sources said he 
and namphy were at odds 
in washington state department spokeswoman anita stockman said 
the united states still wanted paul extradited to face the drug 
charges 
initial reaction to the coup from advocates of democratic reform 
was positive but cautious 
i will support the military government if they say as soon as 
possible when they will call elections said louis dejoie ii 
leader of the national agricultural industrial party we are 
ready to speak with any government that respects human rights 
in his statement to the nation early sunday avril said haiti 
will respect all international treaties liberties and human rights 
and that dialogue will be honored for the sake of national 
reconciliation 
the statement was considered significant because it echoed a 
recent offer for dialogue from opposition leader marc bazin a 
conservative leader of the committee for democratic understanding 
bazin and dejoie were among four leading candidates for 
president in the nov 29 elections and boycotted the elections won 
by manigat 
dejoie said he expected the military to announce when elections 
would be held in the next week or so 
they must do it or they wont have any support dejoie said 
the army right now has to regain its credibility we want to give 
them a chance with this new change of guard 
avril has been a key behindthescenes figure in a succession of 
governments since nationwide riots forced duvalier to flee to 
france duvalier had been president since the 1971 death of his 
father francois duvalier who ruled since 1957

portauprince haiti ap prosper avril a quiet studious 
50yearold career soldier has emerged from the shadows of haitian 
politics to proclaim himself president of this violencewracked 
republic 
avril a thin bespectacled man looked more like a college 
professor than a soldier when he announced on national television 
sunday that he was persuaded by the presidential guard to head 
the military government only his dress uniform and military cap 
gave him away 
i find myself forced to accept the office of president of the 
military government the softspoken new president said in the 
same breath avril a brigadier general and adjutant general 
announced he had promoted himself to lieutenant general 
avril a career soldier of humble origin was born in the small 
town of thomageau a short distance from the capital but close 
associates say he is extremely intelligent and has used the army to 
manipulate his way to power and riches he is believed to be a 
millionaire 
his career has always been linked closely to those who wield 
power in haiti 
early on he caught the eye of francois papa doc duvalier 
the country doctor who founded the duvalier political dynasty more 
than 30 years ago 
avril graduated at the head of his class from the military 
academy during the first year of duvaliers rule he was a 
classmate of brig gen williams regala who later would be part of 
the fiveman provisional government which ruled haiti immediately 
after duvaliers son jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile on feb 
7 1986 
always a survivor avril served under both duvaliers and as a 
political adviser to lt gen henri namphy who headed the junta 
that replaced jeanclaude 
avril is said to get along well with just about everyone and to 
have no enemies in the army which is considered a rare 
accomplishment he was retired by jeanclaude near the end of his 
regime due to a conflict between avril and interior minister roger 
lafontant a man known for his brutal methods of maintaining law 
and order 
although he joined the junta as an adviser avril was forced to 
resign in early 1986 by massive protest demonstrations seeking the 
ouster of all former associates of the duvaliers 
with the rank of colonel he became inspector of the 
presidential guard a job he kept when president leslie manigat 
took office on feb 7 1988 after being elected in 
militarycontrolled elections boycotted by the most popular 
candidates 
avril then helped namphy regain power in a bloodless coup in 
june 
namphy promoted him to brigadier general and appointed him 
adjutant general of the army an administrative post 
avril has always been a staunch supporter of the duvalier 
regime one of the most oppressive dictatorships in the world until 
it was toppled in 1986 he was believed to have had an office at 
the national bank where he managed the special bank accounts of 
jeanclaude 
avril is married to a nurse 
he has no reputation for cruelty and those who know him say he 
has two attributes that are rare in the army a keen political mind 
and the ability to listen to others 
the president guard sergeant who announced on television that 
namphy had been overthrown introduced avril as the most honest 
man in the army 
many in haiti took heart from his promise that dialogue will 
be honored for the sake of national reconciliation which was 
interpreted by many as an offer to negotiate with the democratic 
opposition 
this event has come at the right moment to put an end to a 
government which was going to lead the country to an abyss we 
greet with satisfaction the first declaration of the new 
president said an unexpected admirer max bourjolly 
secondincommand of the haitian communist party

for many texas ranchers hurricane 
gilbert may turn out to be what the bankers have ordered 
the hurricane looked for a time as if it might storm its way 
into the hill country and leave a trail of flooding and 
winddamaged property 
instead the storm broke up mostly into a series of gentle fall 
rains that officials say will boost agricultural prospects in the 
southwestern part of the state 
it was just about what we wanted perfect so far said 
don mathis director of a farmers home administration district that 
governs federal agricultural lending in 26 counties in central 
texas hill country and in the western part of the state 
most of the territory already has gotten from 2 to 5 inches 
of rain mathis said sunday if a lot of these people hadnt 
gotten rain they would have had to sell off a lot of their basic 
herd and practically start all over 
until gilberts rains mathis said a drought situation was 
getting critical 
mathis said he will attend a meeting early this week in oklahoma 
city at which adminstration officials will update farm lending 
policies a lack of rain earlier this month had been threatening to 
set back what had been a modest economic recovery during the past 
two years he said 
evidence of the rainfall shortage could be seen during the past 
two weeks at livestock houses mathis said many ranchers whose 
grazing land was running thin began dumping sheep and goats in 
record numbers at junction and san angelo he said 
calf sales also were approaching records although many of them 
were not being sold at ideal weights mathis said ranchers simply 
decided it was more lucrative to sell them now than to purchase 
grain and fatten them 
this rain makes a lot of difference he said its going 
to mean the ranchers wont have to buy as much hay for their 
livestock this winter 
the economic impact wont stop at ranch property lines mathis 
said 
its going to make a difference in all our area mathis 
said in many of our little towns not losing that cash flow is 
going to mean a lot 
weather officials said more rain could fall in the hill country 
and parts of west texas as what at one time was the most intense 
hurricane on record continued to break up and stall against a cold 
front encroaching from the northwest

the worlds whooping crane population 
down to 16 in 1941 probably will exceed 200 this winter perhaps 
the highest number of the regal white birds this century 
they have taken a nice jump in the last few years said 
james lewis whooping crane coordinator for the us fish and 
wildlife service in albuquerque we have to give nature an awful 
lot of credit for that 
this is our best year since probably early this century or 
late last century were not sure really we didnt have good 
figures back then but id say its probably the best since early 
this century 
lewis said he expects about 145 cranes from canada at their 
winter grounds at the aransas national wildlife refuge on texas 
gulf coast 
a flock of 18 birds from grays lake national wildlife refuge in 
southeastern idaho is expected at its winter grounds primarily 
along the central rio grande valley in new mexico lewis said 
the grays lake flock was started in 1975 in an attempt to create 
a second whooping crane flock in case disaster should befall the 
canadian flock 
for more than a decade biologists have been removing eggs from 
whooping crane nests in the canadian flock and placing them in 
sandhill crane nests at the idaho refuge to boost the number of 
whooping cranes there 
the adopted whooping cranes are raised by their sandhill foster 
parents and travel with the sandhill cranes 750 miles to their 
winter grounds in new mexico 
a captive flock of 47 cranes is at the patuxent wildlife 
research center at laurel md another whooping crane lives at the 
international crane foundation at baraboo wis and a single 
whooping crane lives in a zoo in san antonio texas lewis said 
the longnecked whooping cranes protected by the federal 
endangered species act are white with black wing tips typically 
stand about 5 feet and can have a 7foot wingspan 
in autumn the largest flock flies 2500 miles to aransas from 
its summer nesting grounds at wood buffalo national park in 
canadas northwest territory 
in canada its been a good year lewis said they had 20 
to 22 chicks and banded 17 of them in a oneday operation 
wood buffalo had plenty of water which could make a prime 
nesting season in 1989 he said 
when theres water theres plenty of food such as frogs 
crayfish aquatic insects and tubors for the whooping cranes lewis 
said 
high water also cuts losses due to predators 
predators seem to come in more drought years and they include 
wolves that prey on young chicks before theyre flying lewis 
said 
the peak population at aransas last winter was 134 and lewis 
said 131 survived to spring migration 
but while the canadian wild flock was in summer paradise the 
smaller one which peaked at 33 in the winter of 198485 has had 
to endure drought at grays lake lewis also blamed the flocks loss 
of 15 birds on predators

when hurricane gilbert slammed into the 
yucatan peninsula last week it dealt a crippling blow to mexicos 
vital tourist industry which depends on the peninsula for 
onefourth of its revenue 
antonio erales tourism director for the caribbean resort of 
cancun estimated storm damage there alone at 429 million 
he said tourism at cancun on this resort island and on the 
island of isla mujeres will be suspended for up to three months for 
repairs 
cancun will be back to normal possibly in december erales 
said 
about 90 percent of cancuns beachfront hotels and all seaside 
establishments in cozumel and isla mujeres were damaged by the 
storm which claimed at least 31 lives in the yucatan 
in jamaica officials said montego bay and other big resorts on 
the northern coast escaped the worst of the storm 
prime minister edward seaga of jamaica estimated that gilbert 
caused 8 billion worth of damage when it struck on monday but of 
the islands nearly 600 millionayear tourism industry he said 
im glad to say its in reasonably good shape 
yet most major hotels in montego bay bore plain signs of 
gilberts ferocity gaping holes in roofs and ceilings shattered 
windows standing water mangled balcony railings 
four of montego bays five biggest hotels were shut down because 
of damage and the fifth the wyndham rose hall beach hotel and 
country club faced costly repairs only two of the 15 big 
restaurants in the resort area managed to open 
the extent of the destruction was such that it was difficult to 
imagine the famous resort recovering anytime soon barring a 
massive rebuilding program 
in the yucatan officials said they had advised international 
tourist agents of the problems in the area which attracts most of 
its visitors from the united states and europe 
the stayaways are sure to hurt tourism which vies with 
mexicos maquiladora or inbond assembly industry as the 
countrys secondleading generator of foreign exchange after oil 
officials and residents in the yucatan worry about the impact 
gilberts destruction will have on the local economy 
about 50000 people live here and all of us earn our living 
from tourism if the authorities dont solve this problem soon 
there will be 50000 unemployed lamented lazaro torre a 
22yearold lobsterman from cozumel about 6000 tourists visit the 
island each week 
what are we going to do asked jose luis viniegas an owner 
of a small fishing boat company on cozumel he said most of his 
boats were destroyed in the storm 
both cozumel and cancun still lacked drinking water electricity 
and telephone service on sunday medical authorities expressed 
concern about sanitary conditions 
tourists caught in gilberts path waited for days to get a 
flight home or salvage their vacations with a trip elsewhere air 
traffic was limited to daylight hours because gilbert knocked out 
runway lights and nighttime radar 
miguel mairu of venezuela was among 3500 visibly exhausted 
tourists waiting at cancun airport saturday for a seat on one of 13 
commerical flights out of the city 
gilbert dashed all our plans to spend unforgettable days 
said mairu in cancun for his honeymoon the hotel where we were 
staying was destroyed and i spent my wedding night next to my 
beautiful wife but also with another 600 people who also slept in 
the ballroom of another hotel 
some vacationers complained they received little or no warning 
that the most powerful storm on record was about to hit 
we got to cancun on the last flight on tuesday said joan 
mccarrick 31 of hillsdale nj we didnt even know anything 
about it we got to our hotel put our things in our room and went 
downstairs to have dinner 
thats when they told us we had to evacuate she said

panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega says 
his forces have detected new attempts to oust him perhaps linked 
to president reagans order authorizing covert operations in 
panama according to a published report 
in his first us newspaper interview since he was indicted on 
federal drug charges by two florida grand juries in february 
noriega also told the miami herald the reagan administration has 
sent two recent messages inviting him to resume bilateral talks 
that collapsed in may 
the general commenting on rumors that the us government is 
backing dissident panamanian military officers to promote a coup or 
to set up a rebel movement said his defense forces have spotted 
efforts to contact people and money to buy people for a new 
attempt to topple his regime 
we the military can never dismiss these kinds of things 
noriega said in the interview conducted thursday near panama city 
and published sunday in security matters every information has 
to be analyzed and followed 
the rumors he said escalated two months ago when the 
washington post reported that reagan had signed a secret order 
authorizing a series of unidentified covert actions aimed at 
ousting noriega the plan reportedly included psychological 
warfare actions 
we have received information from people who have participated 
in these seditious meetings noriega said they are 
discussing the kind of plans you make if you are seeking to stage a 
coup 
noriega welcomed recent invitations to resume bilateral talks 
calling the us overtures a positive step and adding that his 
government is ready to start serious scientific and realistic 
negotiations immediately 
us officials confirmed that there have been meetings with 
members of the ruling coalition in the last few days but added 
these were part of regular meetings with a crosssection of 
panamanian political leaders the herald said they denied these 
were proposals for new negotiations 
noriega said he is ready to meet facetoface with ousted 
president eric delvalle without preconditions if that helps 
solve panamas crisis 
previously noriega has said he would never sit down with 
delvalle who unsuccessfully tried to fire him as commander of 
panamas defense forces early this year 
the us government last may offered to lift two drug 
indictments against noriega if he would step down both 
presidential candidates vice president george bush and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis have said they oppose a deal 
that would result in dismissal of the indictments

citing mounting chaos saw maung on sunday ousted civilian 
president maung maung set up a peace restoration committee 
with himself as chairman abolished most organs of state and 
imposed a curfew on rangoon the capital 
saw maung promised multiparty general elections when order was 
restored but people took to the streets of rangoon today to 
protest his seizure of power and troops fired on them reportedly 
killing dozens 
most protesters were unarmed 
analysts had never ruled out the possibility of a coup by the 
186000strong armed forces the only well organized group left in 
burma but events had appeared to be moving toward a compromise 
between opposition leaders and the entrenched old guard 
though little is known about saw maung he is widely considered 
close to both ne win and the ruthless former president sein lwin 
many western diplomats in rangoon believe both men remain the key 
power brokers in burma despite their official resignations 
saw maung 59 was named defense minister july 27 in sein lwins 
government which subsequently ordered troops to gun down unarmed 
protesters faced by huge national demonstrations sein lwin 
resigned aug 12 after 17 days in power but saw maung maintained 
both his defense portfolio and post as head of the armed forces 
his close association with sein lwin described by opponents as 
the most hated man in burma may have helped provoke todays 
displays of outrage on rangoons streets 
saw maung was also criticized earlier by key opposition figure 
aung gyi for bypassing the prescribed chainofcommand when he 
ordered the 44th light infantry division into rangoon in march to 
put down studentled demonstrations with brutal force 
he lacks the intellectual gifts of his predecessors at that 
post and therefore is seen as easily manipulated by the two top 
leaders wrote burma expert bertil lintner in a recent issue of 
the hong kongbased news magazine far eastern economic review 
orders from the top men ne win and sein lwin are normally 
executed by saw maungs deputy maj gen than shwe who lintner 
described as a ruthless field commander who is more feared than 
respected by his subordinates 
than shwe was listed in the no 2 position on the 19member 
peace restoration commitee 
according to official records saw maung was born in mandalay 
and studied at a high school in that former royal capital 
he joined the army in 1949 one year after burma gained 
independence from britain although he was not of ne wins 
generation which fought first against the british and then the 
japanese in world war ii saw maung appeared to have gained the 
generals favor 
by 1967 five years after ne wins military coup against a 
democratically elected government saw maung became a battalion 
commander and major from 1975 to 1976 he headed the 99th light 
infantry division which fought communist insurgents and ethnic 
minority kachin rebels in remote frontier areas 
an alleged coup attempt by some military officers against ne win 
in 1976 saw a major purge of army ranks those who stayed on and 
did well had to prove their loyalty notes josef silverstein a 
burma scholar at new jerseys rutgers university 
saw maung was rewarded in 1976 with the southwest command one 
of nine regional military commands in burma he held the position 
until 1981 when he became the adjutant general 
two years later he was named army commander or the vice chief 
of staff for the army in burma and deputy defense minister he was 
promoted to chief of staff or armed forces commander in 1985

pope john paul ii ended a 10day tour 
of southern africa today with a call for peace and racial justice 
in the region but south african antiapartheid leaders said he was 
not tough enough on pretoria 
in a farewell speech at maputos airport before flying to rome 
the pontiff said southern africa is a region where woeful 
violations of human rights persist 
he said each person should enjoy fundamental rights without 
any restrictions or limitations justified by racial segregation or 
social discrimination 
officials of mozambiques marxist government who previously 
have denounced local roman catholic bishops for urging negotiations 
with guerrillas said the popes visit would improve churchstate 
relations 
but activist clergymen from south africa said the pontiff should 
have spoken out more forcefully against their whiteminority 
governments policies of apartheid under which 26 million blacks 
have no say in national affairs 
the pope has given the south african government more comfort 
than it deserved said the rev allan boesak president of the 
world alliance of reformed churches 
he spoke at a news conference after he and other protestant 
clergy from south africa attended a papal mass and joined 
mozambican church leaders at a meeting with john paul 
the pontiff began his trip in zimbabwe he also visited 
botswana swaziland and lesotho and made a brief unscheduled stop 
in south africa when his plane was diverted in bad weather 
boesak said the threehour papal stop in johannesburg was a 
propaganda coup for south african authorities who had complained 
about the omission of their country from the official itinerary 
south african foreign minister pik botha greeted the pope 
ordered a security force escort for a motorcade to lesotho and 
later boasted about south africas hospitality 
anyone who enters into dialogue with the south african 
government must be aware that they are going to use you for their 
own purposes said boesak 
one of boesaks colleagues the rev frank chikane said the 
pope had met with officials who hurt us and cause us pain and 
had been escorted by people who torture us 
chikane is secretarygeneral of the south african council of 
churches which is leading a civil disobedience campaign 
challenging emergency regulations and apartheid laws 
john paul spoke out several times during his trip against racial 
injustice he also condemned all types of violence and suggested he 
was unenthusiastic about confrontational antiapartheid strategies 
such as sanctions and election boycotts 
in mozambique the pope urged both sides in the countrys 
11year civil war to cease fighting and proposed a wordwide effort 
to rebuild the country 
with violence nothing can be built and much is lost he 
said urging mozambicans to follow the path of dialogue and 
reconciliation which will stop the spilling of blood among 
brothers 
the government despite its opposition to negotiations 
responded mildly 
jose luis cabaco a foreign affairs department official said 
the popes appeal conformed with a government offer of amnesty to 
rebels who surrender 
cabaco also said the papal visit brought the government and 
the church into joint committees where we had to look each other in 
the eyes and talk something we had not been doing 
civil war has left about 6 million of mozambiques 145 million 
people in need of foreign food aid 
this nation needs assistance from other peoples and from the 
international community the pope said let me stress the 
urgency of this solidarity aimed at a quick total pacification 
and immediate aid grants to save a large amount of human lives

prime minister zbigniew messner today 
announced the resignation of his government which had been under 
fire for its ineffectual handling of the nations ailing economy 
the resignations come less than a month after polands most 
serious labor unrest in seven years 
the government has been criticized as sluggish in implementing a 
broad economic reform plan this year and for its handling of price 
hikes which have resulted in annual inflation of 60 percent 
in a speech to parliament messner offered a defense of his 
governments performance but admitted to mishaps implicitly 
acknowledging that his government had lost public confidence 
it was not announced when a new government would be named and 
it was possible that messner or some of his ministers could be 
reappointed by the sejm or parliament under sejm rules a new 
government need not be appointed immediately 
in poland the communist party is the actual seat of power and 
appoints the government through its majority in parliament the 
government is responsible for executing the goals of the party 
which is led by gen wojciech jaruzelski 
the party has criticized the pricehike operation because wages 
under pressure from workers were allowed to rise faster than 
prices wiping out any benefits to the economy from the higher 
prices 
the inflation sparked a wave of strikes in april a second wave 
broke out in august and ended only when authorities and solidarity 
chairman lech walesa agreed on entering into broadbased 
discussions that could include the reinstatement of the banned free 
trade union movement 
in his speech messner the prime minister since 1985 appeared 
to dispute a recent emphasis on dialogue with the opposition and to 
make an appeal for support from hardliners within the party 
we are paying for the strikes now with escalation of demands 
and greater chaos in the market loss of authority of management 
we again have become a symbol of anarchy in the world messner 
said 
political methods of solving tensions cannot mean tolerance 
for lawbreaking he said 
before messners speech the sejm or parliament heard a 
critical report from an extraordinary committee set up to monitor 
the governments performance in implementing economic reform 
jaruzelski had recently distanced himself from messner 
at a communist party meeting aug 28 during the last strike 
wave he criticized the governments performance and called on 
parliament to decide its future at this months meeting 
later the official trade union alliance opzz passed a 
resolution calling for the government to resign 
on sunday walesa told 50000 pilgrims at a workers mass in the 
southern city of czestochowa that the government is close to 
recognizing solidarity which was banned in a 1981 military 
crackdown that ended its 15month heyday 
walesa addressed hundreds of solidarity delegations from across 
the country who converged on the jasna gora monastery for an annual 
pilgrimage of workers 
it was the first public address by walesa since he announced 
friday that solidarity agreed to participate in talks on legalizing 
the union which was banned in 1982 the talks are set for 
midoctober 
walesa agreed to end a wave of strikes last month after the 
government agreed to talks on solidaritys future 
walesa spoke at the end of a rainy outdoor mass celebrated by 
cardinal henryk gulbinowicz archbishop of wroclaw 
solidarity is very close solidarity will be when we are 
really listening and if we turn our slogans into action walesa 
told the crowd spread out on a plain below the fortress walls of 
the 600yearold monastery 
i want to thank the priests at the mass for feeling what i 
feel solidarity is and will be it all depends on us and how we 
listen he said without elaborating it was an apparent 
reference to recent talks between the union and authorities

the captors of four foreign hostages 
including three americans have issued another statement saying 
they would consider freeing the men if the united states expressed 
support for the 9monthold palestinian uprising 
the handwritten arabic language statement signed by the islamic 
jihad for the liberation of palestine was accompanied by a 
photograph showing the four hostages playing cards it was 
delivered sunday to the beirut office of a western news agency and 
beiruts annahar newspaper 
the four men were kidnapped jan 24 1987 from the campus of the 
usaffilitated beirut university college they are alann steen 
49 a journalism instructor jesse turner 41 a visiting professor 
of mathematics and computer science robert polhill 55 a lecturer 
in accounting and mithileshwar singh 60 a visiting professor of 
finance and a legal resident alien of the united states 
the kidnappers first offered to free the four in a statement 
released thursday the latest statement like the previous one 
said the hostages would be freed if the united states declares 
support for the palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine is believed to be 
made up of shiite moslem zealots loyal to iran and sympathetic to 
the palestine liberation organization 
this initiative still stands and we are waiting for responses 
in light of which we shall take the next steps required by the 
interests of the blessed uprising the statement said 
our inclination to free the hostages is not an invitation for 
negotiations but it comes within our conviction of human and 
ethical values it said 
that appeared to be a reply to the us state departments 
assertion in response to thursdays statement that it was 
unwilling to negotiate with the kidnappers 
the recent statements by the captors has triggered speculation 
that they are softening their demands

prisoners held by israel and its militia allies in south lebanon 
israel refused to free anyone

the social democratic party presiding 
over a booming economy fought off a challenge from the 
environmentalist greens to retain its hold on a minority government 
in parliamentary elections 
nearly complete results from sundays balloting gave the greens 
a place in the 349member riksdag or parliament for the first 
time with 20 seats however the greens were denied the key role as 
a legislative power broker 
results today from all but a few mailed ballots invalid returns 
or votes for splinter parties showed the social democrats won 156 
parliament seats or 436 percent a loss of three seats from the 
1985 elections 
the communist party won 21 seats to finish fifth with 59 
percent of the vote a gain of two although there is no formal 
agreement the communists tacitly support the social democrats and 
guarantee their ability to govern 
the conservative opposition moderates with 66 seats or 179 
percent finished a distant second 
the liberals came in third with 44 seats or 122 percent next 
came the center party with 42 seats or 114 percent the 
communists and the greens with 55 percent the christian 
democrats won no seats although they got 3 percent of the vote 
the greens the first new party to enter parliament in 70 years 
drew most of their support from nonsocialist opposition parties 
which suffered their worst combined defeat since world war ii 
prime minister ingvar carlsson who took office after the 1986 
assassination of olof palme said we have ridden out the storm 
and stood steady in the wind and we have won 
carlsson admitted he had felt a bit nervous leading the 
social democrats in an election for the first time 
moderates leader carl bildt claimed the outcome showed hope for 
the opposition and the beginning of a decline for the social 
democrats which lost support in the big cities where political 
attitudes change faster 
preelection polls incorrectly predicted the communists would 
fail to win the 4 percent minimum for a seat in the unicameral 
chamber many people were believed to have voted for the social 
democrats to ensure the partys survival resulting in what party 
leader lars werner called its best election in 40 years 
the entry of the greens will have little impact on the workings 
of the riksdag but could prove disruptive in the future some 
political commentators said 
voter turnout was 864 percent the lowest in 28 years 
swedish television broadcasting the official results said 
about 2 percent slightly more than ususal cast blank ballots or 
voted for one of about 100 fringe parties as a protest vote 
according to preelection surveys about 10 percent of the 
voters made up their minds in the last few days 
the social democrats architects of swedens welfare state had 
been shaken by a series of mishaps earlier this year including a 
politically risky attempt to sponsor a private investigation into 
palmes unsolved murder the popular justice minister annagreta 
leijon was forced to resign in june for overstepping her authority 
in the affair 
carlsson admitted the irregular probe and reports of illegal 
arms sales by swedish companies had hurt the party we would have 
done better if not for the scandals he said 
carlsson targeted the final weeks of the campaign on management 
of the economy at a time when business profits and wages were high 
unemployment was reduced to 17 percent and public spending was 
brought into line 
he also played on disunity in the opposition recalling their 
chaotic six years in office during which they had four 
governments the social democrats who had governed for 44 years 
from 1932 returned to power in 1982 
the opposition parties attacked the governments failure to curb 
inflation which has been running at 7 percent they campaigned for 
reforms to reduce income taxes that slice 75 percent off the top 
brackets taxes in sweden equal more than 55 percent of the gross 
national product the highest in the world 
foreign minister sten andersson attributed his partys victory 
to a healthy economy and a platform of careful tax reform 
we wanted to develop welfare while the other parties wanted 
to dismantle parts of it that is very stupid of them he said 
preelection predictions had said the greens officially called 
the environment party would hold the balance of power between the 
left and the centerright blocs giving the novice party unusual 
leverage

iran said its 8yearold war with iraq 
claimed the lives of 123220 soldiers and 11000 civilians 
islamic guidance and culture minister mohammad khatami also said 
in an interview sunday that 60711 other military personnel were 
listed as missing in action khatami speaking on tehran radio 
monitored in nicosia said iran believed many of the missing are 
prisoners of war in iraq 
the death toll cited by khatami was well below estimates of 
300000 iranians killed that western military analysts considered 
to be conservative it was the first time tehran announced war 
casualty figures 
iraqi officials have claimed more than 800000 iranians were 
killed before a unsponsored ceasefire took effect aug 20 
khatami gave no figures for irans wounded western analysts 
estimated earlier this year that 600000 to 700000 people had been 
wounded in the war 
us and other western analysts have estimated 120000 iraqis 
were killed and 300000 wounded in the conflict 
iran held a 31 manpower edge over its foe but for much of the 
war the iraqis fought from heavily fortified defense lines that 
helped minimize their casualties 
khatami who is also a deputy commander at military 
headquarters said irans revolutionary guards suffered the worst 
casualties with 79664 killed 
the revolutionary guards bore the brunt of the fighting and 
repeatedly launched humanwave offensives against iraqs formidable 
defenses 
khatami said 35170 soldiers of the regular army were killed 
the officer corps of the army built up by shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi was crippled by revolutionary purges after the monarch was 
toppled by ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis islamic revolution in 1979 
khatami said 5061 members of the paramilitary gendarmerie also 
were killed while a military engineering force lost 2075 people 
in addition 1270 police and revolutionary committee members were 
killed he said 
the iranian minister said iraqi attacks on iranian cities 
claimed the lives of 11000 civilians 
diplomatic sources said several thousand civilians were slain in 
a sevenweek war of the cities earlier this year when iraq 
fired about 300 longrange missiles into tehran and other cities 
towns along the border were shelled almost daily by iraqi 
artillery and shortrange rockets 
authorities in the iraqi capital of baghdad listed 18000 
iranian prisoners of war in july but said the total was probably 
closer to 35000 because many iranians were captured in offensives 
shortly before the ceasefire 
iran has told the international committee of the red cross that 
it holds 46098 iraqis but a un team that visited iranian 
prisoner camps july 2330 estimated the figure was closer to 70000

israel today successfully launched test 
satellite horizoni over the mediterranean sea it reportedly 
carried surveillance equipment to monitor israels arab enemies 
the silver craft was set aloft south of tel aviv where 
witnesses saw it arch and watched as booster rockets disengaged and 
fell to the sea the launching made israel the eighth country known 
to possess a rocket powerful enough to put a satellite into space 
a spokesman for janes defense weekly the londonbased defense 
magazine said the israeli satellite was believed to be carrying 
a 3kilogram 12pound payload for surveillance purposes 
apparently for monitoring activity in arab countries 
foreign minister shimon peres discounted fears that the 
launching would spur an arms race with its arab enemies 
its not an arms race peres said on israel radio the 
arabs bought missiles and produce missiles and will do anything 
they can anyway 
tony banks a reporter for janes who is known to have close 
ties to israeli military sources said israel was not thought to 
have the capability to install its own sophisticated surveillance 
equipment in a satellite 
us optical equipment is assumed to have been used in the 
payload banks told the associated press in london 
foreign reports said earlier that the satellite was a test craft 
that would precede the launching of a spy satellite 
yuval neeman head of israels space agency described the 
launching as all in all very clean work 
he called the craft a technological satellite but 
acknowledged theres military potential in all this activity 
meir amit former head of israels mossad secret service and 
current chief of israels general satellite corp said the 
launching could give israel independent access to satellite 
pictures currently provided by the us government 
if you are fed from the crumbs of others according to 
their moods this is very inconvenient and very difficult amit 
said on israel radio if you have your own independent 
capability you climb one level higher 
neeman said the satellite launched shortly before noon rose 
to a height of about 250 kilometers 155 miles that will be its 
closest point to earth it will reach a distance of about 1000 
kilometers 620 miles 
it will revolve around the earth in about an hour and a 
half neeman said on israel radio the satellite will fly for 
about a month afterward it will burn up 
the other countries known to possess the technology to launch a 
satellite are the united states the soviet union china japan 
france britain and india 
 
the launching came a day after israels 10member inner cabinet 
approved the mission according to israeli media reports 
plans to launch an experimental satellite surfaced sunday in the 
israeli media which quoted reports in the british weekly flight 
international and time magazine as saying the test craft would 
precede putting a spy satellite in orbit 
israeli leaders refused to comment on those reports 
the israeli daily haaretz quoted experts as saying the odds were 
high that something would go wrong during israels first attempt to 
launch a satellite 
unidentified defense experts told the hadashot daily sunday that 
a spy satellite would provide faster and more accurate information 
about enemy military movements on the ground and save money by 
reducing the number of reconnaissance flights 
but gerald steinberg a former us space expert now living in 
israel told the jerusalem post a single spy satellite would be 
almost meaningless in helping to defend israel 
an entire system of satellites costing about 10 billion would 
be needed to make a serious contribution the post quoted steinberg 
as saying 
until now israel has relied on reconnaissance aircraft and 
pilotless drones for intelligencegathering 
work on the israeli satellite started in 1983 when israels 
space agency was created the carrier rocket was built jointly by 
the rafael weapons development authority and space aircraft 
industries 
according to foreign reports israel secretly fired a 
mediumrange missile over the mediterranean last may in preparation 
for launching a spy satellite 
israel has limited access to us space satellite information 
but some israeli leaders have made no secret of their 
dissatisfaction with this arrangement 
the relations between the united states and israel when it 
comes to this are those of a patron and his dependent former 
army intelligence chief yehoshua saguy told hadashot

thousands of mourners surrounded the coffin 
containing five torahs destroyed in a synagogue arson fire and 
police have charged two youths with setting the blaze and 
spraypainting swastikas inside the temple 
speakers at sundays funeral ceremony which was attended by 
10000 people compared the vandalism to kristalnacht the night 
of the broken glass in nazi germany that signaled the beginning 
of the holocaust 50 years ago this november

rabbinical institute sharai torah in brooklyn was heavily damaged 
in the blaze early saturday the sabbath between the holiest days 
on the jewish calendar rosh hashana new year and yom kippur

how can such a thing be that the holy torah is destroyed by 
fire a fire from men from haters of the torah 
the whole life is a life of tests but i do not know what this 
test is the torah the scroll containing the first five books of 
the old testament are so holy that by jewish law they are accorded 
a funeral 
after the 90minute service the coffin was carried through the

american allegations that iraq is using 
outlawed chemical weapons against kurdish rebels have touched off a 
wave of antiamericanism in iraq 
but although the conflict may damage usiraqi relations there 
appears little likelihood of a return to the bitter hostility that 
made iraq a leading foe of us middle east policies in the 1970s 
the us senate on sept 9 accused iraq of using poison gas in a 
campaign of genocide against its autonomyseeking kurdish 
minority 
the state department said it had proof of iraqi poison gas 
attacks based on american examination of kurdish refugees in 
turkey britain also condemned baghdad citing compelling 
evidence provided by washington 
the senate demanded economic sanctions against iraq which is 
struggling to cope with a foreign debt estimated at 70 billion 
incurred during its 8year war with iran 
iraq denies the gas allegations and has responded with a wave of 
fierce antiamerican rhetoric its statecontrolled newspapers and 
broadcasts have branded the senate the american knesset a 
reference to israels parliament and claimed it seeks to help 
israel by weakening a powerful arab country 
the iraqis organized a march by 20000 people past the us 
embassy many chanted slogans in english denouncing alleged 
american human rights abuses 
questioning americas right to preach iraqi television screened 
an hourlong documentary depicting the 1945 atomic bombing of 
hiroshima 
it also showed vietnamese children with napalm burns and 
palestinian victims of israeli attacks as well as film of rats 
crawling over homeless americans sleeping in new york city sewers 
the antiamerican propaganda is the strongest since the united 
states and iraq resumed diplomatic ties in 1984 after a 17year 
break caused by us support of israel in the 1967 war with the 
arabs 
today foreign minister tarik aziz said future relations with 
washington depend on whether the us adminstration agrees to the 
senate calls for sanctions against iraq 
if the american adminstration yields to the campaign of the 
senate and the zionist lobby this will have negative effect on 
relations between the two countries aziz told reporters in 
baghdad 
deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoon told the associated press 
last week that iraqs response did not indicate any shift in its 
basic orientation 
but he added if the us policy continues if the tension 
continues obviously trade opportunities and other matters 
would be in jeopardy 
diplomats in baghdad said they expected the burst of rhetoric to 
pass if the chemical weapons charges do not continue 
iraq badly needs western if not american credit to help 
rebuild its warbattered country and reward its weary population 
with consumer goods 
it also seeks diplomatic support in its negotiating struggles 
with iran at peace talks in geneva 
us relations with iraq improved gradually during the persian 
gulf war aided by iraqs growing ties with prowestern states in 
the region and us hostility toward irans islamic fundamentalist 
government 
iraq also appreciated us naval intervention in the gulf to 
protect its arab neighbors shipping from iranian attacks 
but the iraqis remain deeply suspicious of the united states and 
sensitive about signs that foreign countries are tilting toward 
iran in the postwar era 
irans size oil wealth and position on the southern soviet 
flank have made it a focus of western diplomacy for decades and 
tehrans more pragmatic leaders are seeking to end the countrys 
selfimposed isolation 
but iraq too is a strategic country its oil reserves are 
second only to those of saudi arabia it flanks nato member turkey 
and it is argued that iraqs war with iran blocked the expansion of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis islamic crusade 
iraqi leaders claim the western allegations of chemical warfare 
are designed to help both israel and iran 
their suspicions are rooted partly in israeli and american 
efforts to aid iran during the war and by strong us 
identification with israel which regards iraq with a 
millionstrong battlehardened army as a major potential threat 
israel bombed an iraqi nuclear plant in june 1981 to prevent the 
possible development of an arab atomic bomb 
baghdad expressed skepticism about the timing of us actions 
during the war with iran iraq said it used chemical weapons after 
iran used them first iraq drew united natons condemnation but no 
sanctions 
both turkey and the red cross say they have been unable to 
substantiate the gas charges that drew the latest us criticism 
and diplomats critical of iraqs treatment of the kurds refuse 
even in private to characterize it as genocide 
they said the iraqis who lost hundreds of thousands of 
casualties to conventional arms in the war have trouble 
understanding the wests reaction to chemical warfare charges 
the crisis has rallied arabs behind iraq kuwaits foreign 
ministry on wednesday summoned us ambassador nathaniel wilson 
howell to express extreme concern over the us charges an 
official statement said 
it reported that foreign undersecretary suleiman majed 
alshaheen told howell kuwait regrets the way the american media 
exploited such allegations to launch a campaign against iraq at a 
time when neutral parties announced they did not find evidence 
that iraq has used chemical weapons 
it added that kuwait believes that invoking such questions by 
the us senate will only undermine the chances of concluding a 
comprehensive peace agreement between iran and iraq

the gender gap has not faded away as a crucial 
factor in the 1988 presidential campaign it has just changed 
camps the problem now is stalking democrat michael dukakis 
while recent surveys show that bush has erased a doubledigit 
deficit and drawn even with dukakis among women voters those 
surveys also indicate deteriorating support for the massachusetts 
democrat among men 
the polls show that dukakis unfavorable ratings among men are 
now much larger than bushs unfavorable ratings among women 
if george bush continues to run even with women then he wins 
the election big and at the moment he is doing extraordinarily 
well said republican consultant doug bailey 
the gender gap right now is a much bigger problem for dukakis 
than for bush he continued 
bailey as recently as last july 7 said at a news conference 
sponsored by the national federation of business and professional 
womens clubs that if he bush doesnt bridge the gender gap he 
will not win 
now thats all changed and bush has solved the gender gap 
problem although he has not closed it completely bailey said 
gender gap is the term politicians use to describe the 
differences between the way men and women vote it was evident in 
the 1980 election when president reagan won far more support among 
male voters than among female voters according to polls the trend 
repeated itself although to a lesser degree in reagans 1984 
landslide reelection 
a new york timescbs poll released last week showed that among 
men bush held a commanding 53 percent to 37 percent lead while 
among women he held a 4341 percent lead which statistically is a 
dead heat 
thats a far cry from just a few months ago when bush trailed 
dukakis among women voters by more than 20 points and was even with 
dukakis among male voters furthermore a poll in july by hamilton 
frederick and schneiders showed that working women then preferred 
dukakis by a 2to1 margin 
irene natividad chair of the national womens political caucus 
and a former harsh critic of bushs sensitivity to womens issues 
said the narrowing of the gender gap directly reflects positive 
steps that bush and his campaign strategists have taken to court 
the womens vote 
whether its political expediency or real commitment doesnt 
really matter she said when you have child care as part of 
the political dialogue along with foreign policy then i think all 
women win this is the first time weve had such a thing happen 
ms natividad said dukakis needs to do more to stress his own 
commitment to issues deemed important by women or risk seeing his 
remaining 50 percent female support erode further 
bushs recent emphasis on his family on the environment his 
kinder gentler nation acceptance speech his proposal for a 
1000 childcare tax credit calls for an increase in the minimum 
wage and for a parental leave program all have helped him build 
support among women voters analysts say 
also helping have been his hiring of women for several key 
campaign roles and his emphasis on peace as well as economic 
issues these analysts add 
im not bright enough to figure out which of these is the most 
important but collectively they have worked said consultant 
bailey also the fact that hes now viewed as a stronger 
personna has also helped 
norman ornstein an analyst at the american enterprise 
institute said that its not so much that women have turned 
against michael dukakis where he had support it was mostly weak 
support we continue to have a gender gap but it has closed some 
and it has meant less because bushs lead has widened among men 
on dukakis lack of strength among male voters bob beckel who 
managed walter mondales 1984 campaign said democratic nominees 
have had serious troubles with white men for some time now i think 
dukakis is suffering from that 
as much as bush needs to get the gender gap down with women 
the democrats cannot afford to lose by those big margins among 
men beckel said 
rep lynn martin rill has a slightly different view on why 
the gender gap is closing for bush 
women take longer to make up their minds she said 
but now theyve heard george bush on issues that matter for 
the first time people are seeing the george bush that his friends 
talk about

conventional tennis wisdom is all wrong 
says a physics professor who has found that a racket has three 
sweet spots not one and that loose rather than taut strings 
will yield more crosscourt winners 
howard brody a university of pennsylvania professor and weekly 
tennis player has spent thousands of hours over the last decade 
using lasers oscilloscopes and other scientific instruments to 
understand how rackets work 
brody found more than one sweet spot the place on the 
strings where it feels good to hit the ball 
one spot is where there is the least initial shock to the hand 
the second is where uncomfortable vibrations to the hand and arm 
are smallest and the third is the where the ball bounces off the 
strings with the greatest power 
contrary to popular belief tighter strings mean less not more 
power brody said he said he also discovered that stiffer rackets 
give more power than more flexible ones 
brody who has written two books on the science of tennis said 
that the biggest breakthroughs in tennis technology will come in 
improved strings he also foresees rackets made with cushioned 
grips that reduce vibrations 
if i had spent as much time on the courts as ive spent in the 
lab id be a great player brody said

two northern california brush fires 
scorched 14000 acres destroying 24 structures and forcing at 
least 350 people to flee but frosty weather in montana and wyoming 
helped ease blazes there 
about 100 homes were threatened by the windfanned fires that 
began late saturday 15 miles west of vacaville and 20 miles east of 
redding the vacaville fire was arson and caused more than 7 
million in damage to telecommunications equipment officials said 
in wyoming a cold front sunday brought up to 3 inches of snow 
to the firecharred yellowstone national park 
i would be surprised if the fires made any more major runs 
said fire specialist bruce freet but officials werent ready to 
predict the end of the blazes that have involved about half of 
yellowstones 22 million acres 
meanwhile some soldiers who fought yellowstone fires were upset 
at the disparity between army pay and that for civilian 
firefighters base pay for a private is 671 per month but some 
civilian firefighters were making as much as 3700 per month said 
1st lt bob brewer spokesman for the 9th infantry division 
theres a lot of screaming about pay brewer said 
in montana the winter weather quieted the two remaining major 
forest fires and prompted the release of most of the firefighters 
and soldiers who helped battle the blazes the firefighters on the 
lines focused on the 35400acre fire in glacier national park and 
the smouldering 247000acre fire in westcentral montana 
in california some 1500 firefighters were dispatched to fight 
the outofcontrol blazes near vacaville 55 miles northeast of san 
francisco and near redding about 250 miles northeast of the san 
francisco bay area 
nine homes and three outbuildings burned to the ground in the 
10000acre fire near vacaville on sunday while 12 buildings 
including six homes were destroyed by a 4200acre blaze near 
redding fire officials gave no estimate of damage 
evacuees began returning home sunday night as dying winds helped 
firefighters lines had been built around 70 percent of the blaze 
this morning california department of forestry spokesman john teie 
said 
up to 285 people from communities in eastern shasta county were 
evacuated as firefighters battled the redding blaze which was 
fueled by dry timber and 45 mph gusts said evelyn dollarhide a 
spokeswoman with the california department of forestry 
the evacuees included 85 students and counselors from the 
cascade school a boarding school said dollarhide 
more than 800 firefighters fought the blaze which began about 
midnight saturday officials said 
its really awful to walk up and see your place burn said 
andrew scott who spent the night with about 100 others at a red 
cross evacuation center near redding his home was destroyed by 
rapidly moving flames early sunday 
the family also lost three dogs a mobile home and three 
vehicles in the blaze 
we got up there and we didnt have nothing said margie 
scott andrews wife after visiting the rubble that had been their 
home 
in miller canyon near vacaville almost 700 firefighters battled 
the fire that broke out saturday night and forced 65 people from 
their homes 
the blaze was one of four in the area that had been set fire 
officials 
i believe the assumption now is the same person may have 
started all of them said forestry spokesman john ferreira 
about 50 other ranch homes scattered throughout the region were 
threatened said forestry official dianne sanders 
firefighters expected to contain the fire tonight unless 
erratic winds kicked up said ferreira 
atop mount vca several towers used for military telephone and 
television communications were damaged by the fire he said the 
damage was estimated at 7 million 
elsewhere about 550 firefighters on sunday hacked lines around 
an 850acre fire in northcentral idahos gospel hump wilderness 
while special hot shot crews headed to battle the 800acre fire 
in the boise national forest

shots to keep a british helicopter away from a disputed island in 
the south china sea 
a foreign ministry statement denied british press reports that 
the chinese troops fired at the royal navy helicopter and called 
the incident entirely a misunderstanding 
the british embassy said thursday that the helicopter was 
searching for a sinking taiwanese trawler in the south china sea on 
aug 23 when it was hit by gunfire from a chinese garrison on the 
paracel islands the paracels a chain of islands in the south 
china sea are claimed by china and vietnam china seized the 
islands from south vietnam in 1974 
the embassy said the helicopter based on the british frigate 
sirius was nicked but not significantly damaged and no one was 
injured 
the foreign ministry at first refused to confirm or deny that 
chinese troops fired saying only that media reports were incorrect 
and the incident was closed 
but in todays statement china said the helicopter went 
beyond the originally designated flying range and flew at low 
altitude over chinas zhongjian island in the paracels 
under such circumstances our troops stationed there fired 
warning shots the statement said this was entirely a 
misunderstanding now this matter has been resolved

voters in a small farming community 
rebelled against swedens generous refugee policy and 
overwhelmingly rejected a government request to accept a few dozen 
immigrants 
sundays local referendum in the southern district of sjobo was 
closely watched by a nation anxious that a negative vote could be 
seen as the surfacing of supressed racism the referendum was a 
part of nationwide elections 
the result came as a surprise with two out of three voters 
saying no to a proposal to take in the refugees the tt news 
agency reported 6237 people voted against housing the immigrants 
and 3000 voting in favor of the proposal 
it was the first time swedes openly defied their countrys 
longstanding policy to provide sanctuary to political refugees as 
well as language training job skills housing education and 
generous social benefits 
this is a sad result everyone is a loser said madeleine 
ramel head of the social welfare board that would have taken care 
of the immigrants it is unfortunate for sjobo 
mrs ramel said she feared the referendum results would prompt 
other communities to reassess their policy of accepting immigrants 
the agency said the voting was quiet but some opponents of the 
proposal carried placards for a white sjobo and sjobo a 
swedish example 
last year 18000 people the highest rate in europe sought 
political asylum in sweden a neutral nation of 84 million 
according to government figures 
in an effort to relocate the immigrants outside the main cities 
authorities sent letters to 284 municipal districts asking their 
help 
the letter to sjobo did not specify how many refugees the town 
would be asked to shelter or give their national origin but local 
officials said the number would have been between 20 and 40 
the sjobo town council split on the issue last fall and voted 
2524 to put the question to a referendum 
council chairman svenolle olsson head of the center party and 
leader of the fight to keep the immigrants out argued the farming 
community lacked apartments and jobs to keep its own young people 
from moving to the cities 
on sunday olsson also won a clear endorsement for himself when 
his party won 23 seats on the 49member council eight more than it 
previously held 
olof johansson national leader of the center party expressed 
deep regret at the outcome and indicated olsson and other local 
activists would be expelled from the party 
but sjobo is special it is not like all of sweden thank 
god johansson said 
until now sweden has not seen the rightwing backlash to 
immigration that has affected countries like france and denmark 
analysts attributed the quiet acceptance of foreigners to a 
labor shortage and plentiful jobs and to a tradition of humanism 
that was reflected in swedens efforts to rescue jews from nazi 
germany in world war ii 
but hostility toward newcomers has been evident under the 
surface and has occasionally erupted into minor incidents 
a lot of swedes have a negative attitude toward immigrants it 
is normally surpressed but having a referendum is bringing it to 
the surface said political scientist anders sonnerstedt of lund 
university

land in the southeast 150 years ago 
ive always wanted to go on a wagon train trip across the 
country and now im doing it the crusty grayville ill retiree 
said sunday night as he unhitched his fourhorse team from the 
covered wagon he built this summer 
weil put his wagon and horses on a ferry and crossed the 
tennessee river to georgetown this morning the third day of the 
trail of tears commemorative wagon trains journey to tahlequah

the southeast and resettle in tahlequah okla a 1000mile march 
that claimed about 4000 indian lives

a gibraltar policeman testified today he heard 
british commandos shout stop police before shooting to death 
two irish republican army members in this british colony 
a third ira guerrilla who was a short distance away also was 
shot and killed in the march 6 incident 
the police officers statement supported earlier testimony by 
special air service commandos that they had no alternative but to 
shoot mairead farrell daniel mccann and sean savage last march 
on a gibraltar street 
the officers testimony came on the 10th day of an inquest by 
gibraltar coroner felix pizzarello and an 11man jury into the 
shootings of the three unarmed ira members 
critics of the government of british prime minister margaret 
thatcher have claimed the shootings proves there is an unofficial 
shoottokill policy against ira members the outlawed ira 
seeks to drive the british from northern ireland and unify the 
province with the irish republic 
the commandos and british intelligence officers have testified 
they believed the three ira guerrillas possessed a radiocontrol 
device capable of setting off a bomb in a car they had parked near 
the site of a changing oftheguard ceremony 
the commandos pumped more than two dozen bullets into the heads 
and backs of the three the commandos testified they had planned to 
arrest the three but opened fire when ms farrell and mccann made 
threatening movements savage was walking nearby 
shooting for the head was the only way to eliminate the 
possibility one of the three would push a button to set off a bomb 
the commandos said 
police found no radiocontrol device and no bomb in the car 
parked by savage in gibraltar although the ira said the three were 
members on active service 
two days later police discovered a car packed with 141 pounds of 
czechmade explosives in the coastal resort of marbella 
intelligence officials said the bomb was to be activated by two 
electronic timers they speculated the ira members parked the first 
car in gibraltar to save a parking space for the car carrying the 
explosives 
the gibraltar police officer identified only as p 
testified from behind a curtain that hid him from the public and 
the press he said he was on surveillance near the spot where the 
ira members were killed when he saw two of them approaching 
followed by two commandos 
i distinctly heard a shout of stop police from the 
soldiers the officer said 
he said mccanns hand went to his chest and ms farrell reached 
inside the black shoulder bag she was carrying at that point the 
two commandos opened fire the officer said 
the officer said he thought mccann was reaching for a gun and 
that ms farrell was going for the detonator 
so the soldiers had no alternative but to shoot said the 
commandos lawyer michael hucker 
yes sir the officer responded

republican george bush today accused 
michael dukakis today of pursuing an antibusiness scheme as 
massachusetts governor that has produced higher taxes and soaring 
business bankruptcies 
the vice president told the bucks county chamber of commerce 
that his democratic presidential rival this year raised all sorts 
of taxes the income tax the sales tax and one that might be of 
special interest to this audience 
that one he said involved a cutback in a subchapter s tax 
law that had the effect of doubling taxes on massachusetts 
businesses employing fewer than 35 people 
a question of attitude bush said it is here that i think 
my opponent fails frankly since hes never been in business i 
dont think he understands the full effect of his own antibusiness 
scheme 
continuing several days of attacks on dukakis homestate 
economic record bush said the governor is out of the 
mainstream of democrats by opposing a reduction in the capital 
gains tax 
here is the most telling statistic of all for what a dukakis 
administration might mean for small business bush said in the 
first six months of this year the number of business bankruptcies 
nationally was down by 235 percent compared to the same period 
last year in the exact same period the number of business 
bankruptcies was up by 237 percent in massachusetts 
bush said he wants to help small business with overhaul of 
product liability laws to keep insurance costs down 
the vice president also said that between 1980 and 1985 the 
number of businesses owned by women increased by nearly 50 percent 
bush said 5 million new businesses have been created while 
inflation and interest rates have fallen during the eight years of 
the reagan presidency and that small business firms earnings rose 
99 percent in 1987 
the vice presidents planned visit today with roman catholic 
archbishop anthony bevilaqua and retired cardinal john krol was 
postponed because of foggy weather that prevented the campaign 
plane from landing in philadelphia 
bush planned a light schedule of campaign appearances this week 
to give himself time to prepare for his first campaign debate with 
dukakis on sunday 
on tuesday he travels to new jersey to visit the annin flag 
company a business he has cited in speeches as a sign that 
patriotism has been on the rise during the reagan presidency bush 
says flag sales were down when jimmy carter was president but that 
after reagans election business was booming again 
later in the week bush plans a brief campaign trip to texas 
as he prepares for the sunday debate at wake forest university 
in north carolina bush told reporters he is not too good on 
these statistics and needs briefing time to familiarize himself 
with statistical information on various topics that likely will 
come up 
bush and his team have not been hesitant to mention often that 
dukakis is a debating expert and should be expected to perform well 
bush said last week that he isnt nervous about going up against 
dukakis but id like to do well 
hes better than i am on technical style bush said adding 
so ive got to do something else 
he said he hoped he would be able to project who he is as a 
person in keeping with his recent efforts to show a compassionate 
side 
it has to be what you feel and what you are he told 
reporters flying with him last week on air force two 
but bush reflected a calm demeanor toward the debate saying 
i dont view it as make or break or the end of the world or the 
biggest moment of my life

living in this coastal town elwot avery 
learned to pay careful attention to the weather and on the 
afternoon of sept 21 1938 his nose told him to expect an 
autumnal souwester 
it soon became clear it was something much worse trees were 
already down when a twocar garage was lifted by the winds before 
his eyes 
it went up whole like a kite and flew on over the tops of 
the trees and smashed in the road just like so much kindling 
wood recalls avery now 89 
impelled beyond reason to see more avery left his wife and 
stepped outside 
his hilltop home had become an island neighboring houses were 
swamped in 5 feet of water the wind nearly blew him off his feet 
he crawled back on his hands and knees 
the great new england hurricane of 1938 which had turned inland 
virtually without warning was the worst natural disaster to hit 
the region its torrential rains 30foot waves and 186 mph winds 
pulverized granite seawalls twisted railroad tracks like spaghetti 
and leveled whole forests 
moreover the storm was aimed like a giant wrecking ball at the 
most densely populated part of the country the socalled gold 
coast between new york and boston it wiped out 4500 homes and 
badly damaged 15000 other buildings smashed 26000 cars sank 
6000 boats and tore down nearly 20000 miles of electric lines 
the death toll was generally calculated at 580 killed 100 
missing nowhere was it heavier per capita than in westerly a town 
of barely 20000 inhabitants today and fewer then 
within hours of the storms passing the old westerly high 
school became a temporary morgue where bodies eventually more 
than 100 were brought for identification 
avery as owner of a funeral home was put in charge since all 
the telephone lines were down he got a ham radio operator to order 
a truckload of caskets then he worked round the clock for three 
days living on tomato soup and whiskey to bury the dead 
among them was his own mother whose beachside cottage had been 
smashed to pieces by huge waves the last time anyone saw her 
alive he says she was standing in the surf holding the handle of 
a suitcase the suitcase itself had been torn away by the wind 
there were similar scenes of terror everywhere the hurricane 
struck from long island to maine 
as the waves swept through downtown providence people ran for 
higher ground some drowned in the streets 
claire powell who was 9 years old remembers the terror she 
felt when her father did not come home that night 
it turned out he climbed a light pole and hung on until he was 
rescued she says still exuding relief 50 years later 
short circuits caused by flooding set off the worst fire that 
new london conn had seen since benedict arnold and the british 
torched the city in 1781 the flames quickly consumed 30 buildings 
and threatened the entire business district 
firefighters floundering in water above their waists watched 
in frustration as the hurricane blew the spray from their hoses 
back into their faces only a shift in the wind saved the city 
across the region the storm cut power transportation and 
telephones isolating whole communities in somerville mass 
physicians delivered babies by candlelight 
as the connecticut river rose 25 feet and spilled over its 
banks 10000 people were evacuated from lowlying areas of 
springfield mass 
after the flooding came looting fall river marlboro and 
northampton mass were under martial law national guardsmen with 
fixed bayonets patroled providence and westerly 
but there were also many instances of heroism 
the new haven railroads bostonian express was trapped with 600 
aboard by floodwaters at a trestle near stonington conn hulks of 
cottages and boats slammed against the cars passengers screamed as 
the train swayed dangerously 
the engineer ordered everyone into the first car and the tender 
of his locomotive wading into shoulderdeep water he uncoupled 
the other cars then climbed back aboard and opened the throttle 
nudging aside a house that had been tossed onto the tracks and 
driving the locomotive inchbyinch across the buckling trestle to 
safety 
on open water it was a rare boat that was able to ride out the 
storm in somerset mass a 600foot oil tanker was tossed ashore

we lived at that time with a general sense that things would 
always remain largely as they were what the storm proved at first 
blush was that landmarks do not have to endure he says

a group of linguists is working to save the 
language of the alabama indian tribe of eastern texas which had no 
written grammar or dictionary and was faced with extinction as the 
number of speakers dwindled 
heather hardy an associate professor of english at the 
university of north texas began the project after receiving a 
newspaper clipping in 1980 about an alabama tribe member who was 
using note cards to create a dictionary of her native language 
ms hardy decided to contact the woman 
i knew not much had been done on the alabama she said 
when youve got languages in your own back yard that have hardly 
been described at all and are dying out that takes priority 
the alabama live with the coushatta tribe on a joint reservation 
nestled in the big thicket national preserve 70 miles northeast of 
houston 
ms hardy drove to the reservation and found cora sylestine a 
former teacher the two women struck a bargain ms sylestine would 
guide ms hardy through the thickets of her native language if ms 
hardy would help her create the dictionary of her dreams 
first ms hardy had to create a system of writing to record the 
language and the grammar used by its speakers had to be deciphered 
before its words could be broken down for a dictionary 
ms hardy said the process has been laborious done on weekends 
and school breaks financed mostly with small grants and personal 
funds 
as of sept 1 though a team working on the project which 
includes university of north texas linguist timothy montler is 
being financed for two years by a 161000 grant from the national 
endowment for the humanities and the university 
montler a computer expert modified a program the team will use 
to create the dictionary which will define alabama words in 
english and vice versa ms hardy said 
transcribing alabama to written form and translating it to 
english hasnt been as tough as working with some other american 
indian languages which use many sounds that dont exist in 
english ms hardy said only one alabama sound a breathy 
slurred l is not found in english she said the dictionary 
will represent it with an l crossed by a hyphen 
but the language has its own special quirks 
in other languages for instance plural forms usually add 
something be it an s in english or some prefix or suffix ms 
hardy said but in alabama to create a plural the root word is 
shortened the alabama word batatli for example means to hit 
one time but the word batli means to hit repeatedly 
weve never found anything like this ms hardy said it 
led to the joke that in alabama less is more 
ms hardy said she hopes the groups work will allow the tribe 
to start a language reclamation program and create collections of 
alabama folk stories cora says the language is the culture 
ms hardy said by preserving the language you preserve a lot of 
information about the culture

a former chief nasa astronaut says he is 
disappointed in the progress of the nations space program blaming 
the emphasis on the shuttle for a slowdown in space development and 
exploration 
the reusable orbiters on which nasa staked its future in the 
early 1970s have never been the workhorses their supporters 
promised says john w young 
i think we were being unrealistic about what our capabilities 
and limitations were in the old days said young who flew on the 
first manned gemini mission in 1965 it the shuttle just has to 
have too much handson work done with it to make it do all the 
things we wanted it to do 
young now a safety and engineering troubleshooter for the 
johnson space centers director orbited the moon and explored its 
surface during the apollo era he later commanded the first and 
ninth shuttle flights 
it is almost 20 years since we landed people on the moon 
young said and if you had asked me after the moon landing what 
wed be doing in 20 years id have said wed have a base on the 
moon in 20 years 
nasa sold the shuttle to congress as a quickly refurbishable 
inexpensivetooperate spacewagon 
i never believed it could be that way young said i 
wasnt involved in selling it but i was involved in the technical 
details of helping design and build it and it was too 
complicated 
young said the shuttle is capable of fulfilling its creators 
expectations but tight budgets hurt it when nasa could not afford 
to stockpile spare parts for quick repairs 
quick shuttle turnarounds and reflights and routine florida 
landings never panned out nor is the shuttle an inexpensive way to 
fly he added and the assumption that it pays to salvage and reuse 
each 15 million solid fuel rocket booster casings may be wrong 
young said 
delays in flights also affect nasas supply of flightready 
astronauts fourteen astronauts who flew before the shuttle 
challenger exploded decided not to wait for flights to resume the 
space center has 93 astronauts left and is accepting applications 
through july 1 for a 1990 astronaut class 
i expect theres a lot of astronauts leaving because they see 
the line at the end of the tunnel the line theyve got to stand 
in to get a flight is so long

grillos partner daryl branton 24 was relieved of duty with 
pay pending an investigation said miami police spokesman david

allegedly ordered the woman into the back of the patrol car she 
later told police she thought she was being arrested 
they drove to a nearby abandoned building and grillo ordered the

when he entered the democratic race for 
us senate us rep don bonker said he relished the 
longdistance climb it would take to catch his better known 
primary opponent us rep mike lowry 
in the days leading up to tuesdays primary bonker was still 
running uphill after lowry 
on the republican ticket seattle attorney and former us sen 
slade gorton was considered a shooin for the nomination for the 
post being vacated by retiring republican sen dan evans 
gortons two primary opponents had little name recognition and 
even less money as of aug 31 gorton had amassed 891110 in 
donations 
political polls gave lowry 49 the edge and then some in the 
primary 
he enjoyed an enormous advantage the resident of the suburb of 
renton is a far more familiar face in the populous seattle area 
which he has represented for nearly five terms in the house bonker 
is from vancouver in southwestern washington on the columbia river 
bonker 51 leads lowry in the amount of campaign money raised 
although he spent a huge chunk of it early trying to make himself 
better known to voters as of aug 31 bonker had collected 
849694 while lowry raised 803000 
both candidates spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on 
lastminute media buys 
bonker a seventerm congresssman pinned his final push partly 
on a pair of statewide tv ads that painted him as a doer and 
lowry as a slightly buffoonish blowhard 
bonker also attacked lowry as a rebel with the wrong cause among 
the states otherwise unified congressional delegation 
lowry just smiled and continued to call bonker an excellent 
congressman and good friend 
actually their records are similar and despite his moderate 
image bonkers voting record is as liberal as lowrys 
but the two differed on at least two vital but somewhat 
parochial issues neither of which seems to have caught fire among 
voters in fact in eastern washington the contest was dubbed the 
invisible campaign 
bonker favors a measure stalled in house committee that would 
allow states to ban the export of raw logs as necessary to pull 
small and medium sawmills from an economic slump lowry opposes the 
idea saying it would cost jobs hurt the states badly depleted 
common school fund which depends on timber revenue and invite 
foreign trade retaliation 
bonker also favors the basing of a navy ship in everett saying 
the home port would produce jobs lowry calls that home 
porking and says it is a waste of tax dollars and an 
environmental threat 
while the two democrats slugged it out gorton was busy blasting 
both of them as antidefense liberals from the same pod 
gorton 60 lost his senate seat in 1986 to democrat brock 
adams many felt the upset lay partly in gortons icy image and 
perception that he had stopped listening to voters 
gorton vows to hear better to listen better among other 
things he opposes higher taxes and favors efforts to control crime 
and illegal drugs 
also on the republican ballot is port angeles attorney doug 
smith 59 a former pentagon and white house aide under presidents 
nixon and ford who calls gorton a liberal and loser 
the other gop hopeful is former state supreme court justice 
william goodloe of seattle who said recently that his campaign is 
focusing on two issues the sicknesses of too much campaign 
money flowing from political action committees and pornography

a beijing court cleared a newspaper of libel for 
reporting unsanitary conditions in a factory and chinese 
journalists said monday they hope a precedent has been set for 
press freedom 
the official englishlanguage china daily said the case was 
followed closely by chinese reporters because the country does not 
yet have a law stipulating the rights and responsibilities of 
newspapers 
the xinyuanzhai beverage factory of beijing claimed it lost 
160000 in business after the beijing evening news reported in 
july the city was fining it for poor sanitation and flies the 
factory director chang jiangqiu said the story was erroneous 
because he had not paid a fine when the story was published he 
also said the factory did not have flies 
after a sixhour trial last week beijings eastern district 
court said the paper had made only a minor technical error and 
that this was not enough to support a defamation claim china 
daily reported 
the court rejected the factorys demand for 13000 in damages 
and ordered it to pay a 5 trial fee the factory has not said if 
it will appeal 
as part of recent political and economic reforms the chinese 
media have been allowed to investigate and report disasters 
scandals and corruption as well as cases of consumer abuse that 
were previously offlimits 
one result been an increase in the number of legal complaints 
against papers and journalists 
the beijing evening news said it reported on the factorys 
failings to fulfill its responsibility as a consumer watchdog a 
new role for chinas tightly controlled official press 
this is the first libel case actually brought to court against 
a paper said wu jingshu a national news editor at the china 
daily other cases have been settled through mediation he said 
adding journalists think that papers need something to protect 
them people can sue for anything 
the china daily quoted the beijing evening news deputy chief 
editor liu tingzhao as saying the case illustrated the urgent 
need for a journalism law 
legislators began drafting a law in 1984 to codify the rights 
and responsibilities of journalists including the right to 
criticize government officials the law is not yet completed

the united states anticipates difficulty in 
dealing with the new government of haiti if its army is to be 
headed by a colonel facing a drug indictment in florida the white 
house said today 
frantz lubin haitis director of information said in 
portauprince over the weekend that jeanclaude paul commander of 
the dessalines barracks was assuming command of the army however 
gen prosper avril in announcing sunday that he was assuming the 
presidency did not mention paul 
paul has been indicted by a federal grand jury in florida on 
drug trafficking charges 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today that pauls 
appointment would be a telling symbol about the intentions of the 
new president 
on the surface it would be difficult to detect much 
difference in the haitian government as a result of the weekend 
coup that ousted president henri namphy fitzwater said 
i guess the thing we are looking for at the moment is who does 
he avril appoint to various key positions in the government and 
that will give us an indication of how he plans to proceed 
fitzwater said 
appointing paul he said would certainly give us an 
indication of the difficulties we will have with this government if 
he is appointed 
the united states was providing haiti with about 100 million a 
year in economic aid until last november when aid was suspended 
after elections were aborted by violence 
certainly there is no consideration at this point of changing 
that situation fitzwater said 
state department spokeswoman anita stockman said sunday we 
have seen the press reports about colonel paul our position on him 
is well known he is under indictment on narcotics charges and we 
continue to believe he should answer those charges in court 
larry birns director of the council on hemispheric affairs 
which has been critical of reagan administration policy toward 
haiti said pauls status will continue to pose a major dilemma 
for avril because if he wants to get renewed us economic aid 
and military aid as well he has got to not only lead the country 
to democratic reforms and the staging of elections but he has to 
find some way to hand paul over to the american authorities 
officials in washington still were seeking information about the 
haitian coup 
i dont know any more than you do president reagan told 
reporters as he returned to the white house after a weekend at camp 
david the presidential retreat in maryland 
ms stockman said the motivation is not entirely clear 
although we understand that the noncommissioned officers who acted 
against ousted haitian president henri namphy were dissatisfied 
with recent human rights violations and the general deterioration 
in the security situation punctuated by attacks against the 
churches over the past two weeks 
birns said troops under pauls command had been sent to guard 
roman catholic churches in portauprince in recent days the 
700man dessalines barracks located across the street from the 
national palace is the most feared unit of the 7000man national 
army and paul has been considered the most powerful figure in haiti 
after namphy 
birns said he regarded the coup as a hopeful sign although 
he was skeptical that democracy is near in haiti 
avril and the institutionalists in the haitian military 
recognize the country faces a dead end he said that without 
renewed us economic aid and loans from the multilateral lending 
agencies haiti is going to soon dissolve 
avril can be counted on to begin a process that will lead to 
the staging of elections birns said but his major problem 
remains jeanclaude paul who fears extradition to the united 
states 
ms stockman said there were no reports that americans had been 
injured 
she said the airport in the haitian capital was closed and a 
travel advisory cautioned americans to avoid nonessential travel 
and advised them to contact the embassy if they must travel

promises promises promises but no action the 
people complained to mikhail s gorbachev 
perestroika perestroika perestroika he answered referring to 
his program to restructure the economy 
the soviet leader logged hundreds of miles last week in a major 
trip to check the pulse of the people the pulse in eastern 
siberia he found was rapid from anger he got an earful of 
complaints about everything from apartments without hot water to 
stores without meat 
i felt its already impossible to talk to the people the 
57yearold communist party general secretary told local officials 
on only the second day of a fiveday visit to krasnoyarsk 
wherever i was on the street in a factory or here the 
people are simply at your throat and i think theyre right 
gorbachev was hearing that perhaps more than anything else 
soviets want a better place to live and more food on their tables 
by choosing krasnoyarsk for the trip gorbachev was asking for 
complaints 
on july 29 he told a plenary session of the partys 
policymaking central committee in moscow that medical service and 
other urgent problems were particularly acute in the region 
which is 2000 miles east of moscow and encompasses onetenth of 
the entire country 
since the plenum soviet television newspapers and magazines 
have railed about food and consumer goods shortages and the 
resulting long store lines that symbolize the hardships soviets 
endure every day the media also has complained about the failure 
of the government to satisfy the peoples basic needs 
gorbachev has repeatedly said improving the daily lives of 
soviets is a priority in his reform drive soviet and western 
economists have said that gorbachev must offer rewards in the form 
of better housing food consumer goods and higher pay if he is to 
get more work out of people 
for now though people seem unhappy and gorbachev returned 
monday from a sixweek vacation in the crimean sun to face angry 
complaints shouted at him by residents of a tiny village of 
yemelyanovo near krasnoyarsk 
we have no hot water you do what you can to wash one man 
shouted 
other residents complained about poor medical facilities in the 
region a shortage of housing and a lack of meat in stores 
the angry streetside exchange in yemelyanovo and elsewhere 
broadcast on the popular evening news program vremya were a 
marked departure from previous citizens discussions with top 
soviet officials 
before gorbachev took power citizens largely kept their 
complaints to themselves praising government policies when meeting 
with officials or asking uncritical questions but gorbachev with 
his populist style encouragement of openness and his desire to 
stay in touch with the people changed that 
the leadership emphasized the importance of the trip by making 
it one of the longest that gorbachev has made within the soviet 
union since he became general secretary in march 1985 and by 
devoting hours of television coverage and the front pages of most 
newspapers to it daily 
the leaderships concern was reinforced by another simultaneous 
trip by kgb chairman viktor chebrikov to vladivostok a pacific 
port chebrikov who like gorbachev is a member of the ruling 
politburo also heard complaints about work and living conditions 
medical cases and shortages of consumer goods 
gorbachev did not deny that perestroika had failed to improve 
peoples lives adequately his response to the complaints was to 
blame local and central officials and people who had not fully 
endorsed perestroika and were sticking to the old ways still 
he said changes for the better are evident in increasing 
production of consumer goods housing and dairy and meat products 
we have policies that are criticized from all sides but no 
one can suggest anything else he said we have a different 
mood different position different relation to the country and the 
people 
but he said patience was required because tough times are ahead 
do you think that i as general secretary do not want all the 
problems to be solved as soon as possible how nice it would have 
been if we could reach agreement today and have things sorted out 
tomorrow 
and at the end of the visit on friday gorbachev sounding like 
a cheerleader or politician on the campaign trail told krasnoyarsk 
party and government officials he had learned that citizens of 
krasnoyarsk have accepted perestroika then he asked am i 
making the correct conclusion the audience broke out in 
thunderous applause

bursting with olympic pride the south 
korean media is deluging the country with saturation coverage of 
the games including a look at the peculiar habits of foreign 
visitors 
newspapers are racing each other to praise the olympics that are 
seen by koreans as the turning point in the nations transformation 
into a leading industrial power 
seoul captivates world greatest ever show on earth and 
closest thing to perfection trumpeted banner headlines hailing 
the games 
some newspapers predicted the olympics could be a turning point 
for the entire world by helping to usher in peace and 
understanding curtain rises on world in harmony proclaimed 
the chosun ilbo 
the countrys three main televison channels are carrying little 
but olympic coverage from early morning until well past midnight 
with important events repeated several times on each channel 
south korean newspapers are devoting more than half their pages 
to coverage of the olympics with other news crowded onto back pages 
as every facet of the games is breathlessly recounted 
seoul newspapers dont normally publish monday morning or sunday 
evening but they are for the olympics most papers have added up 
to eight extra pages to cope with olympic coverage 
local journalists say olympic fever has swept their publications 
with editors and reporters striving to produce the best coverage 
we are so excited about this festival newspapers are just 
writing everything that comes to mind said a senior journalist 
who demanded anonymity 
the press has also been taking a look at the foreign tourists in 
town for the olympics most south koreans have little experience of 
foreigners and thousands of tourists have been an eyecatching 
sight 
people both koreans and foreigners began a story in the 
korean herald the story praised koreans for their orderly 
behavior with the implication that foreigners were not so well 
behaved 
korean spectators waited in long lines to enter stadiums in an 
orderly manner showing a high sense of order it said 
newspapers have complained about foreigners selling olympic 
tickets but without mentioning that koreans are doing the same 
thing 
donga ilbo lambasted some members of the international olympic 
committee for being arrogant claiming they refused to ride to 
group events in buses and their wives were rude to korean workers 
chosun ilbo noted the american team was the most free or 
liberal during the athletes parade in the opening ceremony 
radical students who demanded the olympics be shared with 
communist north korea focused on the americans in leaflets that 
said the ugliness of yankees was fully displayed during the 
opening parade 
but foreigners ready to praise south korea and the staging of 
the olympics are quickly singled out for media attention heaven 
provided a glorious day like today for koreans to demonstrate the 
stamina which has sustained them during so many dark years one 
american was quoted as saying

republican george bush said today that democrat michael dukakis 
has raised all sorts of taxes in massachusetts and will do the 
same nationally if elected dukakis retorted that the reagan 
administration has left a sea of republican red ink that not even 
moses could part 
bush and his running mate dan quayle both launched 
economicbased attacks on dukakis to kick off a week that will see 
relatively little campaigning as the presidential candidates 
prepare for their first debate next sunday 
in philadelphia bush charged dukakis with championing an 
antibusiness scheme that has caused higher taxes and soaring 
business bankruptcies in massachusetts 
bush told a local chamber of commerce that the democratic 
governor this year has raised all sorts of taxes the income tax 
the sales tax and one that might be of special interest to this 
audience an additional tax on state business 
quayle at a rally in knoxville tenn said dukakis had imposed 
an economic manacle on the states economy a satirical 
reference to dukakis claim of an economic miracle in massachusetts 
he raised virtually every tax in massachusetts said 
quayle now i know what he means when he talks about good jobs at 
good wages if he is elected president he is going to take your 
good jobs at your good wages 
in remarks prepared for a little rock ark appearance dukakis 
said he was tired of bush using selective statistics to misconstrue 
the state of the economy both in massachusetts and nationally 
mark twain once said that there were three kinds of 
falsehoods lies damn lies and statistics dukakis said mr 
bushlikes statistics the statistics that show that more 
americans are working but do not tell you the quality of their 
jobs statistics that tell us that some people and some states are 
doing very very well but dont tell us about the daily struggle 
of many americans to pay their bills 
he also said not all is well with the federal economy as long as 
the budget deficit runs into the billions of dollars 
the next president will inherit a sea of republican red ink 
that not even moses could part dukakis said 
both candidates kept their campaign schedules light this week 
with plenty of time set aside to prepare for their first debate 
bush press secretary sheila tate said the vice president would spar 
in mock debate with former deputy treasury secretary richard darman 
playing the role of dukakis 
while bushs only public appearance sunday was to go to church 
in washington his surrogates were attacking dukakis with one gop 
rep newt gingrich of georgia calling the democratic presidential 
nominee nuts 
in a speech sunday to the california republican convention 
gingrich accused dukakis of being a leftwinger who opposes 
weapons systems supported by bush 
its not that dukakis isnt a patriot its that dukakis is 
nuts gingrich said his value system has no relation to 
reality 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan responded by saying americans 
are increasingly tiring of gingrichs oneliners 
his attempt with innuendo and lies and misrepresentation of 
the governors position is typical of his nasty approach gearan 
said 
bush and dukakis both have lightened their calendars in 
preparation for their facetoface meeting next sunday night in 
winstonsalem nc the first of two televised debates between the 
presidential candidates 
both candidates commented on the weekends military coup in 
haiti with bush saying its too early to say what happened 
but he added we want democracy for haiti for the whole of the 
caribbean and for the whole of central america 
dukakis issued a statement calling for the united states to 
recall its ambassador from haiti for consultations while refusing 
to recognize the countrys military government 
the people of haiti have suffered far too long under 
successive repressive regimes the dukakis statement said 
the republican vice president speaking to reporters after 
attending sunday church services said i think ive done the 
homework for the debate 
its like a ball game getting up for it mentally up and 
physically up bush said 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas who lost to bush in 
the race for the gop presidential nomination said the debate next 
week could cause a shift in the political landscape 
the stakes are high this is hard ball dole said in an 
appearance in ohio on sunday i dont worry about george bush 
the big difference is he knows what hes talking about now maybe 
dukakis can memorize enough to get through the debate but hell 
forget it right afterwards 
however dukakis was not without his defenders 
sen george mitchell dmaine took the republicans to task for 
their criticism of dukakis veto of massachusetts legislation that 
would have required teachers to lead classes in the pledge of 
allegiance 
there is no greater phony issue thats been raised in this 
campaign mitchell said on abcs this week with david 
brinkley in america the pledge means something because we say 
it freely we are not forced to do so

thousands of people have started 
returning to the homes they abandoned when rising waters from 
overflowing rivers inundated them more than two weeks ago 
officials said monday 
they face the prospect of rebuilding their homes and lives after 
most of their meager belongings have been lost 
bangladesh is one of the worlds poorest nations with a per 
capita income of 150 per year the flooding the worst in the 
nations history affected 40 million people more than a third of 
bangladeshs 110 million population 
at least 53 of the countrys 64 administrative districts were 
covered by flood waters at the height of the disaster officials 
said 
relief ministry officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said monday that hundreds of flood victims mainly in the northern 
districts were leaving relief centers and high dikes where they 
sought shelter and returning home 
we have reports that displaced people have started going back 
home as flooded rivers have receded improving the situation one 
official said it is difficult to estimate the number of 
returnees at this stage 
an independent bengalilanguage daily the sangbad said more 
than 168000 people affected by floods in pabna district 75 miles 
northwest of dhaka had returned to their homes over the past week 
a major problem the victims are now facing is lack of money to 
rebuild their ruined houses the paper said monday 
refugees are still arriving in dhaka a city of 6 million 
people in search of food shelter and jobs dhakas central 
kamalapur rail station is crowded with flood refugees who arrive 
daily at least 2000 people arrived from other parts of the 
country over the weekend station officials said 
the floods like a demon has taken everything my house and 
crops said nur ali a farmer ali who came to dhaka with his 
wife and two teenage daughters on saturday is living at the 
railroad station

we received barely any relief said ali adding that he hopes to 
find a job in the capital as a day laborer 
more than 1 million people are living in the 476 floodrelief 
centers set up in dhaka which also was badly hit by the flooding 
food supplies at the centers in the capital are better than those 
elsewhere refugees said each day adults receive one pound of 
rice and children onehalf pound 
several journalists unions in bangladesh criticized the 
government for inadequate relief efforts and said in a statement 
sunday that the government was suppressing facts about the 
intensity of flooding and the death toll 
the suppression of facts in such an emergency would be harmful 
to the nation the statement said 
the government death toll from the floods generally considered 
understated is 1000 newspapers carrying their own daily 
tallies estimate that at least twice as many people have died 
of these newspapers said nearly 1000 people died of diarrhea 
and other waterborne diseases such as cholera according to the 
reports more than 1 million people have contracted diarrhea from 
drinking the muddy flood water 
the government says only 200 people have died of diarrhea

michael dukakis accused republican 
george bush today of campaigning with a warmedover call to 
selfishness and said a democratic white house would seek 
prosperity for all americans not just the wealthy 
the democratic presidential nominee said bush does not 
understand that gop economic policies have not spread their 
benefits across the economy but had served people who already have 
good jobs or inherited wealth 
but most americans arent satisfied and neither am i the 
massachusetts governor told an invitationonly campaign rally 
in a line borrowed from john f kennedy dukakis said he means 
to get america moving again restoring strength to all parts of 
the economy and all sections of the nation 
he said the next president will face a sea of republican red 
ink that not even moses could part 
in his prepared speech dukakis said federal resources are 
limited but problems cannot be shrugged away 
and we cant afford leadership that says over and over again 
that its morning in america and then suggests that all we 
americans have to do is roll over and go back to sleep he said 
dukakis said bush is the candidate of a complacent party that 
seems to have exhausted its reservoir of ideas for dealing with 
the economy 
in their hearts they know that four more years of reaganomics 
would be bad for the country and that four more years of 
reaganomics without reagan would be a disaster

a navy commodore who caused a 
diplomatic flap by claiming malaysia had annexed six philippine 
islands was fired monday after officials said he misread a 
navigational chart 
a statement by the armed forces also said a colonel was relieved 
of command in the central visayas region after telling reporters 
that 1000 roman catholic priests and nuns in his area were 
communist sympathizers 
commodore juanito cortez commander of naval district 6 was 
fired for insubordination after he reportedly told visiting 
congressmen that malaysia had effectively annexed six southern 
philippine islands the statement said 
the lawmakers said cortez based his claim on what he said was a 
malaysian map showing the six islands in the turtle island chain in 
malaysian territory 
cortezs remark prompted charges by filipino legislators that 
malaysia was encroaching on its territory but last week the chief 
of staff gen renato de villa said the boundary shown on the 
map was actually a recommended navigational direction and not an 
international border 
leticia shahani chairman of the senate foreign affairs 
committee issued a public apology on friday after she denounced 
the alleged incursions by malaysia based on cortezs statements 
the inquiry showed cortez violatedthe concept of chain of 
command by failing to convey through proper channels such 
information of national and international importance that would be 
acted upon by higher authorities before disclosing it the 
military statement said 
in cebu the deputy commander of the visayas command col 
apolinario castano was stripped of his command for issuing 
statements about priests and nuns in the rebel movement that had 
no basis in official records the military said castanos 
claim of up to 1000 rebel sympathizers in the clergy led to 
denuniciations by the roman catholic leadership

nancy eisenbarth waits anxiously to read every 
one of danielle steels novels but shes more than a fan her 
research provides believable backdrops for the steamy melodramas 
the friends working relationship began one day over lunch in 
san francisco when ms steel was fretting over some factual 
details in the ring it was her first hardcover book published 
in 1980 and chronicled three generations of women 
i offered to look some things up and we went on from there 
said ms eisenbarth i had no inkling that she would become as 
successful as she has and i had no idea it would be as much fun 
many of ms steels novels which include zoya 
passages and fine things wind up on the new york times 
bestseller list in fact shes had as many as three on the list 
at one time her books 35 in all have been published in 27 
languages and more than 85 million copies are in print 
ms eisenbarth a history major in college receives long plot 
summaries from ms steel for new books she then spends nearly four 
months researching details of the time period described in the 
outline 
she makes up the story and i provide the background ms 
eisenbarth 41 said in a telephone interview from the west chicago 
suburb of naperville i play a small part in making them seem 
realistic 
ms steel said her researchers role is crucial to the success 
of her books 
nancy has been my mainstay for years and years and years 
ms steel said from her home in san francisco shes modest in 
talking about her role but her part is really very very 
important 
ms eisenbarths research takes her not to exotic locales but 
to libraries 
because ms steel is so glamorous and exciting everybody 
thinks my job is glamorous and exciting but its really most of 
the time in the stacks said ms eisenbarth who has researched 
14 steel novels 
she relies on personal diaries pictures and social histories 
ms steel insists that every detail be correct down to the 
perfume a historical figure might have worn or the name of a club 
where he or she might have gone 
still ms eisenbarth said theres always one fact in every 
book that she has trouble tracking down and usually finds after 
the book is published 
i could not find the color of general rommels eyes so i made 
them a glittery blue she said later i found a color picture 
and his eyes were clearly brown

two members of the federal energy regulatory 
commission who frequently disagree with one other united monday in 
complaining to a senate committee that their chairman is cutting 
them off from the commission staff 
i do not like the constraints i am laboring under charles 
stalon a democrat who has been behind many of the commissions 
deregulatory initiatives told the senate energy and natural 
resources committee 
his colleague charles trabandt a republican who has urged a 
goslow policy on further deregulation said my staff cannot get 
the answer to any question without the prior approval of the 
chairman and i think thats unfortunate 
trabandt said he thought the work product of the commission 
staff ought to be subject to some kind of review but he and his 
assistants should be able to get factual and legal information 
available to the staff 
i do believe i ought to be able to call on the staff to draft 
alternative proposals for my fellow commissioners stalon said 
by law the ferc chairman martha hesse has sole control over 
the commission staff save for personal assistants each of the five 
commissioners may hire 
ms hesse is traveling in europe and spokeswoman tamara 
youngallen said there will be no comment for now 
trabandt and stalon appeared at a hearing on their renominations 
to the commission by president reagan with them was texas oil and 
gas consultant jerry j langdon nominated last month to a vacancy 
on the commission 
the committee earlier approved nominations for the other two 
ferc seats as part of a package deal with the white house to break 
a yearlong deadlock over the makeup of the commission the deal 
gives democrats three of the five seats but leaves ms hesse a 
republican as chairman 
the complaints from trabandt and stalon emerged under 
questioning from senators 
the ranking republican committee member sen james mcclure of 
idaho said there is some reality to reports of difficulties 
in the management of the commission 
he said he hoped the planned confirmations of the three holdover 
commissioners and two newcomers would lead to better 
relationships inside the commission

doctors on monday upgraded the condition 
of confessed pipebomb killer and forger mark hofmann who is being 
treated for a drug overdose from serious to fair 
hofmann who pleaded guilty to two 1985 bombing murders was 
flown thursday to the university of utah health sciences center 
after a cellmate found him comatose at the utah state prison 
hofmann initially was listed in critical condition from an 
overdose of an antidepressant drug 
he appears medically to be progressing well hospital 
spokesman john dwan said hes eating on his own and following 
medical instructions 
however dwan said doctors planned to perform some minor surgery 
soon to clean out a wound on hofmanns arm and possibly do some 
skin grafting 
hofmann suffered an injury from reduced blood circulation caused 
by lying in one position for an extended period of time prior to 
being discovered unconscious last week 
dwan said hofmann would remain at the hospital for a few more 
days at least 
hofmann would likely continue to have problems with his arm due 
to muscle degeneration he added and will require some 
hospitalization again in the near future 
hofmann was sentenced to five years to life in prison after 
pleading guilty in january 1987 to having planted the bombs that 
killed steven christensen a documents collector and kathleen 
sheets the wife of christensen associate gary sheets 
hofmann also was charged with multiple counts of fraud in the 
forgery of historical documents many of which were sold to the 
mormon church 
he confessed that he planted the bombs in an attempt to cover up 
his forgeries and as part of a plea bargain arrangement pleaded 
guilty to two fraud counts in exchange for the others being dropped 
earlier this year the state board of pardons told him he would 
spend the rest of his life in prison

opponents of legislation to curb textile 
clothing and shoe exports have agreed to allow a house vote on the 
senatepassed bill rather than sending it to a housesenate 
conference committee a supporter of the measure said monday 
the decision virtually assures a preelection showdown on the 
textile bill between president reagan and congress 
rep ed jenkins dga said he expects the house to vote friday 
to approve the senatepassed bill and send it to reagan whose 1985 
veto of a similar textile bill was sustained by just eight votes in 
the house 
i dont know if we have picked up any votes or not since the 
last override we had jenkins said i think it would be a tough 
job to override 
jenkins said the decision to allow a house vote on the 
senatepassed bill was relayed to textilestate lawmakers late last 
week by rep dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means 
committee 
the committee had voted earlier last week to send the senate 
bill to a timeconsuming conference committee with only weeks left 
before the 100th congress adjourns that probably would have 
enabled reagan to kill the bill simply by refusing to sign it once 
congress left town 
the legislation would freeze textile and clothing imports at 
1987 levels this year and limit import growth to 1 percent annually 
threafter it also would cap shoe imports at 1987 levels and 
prohibit foreign manufacturers from increasing their share of the 
us market 
proponents of the legislation contend it is needed to save 
american jobs in a textile industry whose markets are being flooded 
with imports critics contending that the industry is flourishing 
despite imports say the legislation would narrow consumer choices 
and encourage manufacturers to cut corners with shoddy goods

neighborhoods mrs freedman said

against drugs the program became a model for other cities 
including miami which began a similar campaign during the summer 
tampas oneday followup operation also served as a buildup to a 
meeting next month at which mrs freedman plans to ask businesses 
to pitch in financially and pledge dollars to continue the 
crackdown 
its a continuous effort she said weve got to come up

the marist college institute for public opinion reported that of 
601 likely new york voters surveyed last week 48 percent said they 
favored dukakis while 42 percent chose his republican opponent the 
number of undecided stood at 10 percent 
the results signal a statistical dead heat given a margin of 
error of 4 percent in the poll 
in march the marist pollsters reported that 47 percent of new 
yorkers surveyed favored dukakis 41 percent preferred bush and 12 
percent were undecided 
new york a major battleground state with 36 electoral votes 
has been considered a dukakis stronghold because democrats have a 
32 lead in registration over republicans and because dukakis is 
from neighboring massachusetts

the nations railroads are ignoring many track 
defects reported by their inspectors some of whom say theyve been 
ordered to falsify reports by noting only severest problems the 
pittsburgh press reported monday 
i walk the track in the terminal area do my job find defects 
and put them on my reports and i just get a world of hell from my 
supervisors said paul abbott a track inspector for seven years 
and now an assistant track foreman at norfolk southerns train 
yards in roanoke va 
abbott told the press that as late as midaugust he found dozens 
of serious defects in the roanoke yards far far more than the 
federal railroad administration will permit but was told not 
to report the safety violations 
the press said abbotts comments were representative of two 
dozen inspectors from conrail csx boston amp maine illinois 
central norfolk amp southern pittsburgh amp lake erie and other 
railroads who said their supervisors have ordered them to falsify 
inspection reports 
the defects abbott cited included seven broken rails six 
mismatched rail joints and scores of rotten ties 
norfolk southern spokesman robert aumen denied forcefully and 
unequivocally that abbott had ever been ordered to falsify 
inspection reports 
but on a tape recording which the newspaper said abbott made 
and union representatives played for fra inspectors division 
engineer william schafer tells abbott all im asking you to do 
if you go out and find something uh thats an fra defect thats 
not going to cause any derailments dont put it down on a piece of 
paper theres no way were going to be able to fix all that 
schafer told the newspaper he never instructed anyone to 
ignore or overlook unsafe conditions 
i was trying to maintain this terminal using good judgment 
and the companys resources to its fullest benefit schafer said 
abbotts complaints led to a threeday fra inspection that found 
25 safety violations at the roanoke yards two weeks ago all the 
defects were repaired schafer said last week 
top managers at all the railroads said track maintenance is not 
being overlooked but supervisors acknowledged that maintenance 
commonly is deferred because of personnel and material shortages 
and managements reluctance to take tracks out of service 
some railroads just dont care about their yards and wont 
spend the money to make them safe said william mitchell a 
senior track inspector with the ohio public utility commission 
my phone rings all the time with calls from conrail track and 
yard supervisors pleading with me to come and inspect their yards 
so i can write up the defects they say that my report is often the 
only way management can be forced to give them a few thousand ties 
or some switches or new rail theyve been waiting for for months to 
make their yards safe to use he said 
id say our yard tracks on conrail are in pretty good shape 
for the most part countered richard hasselman conrail vice 
president for operations 
the newpaper also said that during its ninemonth investigation 
it obtained a soo line inspection report compiled april 8 1987 
that called for replacing 27 ties at the precise spot where nearly 
a year later a 28car derailment spewed hazardous chemicals into 
the air and forced an evacuation of annandale minn 
the railroad said the accident occurred because the rails had 
widened beyond their proper gauge the 27 ties a key to 
maintaining proper gauge never were replaced the paper said 
soo spokesman john bergene said the railroads investigation did 
not find the damaged ties to be a big factor in the accident and 
that investigators have not determined why the rails spread

clerical workers at new york university voted 
monday to approve a new contract and call off a threeweek walkout 
the union said 
it was definitely worth going out on strike said margarita 
aguilar president of local 3882 of the united staff association 
we moved an institution from what they wanted to impose 
the strike began aug 29 the first day of fall registration at 
the nations largest private college most activities at the 
college went on normally during the strike 
some workers returned to work for a half day monday the rest 
return tuesday 
nyu spokesman howard levine said the agreement was reached 
sunday night after daylong talks held under the auspices of federal 
mediator vincent watson 
the agreement was presented to the members monday morning and 
they approved it overwhelmingly by secret ballot aguilar said the 
pact still must be ratified formally in a mail ballot 
the union represents 1500 filing clerks receptionists and 
secretaries who had been working without a contract since october 
1987 
levine said the pact follows the pattern of 55 percent annual 
wage increases given to other faculty and staff it does give 
additional money to the lower paid employees in the bargaining 
unit levine said 
aguilar said about 900 people were eligible for that extra money 
the major issue was the unions claim that its members 
predominantly women and minorities earn an average of 17500 a 
year 2000 less than men in jobs with similar responsibilities 
such as porters elevator operators and security guards 
because of that perceived disparity the union rejected the 
universitys offer of 55 percent annual wage increases in each of 
three years saying it was nothing more than a cost of living 
increase that did not address inequity 
nyu implemented the first raise last year 
neither levine nor aguilar said how much extra money would be 
available to those at the low end of the pay scale 
the union was unable to get nyu approval for an agency shop 
which would require all the people who benefit from a contract to 
contribute to the costs of negotiating it currently only 900 of 
the 1500 eligible workers are duespaying members of the union 
but the union gained other improvements including in overtime 
pay pensions life insurance and leaves of absence

verge of anarchy saw maung in a statement to radio rangoon vowed 
to restore order and to hold general elections under a multiparty 
system at an unspecified later date 
opposition leaders said on monday they would continue our 
struggle for democracy by various means until the goal is 
achieved a joint statement was issued by former military 
officers aung gyi and tin oo and aung san suu kyi the daughter of 
the late independence hero aung san

fredenburg 
it wasnt fighting between the troops and the demonstrators 
it was really more troops firing on the demonstrators fredenburg

there was a small group of young people outside the embassy 
not demonstrating but waiting outside the embassy and further 
down the street there was a group of people marching 
they were as far as we could tell unarmed and behaving in a 
peaceful manner the troops opened fire on that group of 
demonstrators and then opened fire on the small group of a hundred 
or so people that were standing in front of the embassy at the same 
time 
the procession of demonstrators may have numbered one to two 
thousand when the firing died down and the ambulance came to 
pick up the casualties there were two people who appeared to have 
been killed and there was one wounded still lying in front of the 
embassy a young man who was shot in the upper body and was quite

hurricane gilberts damage to 
jamaicas airports is preventing apple pickers from getting to west 
virginia orchards threatening the crop 
its going to be devastating said douglas dirting vice 
president of tricounty growers inc which normally has 400 people 
in the fields during midseptember on monday there were fewer 
than 15 he said 
dirting said the jamaicans may arrive friday but by then 72000 
bushels of apples will have dropped to the ground 
tricounty also blames the us labor department for its 
troubles 
labor department region iii administrator william haltigan last 
month denied the companys certification to hire foreign workers 
until it settled a legal dispute with two former workers dirting 
said 
the lawsuit and the bureaucratic delays were finally resolved by 
last week just as the hurricane tore through jamaica 
tricounty hired 40 jamaicans who had been in connecticut 
cutting tobacco but they barely will make a dent in the apple crop 
this week dirting said 
when apples hit the ground most of the time the processing 
companies wont even want to buy them for juice he said 
tricounty gets 8 to 10 per bushel for highquality apples 
but juicequality apples fetch only about 150 per bushel company 
officials said 
the growers have had little luck in finding domestic labor to 
pick the apples tricounty recruited just three local pickers

handguns battled in a new outbreak of violence in the disputed 
region of the caucasus and the tass new agency reported monday 
that 25 people were injured 
the shootout over the weekend in a village in the enclave of 
nagornokarabakh marked an escalation of tensions that have been 
flaring between the two ethnic groups 
the ethnic strife over the last seven months has been a 
challenge for kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
in addition to the violent clash a series of general strikes 
was reported in armenia and in nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian 
area that has been part of the republic of azerbaijan since 1923 
the official news agency said demonstrators left a rally sunday 
in the main city of nagornokarabakh stepanakert for the nearby 
village of khadzhaly and when they arrived clashes broke out 
firearms and sidearms were used in massscale fights on both 
sides tass reported from stepanakert as a result 25 people 
received injuries of various degress of gravity and 17 were 
hospitalized both armenians and azerbaijanis applied for medical 
assistance

yerevan however said by telephone that azerbaijanis were the only 
ones carrying firearms and that 19 of those injured were armenians 
four seriously he said 150 of the demonstrators had marched to 
khadzhaly 
the editor who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
clashes were touched off by reports of earlier disturbances in the 
village between armenians and azerbaijanis 
demonstrators were holding a rally in stepanakert when armenians 
arrived from khadzhaly with reports that azerbaijanis had stoned a 
busload of armenians on saturday the editor said he said an 
unknown number of armenians was injured in those disturbances 
the armenians who returned to stepanakert stoned azerbaijani 
houses in the city breaking windows according to the journalist

the government said monday that raoul wallenberg 
the swedish diplomat credited with saving 100000 hungarian jews 
from the nazis died 41 years ago in a soviet prison and was 
cremated without an autopsy 
gennady i gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman said at a 
briefing that wallenberg died in july 1947 he did not give the 
exact date of death 
a 1957 search of documents at lubyanka prison in central moscow 
turned up a note written by the medical service officer about his 
orders from state security chief viktor abakumov gerasimov said 
abakumov later ran afoul of dictator josef stalin and was executed 
reported personally to the minister the body ordered to be 
cremated without a post mortem july 17 1947 the note said 
according to gerasimov 
gerasimov said the chief medical officer whom he identified 
only as smoltsov had handwritten his report on wallenbergs death 
prisoner wallenberg died in his cell last night presumably of 
myocardial infarction heart attack smoltsovs report said 
gerasimov raised the topic of wallenbergs death without 
prompting from reporters he said the issue had been broached 
friday in vienna by representatives of the united states canada 
great britain sweden switzerland and hungary at a conference on 
european security 
he was arrested in 1945 in budapest gerasimov said since 
then we answered a lot of questions about his fate but up to now 
we hear news and we still hear questions even here 
despite soviet insistence that he died in prison in 1947 
reports have persistently surfaced that wallenberg had been seen in 
soviet prison camps 
swedish author kenne fant in a recently released book on 
wallenberg said he had spoken to a very trustworthy source who 
heard of a prisoner who must have been wallenberg fant said the 
prisoner was seen in 1986 in the labor camp blagoveshchenka a 
closed city 200 miles southwest of novosibirisk 
fant also cited sources in the united states who said wallenberg 
was treated for a heart ailment in hospitals in leningrad and 
moscow in 1982 and 1983 
many swedes have refused to accept soviet accounts of 
wallenbergs death as a final answer even though soviet officials 
continually denounce claims that he is alive 
gerasimov said he knew no other details about wallenbergs death 
or arrest 
as to the reasons for his arrest they are unknown to us 
please remember that these were abakumovs times he said 
wallenberg arrived in budapest in july 1944 on a ussponsored 
mission to save jews he disappeared after the red army swept into 
the hungarian capital in january 1945 
in its time the soviet government expressed sincere regrets 
as to what happened and also expressed deep condolences to the 
swedish government and to the family and relatives of wallenberg 
gerasimov said

an american stockbroker asked soviets 
on monday why their shops are low on supplies a soviet journalist 
accused a wellknown us colleague of trying to teach russians how 
to live 
showing the candor the soviets now seek in their relations with 
americans as well as the disagreements that still divide the 
superpowers a sixday meeting of 500 citizens from both countries 
began monday in this southern soviet city near the turkishiranian 
border 
it is the fourth annual encounter cosponsored by the 
statesanctioned ussoviet friendship society and the chautauqua 
institution of new york about 300 americans from apollo 11 
astronaut michael collins to broadway songster tommy tune came to 
tbilisi for the conference 
in past years the conference served as a reliable barometer of 
ussoviet relations thirteen months ago in chautauqua ny the 
soviet delegation trumpeted the merits of mikhail s gorbachevs 
drive for greater openness 
in 1986 the meeting was held at the latvian baltic sea resort 
of jurmala but the festive mood was soured by the kgbs arrest 
days before of us journalist nicholas daniloff in moscow 
with four superpower summits and an unprecedented agreement 
between moscow and washington to destroy their shorter and 
mediumrange nuclear weapons now history the mood was decidedly 
upbeat as the meeting began in this capital of soviet georgia 
1000 miles south of moscow 
probably everyone even those who are not specialists in 
sovietamerican relations is amazed at the changes that have taken 
place in the last three to four years deputy foreign minister 
anatoly l adamishin told the conference 
because of the greater heed paid by the gorbachevera kremlin to 
soviet public opinion adamishin said it was important for 
citizens of both superpowers to understand each other 
the soviets showing the importance they place on the meeting 
sent gorbachevs science advisor yevgeny velikhov top foreign 
policy commentator alexander bovin and col gen nikolai chervov 
of the soviet general staff 
the americans included official government representatives such 
as deputy assistant secretary of state thomas w simons jr also 
attending were many private citizens who paid 3500 to take part 
we will have differences of opinion as the week unfolds but 
we came in goodwill seeking common ground hedrick smith a 
syndicated columnist who was once the new york times bureau chief 
in moscow told mondays opening session 
in questionandanswer sessions americans voiced concern over 
soviet human rights practices including limits on travel and 
emigration and the banning of some books 
soviets asked the americans why their trade union 
representatives were sometimes barred from getting us visas and 
why the united states has not agreed to a longstanding kremlin 
call for a ban on nuclear tests 
the sharpest exchanges came in a stuffy hall at the headquarters 
of georgias znamya society where 300 people met to hear two 
soviet and two american panelists discuss how each country views 
the other 
you fellows have walked the streets of paris and other western 
capitals when you see that in the main street of leningrad 
theres basically nothing in the stores how do you explain that 
dale mcbrier 34 a stockbroker from erie pa asked the soviet 
panel members 
my dear american friend answered bovin i wish you could 
read the current issues of izvestia or any other newspaper i 
assure you there are critical articles there unfortunately your 
society has not caught up with the criticism 
the portly bovin who appears frequently on soviet television 
accused his fellow panelist smith of attempting to teach us how 
to live by critical remarks made in smiths recent book the 
russians 
i hate to disappoint mr bovin but the book was not written 
to instruct soviet citizens since it was published in english and 
not in russian smith replied soviet customs guards still 
routinely confiscate copies of the russians if they find it in 
western travelers luggage 
a soviet from togliatti told the meeting the local branch of the 
ussoviet friendship society needed permission from local 
communist party and government officials to meet and that 
sometimes they have been told no its too early now you will 
have no peace cruises or meetings until next may 
panels on arms control human rights and women in society are 
scheduled before the conference adjourns saturday more than 120 of 
the americans are being put up by georgians in their homes a new 
facet of the program that both soviet and american participants say 
is proving to be one of the most rewarding

pope john paul ii returned home monday from a 10day 
trip to southern african after urging warstricken mozambique to 
find peace with south africa and calling for an end to racial 
discrimination 
but south african clergymen who met the pontiff at the end of 
his pilgrimage said he should have spoken out more forcefully 
against apartheid 
john pauls 49th foreign trip which took him to five nations 
was marked by a forced landing in south africa a deadly bus 
hijacking in lesotho and a papal appeal for aid to victims of 
mozambiques drought and civil war 
in a mistyeyed departure speech at maputo airport in 
mozambique the pope decried the scandalous poverty of the 
region and the painful violations of elementary rights of each 
man a reference to south africas racial policies 
speaking of the hunger in mozambique the pope described the 
worried gaze of so many children the uncertain look of so many 
youths and the weary eyes of so many adults 
he also appealed to all those who have political 
responsibilities in the region to settle their differences 
peacefully 
six days before the pope visited mozambique south african 
president pw botha held a surprise meeting with his mozambique 
counterpart joaquim chissano to revive a 1984 nonaggression pact 
and jointly develop energy sources and tourism 
chissano a marxist said the pope had seen for himself the 
signs of good will to overcome the crisis 
civil war has left 6 million of mozambiques 145 million people 
in need of foreign food aid and john paul said he felt the heart 
of the people bleed 
this nation needs assistance from other peoples to save a 
large amount of human lives the pope said 
activist clergymen from south africa who on monday attended a 
papal mass in mozambique said john paul should have spoken out 
more forcefully against apartheid during his tour of the region 
on wednesday john paul made an unscheduled stop in south 
africa where his plane was diverted in bad weather forcing him to 
travel by road to lesotho 
the pope had given the south african government more comfort 
than it deserved said the rev allan boesak president of the 
world alliance of reformed churches he spoke to reporters after he 
and other protestant clergy from south africa joined mozambican 
church leaders at a meeting with john paul 
during his pilgrimage john paul condemned all violence but 
suggested he was not enthusiastic about antiapartheid strategies 
such as economic sanctions and election boycotts 
boesak said the threehour papal stop in johannesburg was a 
propaganda coup for south african authorities who had complained 
about the omission of their country from the official itinerary 
south africas foreign minister pik botha greeted the pope 
ordered a security force escort for a motorcade to lesotho and 
later boasted about south africas hospitality 
anyone who enters into dialogue with the south african 
government must be aware that they are going to use you for their 
own purposes boesak said 
one of boesaks colleagues the rev frank chikane said the 
pope had met with officials who hurt us and cause us pain and 
had been escorted by people who torture us 
chikane is secretary general of the south african council of 
churches which is leading a civil disobedience campaign 
challenging emergency regulations and apartheid laws 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs which are controlled by the 5 million whites 
during his ninehour return flight to rome john paul sent his 
first public message in at least five years to libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi whose country has no diplomatic relations with the 
vatican 
the pope who flew over the libyan coastal city of benghazi 
sent a telegram extending good wishes for the peace and 
wellbeing of the peoples of the jamahiriya the name the 
government has used for libya since gadhafi took power in a 1969 
coup 
the pontiff began his trip in zimbabwe where he attended a 
conference of southern african bishops just before the papal plane 
landed in botswana topless women dancing at the airport in 
gabarone were told to cover themselves 
in swaziland the pope stressed the virtues of monogamy at a 
mass attended by 20yearold king mswati ii and three of his four 
wives 
the popes visit to tiny lesotho was the most dramatic of his 
pilgrimage the night before he arrived rebels hijacked a 
pilgrims bus carrying nuns and schoolchildren to see the pope six 
people were killed when south african soldiers stormed the bus to 
end the 27hour ordeal

most americans continue to believe immigrants 
have a negative impact on the economy and little to contribute to 
us culture according to a los angeles times poll published 
monday 
attitudes toward immigrants which historically have not been 
welcoming have remained unchanged in spite of two years of 
unprecedented attention during the governments amnesty and 
employer sanction programs the times said 
experts government officials and immigrant advocates said they 
were disappointed that immigration reforms havent altered the 
situation 
a lot of our old prejudices are still at work said maurice 
a roberts editor of interpreter releases a washingtonbased 
national immigration journal 
despite extensive publicity about the 1986 immigration reform 
law a large part of the population is not aware of the 
governments efforts according to the times poll but among those 
familiar with the changes the public generally approves the 
legalization of about 2 million immigrants while giving low marks 
to the early effectiveness of employer sanctions 
the times poll was conducted four months after the oneyear 
legalization program ended and two months after the federal 
immigration and naturalization service began full enforcement of 
sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal workers 
the poll directed by ia lewis was conducted by a nationwide 
telephone survey of 1418 respondents last weekend the margin of 
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points 
figures dont add up to 100 percent because the poll excluded 
those who didnt have a clear opinion 
asked if immigrants get more from the us economy through social 
services and unemployment benefits or contribute more through taxes 
and work 64 percent said that immigrants take more than they give 
only 19 percent said immigrants contributed more while four 
percent said immigrants benefitted and contributed equally to the 
economy 
asked if immigrants have made a contribution in the last decade 
to american culture 46 percent said they havent while 40 percent 
said immigrants have enriched the culture 
most experts and officials said the poll results were not 
unexpected they say it is reflective of antiimmigrant opinions in 
a country of immigrants 
the fact is that the country tends to have unwelcoming 
attitudes but at the same time theyre ambivalent because of their 
own immigrant backgrounds said charles kamasaki of the national 
council of la raza a washingtonbased hispanic rights organization

representatives of the nicaraguan 
government met with rebel leaders monday for the first time in 
three months but both sides remained sharply divided on ways to 
end seven years of civil war 
the leftist sandinista government and the usbacked rebels 
known as contras began a twoday conference as a preliminary step 
to resuming the highlevel peace talks that collapsed on june 9 
the rebels recently proposed that highlevel talks resume sept 
26 but the two sides disagree on a location 
nicaragua is willing to resume talks but they must be held in 
managua victor hugo tinoco nicaraguan assistant foreign minister 
and the head of the sandinista delegation said at a news 
conference before mondays meeting 
the rebels have opposed holding the talks in the nicaraguan 
capital and have said highlevel negotiations cannot resume until 
the government releases more than 40 antigovernment demonstrators 
arrested in july 
a fragile march 21 ceasefire remains in effect in nicaragua 
but each side accuses the other of violating the truce 
tinoco said he expected the guatemala meeting to result in a 
ceasefire for 30 or 60 days that could be extended indefinitely 
both sides agreed on march 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to 
the conflict the government says has claimed the lives of 28000 
nicaraguans 
the agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in 
exchange for democratic reforms shortly before peace talks broke 
off in june the sandinistas proposed a timetable for disarmament 
and political reforms 
but the contras rejected the plan saying it did not go far 
enough they demanded freedom for political prisoners and 
democratic reforms in nicaragua 
tinoco said the sandinistas will urge that a ceasefire 
verification commission funded by 10 million from congress be put 
into operation commission members would include the 
secretarygeneral of the organization of american states joao 
baena soares and nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y bravo tinoco 
also reiterated the governments demand that the contras free 66 
prisoners of war being held in honduras 
he blamed the contras for ending peace talks on june 9 the 
contras broke them off to seek military aid in the united states 
congress he said 
direct us military aid to the rebels ended feb 29 and the 
contras have few bargaining chips left nonlethal us aid to the 
contras is distributed only in honduras 
during the past four months most of the rebel forces fled back 
to base camps inside honduras to receive new supplies of uniforms 
and food 
contra sources say only 2000 fighters remain inside nicaragua 
while more than 9000 are holed up in isolated camps in eastern 
honduras 
the ceasefire pact in march caused deep divisions within the 
rebel ranks militant contras led by enrique bermudez a former 
colonel under the deposed anastasio somoza dictatorship said the 
agreement was tantamount to surrender

fiftyone precolumbian artifacts smuggled out of 
peru in furniture shipments have been seized in miami customs 
officials said monday some of the pieces were 1000 years old and 
worth up to 5000 they said 
the cache included pieces of pottery textiles and wooden items 
which were displayed at a news conference by authorities they 
called it the biggest seizure of antiquities here in recent memory 
and said arrests were expected in the case 
we havent determined the value said ken stroud head of 
the customs fraud unit but some pieces run from 1000 up to 
5000 it depends on whos doing the buying 
some of the items were 1000 years old according to an 
evaluation by the lowe museum here and peruvian archaeologists 
were expected to arrive soon to further identify the artifacts 
all the pieces had been stamped by the peruvian government 
showing they were legally registered under that nations laws 
which forbid exporting antiquities 
if its removed from peru it was either smuggled out or 
stolen first and smuggled out stroud said 
the artifacts were found in july and august by miami 
international airport inspectors making routine searches of 
challenge air flights for drugs stroud said they were hidden 
inside furniture shipped here from lima peru some of the pottery 
had been painted in garish colors to make it look modern 
stroud said the airline was not implicated and had cooperated 
fully with customs authorities 
we feel were getting very close to making arrests in the 
case stroud said we just have a few loose ends to tie up 
he said the artifacts were most likely destined for private 
collecters because museums are aware of the legal restrictions in 
peru 
customs delayed announcing the seizures while the case was under 
investigation but decided to go public in part because they feared 
the pieces would deteriorate in the humid warehouse where they were 
stored stroud said 
he said customs was in contact with the peruvian embassy on 
monday to make arrangements to return the antiquities under a 
treaty the united states has with that country

a small stream coursing through a 
mangled landscape of twisted metal and crumbled concrete home was 
all that remained monday of the furious flood spawned by hurricane 
gilbert 
although the waters receded the human cost of the calamity 
continued to rise hundreds sifted through the muck to salvage 
possessions thousands spent another day in shelters for the 
homeless workers still dug for bodies 
more than 100 people have been confirmed dead in this industrial 
center which is still stunned by the sudden stormwhipped rebirth 
saturday of the santa catarina river the river dry for decades 
became a savage torrent 10 feet deep and 150 yards wide 
we just got three blankets out and lost everything else 
said ramona carrizales lopez sitting outside a shelter for the 
homeless 
mrs lopez was among thousands of people who had built meager 
homes in the bonedry riverbed that cuts through the most populated 
region of northern mexico 
hurricane gilbert brought ferocious winds and up to 12 inches of 
rain as it tore northwest through the gulf of mexico pushing up 
against the 14000foot mountains that ring this nuevo leon state 
capital of 28 million people 
the santa catarina riverbed suddenly swelled with water that 
swept away entire ramshackle communities miles of roads and a 
sprawling sports complex that had been built on the riverbed 
four buses and other vehicles were dragged into the torrent bus 
passengers are presumed to comprise most of the more than 100 
people confirmed dead and officials said many are still missing 
the nuevo leon state government said a considerable number 
of people were missing and 30000 people were lodged in shelters 
around the state 
gilbert ironically did its worst damage on an inland city at a 
time when the storm was at one of its weakest points 
on monday the santa catarina river was only a 15footwide 
stream scores of people lined the banks digging with their hands 
to salvage what they could 
maria costa her husband and their six children lived on the 
riverbed in a tworoom home made of concrete blocks and tin their 
clothing furniture and new school books were washed away 
we went yesterday to see it but there wasnt a thing to save 
even the blocks were gone said mrs costa 30 as she washed her 
10monthold sons diapers in a bucket of water 
now where do we go she asked its not that we want them 
to give us land but something to live on and a way to pay for it 
alejandro chapa mayor of san pedrogarza garcia the suburb of 
monterrey hit hardest by the disaster said monday that his first 
priority is to find better lodgings for the 7000 homeless people 
in his community 
it would be wonderful if we could get tents provisionally so 
these people will have a place to live chapa said in an 
interview at his home 
chapa said that perhaps the us government or the state of 
texas would provide that kind of aid although no formal request 
has been made 
theyve always been very helpful he said 
the santa catarina once had a steady stream of water but in the 
decades since it dried up the state government had begun to use 
the riverbed to build major thoroughfares hightension electricity 
towers underground pipelines and plant hundreds of trees 
but most impressive were the miles of tennis and basketball 
courts soccer and baseball fields and jogging tracks and even 
dressing rooms used daily by thousands at the sports complex that 
was destroyed 
chapa said the government would rebuild the roads and sports 
complex but he said those people with homes on the riverbed that 
escaped ruin would be allowed to return there only provisionally 
were asking for a place to put them chapa said houses 
can be built pretty fast but not in a month

an arab league representative voiced concern 
monday about israels launch of a test satellite into orbit and 
said it meant the arabs would have to strengthen their defenses 
clovis maksoud who represents the arab league in the united 
states said the satellite gave israel a serious strategic 
leverage since the country already had the capability to fire 
longrange missiles 
maksoud in an interview stressed steps taken jointly by israel 
and the united states to strengthen their strategic ties 
he cited israels inclusion in the us program to develop a 
spacebased defense against ballistic missiles and israels 
record which is replete with disclaiming nuclear capability 
as a result maksoud said the launching of a test satellite 
warrants enhancing arab defensive capabilities so that any 
mideast negotiations produce a peaceful outcome rather than 
ratifying israeli hegemony 
the satellite is designed for communications purposes but the 
arab league official said it could be used to monitor israels foes 
we are deeply concerned that such a communications satellite 
can be modified into a spy system and therefore further enhance 
the strategic imbalance which the americanisraeli strategic 
agreement has introduced maksoud said 
state department spokesman charles e redman meanwhile said 
the united states was not involved in any way with the israeli 
program 
we dont have any details of the launch beyond what was 
reported by the israelis he said 
a spokesman for the us space command in colorado cmdr dugald 
gillies said monday that american radars and sensors picked up the 
israeli satellite shortly after launch its orbit has been 
calculated to have a high point of 716 miles and a low point of 155 
miles he said 
it is circling the earth every 98836 minutes and the 
satellite has an inclination to earth of 14286 degrees 
gillies added it was launched early monday eastern daylight time 
and is in a near polar orbit 
defense officials at the pentagon said they were unsure exactly 
what the satellites payload included 
but were leaning toward more of an experimental 
communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite said 
one source who asked not to be identified 
this launch is impressive because its a first but i dont 
think this particular satellite is going to offer much more ability 
to keep tabs on their neighbors the source said 
redman stressed that israeli leaders had given public assurances 
that their goal was peaceful purposes of space research and 
technological advancement 
israel is the eighth nation to place a satellite into space the 
country is one of the most advanced technologically in the world 
and is generally believed to have nuclear capability 
israeli leaders preferring to keep potential foes off guard 
have responded ambiguously to such assertions but also have given 
assurances the country would not initiate a nuclear conflict 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign minister 
shimon peres said the launch should not touch off an arms race with 
arab countries

two republican members of congress have 
introduced a resolution that would withhold part of the us dues 
payments to the united nations that president reagan ordered 
released last week 
the resolution introduced by sen jesse helms of north carolina 
and rep pat swindall of georgia would block the release of 288 
million of the 144 million that congress appropriated to the 
united nations in fiscal 1988 
swindall said he introduced the resolution friday because 
reagans decision to release the dues payments cripples 
congressional efforts to reform the uns antiamerican programs 
congress ordered the reagan administration last year to withhold 
part of the us dues until reagan certified that the united 
nations was making progress toward reducing its staff adopting new 
budget procedures and ending soviet abuses of the un civil 
service system 
reagan made that certification last week in announcing that the 
us would release the 44 million withheld from its dues payment 
in fiscal 1988 and would pay the full 144 million appropriated for 
fiscal 1989 
the 1987 law authorizing the un dues payment specifies that 
congress can block payment of the final 20 percent of the dues if 
it approves a joint resolution within 30 days of the presidents 
certification

israel closed 22 adult education programs in 
the west bank monday as part of a new offensive against palestinian 
activists in the occupied lands prompting protests by hundreds of 
palestinians witnesses said 
in the occupied gaza strip meanwhile an 18yearold 
palestinian died of wounds he received in clashes with israeli 
troops last week his relatives said 
the death raised to 269 the number of palestinians who have died 
in the 9monthold uprising in the occupied territories six 
israelis also have died 
soldiers shot and wounded four arabs monday including a 
15yearold boy struck in the stomach after palestinian protesters 
stoned soldiers in the west bank towns of nablus and qalqiliya 
hospital officials said 
the army confirmed three palestinians were wounded in clashes in 
nablus and qalqiliya and in the west bank town of jenin 
also monday the army said it confiscated the passports of six 
americans who allegedly took part in the antiisrael protest 
one of the americans 33yearold bill doares of new york told 
the associated press that an army officer grabbed the passports 
without explanation after the group watched from a distance as 
troops fired rubber bullets to break up a peaceful protest by 
palestinian women 
the latest casualties brought to 46 the number of palestinians 
wounded in the last three days the haaretz daily attributed the 
rising numbers of palestinian casualties to the widening use of 
plastic bullets and said soldiers are permitted to fire them even 
if their lives are not in danger 
haaretz quoted military sources as saying this allowed troops to 
be as tough as possible with demonstrators without risking large 
numbers of arab fatalities unlike live ammunition plastic bullets 
generally are not lethal except when fired from a distance of 20 
yards or less 
the army declined comment except to say soldiers must adhere to 
strict unspecified rules when using plastic bullets 
in nablus the west banks largest city troops closed 22 adult 
education programs that taught courses in computer programming 
mathematics chemistry and english palestinian witnesses said 
the action was part of an ongoing israeli effort to stifle the 
growth of a grassroots palestinian leadership in the occupied 
lands 
we didnt have any choice but to close them down said an 
official of the west bank military government speaking on 
condition of anonymity these programs are part of an allout 
effort by proplo elements to replace the system run by israel 
israel has shut down more than 320 trade unions professional 
organizations and local committees in the west bank and gaza in 
addition all schools in the west bank and middle schools and high 
schools in gaza remain closed on army orders israel contends they 
are breeding grounds for violent protests 
mondays closures prompted widespread protests in nablus where 
hundreds of palestinians marched in the citys openair market 
waving outlawed palestinian flags and chanting antiisraeli 
slogans arab witnesses said 
dozens of school children flew kites bearing the red green 
yellow and black colors of the palestinian flag the witnesses said 
also in nablus 200 masked supporters of the militant islamic 
group hamas or zeal held a separate march during which 
protesters who wore white tshirts emblazoned with hamas 
carried palestinian flags and islamic banners 
the american passports were confiscated sunday in the west bank 
city of ramallah an army official said he said the group 
participated in an antiisraeli protest and was detained they 
ran away leaving the passports said the official 
but doares denied the group joined the protest and said they

their everyday lives 
once the extent of subscribers is determined the network 
intends to seek commercial sponsors as well as contributions from 
foundations to provide financing to expand production 
however unlike much religious programming the network will not 
solicit contributions

the government of prime minister zbigniew 
messner resigned monday after strong criticism of its management of 
the economy a lawmaker later asked parliament to legalize the 
banned solidarity labor movement 
messner prime minister since 1985 announced in a speech to 
parliament that he and all 19 ministers were resigning he defended 
his governments performance but conceded mishaps in not 
standing up to inflationary wage demands 
it was the first time in polands postwar history that the 
entire government stepped down messner said the mass resignation 
would make it easier for parliament to make proper decisions 
about the future government 
the sejm or parliament approved the resignations near the end 
of a 12hour session monday by a vote of 3591 with 17 
abstentions a new government was expected to be named by the sejm 
this month 
messner or some of his ministers could be reappointed 
the issue of solidarity and the name of lech walesa founder and 
former head of the outlawed independent labor federation came up 
repeatedly in the freewheeling discussion of the economy and 
government that followed the resignations 
inflation caused a wave of labor strikes in april a second wave 
of strikes in august ended when authorities and walesa agreed to 
hold broadbased talks now scheduled for next month that may 
include the issue of legalizing solidarity 
solidarity should regain its proper place in the trade union 
movement ryszard bender an independent parliament member from 
lublin told parliament monday apart from associations apart 
from solidarity there is also a need to have new political 
parties 
it was the first call in parliament for legalizing the union 
movement since solidarity was suppressed in december 1981 with the 
imposition of martial law 
turning to address polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
bender urged that jaruzelski and walesa the first nobel peace 
laureate in polish history meet and make a joint statement 
concerning polands most vital interests 
jaruzelski smiled slightly but showed no other reaction to the 
remarks 
later sejm deputy aleksander legatowicz an economist said the 
government failed because it closed itself off from criticism 
there are people allergic to the word socialism and others 
allergic to the word solidarity he said 
solidarity the first free trade union movement in the soviet 
bloc emerged from a tumultuous summer of labor unrest in 1980 
about 30 deputies spoke monday with several endorsing the 
planned roundtable talks with the opposition bender was the only 
speaker openly calling for reinstatement of solidarity 
deputy sylwester zawadzki said extreme demands such as 
calling for trade union pluralism may not make reconciliation 
easier 
under polands system the communist party led by the politburo 
is the actual seat of power and appoints the government through its 
majority in parliament as first secretary of the politburo 
jaruzelski is the countrys leader the government is responsible 
for executing the partys goals 
the party leadership has maintained that its goals for reforming 
the economy and political system have been correct but 
implementation by messners government has been faulty the soviet 
press also has recently criticized the polish government 
one speaker suggested last friday that the government was being 
used as a whipping boy 
the situation resembles a soccer game said tomasz adamczuk 
a member of the communistallied peasant party the players are 
the political parties the polish trade union alliance the 
opposition and others the ball is the government 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman 
welcomed the understanding reached friday between government 
negotiators and walesa on future talks 
redman said monday that a process of national reconciliation 
may have begun and all sides should strive to realize its historic 
potential 
in his speech messner appeared to question the recent emphasis 
on dialogue with the opposition we are paying for the strikes 
now with escalation of demands and greater chaos in the market 
loss of authority of management we again have become a symbol of 
anarchy in the world he said political methods of solving 
tensions cannot mean tolerance for lawbreaking 
immediately prior to messners speech parliament heard a 
critical report from a committee set up to monitor the governments 
performance in implementing economic reform its chairwoman 
krystyna jandy jendroska cited the dismal performance of the 
economy in the areas of inflation production housing 
agriculture taxes and investments 
she urged that more coalition forces from outside the party 
be brought into government including experts in the economy 
the criticism of the government echoed statements at a communist 
party plenum aug 2728 during the wave of strikes 
the government was criticized as sluggish and ineffectual in 
implementing a broad economic reform plan this year and for its 
handling of price increases that have led to annual inflation of 60 
percent

the wife of conservative rep robert 
k dornan apologized to a gay community leader she called a fag 
at a meeting and later revealed her brother is a homosexual who is 
dying of aids 
dornan rcalif afterward told reporters he knew his 
brotherinlaw was a homosexual but did not know that he has 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
why didnt you tell me he asked his wife sallie after she 
told reporters that one of her four brothers is a homosexual and is 
dying of aids 
i didnt want to hurt you she said 
the dornans declined to be interviewed further on the issue 
monday 
they regard this as a personal matter that they dont want to 
continue publicly talking about it not out of any shame for 
themselves or the family but for the privacy for the brother 
said dornans chief aide brian bennett 
bennett refused to name the brother he said dornans family and 
mrs dornans family had not always gotten along in attempting to 
explain why dornan did not know about his brotherinlaws illness 
dornan is seeking a third twoyear term 
the relevation occurred at a socalled town meeting sunday held 
by dornan at pacifica high school to meet with constituents the 
school is in dornans district about 30 miles southeast of 
downtown los angeles 
during a heated exchange between her husband and jeff 
letourneau a gay activist mrs dornan screamed shut up fag 
then letourneau and about 30 other chanting protesters were 
escorted from the auditorium by police at dornans request 
letourneau was allowed to return and pose the last question and he 
demanded an apology from mrs dornan 
im very sorry i did that said mrs dornan her voice 
breaking you were all yelling at my husband whom i love 
i apologize but it will not rid the anger in my heart my 
brother is dying and he grows thinner every day and has sores on 
his body i want you to understand theres great anger and pain 
inside of me 
she said later that gay activists like letourneau were trying to 
make the aids crisis into a civilrights issue instead of a medical 
issue 
a plague doesnt have any civil rights mrs dornan said 
letourneau an organizer of the orange county visibility league 
a gay rights group accepted mrs dornans apology and asked dornan 
if he would support federal subsidies to aids sufferers to purchase 
the drug azt or azidothymidine which was recently approved for 
aids treatment by the us food and drug administration 
of course said dornan it extends the precious thing we 
call human life 
azt is not a cure but has been found to prolong the lives of 
some victims by strengthening their immune systems aids attacks 
the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to infections 
and cancers 
before dornans town meeting letourneau had organized a rally 
of the gay rights group to protest what they say is dornans 
antihomosexual stand 
in his defense dornan said he contributed part of his 12400 
congressional pay raise to help aids hospices and called a news 
conference in january 1987 to publicize the enormity of the issue 
ive lost friends and people i know to aids dornan said 
terry dolan was a good friend 
dolan head of the national conservative political action 
committee died of complications of aids dornan said he also was 
acquainted with conservative lawyer roy cohn and entertainer 
liberace who attended his church at one time who also died of 
complications from aids

tornadoes spawned by hurricane gilbert 
caused more than 35 million damage in this inland southern texas 
city apparently harder hit than coastal cities that faced the main 
storm officials said monday 
its amazing to me that no one was killed this is far worse 
than anything in brownsville gov bill clements said here after 
touring ravaged areas of both cities there is no place anywhere 
that suffered this kind of damage 
two people were killed in the 41 tornadoes that leapfrogged 
across the state heavy rain swelled rivers in some areas but no 
injuries were reported 
clements said he would wait for county officials to send him 
damage estimates before taking steps for a disaster declaration and 
sending requests for aid to the federal government 
a federal disaster designation would let businesses receive 
lowinterest loans to rebuild and some residents would be placed in 
temporary housing for a certain period said ed hargett regional 
director for the federal emergency management agency 
earlier clements viewing damage in brownsville on the southern 
tip of texas which felt part of the hurricanes wind and waves 
i think that all of us feel a sense of relief that we are 
blessed that there is no more damage in texas and more particularly 
here in cameron county than you have experienced clements said 
after flying over waterfront areas at brownsville 
what little was left of the hurricane was moving across the 
midwest toward illinois leaving heavy rain in its wake 
i dont think we are expecting much more in the way of trouble 
from hurricane gilbert said laureen chernow spokeswoman for the 
states emergency management council in austin 
san antonio mayor henry cisneros toured tornadoravaged areas 
sunday and said he wanted to extend his state of emergency 
declaration through friday 
the declaration will enable the city to try to seek assistance 
from the small business administration and other federal agencies 
i dont want to deny anyone potential help cisneros said 
twisters that raged through a residential area in the border 
town of del rio caused an estimated 1 million damage but no 
injuries late saturday officials said 
in corpus christi two sea beaches in county parks were closed 
because they had about 100000 damage nueces county commissioner 
jp luby said 
the foredunes were extensively damaged he said the tide 
went in and melted them away like butter foredunes along the 
beach protect larger interior dunes from erosion 
luby who said he would seek federal assistance in the park 
cleanup effort said county jail inmates will help clean up timber 
and other debris and repair damage to the foredunes and parking 
lots 
but san antonio which opened up shelters for gulf coast 
residents fleeing the pending storm seemed to have suffered the 
worst damage 
one man was killed friday when a utility pole struck his house 
and a woman was thrown from her mobile home by a tornado 
the storm system then spawned a tornado that cut a path through 
kelly air force base causing 3 million damage to 12 buildings and 
an additional 25 million to aircraft parts 
another tornado destroyed the airconditioning system at the 
veterans administration hospital causing 2 million damage and 
prompting cisneros to issue the emergency decree so equipment could 
be flown in and to avoid moving some 700 patients 
another tornado struck the lodge apartments destroying about 
120 units damaging 264 others and leaving 300 homeless other 
twisters hit residential and businesses areas causing about 5 
million damage officials said 
heavy rain caused the rio grande to rise about 30 feet from lake 
amistad outside del rio to alcon lake in zapata 
it didnt pose any problems because boaters were warned to get 
off the river ms chernow said

aides to democrat michael dukakis proposed 
monday that the news anchormen of four commercial television 
networks serve as the questioners in upcoming presidential debates 
but sources said the idea was rejected by george bushs advisers 
aides to the republican presidential hopeful responded with a 
list of proposed moderators and questioners from both print and 
electronic media as of late monday the dukakis campaign had not 
agreed to the idea sources said 
only six days before the first debate the campaigns are still 
sparring over the arrangments for the televised confrontations 
between bush and dukakis 
the first debate sponsored by the parties commission on 
debates is scheduled sunday at wake forest university the second 
presidential debate is due oct 13 or oct 15 in los angeles 
sponsored by the league of women voters 
the late round in the predebate sniping came as dukakis 
campaign chairman paul brontas called james baker his counterpart 
in the bush camp on monday 
sources famiiliar with the talks who spoke only on the condition 
they not be identified said brountas suggested that the anchors 
from cbs news abc news nbc news and the cable news network be the 
moderators and questioners during both presidential debates and the 
vice president debate scheduled oct 5 in omaha 
that would mean cbss dan rather nbcs tom brokaw abcs peter 
jennings and probably cnns bernard shaw would be on stage for all 
three events 
this is a television event said one dukakis aide of the 
idea we want to do what we can to make it an event that people 
will pay attention to we think that they anchors would make it a 
bigger eventmore people would watch it 
but a top bush adviser said the idea was turned down as 
blatantly unfair to the print media and other television 
correspondents 
this source said bush responded later monday with a list of four 
proposed moderators and 10 panelists the source would not name any 
of them saying only the list was made up of network anchors 
network correspondents and print representatives 
the bush source took the occasion to accuse the dukakis campaign 
of violating the agreement not to talk about such matters 
we are operating under a written agreement of understanding 
not to discuss the negotiations surrouding debate details said 
the aide obviously that has been violated and thus the source 
gave the bush campaign position on the matters 
the predebate sparring is typical of presidential debate 
negotiations what is different in 1988 is that the campaigns are 
negotiating directly rather than with an involved third party like 
the league of women voters 
with the effort by the two political parties to take the 
sponsorship of the debates away from the league which has done it 
for the past three presidential campaigns the two campaigns have 
squabbled more directly on these matters than in the past

sen dan quayle ridiculed michael dukakis 
defense posture on monday and accused the democrat of causing an 
economic manacle rather than a miracle in his home state of 
massachusetts 
at rallies in knoxville tenn and on the start here of a 
fourday western swing the republican vice presidential candidate 
hammered at dukakis record on both pocketbook and national 
security issues 
the west has a lot of big open spaces just like the dukakis 
defense record quayle told the crowd of about 250 in casper he 
laughed at the pose dukakis struck last week in michigan when he 
donned a helmet and rode in a tank 
in just one week his defense policy went from general 
confustion to gen patton the indiana senator said 
earlier he faced down persistent hecklers at a noontime rally 
at an outdoor shopping mall in downtown knoxville in republican 
east tennessee quayle said his aim was to burst the bubble of 
dukakis reputation as a competent administrator 
in casper he excoriated the man from massachusetts on gun 
control his opposition to the death penalty and on a 
massachusetts prison furlough program that quayle said let on 
average one firstdegree murderer out on furlough each day since 
1983 the furlough program has since modified to exclude murderers 
later quayle was headed to boise idaho the 30th state he has 
campaigned in 
in knoxville he charged dukakis with driving citizens away from 
massachusetts with high taxing and spending higher spending per 
capital than any other state 
michael dukakis did not create an economic miracle in 
massachusetts he created an economic manacle that inhibits 
private sector expansion at the expense of public sector 
expansion quayle said 
the indiana senator told the rally the last thing in the 
world he should want this campaign to be about is competence 
the record of michael dukakis as governor of massachusetts is not 
something of which to be proud 
quayle said massachusetts ranks 40th out of 50 states in total 
employment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth the state 
actually lost 90000 manufacturing jobs between june 1984 and 
january 1988 he said 
several dozen produkakis demonstrators positioned themselves 
near the front of the crowd of 750 waving signs and making 
catcalls 
dont worry about the yellers you know if you had to support 
dukakis youd be yelling too quayle said in his sole digression 
from the speech 
the indiana senator charged dukakis had earned the title mr 
tax hike and mr job loss not mr president 
quayle conceded that massachusetts has a low unemployment rate 
but said that is because people are leaving massachusetts 
quayle said dukakis raised virtually every tax in 
massachusetts sales taxes personal income taxes business taxes 
taxes on cigarettes gas beer and wine the state legislature 
not the governor deserves credit for taxes that were cut during 
dukakis three terms quayle said 
quayle claimed he has presided over horrendous growth in the 
debt of massachusetts and has created more debt than all 
previous governors of massachusetts combined 
massachusetts like most states is required by its constitution 
to operate on a balanced budget quayle aides said he was referring 
not to its operating budget but bonded indebtedness 
david prosperi quayles press secretary said hes not the 
only one whos doing it but were pointing out the fact that hes 
issuing debt to come up with a balanced budget debt though 
bonds 
quayle ate a fast lunch at a greek restaurant peroulas before 
departing knoxville 
quayle flies from boise to las vegas tuesday then moves on to 
phoenix and california before heading home 
the republican ticket is rated solidly ahead of the democrats in 
the mountain states and nevada while a tight race is forecast in 
california for its 47 electoral votes

fear of rearrest a state department spokesman said monday 
the american embassy in pretoria south africa said after the 
three fled from detention in a hospital to the consulate in 
johannesburg a week ago that the united states would not force them 
to leave against their will it is against us policy however to

republican george bush warming up for his 
debate with michael dukakis this weekend accused his democratic 
rival monday of being antibusiness and pursuing a 
divideandconquer campaign strategy aimed at polarizing americans 
hes begun a calculated strategy of emphasizing differences 
between rich and poor between one region of the country and 
another the vice president told the lower bucks county chamber 
of commerce 
the luncheon speech in which bush offered himself as the 
champion of small business was his only public event monday he 
returned to washington afterward to prepare for his first 
nationally televised debate with dukakis in winstonsalem nc 
sunday night 
campaign spokeswoman sheila tate said the gop nominee planned to 
spend most of the week getting briefings from policy aides and 
taking part in mock debates with economic adviser richard g 
darman standing in for dukakis 
campaign sources said bush soon will propose a parental 
leave program that would use tax incentives to encourage business 
companies to give parents time off to care for children 
until now bush has made only vague mention of such a plan 
saying that women should not have to worry about getting their jobs 
back after a pregnancy or finding time to care for a sick child 
the reagan administration has opposed parental job leaves 
the vice president used three charts and a flurry of statistics 
in his speech here to demonstrate what he claimed was dukakis poor 
treatment of businesses as governor of massachusetts 
frankly since hes never been in business i dont think he 
understands the full effect of his own antibusiness scheme bush 
said 
the vice president asserted that in the first six months of this 
year the number of business bankruptcies had fallen nationally but 
risen in massachusetts moreover bush said he clearly wants to 
raise taxes 
in boston the dukakis campaign called together eight 
massachusetts business leaders who support the candidate i cant 
believe how anyone can say that the massachusetts economy is not 
conducive to business said one of them bernard j okeefe 
chairman of an electronics manufacturing firm and recent chairman 
of the national association of manufacturers 
ive been to every state in the union and i can assure you 
that there is not a state in the union that comes anywhere near 
close to massachusetts as an environment for growth and 
employment he said 
and dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said bush went to 
lunch today and served up another plate of whoppers about the 
governors economic record 
george doesnt know what hes talking about when he calls mike 
dukakis antibusiness she said citing four private independent 
rankings that applauded a favorable business climate in 
massachusetts 
on bankruptcies she said the rate of business failures in 
massachusetts was less than half the the national rate during the 
eight years of the reagan administration and had fallen by 28 
percent since dukakis became governor in 1983 
she also said bush was flat wrong in charging that dukakis 
had effectively doubled taxes on certain small businesses in 
massachusetts 
the state gave companies with fewer than 35 shareholders a 15 
million tax break in 1985 but when the federal tax overhaul law 
took effect the states revenue loss nearly tripled 
as a result dukakis and the legislature amended state law to 
restrict the tax break to corporations that grossed 6 million or 
less annually thus disqualifying 750 larger companies that had to 
pay a higher corporate rate 
 
 
 
 
bush said the current economic expansion is tough news for my

average sat scores lost ground in 1988 for the 
first time in eight years but minority students continued a 
decadelong pattern of impressive gains the college board reported 
monday 
scores on the verbal section of the scholastic aptitude test 
fell two points to an average 428 while the average on the math 
section was unchanged at 476 according to the boards annual 
report 
both portions of the multiplechoice exam taken each year by 11 
million collegebound students are scored on a scale of 200800 
with a combined 1600 being perfect 
the combined mathverbal average of 904 marked the first decline 
in eight years the national average hit a low of 890 in 1980 
recovered a bit to 906 by 1985 and was unchanged until this years 
slight decline 
ironically the release of the sat averages coincided with the 
planned departure tuesday of us education secretary william j 
bennett who during his 3 years in office had credited the reagan 
administration with spurring reforms which until this year had 
helped produce gradually improving sat scores 
in a statement monday bennett blamed the school establishment 
for the falloff in scores no medals for america in this news i 
said in april that the absolute level at which our improvements 
are taking place is unacceptably low today its a bit lower and 
still not acceptable cmon team back into training 
college board officials nonetheless cheered the stability of 
test scores in recent years 
were pleased frankly that there is as much stability in the 
scores as the data suggests board president donald m stewart 
told reporters he noted that scores were generally holding up even 
though the number of testtakers has risen 13 percent since 1986 
and the number of minority testtakers was up 23066 in the last 
year alone 
minority students in the class of 88 especially blacks posted 
the strongest gains verbal scores among blacks last year rose an 
average of two points to 353 and math scores rose seven points to 
384 doubly impressive since the number of black testtakers rose 
39 percent in three years from 70156 in 1985 to 97483 last year 
said the boards research director robert g cameron 
stewart said it was unclear why minority students were gaining 
one explanation is that federal programs such as head start begun 
in the 1960s and 1970s and aimed at assisting poor students are now 
paying off in higher minority sat scores 
since 1976 the first year the college board compiled ethnic 
data combined scores by blacks have climbed 51 points but they 
still trail average white testtakers by 198 points whites 
averaged 445 on the verbal in 198788 down two points and 490 on 
the math up a point 
among mexicanamericans verbal scores were up three points over 
last year to 382 and math scores up four to 428 their combined 
gains since 1976 amount to 29 points 
men continued to outperform women with male testtakers scoring 
an average 498 math and 435 verbal while females scored 455 math 
422 verbal test critics have charged that the sat is biased 
against women both in its wording and content college board 
officials deny the bias charge and counter that schools may be to 
blame for steering females into less demanding curricula 
meanwhile national averages on the act the predominant college 
entrance exam in 28 states mostly in the west and midwest were 
also little changed the approximately 1 million students who took 
the act last school year averaged 188 on a scale of 136 up 
slightly from the 187 average the year before according to the 
american college testing program the organization based in iowa 
city iowa which administers the test 
scores among whites were unchanged at 196 blacks rose 02 to 
136 american indians and alaskan natives gained 03 to 149 
mexicanamericans were up 03 to 157 and hispanics were up 02 to 
171

united nations the un secretarygeneral will make his first 
visit to south africa in five years on wednesday for peace talks 
with white minority leaders of the nation isolated and condemned by 
the world body as racist 
he then holds peace talks in angola 
un officials said monday that secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar will confer with president pw botha in pretoria the 
south african capital from wednesday to friday on implementing a 
un plan for the independence of namibia or southwest africa 
the officials declined to discuss his schedule in south africa 
or say whether he will meet with black leaders 
but south africas new un ambassador jeremy b shearar told 
the associated press he doubted the secretarygeneral would meet 
opposition leaders 
i think we could assume he is not going to complicate this 
short visit shearar said in a telephone interview 
we are dealing with a topic which has occupied us and the un 
for some 40 years and it would not be sensitive for anybody to try 
to deal with other issues it meeting opposition leaders could 
cloud the issues he said 
perez de cuellar trusts that his visit will help expedite the 
implementation of a un independence plan for namibia security 
council resolution 435 of 1978 a un announcement of the visit 
said 
south africa has been governing namibia under a mandate issued 
by the nowdefunct league of nations after world war i and rejected 
the un resolutions 
south africa has said it is willing to grant independence to 
namibia by next june 1 if the estimated 50000 cuban troops 
supporting the marxist government in neighboring angola have left 
by that date 
a un observer team is expected to oversee the transition to 
independence beginning in november 
shearar said the visit is coming at a very important 
juncture since the united nations shortly will be involved in the 
peace process it is very important that the process should have 
an impulse from the secretarygeneral himself he said 
a feeling exists in south africa shearar said that the un 
cannot be impartial on these southern african issues and we think 
it is hopeful that he should be there and demonstrate his 
impartiality and that of the secretariat 
we think both ourselves and the united nations have a great 
deal to gain from the visit 
shearar said he hoped no one would raise extraneous issues 
on the independence of namibia and the withdrawal of cuban troops 
from angola we are looking forward to reaching an understanding 
and a commitment on the part of the angolans and the cubans for 
their withdrawal and their presence too close to the border oculd 
inhibit free and fair elections he said 
shearar said he hoped the peace process in southern africa 
eventually would lead to a restoration of south africas voting 
rights and participation in the general assembly the pretoria 
government was stripped of its voting rights in 1974 
we hope that during the negotiations that go on people will 
see what is happening in south africa and see a general commitment 
to reform shearar said 
maybe its not such a bad idea to have south africas voice 
back in the corridors of the general assembly they may find it 
is sensible to deal with us rather than isolate us because that 
will not sort our our internal problems 
i would greatly look forward to being permanent representative 
when we resume our seat in the general assembly but there is a lot 
of ground to cover before that happens the envoy he said 
in angola perez de cuellar will confer with president eduardo 
dos santos on the situation in the area un officials said 
south africa regularly is denounced by the united nations and 
the security council for apartheid its rule over namibia and 
reported undermining of neighboring states 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

bus service came to a virtual 
standstill monday after leftist rebels called for a nationwide 
transportation ban and threatened drivers who took to the roads 
despite assurances from the military that transportation would 
be protected a vast majority of bus and truck drivers chose to 
park their vehicles 
only a handful of buses the main means of mass transit 
circulated in this capital city of 1 million inhabitants more than 
70 percent of the urban bus traffic was halted and intercity 
service was even more severely curtailed an official of the bus 
owners association told the associated press 
a dispatcher at one of the capitals two terminals said 90 
percent of the bus service between provinces was stopped 
local radio stations with correspondents in all 14 provinces 
also said the ban was about 90percent effective 
workers had to walk to their jobs or pay inflated fares to 
pickup truck and van owners who turn significant profits during 
such bans dozens of overcrowded small trucks and vans circulated 
through downtown 
there were fewer private cars on the roads but public 
transportation was more severely curtailed 
the ban on bus and truck traffic was the fifth called this year 
by the marxistled guerrilla army which has been waging a nearly 
9yearold war against the usbacked government 
the government had repeatedly urged on broadcast media that 
mondays ban be ignored saying the military would protect vehicles 
the ban is indefinite previous bans this year during which 
about 35 vehicles were burned lasted three days each 
col mauricio vargas the army chief of operations told ysu 
radio that about 13000 soldiers were providing and protecting 
transport 
we refuse to allow a violent minority to impose its will on 
us he said 
soldiers rode shotgun aboard several stateowned buses 
circulating in the capital and some army trucks carried passengers 
to and from the city outskirts lorgio deleon a 48yearold father 
of six was stranded at the eastern bus terminal with no way to get 
to his tailors job in zacatecoluca 35 miles southeast of san 
salvador 
this hurts the poor worker more than anyone we dont work 
today we get our pay docked he said the person who has some 
capital he just stays home where he has everything 
rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front said the 
ban was in response to what it termed official repression the 
guerrillas in announcing the ban referred to the actions of riot 
troops who broke up a sept 13 demonstration by leftist university 
students 
the troops used tear gas and clubs and fired shots in the air to 
disperse nearly 3000 students at that protest about 250 
demonstrators were arrested 
all but 14 were subsequently released with the remainder 
charged with what the government called terrorist acts

the trail of tears commemorative wagon 
train crossed the tennessee river on monday the third day of its 
1000mile journey to oklahoma 
eight covered wagons were taken across the quartermile expanse 
of water on a tugoperated ferry connecting state route 60 midway 
between georgetown and madison 
the crossing went without a hitch although one wagon had to be 
pushed onto the barge when the mule team pulling it was unable to 
get any footing on the slick metal approach ramp 
this was our second big hurdle and it went off just fine 
said ray morris of golconda ill the project coordinator our 
first hurdle was just getting the wagon train on the road saturday 
that was a miracle considering the short time we had putting this 
project together 
the wagon train departed saturday morning from red clay state 
historical park 15 miles east of cleveland after three days of 
traveling the eight covered wagons had covered slightly more than 
50 miles 
although the project is designed to commemorate the 150th 
anniversary of the removal of the cherokee indians from the 
southeast in 1838 as of monday no cherokees had traveled with the 
wagon train 
we did invite the cherokees in oklahoma to join us but theyre 
a poor people and couldnt afford to pay their own expenses for a 
76day trip said morris an agricultural adviser for the 
university of illinois 
morris said the university was continuing to pay his salary 
while he made the trip because the journey is seen as a cultural 
contribution to the community however he said there were no funds 
available to finance indian participation 
the state of illinois gave us 1000 and some of the 
communities along the way have promised to provide free services 
such as meals and feed for our animals he said otherwise 
were paying our own way 
meanwhile harley grant of chattanooga the interim chairman for 
tennessees commission on indian affairs said he was surprised 
that the cherokees had not played a greater role in the project 
grant added that the cherokees had been indirectly invited to 
participate in the project several months ago 
but most of us work for a living and were unable to make the 
journey from day to day he said 
morris said he expected some cherokees to join the wagon train 
as it moved further westward he also noted that the journey will 
end at tahlequah okla the capital of the cherokee nation 
there will be a big observation at the cherokee reservation 
when we get there in early december he said and too we did 
receive a letter of recognition from wilma mankiller the principal 
chief of the cherokees 
in her letter mankiller thanked the participants for 
commemorating the cherokees terrible ordeal grant also said he 
thought the wagon train project was a good idea

michael dukakis said monday that many 
americans are treading water after eight years of reaganomics 
and still awaiting the economic recovery trumpeted by the 
republicans 
after eight years in power the republican party seems to have 
exhausted its reservoir of ideas dukakis said in a speech that 
echoed refrains from john and robert kennedys campaigns 
in their hearts they know that four more years of reaganomics 
would be bad for the country and that four more years of 
reaganomics without reagan would be a disaster 
we can do better than that dukakis said as he set out on a 
twoday southern swing 
he said republican prosperity means young families having to 
postpone having children kids going home to an empty house at the 
end of the day because their mothers must work and cant afford 
child care and 40 million americans without health insurance 
mr bush doesnt seem to understand that i do he said as 
he set out on an abbreviated week of campaigning to allow him ample 
time to prepare for next sundays campaign debate 
we dont need a warmed over call to selfishness we need a new 
call to greatness said the massachusetts governor who is 
struggling to reverse bushs recent gains in the polls 
from arkansas dukakis flew to texas for a joint appearance with 
vice presidential running mate lloyd bentsen 
in a speech about energy policy dukakis said he would convene a 
bipartisan energy summit with congressional leaders shortly after 
taking office the summit would be chaired by bentsen a texas 
senator 
dukakis accused bush of tailoring his position to the region of 
the country hes campaigning in saying in texas he was in favor of 
offshore drilling but saying in california he was against it 
george bush is like a coin they just flip him and sometimes 
he lands on his head and sometimes he lands on his tail dukakis 
said to the laughter of his audience of 1000 people 
dukakis offered no new proposals in his little rock speech 
although aides said he would be making some recommendations over 
the next few days in speeches devoted to health insurance and 
energy policy 
advisers said the first appearance of the campaign swing was 
designed to show dukakis is attuned to the concerns of average 
people and the democratic presidential nominee was warmly 
applauded when he vowed to stand up and fight for the average 
american family 
it contained plenty of robust rhetoric as well including the 
declaration that the new president will inherit a sea of 
republican red ink that not even moses could part dukakis did 
not say how he would tackle the deficit 
dukakis has scaled back his campaign time this week to prepare 
for sundays televised debate in winstonsalem nc the first of 
two debates 
shortly after his plane departed boston aides distributed a 
written statement reporting that a doctors examination earlier 
this month showed dukakis to be in excellent health 
the statement noted that dukakis suffers from back pain that is 
aggravated by long stretches of sitting in airplane seats and his 
doctor has prescribed antiinflammation medication 
in his speech in little rock dukakis depicted an america 
ready to take charge of its future again and said in areas 
such as health insurance education and the environment he would 
use the power of government for change 
beyond that he said in a kennedyesque passage that he would ask 
all americans to bear a fair share of the burden of leading 
america into a new decade and a new century 
dukakis has been struggling to regain his footing in the race 
for the white house after a long period of decline in the polls 
and his traveling group of advisers was expanded for the trip by 
several veterans of past democratic campaigns those on board 
included ted sorenson a senior adviser to president kennedy and 
peter edelman who advised robert kennedy 
whether it was coincidental or not dukakis speech was 
delivered to a crowd in the camelot hotel and contained echoes of 
rhetoric from the two kennedys 
he spoke of the need to get america moving again foresaw 
new frontiers to conquer and after an attack on voodoo 
economics he said we can do better than that 
dukakis renewed his criticism of bushs call for a cut in the 
capital gains tax as a giveaway that would benefit mostly the 
wealthy 
he said that while bush may be satisfied with the status quo 
most americans arent satified and neither am i 
he said prosperity is fragile for too many who are treading 
water in the rust belt and the farm belt and the oil patch in our 
inner cities and small towns and rural counties 
too many americans even those with good jobs and with 
paychecks that once would have seemed enough are fearful that they 
could be wiped out by one big wave such as a longterm illness in 
the family or the cost of college education he said

democrat michael dukakis said monday that eight years of 
republican economic policies had left many americans fearful of 
being wiped out financially gop nominee george bush accused 
dukakis of using a strategy of dividing america by emphasizing 
differences between rich and poor 
the presidential rivals focused on pocketbook issues as they 
began a light week of campaigning in advance of their first 
nationally televised debate sunday in winstonsalem nc both 
candidates are cutting back on appearances to allow time to study 
issues and rehearse for the first of two scheduled debates 
while attacking each other on the economy dukakis and bush did 
not spell out any new economic proposals although the vice 
president voiced support for federal limits on certain types of 
liability lawsuits to help businesses curb insurance costs 
bush traveled to bensalem pa where he told the lower bucks 
county chamber of commerce that dukakis as governor of 
massachusetts had an antibusiness bias and clearly wants to 
raise taxes 
the vice president said the number of business bankruptcies in 
massachusetts was up 237 percent during the first six months of 
the year but on the national level had fallen by 235 percent 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said bush was wrong 
that business failures in massachusetts actually had declined by 28 
percent since dukakis became governor in 1983 and were less than 
half the national rate during the eight years of the reagan 
presidency 
the campaign also trotted out massachusetts business leaders to 
rebut bush 
ive been to every state in the union and i can assure you 
that there is not a state in the union that comes anywhere near 
close to massachusetts as an environment for growth and 
employment said bernard j okeefe the chairman of egampg an 
electronics manufacturers and recently chairman of the national 
association of manufacturers 
bushs vice presidential running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana echoed bush during a campaign stop in knoxville tenn 
quayle said dukakis had inflicted an economic manacle on 
massachusetts rather than an economic miracle 
later in casper wyo quayle ridiculed what he called dukakis 
efforts to come across as tough on defense referring to dukakis 
appearance at a michigan facility where he donned a helmet and 
cruised around a tank quayle said in just week his defense 
policy went from general confusion to gen patton 
brushing aside dukakis criticism of gop economic policies bush 
said hes begun a calculated strategy of emphasizing differences 
between rich and poor between one region of the country and 
another 
bush added he wont win unless he convinces the electorate 
that everything is bad in america i am dismayed by the 
divideandconquer strategy 
the vice president said dukakis had raised all sorts of 
taxes as governor 
he mentioned the state income tax which raised about 70 
million when it was linked with the new federal tax code a sale 
tax hike on cigarettes which produced 40 million and a tax break 
affecting businesses with fewer than 35 shareholders dukakis and 
the legislature amended the law to restrict it to corportations 
grossing 6 million or less a year disqualifying about 750 
companies including some of the states largest corporations 
dukakis on a twoday swing through the south said bush may be 
content with the state of the economy but most americans arent 
satisfied and neither am i 
in a speech in little rock ark dukakis said after eight 
years in power the republican party seems to have exhausted its 
reservoir of ideas 
the democratic nominee said prosperity is fragile for too many 
who are treading water in the rust belt and the farm belt and the 
oil patch in our inner cities and small towns and rural counties 
too many americans even those with good jobs and with 
paychecks that once would have seemed enough are fearful that they 
could be wiped out by one big wave such as a longterm illness or 
the cost of a college education dukakis said 
in a speech in houston about energy policy dukakis said he 
would appoint running mate bentsen to chair a bipartisan energy 
summit with congressional leaders he also accused bush of 
tailoring his positions to the region where he is campaigning 
supporting offshore drilling in texas but opposing it in california 
george bush is like a coin they just flip him and sometimes 
he lands on his head and sometimes he lands on his tail dukakis 
said 
new polls were released showing dukakis and bush in dead heats 
in new york and ohio which together account for 70 of the 270 
electoral votes needed to win the white house a poll in 
mississippi with seven electoral votes gave bush a substantial 
lead 
bush who once trailed dukakis by 10 percentage points in ohio 
was favored by 43 percent while dukakis was supported by 39 
percent in a poll of 667 registered voters taken by the university 
of akron with a margin of error of 4 percentage points it was a 
statistical dead heat 
in new york dukakis led bush 48 percent to 42 percent with an 
undecided pool of 10 percent according to the marist college 
institute for public opinion the margin of error was put at 4 
percent making it also an effective tie 
in mississippi bush led dukakis 493 percent to 34 percent the 
survey of 1000 potential voters by rick knox and associates had a 
margin of error of five points 
a media generalassociated press poll meanwhile said americans 
see dukakis as more compassionate and bush as more competent but 
arent convinced that either candidate can accomplish most of his 
goals as president 
only 36 percent of those surveyed said bush could accomplish 
most of his goals as president and just 31 percent said dukakis 
could achieve most of his goals nearly half said either would be 
stymied the rest were not sure 
after a onestop campaign foray in pennsylvania bush returned 
to washington where he will spend most of the week on debate 
preparation press secretary sheila tate said former deputy 
treasury secretary richard g darman a key firstterm strategist 
for president reagan would play the part of dukakis in debate 
practice sessions 
a campaign source said bush plans to propose a parental job 
leave program that would give businesses tax incentives to give 
parents time off to care for children after birth or because of 
serious illness 
on the debate front sources familiar with the negotiations said 
monday the dukakis campaign has proposed the four network 
television news anchors one each from cbs nbc abc and cnn be 
the moderator and panel for each of the presidential debates as 
well as the vice presidential faceoff 
but a republican adviser said such an arrangement would be 
unfair to representatives of newspapers and other broadcast outlets

it will be december before this caribbean 
luxury resort returns to normalcy after weathering the strongest 
hurricane of the century hotel executives say 
but cancun which alone represents 20 percent of mexicos 
tourist income will recover and continue to grow they said 
an estimated 40 million in lost hotel room revenue for the 
coming weeks is the least of the damage caused by hurricane gilbert 
as it roared through mexicos choice resorts on the yucatan 
peninsula last week 
industry officials said they will rush repairs in cancun to be 
ready for the beginning of the high season in december other 
affected areas include the neighboring islands of cozumel and isla 
mujeres 
workers were putting ceilings back in the lobby at the sheraton 
and unloading new plants to replace those wiped out by the storm as 
stillstranded guests continued to try to find seats on jammed 
flights 
at the 14story hyatt regency the tallest building on the 
strip architects and engineers huddled with hotel officials in the 
lobby to replan remodeling that already had been scheduled 
about 6000 tourists were evacuated in the hours just before the 
storm last wednesday and no tourists were among the 31 people 
confirmed killed on the yucatan peninsula 
government officials and hotel people said they were still 
gauging physical damage from the storm and the loss of business it 
will suffer while repairs are made and the city is cleaned up no 
official estimate was made but carlos constandse a leading local 
hotel owner said he believed repairs would cost about 100 million 
we have to close in the short term 100 percent tourism 
secretary antonio enriquez savignac said during a weekend visit 
here with president miguel de la madrid i believe in two weeks 
we will be in a position to begin slowly reopening the hotels by 
the end of november it will be totally repaired 
hotel managers said they were aiming for the dec 15 start of 
the high season 
tourism accounts for 10 percent of foreign exchange and has 
helped mexico survive economic crisis and falling oil prices 
cancun itself draws 1 million tourists annually and brings in 500 
million a year or 20 percent of tourism income enriquez savignac 
said 
about 90 percent of the tourists are foreigners the 100 a 
night offseason and 160 inseason rates are beyond the means of 
all but wealthy mexicans 
obviously theres going to be a down the very commercial 
restaurants ones that cater only to tourists are going to suffer 
and give their employees vacations said paolo ceravolo who owns 
an italian restaurant popular with local hotel and construction 
executives but by december there will be people 
there is too much invested in cancun for them private 
investors to let it fall he said 
were going to have to lower rates and the people will come 
said miguel loyo controller of the 1200room hotel presidente he 
stood in the lobby its ceiling gone and glittering glass decor 
stripped to bare concrete 
cancun was a hamlet of fishermen and farmers until 1969 when 
the government using computer analyses of its climate proximity 
to mayan ruins and other factors targeted it for development 
since then it has boomed to a population of about 200000 nearly 
all its 45000 jobs depend on tourism 
more than 50 of its 111 hotels are strung along a 12mile ribbon 
of powdery white sand dunes now known as the hotel zone that 
faces the caribbean on one side on the other lagoons separate it 
from the mainland 
all the hotels on the strip were damaged in one way or 
another constandse said of 11000 rooms that were operating at 
the time 30 percent were damaged he said 
gilbert uprooted trees jerked street lights out from their 
concrete bases and bent communications antennae like hairpins 
windows and glass walls blew out all along the hotel strip in

a fourstory eightroom section ripped away and came to rest at a 
steep angle at the edge of the sea a crumbled swimming pool lay at 
the oceans edge and sand was washed from under the main floor of 
another section

amnesty international opened its us leg of 
its human rights concert tour monday with a starstudded lineup of 
top international rock stars that included bruce springsteen and 
sting 
the human rights now tour began late monday afternoon with 
performers singing the late reggae star bob marleys get up 
stand up to an unenthusiastic crowd at john f kennedy stadium 
by the time sting took the stage 2 hours later the stadium had 
filled and the crowd had turned boisterous 
about 73000 tickets at 35 each were sold for the concert held 
at the same stadium where 90000 gathered for the 1985 live aid 
concert that raised money to fight hunger 
its very easy for young people to feel helpless to feel 
impotent to feel they have no influence or control over the world 
they are going to inherit but amnesty international is a real 
beacon of hope british rocker peter gabriel said at a news 
conference before the concert 
gabriel tracy chapman and senegalese singer yousoou ndour also 
were featured along with american folk singer joan baez and 
saxophonist branford marsalis 
amnesty international launched the worldwide concert tour in 
london on sept 2 to mark the 40th anniversary of the universal 
declaration of human rights which the united nations adopted in 
1948 
the londonbased amnesty international which monitors human 
rights abuses and political prisoners handed out literature and 
asked concertgoers for signatures on petitions supporting the 
declaration by halfway through the concert 40000 people had 
signed said amnesty officials 
philadelphia one of the 19 tour stops in 14 countries is the 
first stop in the united states the tour stops in los angeles on 
wednesday and san francisco on friday before concerts in asia 
africa and south america 
amnesty international is based on a simple concept that every 
person must and can help to enforce human rights standards 
amnesty international official jack healey said at the news 
conference 
the performers said they will concentrate on entertaining the 
crowd and not on educating the audience about examples of abuse 
the idea is art poses a challenge it lets you know what the 
issues are and puts it in your hands to do something about 
springsteen said 
the concert stage was decorated with a 40foot map of the 
eastern hemisphere on one side and a map of the western hemisphere 
on the other between sets the audience saw an animated video 
about the human rights declaration 
by the time the tour concludes in buenos aires on oct 15 
organizers expect more than 1 million people to have attended the 
concerts amnesty officials said the tour was designed to raise 
awareness of human rights not to raise money the peformers are 
donating their time 
margaret farren a 16yearold high school student from belmar 
nj went to the concert with about 20 members of an amnesty 
international chapter 
she said she expected membership to increase as a result of the 
tour 
this is definitely going to catch peoples attention ms 
farren said

general assembly the united states and other nations have 
sponsored a resolution inviting south korea to address the assembly 
on the 40th anniversary of its founding 
both south korea and communist north korea have nonvoting 
observer status and are not permitted to speak during the general 
debate when national leaders address the assembly 
but the soviet union and its socialist friends oppose letting 
south korea speak and on monday they sponsored a resolution 
inviting north korea to deliver an address 
both north and south korea formed their governments in late 
summer of 1948 
china has not sponsored either resolution but opposes a south 
korean speech 
the threeweek general debate begins sept 26 when president 
reagan will deliver his final speech to the world body his 
administration has criticized the united nations over the years for 
bureaucracy waste and antiwestern bias 
the session will hear 13 heads of state six prime ministers and

iraniraq peace talks a un meeting between greek and turkish 
cypriot leaders of the divided mediterranean island nation of

africa or namibia and southern africa and positive signs in 
southeast asia 
but he also pointed to continuing problems in the middle east 
central america southern africa and the korean peninsula the 
issues of disarmament global economic disparties human rights 
violations and the environment are urgent problems he said 
perez de cuellar said the united nations still faces a financial 
crisis despite a us promise to pay 144 million in arrears 
the un chief said the financial health of the organization 
needs to be immediately restored the united nations cannot 
function without money 
he said the un faces both an immediate shortage of cash 
which threatens insolvency in the next few months and the 
virtual depletion of reserves he said this means the un will 
not be able to carry out new peacekeeping operations 
he said he would ask the general assembly urgently to consider 
new ways of raising money such as voluntary contributions 
interestfree loans and changes in the scale of assessments 
it would be paradoxical and discordant perez de cuellar 
said if the organization should face financial difficulties 
precisely when it has to meet the demands of a more constructive 
phase of international affairs

us marshals arrested a fugitive wanted in 
a hostagetaking at a newspaper office as he arrived monday on a 
flight from newark nj with an attorney 
marshals grabbed eddie hatcher and frisked him in the covered 
passageway connecting an arriving piedmont airlines plane to a 
terminal at raleighdurham airport a security officer guarded the 
door to the terminal while marshals arrested hatcher handcuffed 
him and led him to a car waiting on the tarmac 
hatcher whose hair had been cut shorter since his disappearance 
last month wore a bright red shirt blue jeans long breech cloth 
and indianstyle boots 
he is charged with violating federal weapons laws and holding up 
to 20 people hostage at the robesonian newspaper in lumberton on 
feb 1 hatcher who is american indian and a second man charged 
in the incident said they were protesting alleged corruption and 
discrimination against minorities by robeson county law enforcement 
officials 
hatchers arraignment had been scheduled for monday and his 
brother and sister aaron and ginger clark were waiting at the 
airport with a limousine they said they had planned to take their 
brother to the federal courthouse in downtown raleigh for the 
hearing 
however authorities were watching the flights coming into 
raleighdurham and spotted hatcher first said us marshal bill 
berryhill 
we felt like with his arraignment today he might come in 
said berryhill 
the marshal said he was willing to give hatcher the benefit of 
the doubt and believed he was on his way to surrender when he 
stepped off the plane at the airport 
new york attorney ron kuby had accompanied hatcher on the flight 
from newark kuby is an associate of lawyer william kunstler 
wellknown for his defense of leftwing activists 
ms clark watched through a window as officials led her brother 
out of the plane and down a stairway to the waiting car she 
sobbed pounded on the window and waved in an attempt to get her 
brothers attention hatcher looked up and smiled at her 
hatcher was taken to the cumberland county jail in fayetteville 
one county over from robeson in southeastern north carolina 
berryhill said 
upon his arrival in fayetteville hatcher was asked where he had 
been he replied over the rainbow i had a vacation i feel real 
good its time to overthrow the government 
while hatcher was being taken into custody his case was called 
by us district judge terrence boyle the judge entered an 
innocent plea on hatchers behalf and set trial for sept 26 
hatcher 30 disappeared aug 31 after the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals revoked his bond he was declared a fugitive after 
failing to surrender to us marshals in raleigh

with his lawyers while a fugitive barry nakell a chapel hill 
attorney whos helping represent hatcher said i cant say 
berryhill said investigators would pursue information on where 
hatcher has been during the past 20 days even though its rather 
academic at this point 
well be talking with mr hatcher right away the marshal 
said and well be getting with the airlines to determine point 
of departure who bought the plane tickets and so on 
us attorney margaret currin and assistant us attorney john 
bruce would not comment on possible additional charges against 
hatcher or others who may have helped him 
timothy jacobs 20 who also is charged in the hostagetaking 
incident surrendered to us marshals in asheville on aug 31 
jacobs was later transferred to the wilson county jail 
bruce said hatcher and jacobs would be tried together since they 
were indicted together and the cases had not been separated by a 
judge 
hatcher and jacobs had been released on 100000 unsecured bond 
july 5 after a threejudge panel of the appeals court ruled they 
had not been given a bond hearing within five days of their arrest 
as required by law but the full court voided that decision and set 
an oct 4 hearing on a prosecution motion challenging bond for the 
two men

the foreign office plans to tell 10 ambassadors 
that their envoys must obey the law following a flurry of crimes by 
visiting diplomats officials said monday 
the foreign office said the ambassadors were being selected as 
representatives of geographic regions rather than as suspected 
offenders the envoys were not immediately identified 
were asking a number of senior ambassadors to call to enlist 
their help and cooperation in putting across to their colleagues 
the governments concern at any possible abuse of diplomatic 
privilege said a foreign office statement 
the meeting is to be held this week but no final date was set 
the carea gun at demonstrators 
outside his embassy and a tunisian who refused to pay parking 
fines 
the 10 ambassadors will meet with foreign office minister 
timothy eggar who expelled both the cuban diplomat and the cuban 
ambassador oscar fernandezmell 
obey our laws or go home eggar warned in a column this week 
in a london weekly the mail on sunday 
eggar revealed that britain tried unsuccessfully in 1984 to get 
an international agreement to modify the 1961 vienna convention 
which gives diplomats blanket immunity from prosecution 
britain has been particularly touchy about diplomatic crime 
since a man firing from the libyan embassy at demonstrators killed 
a london policewoman in 1984 libya refused to waive immunity and 
britain severed relations 
it is widely suspected that violations are occurring of the 
foreign office ban on diplomats carrying guns and stockpiling arms 
officials say privately 
londons sunday telegraph said this week that the intelligence 
service mi5 quietly screens diplomatic consignments if arms 
are suspected although this is forbidden under the vienna 
convention 
the newspaper said intelligence agents arranged for a recent 
shipment of automatic rifles destined for an arab embassy which it 
did not identify to be dropped while being unloaded from a 
freighter the ambassador was told to send the rifles home the 
newspaper said 
most crimes by the 18000strong diplomatic community are 
unpublicized and the envoy involved is quietly expelled with 18 
such cases last year and 17 in 1986 the foreign office says 
recent publicized cases include a jordanian embassy waiter 
suspected of sex crimes a mexican envoy questioned about the 
murder of two prostitutes and an iranian consul expelled on 
shoplifting allegations 
britain lists the worst offenders for nonpayment of parking 
fines 
egypt headed the 1987 list with 799 unpaid tickets followed by 
the soviet union 622 china 551 and france with 513 
asked to comment an egyptian embassy spokesman did not return 
the call 
tunisian diplomat sadok kassous was expelled because he refused 
to pay hundreds of dollars in fines protesting that insufficient 
parking spaces were provided outside the embassy

an unexpected outpouring of swedish 
antiimmigrant sentiment surfaced monday in a small towns vote 
against accepting refugees 
in the first referendum of its kind in sweden the farming 
community of sjobo rejected a governments request to house and 
absorb into the community up to 40 refugees 
asked on sunday whether they would accept the refugees 6237 
people voted against no and 3000 voted in favor a margin of 21 
the result raised concern that supressed antiimmigration 
feelings would emerge in other parts of the country known for its 
generous refugee policy 
before the referendum it was widely expected the vote would be 
close with a majority voting in favor reflecting swedens 
opendoor policies 
this is a sad result everyone is a loser said madeleine 
ramel head of the social welfare board that would have taken care 
of the immigrants it is unfortunate for sjobo 
the referendum coincided with nationwide parliamentary elections 
in which the social democrats who have dominated politics for most 
of the past 50 years retained power 
the result gave the environmental greens a place in the 
349member riksdag for the first time it emerged as the second 
strongest green party in europe after west germany 
the greens appeared to have taken most of their votes from the 
threeparty nonsocialist bloc which registered its lowest result 
since world war ii 
the social democrats supported by the communists were in 
control with 177 seats the centerright bloc got 152 and the 
greens got 20 
the vote in sjobo was the first open defiance of swedens 
longstanding policy to provide a home to refugees and give them 
language training job skills housing education and other 
benefits 
last year 18000 people sought political asylum in this neutral 
nation of 84 million the highest rate in europe according to 
official figures 
the immigration authorities routinely ask the countrys 284 
local governments to receive refugees in an effort to spread 
immigrants outside the main cities 
most districts have been positive but the sjobo council last 
autumn voted 2524 to put the question to a referendum 
council chairman svenolle olsson head of the local center 
party has been the leader of the fight to keep the immigrants out 
he has been under pressure to drop the referendum but said it 
was a matter of democracy to hold it center party leaders in 
stockholm have threatened to expel him from the national party 
until now sweden has not witnessed the rightwing backlash to 
largescale immigration that has appeared in france and neighboring 
denmark and norway 
it is scary to see that swedens humanistic policy actually 
has no real support among the people said signe jansson a 
midwife in sjobo who voted yes 
but officials cautioned against overestimating the significance 
of the vote 
christina rogestam head of immigration said swedens refugee 
policy does not stand or fall with sjobo we believe that all other 
districts now will give their support 
center party leader olof johansson said sjobo is special it 
is not like all of sweden thank god 
olssons campaign against refugees may have spurred a jump in 
the popularity of the local center party which took 23 seats in a 
separate vote for the 49member council eight more than it 
previously held

the army said monday it was 
scaling back plans for a laboratory in western utah for testing 
germ warfare defenses 
the armys plans for the biological laboratory at dugway proving 
ground had drawn strong opposition from utahs governor and 
congressional delegation and from opponents of research into 
genetically altered organisms 
the army initially proposed a 54 million biological aerosol 
test facility with the highest level of containment possible 
biosafety level 4 such a facility is required for experiments 
involving genetically altered organisms and diseases for which 
there are no vaccines 
the army said it had no plans to conduct tests involving such 
organisms at the dugway facility but it wanted the ability to do 
so if the need arose 
at a news conference monday michael owen deputy assistant 
secretary of the army for installation and logistics said the army 
would instead seek to build a 5 million level 3 test facility in 
1991 
level 3 testing involves diseases for which cures exist 
the armys decision is based on an extensive evaluation of the 
requirements for biological defense owen said existing army 
bl4 facilities will be used to satisfy any future needs for 
material testing that requires a containment level higher than 
bl3 
the new laboratory would replace an older facility at the 
western utah desert army installation 70 miles southwest of salt 
lake city it would be used to test procedures developed for 
defense against an attack with biological materials the united 
states is party to a 1972 treaty that prohibits the offensive use 
of biological agents 
biological testing has been conducted at dugway since 1952 
the announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by gov norm 
bangerter and utahs congressional delegation who joined owen at 
the news conference 
i think its a good idea of cooperation between the citizens 
between the governors office between the delegation and the army 
which took it upon themselves to back down considerably on this 
effort said rep james hansen rutah 
hansen said the new level 3 facility at dugway would merely 
duplicate testing conducted there since 1952 
i appreciate the armys newfound willingness to compromise 
with the people of utah and negotiate with me as governor on 
matters which affect the state and its citizens bangerter added 
last march the governor vowed to do all he could to block 
construction of the higherlevel lab he told army officials that 
if they intended only to conduct level 3 experiments then a level 
3 lab was all that was needed 
he also threatened to withhold state construction licenses for 
the project 
owen said the public outcry against the armys initial plans was 
not the sole determining factor in the decision but he added 
we try to be good neighbors 
jeremy rifkin of the foundation on economic trends said monday 
he would fight the level 3 plan rifkin succeeded in getting a 
federal court restraining order halting the army from proceeding 
with its original plans pending an environmental impact statement 
he said his washingtonbased lobby contends that plans to build 
a level 3 lab will require still another environmental impact 
statement he said if the army balks the foundation will again go 
to court 
rifkin said the decision not to build a level 4 lab is clearly 
a victory for us because it would stop highcontainment work and 
gene splicing 
on the other hand theyre apparently planning now to build a 
facility that would be less secure while still handling toxic 
organisms he said 
during public hearings last march witnesses cited a 1966 
accident at dugway with nerve gas that killed 6000 sheep while 
the army denied responsibility for the deaths it paid compensation 
to ranchers who lost livestock 
the news conference was held by owen bangerter and hansen at 
the gate to tooele army depot where the army was conducting a 
public hearing later monday night for its biological defense 
research program

reporter 
guards maintained tight security outside the sixthfloor suite 
in the dominican concorde hotel where namphy his wife gabrielle 
and his daughter melissa were staying

general for about 30 minutes in his hotel suite

americas troubled atomic power industry has 
started spending millions of dollars on advertising aimed at 
rebuilding public support for nuclear energy 
the advertisements make the argument that nuclear power helps 
reduce dangerous us dependence on foreign oil imports 
antinuclear activists however say the ads are misleading 
because only about 4 percent of us oil consumption goes toward 
generating electricity they contend that the industry is 
belittling or ignoring safety risks involved with nuclear power

trevor pinnocks debut as an operatic conductor 
at the metropolitan opera has already raised eyebrows but the 
british early music specialist says youve got to start 
somewhere why not here 
pinnock will conduct handels giulio cesare which premieres 
tuesday with kathleen battle as cleopatra and tatiana troyanos as 
caesar jeffrey walker in the role of ptolemy is the first 
countertenor male alto to appear at the met 
the more significant first for the met is having an early music 
specialist in the pit pinnock who founded and directs the english 
concert is one of britains bestknown workers in the original 
instruments field along with christopher hogwood and john eliot 
gardner 
however the announcement that pinnock would conduct giulio 
cesare provoked some critical grousing last season donal 
henahan chief music critic of the new york times ended a 
laudatory review of one of pinnocks performances with this warning 
shot followers of the metropolitan opera must wonder what 
qualifies mr pinnock to conduct next seasons julius caesar 
the trouble is people are always ready to pigeonhole 
everybody pinnock said before rehearsal recently 
ive done giulio cesare ive done it with students on stage 
in london but the fact is ive never conducted in an opera house 
before he said 
i do know the music through and through i love the music of 
handel and i love working with singers in a certain way all 
music is sung i hate music that doesnt breathe 
pinnock 41 has been performing professionally since 1966 and 
he formed the english concert in 1973 
the met has only been doing handel since 1983 when rinaldo 
entered the repertory followed by an operatic version of the 
oratorio samson in 1985 
this production of giulio cesare was done by john copley for 
the english national opera in 1978 with charles mackerras 
conducting 
pinnock is not working with original instruments at the met but 
with a small orchestra 18 violins six cellos three basses and 
harpsichord of modern instruments 
the early music influence will come in the style of playing 
especially the ornamentation in both the instrumental and vocal 
parts 
of course it has been paramount in my musical considerations 
the combination of what handel wants and how to fill the hall 
pinnock said 
its interesting how much thats affected ornamentation i 
have quite strong ideas about the type of ornamentation that is 
suitable for a large space as opposed to a small room i think the 
ornamentation in general needs more space it cant be tight and 
fast ornamentation 
it also has to suit the voice 
ive found that ive had to write quite different 
ornamentation in some cases for cover singers pinnock said 
because obviously one is trying to solve two things in 
ornamentation first and foremost for me ones trying to enhance 
the meaning of the words and the whole sense of the aria if the 
ornamentation doesnt do that its completely wasted notes 
secondly it is to show off the voice and it must be to show off 
the beautiful qualities of whoever is singing it 
giulio cesare premiered in london in 1724 and was revised 
and revived in 1725 1730 and 1732 following its last german 
performances in 1733 it disappeared from the repertory until the 
1920s 
restoring the reputation of handels more than three dozen 
operas has become a cause for his partisans winton dean and john 
merrill knapp in a monumental scholarly survey of handels operas 
published last year contended that handel ranks with monteverdi 
mozart and verdi among the supreme masters of opera 
pinnock said handels operas have unfairly gained a reputation 
for being static that has something to do with the limitations of 
the opera seria form of recitatives mixed with da capo 
arias solos which have two movements repeating the first 
pinnock sees giulio cesare as a series of pictures in which 
the audience is invited to take part 
the da capo aria musically enhances the meaning of the 
words he said so what weve begun to understand in the 
beginning weve entered the picture then were fully in 
accordance with whats being sung and can relish the atmosphere 
before moving on to the next picture 
now of course it is possible in a certain production to make 
it so static that we as the audience are not invited in but i 
believe that the good production of a handel opera will at the same 
time honor that concept of the picture and not destroy it by 
ridiculous movement 
among pinnocks future projects is next seasons launching of 
the classical band in new york an original instruments 
orchestra of 40 or 50 players which will have guest conductors 
leonard bernstein wants to have a go pinnock said though 
thats not yet definite 
he says he wants to be free to perform any kind of music though 
pinnock admits some limitations 
im not good enough at playing jazz which upsets me a lot 
because i feel i should be but i dont know the language well 
enough 
ive always held that at their best moments the bands of basie 
and ellington showed how a band should work and thats the same 
sort of basis as my little orchestra the english concert 
as a director one has to set up the best framework for the 
individual musicians to play even better than they know how that 
was the great art of count basie who didnt always have the 
greatest soloists but he often managed to make it possible for 
them to play even better than one would expect

suzhou is the name of a nearby city of 
gardens known for its beauty it also is the name of a creek in 
shanghai known for its ugliness 
suzhou creek whose waters once abounded in clams and crabs and 
were prized by ancient winemakers today is shanghais most glaring 
symbol of a pollution problem that endangers the health of its 12 
million citizens 
officials fear the creeks pollution and stench also could scare 
off foreigners willing to invest in the rebirth of shanghai as a 
leading center of industry and commerce 
but the government has begun to act 
construction began in august of a 432million pipeline project 
to divert the raw sewage now discharged into suzhou creek and 
flowing into the huangpu river shanghais main waterway 
qiu xingyan chief engineer of the pollution control division in 
the citys environmental protection bureau said the system will 
transport the garbage into the yangtze river estuary north of 
chinas largest city 
i was a little worried at first about shifting pollution from 
the suzhou to the yangtze qiu said in an interview but stressed 
that the sewage will be treated and wont affect water quality in 
the yangtze 
shanghai last year completed a 162million project to move 
treatment stations for the citys drinking water into less 
contaminated waters further up the huangpu river 
raw garbage still flows into water used for drinking and more 
money must be spent in the future to move water stations upstream 
but there has been an improvement over the recent past when every 
glass of drinking water was onethird chlorinated sewage 
during the song dynasty 9601279 winemakers used water from 
the suzhou then called the wusong for highquality wine but by 
the 1920s with shanghai fast rising as the commercial and 
industrial center of china the river was already badly polluted 
its fish and crabs dying off 
today the 77mile river snakes through industrial workingclass 
neighborhoods of shanghai finally dumping the refuse of textile 
and chemical factories into the huangpu along the citys famed 
waterfront bund 
in contrast to the deathlike dun of its surface the suzhou 
churns with activity hundreds of flatboats ply the waters loading 
clothing and shoes some bound for overseas markets and unloading 
televisions and other consumer goods 
the fumes from old trucks compete with the odors wafting from 
the river suzhou creek is only the most pungent example of 
shanghais water pollution problems regarded as the worst in china 
zhang mingyo of the city environmental protection research 
institute said shanghais 10000 factories every day dump 5 million 
tons of largely untreated sewage into branches of the huangpu 
city environmentalists even keep tabs of the stink factor on 
the huangpu and last year the river registered 150 foulsmelling 
days 
more seriously scientists believe shanghais high rates of 
stomach liver and esophagal cancer are linked to poor water 
quality in the first half of this year 30 people died and 300000 
were sickened from a major outbreak of hepatitis in the city caused 
by contaminated clams 
the experts acknowledge that the pollution problem in shanghai 
became worse after the communist takeover in 1949 and has become 
even more serious with chinas economic takeoff in the 1980s 
the state environmental protection bureau has estimated that 
more than 29000 miles of chinas waterways have been contaminated 
by industrial pollution although environmental protection laws 
have been enacted the state lacks both the money for pollution 
controls and the will to slow the pace of the nations 
modernization drive 
estimates are that shanghai already reeling from the costs of 
rebuilding its antiquated industries and woefully inadequate 
infrastructure will need 4 billion by the turn of the century to 
reach national standards on water and air pollution 
the city now fines factories that exceed limits on the density 
of the garbage they discharge although it does not regulate the 
amount of sewage released it will also charge fees for use of the 
new suzhou pipeline and others planned to be built by the year 
2000 the pollution control divisions qiu said 
qiu added the new pipeline will handle only 40 percent of the 
sewage now discharged into the suzhou 
but he said the city plans to eliminate the smell by the year 
2000 and hopes that one day fish will return to the suzhou 
the project is important to shanghai he said because 
foreigners who see and smell suzhou creek may be reluctant to 
invest in the citys development 
cleaning up the creek he said will be helpful for the image 
of shanghai

the diaries of two israeli soldiers offer 
sharply conflicting accounts of how the israeli army deals with the 
ninemonthold palestinian uprising on the west bank and gaza strip 
but at the same time the diairies published in the jerusalem 
post mirror the broad differences in israeli society itself on how 
to quell the rebellion 
one soldier a reservist wrote that troops were taught to beat 
arabs with dry blows that cause pain but draw no blood 
the other said his reserve duty in the gaza strips jabaliya 
refugee camp convinced him that despite occasional abberations 
soldiers were restrained and noble men 
the israeli army remains one of the most decent in the 
world the second soldier americanborn freelance writer louis 
rapoport wrote of his 30 days of duty in the crowded camp of 
70000 refugees in june 
but the other britishborn educator jonathan kestenbaum 
described a tremendous callousness among many of the soldiers 
he served with in the west bank village of qabatiyeh in august 
among the soldiers there is a depressing routine of almost 
wild abandon everybody here makes up their own rules kestenbaum 
wrote in his diary 
kestenbaum 29 described an encounter with an israeli guard at 
a detention center in jenin north of jerusalem 
how many dogs have you brought kestenbaum quoted the guard 
as asking him when he arrived with a group of teenage palestinian 
detainees 
he added once the man opposite you is a dog anything goes 
rapoport conceded troops were sometimes responsible for 
accidents or misjudgments including a case where an israeli 
soldier made a firebomb and intended to hurl it at arab 
demonstrators his officers confiscated it 
but he wrote many soldiers were frustrated because they felt 
the palestinians had a propaganda edge by sending boys as young as 
9 years old to the front lines of stonethrowing riots to take on 
armed troops 
the scores of men in the reserve company i served with are 
portrayed in the world media as part of a goliath machine versus 
little david with his puny stones rapoport wrote 
addressing the same issue kestenbaum wrote of a 15yearold 
palestinian killed by a member of his unit why are we using live 
bullets on teenagers throwing stones 
kestenbaum told of chasing a 9yearold boy who broke a 30day 
curfew to try to retrieve bread from a gutter and of rounding up a 
group of elderly palestinians who slipped into a field at night to 
pick a bucket of tomatoes rotting in the fields 
our jeep springs into action chasing this family as if the 
very future of our country depended on it we corner them 
kestenbaum wrote at which point the old woman 90 years old 
falls to her knees kisses my hand and begs me not to detain her 
we really needed tomatoes she says 
these are vulgar unnecessary situations which humiliate them 
and degrade us kestenbaum added 
both kestenbaum and rapoport described the shooting deaths of 
palestinians during their tours but had markedly different 
reactions to the killings since the uprising began 266 
palestinians and six israelis have died 
i doubt whether any other army in the world would act with 
more restraint rapoport said adding that he considered the arab 
fatalities in the uprising to be remarkably low given the scale 
of the revolt 
kestenbaum offered this observation about a soldier in his unit 
who killed a palestinian teenager the guy who fired the shots 
was the same guy who spent three days at our training base talking 
of beating up arabs the death didnt really affect him one way 
or the other

punctuated by violence and 
black defiance the campaign for local elections in south africa is 
developing into a highstakes showdown between the government and 
its adversaries 
two powerful challenges from opposite directions threaten to 
foil the governments hopes for political and publicrelations 
triumphs oct 26 when for the first time voters of all races go 
to the polls on the same day 
black antiapartheid clergymen are defying emergency regulations 
by urging a boycott of the elections which they view as an 
entrenchment of segregated whitecontrolled political structures 
among whites the farright conservative party which depicts 
even minimal reforms by the government as surrender to the black 
majority is campaigning vigorously for an intensification of 
apartheid it is favored to win control of most white municipal 
councils in two of the four provinces including transvaal the 
most populous 
president pw bothas national party which rejects black 
participation in national elections says in its campaign leaflets 
that the local elections prove democratic participation for all 
has become a reality 
information minister stoffel van der merwe suggests that the 
turnout among registered black voters could reach 40 percent in 
contrast to about 20 percent in the previous black local elections 
in 1983 
to maximize the turnout the government is spending hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on advertising in a series of print and 
television ads a pair of squirrels discuss the virtues of voting 
billboards in white and black communities bear the slogan you 
can make it happen vote oct 26 
a black newspaper columnist joe latakgomo wrote of the slogan 
nobody has got around to telling me what it is i can make 
happen 
predicting that militants will try to intimidate wouldbe black 
voters the government will allow ballots to be cast in advance by 
virtually anyone who asks to do so critics claim this prior 
vote system could be easily abused to produce fraudulent turnout 
statistics in townships where few voters show up on election day 
roughly half the 26 million blacks are not allowed to vote 
because they are considered citizens of semiautonomous or 
nominally independent homelands hundreds of thousands of other 
blacks are ineligible for other reasons these include residents of 
illegal squatter camps and servants who live at their employers 
homes in white areas 
in some black townships the nomination deadline expired with no 
candidates entering the election in many other townships most 
candidates are running unopposed and will take office for fiveyear 
terms no matter how low the turnout nowhere are prominent black 
antiapartheid activists seeking office 
several major black opposition groups have been banned from 
functioning since february and dozens of activists have been 
detained 
in june the government outlawed calls for election boycotts 
those who do can be sentenced to prison terms as long as 10 years 
a leading black newspaper the sowetan has responded by 
rejecting ads promoting the election 
archbishop desmond tutu of the anglican church has risked 
prosecution by telling blacks that the election is ludicrous and 
will perpetuate your oppression 
unsigned pamphlets distributed in townships denounce blacks 
running for office as a bunch of crooks murderers and highly 
paid apartheid agents who should be met with the peoples 
anger 
one black candidate david nkomo was assassinated in soweto in 
august by two unidentified gunmen earlier assailants threw hand 
grenades at a rally organized by nkomos sofasonke party and 
candidates homes were set afire in the cape province township of 
bhongolethu 
a johannesburg security company is conducting oneday workshops 
in major cities costing the equivalent of nearly 200 per 
participant civil defense and bombdisposal experts provide advice 
on countering the possible increase in terrorist activities 
before the election 
for most of the 5 million whites the drama surrounding the 
black elections is overshadowed by the conservative partys assault 
on the national party which has held power for 40 years 
the conservatives who won 26 percent of the vote in 1987 
general elections believe whites are confused by bothas reform 
program and prefer the clarity of an unabashed prosegregation 
policy 
many analysts predict the conservatives will take control in 
every white municipality in transvaal except johannesburg and a few 
suburbs even pretoria the national capital is expected to be 
lost by the national party

a cat and a mouse first brought bill hanna 
and joe barbera together 50 years ago and a whole menagerie helped 
them become televisions foremost cartoon animators 
we did every frame of the first tom and jerry in 1939 
said barbera then mgm decided we had exhausted all the story 
ideas about a cat and mouse so for the next 20 years all we did 
was turn out tom and jerry cartoons 
the tom and jerry cartoons won seven academy awards more 
than any other series with the same characters jerrys dance with 
gene kelly in anchors aweigh has become a screen classic 
then they folded the animation department and joe and i were 
out of work said hanna we set up our own studio at our homes 
and went to work the first thing we did was ruff and reddy 
in the 30 years since hannabarbera has filled the television 
screen with such animated series as the flintstones yogi 
bear huckleberry hound and friends top cat 
scoobydoo johnny quest the jetsons and animal 
follies fred flintstones yabba dabba doo and yogis 
smarter than the average bear entered the language 
hannabarbera has received eight emmys including the governors 
award of the academy of television arts amp sciences presented last 
month they were awarded a just say no commendation from first 
lady nancy reagan for an abc special last week 
their first effort for television was shown to harry cohn then 
the head of columbia pictures 
we did a pencil test of ruff and reddy said barbera we 
photographed the pencil sketches and screened it for cohn he 
didnt know what a pencil test was he walked out and told an 
assistant to get rid of us fortunately the assistant ignored the 
order and we did 52 shorts for a saturday morning show 
they knew the times had changed when the budget for their first 
television show was 2800 the tom and jerry cartoons had cost 
50000 each 
neither the whitehaired hanna nor the darkhaired barbera had 
set out to be cartoonists hanna studied engineering and journalism 
in his native new mexico he got into animation in 1931 when he 
needed work barbera who grew up in brooklyn first entered 
banking but soon turned his doodles into magazine cartoons and then 
into a job as an animator 
the original name of the flintstones was the flagstones 
but the couple in the hi and lois newspaper comic strip was 
named flagston 
i think it worked out better because the flintstones is a 
better name said barbera when we came up with yogi bear 
they tried to stop us because there was a honeybear on a box of 
cereal we wouldnt have done tom and jerry if wed listened to 
people 
their most widely accepted cartoon series has been the 
flintstones which hanna readily admits was a prehistoric parody 
of jackie gleason and art carney in the honeymooners just as 
yogi bear resembled phil silvers as sgt bilko in youll never 
get rich 
you can read a lot into it said hanna you can compare 
fred and barney rubble with gleason and carney 
barbera added we had a lot of prehistoric and animal gags 
the show really took off when wilma had a baby and we had a contest 
to name the baby the ideal toy co called and asked what the baby 
was going to be i said a boy of course a chip off the old 
rock 
the man from the toy company said if wed make it a girl hed 
give us a lucrative contract for dolls we changed it to a girl on 
the spot we had the contest and the baby became pebbles 
hanna and barbera have selected their personal favorites and 
will release six 90minute videocassettes 
tom and jerry will not be on the videos because the rights 
are owned by turner broadcasting system however the cartoon is 
coming full circle hannabarbera will do a fulllength motion 
picture cartoon of tom and jerry the script has been completed 
and it will go into production in a few years after the studio 
completes a feature film of the jetsons 
yogi bear is now a daily show being syndicated to about 80 
percent of the nation

in this year of the drought millions of 
americans have discovered the fickleness of water supplies its a 
concern that needs to be kept in mind by anyone considering a rural 
residence whether farmer or commuter 
in the last decade or so many longtime city dwellers have moved 
into the sometime greener pastures of rural america 
these relocations can offer many benefits but they also pose 
problems the urbanite may not have thought of with water supplies 
and sewage disposal atop the list 
prospective homeowners need to know about the terrain the 
proximity of the house to other structures and the condition of 
the well and septic system says roger m waller a hydrologist 
with the us geological survey 
if building in an unpopulated area drill a well first he 
advises or if buying an old house find out if the water supply 
is adequate 
rural homeowners sometimes find out too late that the well 
drilled on their land doesnt provide enough water or that what is 
available is of poor quality 
waller is the author of a new booklet ground water and the 
rural homeowner designed to explain the fundamentals of 
undergound water supplies it discusses how water moves through the 
ground the most common types of wells and methods to solve or 
prevent common well and septicsystem problems 
single copies of the 37page booklet are available at no charge 
by writing to the us geological survey books and openfile 
reports section box 25425 denver co 80225 
when considering buying rural property get to know the area 
well and if possible in all weather conditions waller cautions 
try to visit the site under adverse conditions such as during 
heavy rain or meltwater runoff to observe the drainage 
characteristics particularly the condition of the basement he 
says 
it is also important to learn what types of business or other 
activities may have been in the area in the past 
for example waller notes that while orchards are picturesque 
they are often treated with chemicals to prevent disease and insect 
infestation these chemicals eventually settle into the soil and 
can enter the ground water the same type of problems can occur in 
areas previously used for vegetable farms 
in northern areas salt and other chemicals spread on highways 
in the winter can enter the water supply and other potential 
hazards include oil spills natural gas in wells bacteria from 
septic tanks and barnyard runoff and fertilizers 
some mortgage lenders require a negative bacteria test of well 
water before making a loan but even if that isnt required it is 
important to have the test done waller stresses 
also important to the buyer is a well record or log which 
describes the wells characteristics including yield and the type 
of materials that the driller encountered this should include such 
information as well depth water level type of pump pumpintake 
setting and yield 
although potential water problems for the rural homeowner can 
sometimes be expensive pose a health hazard or possibly affect 
real estate values these problems can be avoided by the observant 
informed buyer or owner concluded waller

as a youth loyall newell found a home in the 
pool hall a shaky beginning maybe but what it led to was a 
career as a rare combination of historian artisan and hustler 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
back during the great depression 
loyall newells father thought his son frittered away entirely too 
much time hanging around the pool hall it turns out it wasnt a 
misspent youth after all 
my dad would pay me 30 a week to help out in his garage 
newell recalls i could make that in half a day on a snooker 
table 
at 63 newell still shoots a mean stick as they say over at the 
idle hour where newell had idled away many an hour in his young 
manhood hell still take on anybody in kansas at threecushion 
billiards you name the bet 
it is not his artistry with a cue stick though that has 
brought him the big payoff it is artistry of another kind 
today loyall newell is one of americas leading authorities on 
pool tables and one of only a handful in the land able to restore 
to its original romantic luster one of those heavy old carved and 
inlaid beauties built more than a century ago 
were not talking about just refinishing he says were 
talking about restoring i replace missing parts with original 
parts because i have the parts not many others do then i refinish 
it 
right now hes busy restoring a table that has been in the 
kansas governors mansion for generations and is getting ready to 
restore another that mark twain played on at his home in elmira 
ny newells handiwork decorates private rec rooms and fancy clubs 
in a dozen states 
ironically loyall newells good fortune results from what many 
perceive as a great american misfortune the demise of the family 
farm 
after world war ii when small farmers by the thousands began 
leaving the land for better paying factory jobs rural towns across 
the plains withered and died the local pool hall was often the 
first to board up its windows 
this was happening when i got out of the navy newell 
recalls 
i had a feeling somebody was going to want all those pool 
tables some day so i started buying them up for practically 
nothing besides i just like pool tables those old ones i think 
theyre beautiful historic you might say 
the first ones i bought were four old mahogany tables from a 
place over in geary county i also took all the cues and racks and 
equipment and the back bar and front bar to boot paid 60 for the 
whole shebang some owners gone broke would be glad to take 25 a 
table just to have me cart them away 
i did that all around kansas missouri nebraska oklahoma 
bought out 75 or 80 pool halls it turned out i was right i could 
get 200 or 300 apiece for them depending on the condition from 
people who wanted a fancy table for their homes i put more than 
350 tables in kansas city alone another 75 or 80 in topeka 
it was still only a sideline newell had bought the idle hour 
and ran it along with holding a parttime job in the post office 
then one day in the late 50s an antiques dealer from the west 
coast came through clay center and offered newell 800 for four 
tables newell had picked up for 200 not bad at all quadrupled 
his money 
but newell later learned that the dealer had refinished the 
tables and sold them in los angeles for 3500 each 
there i was with a warehouse full of tables and boxes of 
parts boxes stacked on boxes thats when i decided to get in the 
restoring business not refinishing restoring 
the business grew to more than newell could keep up with he 
sold the idle hour retired from the post office and some years 
ago his son joe quit his job and joined his father in what became 
newell billiard supply co people in the pool table business also 
refer to it as the smithsonian institution of pool halls

that is because along with all those accumulated tables and 
parts newell also has assembled what he believes is the nations 
most complete collection of pool table records and catalogs they 
begin with the first ones put out by brunswickbalkecollender co 
americas oldest and largest manufacturer 
the company changed management half a dozen times and lost 
most of its records in floods and fires newell says so now 
they come to us to answer their inquiries were their official 
consultants 
what happens usually is that somebody will inherit or discover 
an old beatup table with a cracked slate and the brunswick name on 
it 
they ask brunswick whether its worth fixing brunswick refers 
them to us we tell them to take pictures of the end and side 
panels and send us the pictures we tell them what it is and when 
it was made and how much it will cost to restore it 
leafing through the catalogs newell pointed out that there have 
been scores of designs over the years many of them with names like 
war cries nonpareil eclipse monarch exposition the catalogs 
also include specially designed tables for individuals such as 
john d rockefeller and a number of foreign nabobs 
an old monarch table catalog price 475 in 1875 now in top 
condition can fetch as much as 35000 to 50000 
often the price of a restored table reflects not only newells 
skill but the scarcity of antique parts 
heres a bolt he said reaching into a drawer it holds 
the slate to the frame it has 14 threads per inch not 12 not 16 
theyre what came in the original tables and nobody makes exactly 
the same ones nowadays use any other and youll break the slate 
newells shop is a wonderful scene of organized disorder 
redolent with odors of hide glue raw wood and linseed oil the 
smells of creation only two or three restoration projects are on 
the floor at any one time about 85 more tables await rebirth in a 
warehouse work to be done between special orders and sold to any 
bidder 
you never know what sort of person the customer will be 
newell said we fixed up a table for a man in eureka springs 
ark charged him 7140 when i delivered it he paid me in 20 
bills 
newell at his work is a model of patience he does the tedious 
jobs leveling sanding rubbing without complaint in no hurry 
he might take an occasional work break for old times sake and 
shoot a rack of nine ball at the idle hour which happens to be 
right next door 
thanks to his memories of youth and his loving care the idle 
hour appears today just as it did in 1936 when it was built no 
coinoperated pool tables here all classics and a classic bar 
worn silk smooth by elbows 
clay center out in remote northeastern kansas with a population 
of about 5000 is one farm town that hasnt yet gone under and 
boarded up its pool hall it would be like boarding up a shrine 
newell picked up the skills of wood finishing just as he learned 
pool shooting by experimenting asking around discovering some 
tricks of his own 
when i was a boy shining shoes at the idle hour he said 
i used green pool table cloth for that final shine it popped 
nice and did the job 
know what i use now to polish wood my old shoeshine brushes 
yep i still have them i didnt throw them away 
come to think of it he said i dont believe ive ever 
thrown anything away

an irishcatholic with a law degree john loftus 
was moving up in the ranks of the justice department when he joined 
a special unit created to find and deport nazi war criminals living 
in the united states figuring it would help his career but loftus 
became obsessed with the hunt and when his superiors tried to rein 
him in he decided it was time to pursue the investigation on his 
own it was a costly decision 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sometimes john loftus wishes he had 
simply walked out of the classified government vaults 10 years ago 
and turned his back forever on his knowledge of nazis living 
quietly in the united states 
by this time loftus figures he could have been a veteran 
justice department prosecutor or perhaps he might have started a 
lucrative law practice in his home state of massachusetts he 
thinks he might have even spared his wife a disabling injury and 
that he might have been able to keep his spacious rockland home 
instead loftus search into documents showing nazi officers and 
sympathizers smuggled to the west as anticommunist informants led 
to his resignation from a special federal naziprosecution unit in 
1981 thats when he began his oneman probe into the governments 
collaboration with fugitive nazis 
his quest has been costly 
loftus research and travel is barely covered by his magazine 
articles and royalties from his 1982 book the belarus secret 
which chronicles the paths taken to the west by nazis who led the 
massacre of nearly 40000 jews in the byelorussian section of 
eastern europe 
his wife was left partially crippled after a 1983 attack at a 
psychiatric hospital where she had taken a job to help pay bills 
he had to put his home up for sale a kentuckybased fund for 
loftus work doesnt even offset phone bills he says 
god i think often about what it would be like if i just 
walked out of that vault says the 38yearold loftus my 
family would be healthy i wouldnt be constantly on the edge of 
bankruptcy 
but i think if i would have done that i would have been 
ashamed for the rest of my life 
loftus the crusader was once a comfortable insider with a 
steppingstone resume 
like many irishcatholic boys he went from boston latin school 
to jesuitrun boston college where he took political science 
classes with other aspiring attorneys and public servants after 
graduating from suffolk law school in boston in 1977 he accepted 
an honors placement in the justice department 
loftus was moving up the justice department ranks when he 
noticed a posting in 1979 seeking applicants for the office of 
special investigations created to find and deport war criminals 
i joined osi for purely selfish reasons loftus says i 
thought being a nazi prosecutor would be good for my career and i 
might even get a free trip to germany out of it but it was my 
honest feeling that it was a waste of the governments money to 
reopen cases against 60yearold men for crimes committed 40 years 
ago i thought we had more important targets 
i knew nothing about the holocaust like most americans there 
were six sentences about the holocaust and war crimes in all my 
public education 
loftus education began with his first cases he was assigned 
osi files connected to byelorussia or white russia a section of 
the soviet union occupied by the nazis from 1941 to 1944 when 
nearly all jewish natives were exterminated by local nazi 
collaborators 
while researching the cases loftus spent hours studying old 
files in the vaults in suitland md tracking the subjects from 
white russia to the united states many of the paths he learned 
passed through shadowy anticommunist groups established in allied 
nations to coordinate espionage against joseph stalin and the 
rising soviet regime

loftus estimates nearly 10000 nazi officers and sympathizers 
were brought into the united states through intelligence networks 
using the displaced persons act at the height of mccarthyism many 
were given citizenship and have lived openly without recrimination 
nearly 6000 survive he estimates 
in south river nj for example loftus and three other osi 
officials in 1980 checked gravestones near a monument bearing the 
symbol of the belarus ss outfit in white russia ironically loftus 
has become close friends with one of the few surviving byelorussian 
jews who also lives in new jersey 
here is someone living in the shadow of the people who 
murdered his family were not talking about somebody serving 
as a clerk for the nazis or someone who swept out the mess hall or 
some poor kid drafted into the nazi army were talking about 
politicians who climbed to power over the bodies of children 
loftus says the benefit of bringing in the nazis was marginal 
and perhaps even damaging to national security few of those 
sheltered by the intelligence community had actual links to 
underground networks in europe in fact some were soviet 
counteragents he says 
harold kim philby who coordinated many nazi emigrations as 
leader of the antibolshevik bloc of nations defected to the 
soviet union in 1963 as one of the highestplaced moles in western 
intelligence philby 76 died in may in the soviet union 
by late 1980 loftus work was about to be tested he was named 
principal prosecutor of stanislaw stankievich a highranking nazi 
collaborator in the white russian city of borissow who was the 
first to face deportation and loss of citizenship on osi charges 
stankievich died in november 1980 in new york city only weeks 
before his hearing was scheduled to begin 
a frustrated loftus used the court file to probe further into 
the nazirecruiting networks that brought stankievich into the 
united states his research began to irritate osi officials who 
wanted to focus on information directly linked to deportation 
cases loftus says 
i was told to stay out of the vaults he said i knew then 
i would have to pursue this on my own 
in 1981 loftus took down the sign he hung in his justice 
department office wahrheit macht frei truth shall make you 
free taken from the phrase work shall make you free that was 
placed in some nazi concentration camps 
since the stankievich case osi has filed charges against about 
60 alleged nazis and deported about a dozen including karl linnas 
who died in july 1987 in leningrad after being convicted of war 
crimes by a soviet court and john demjanjuk who is appealing his 
death sentence in israel 
people see the holocaust as a jewish issue loftus says 
they dont see the larger covert abuse issue im not a nazi 
hunter now im not a simon wiesenthal im hunting those western 
bureaucrats that recruited them that handful of the 40s and 50s 
who made nuremberg meaningless they created a statute of 
limitations for genocide 
over recent years his reports have included word from south 
american sources that nazi dr josef mengele accused of 
concentration camp atrocities was keeping on the move in south 
america that some people in the vatican had helped nazis flee 
after the war and that several dozen nazis who had worked for 
allied intelligence had been permitted to settle in australia 
loftus recently wrote an article contending that the united 
states and the soviet union stockpiled a deadly nazi nerve gas 
sarin during the cold war and are only now considering its 
destruction 
he is lobbying for a house resolution calling for full 
disclosure of postwar intelligence operations he is also finishing 
work on a book about an irish republican army gunsmuggling 
operation uncovered in boston in 1984 and is researching documents 
from canada and the united kingdom on nazi spy networks 
i think ive learned in the last six years there are three 
great evils in this world communism fascism and indifference

julius lester has written 19 books many for 
children his early works include a paean hymn to black power his 
latest book lovesong caused an academic uproar and his exile 
from the afroamerican studies department at the university of 
massachusetts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
julius lester wrote the book on black 
power in 1968 with a title he meant to be funny look out 
whitey black powers gon get your mama 
the title however was taken seriously by at least one 
newspaper which headlined the story white mamas in danger says 
black militant 
that same year lester was branded an antisemite for having a 
teacher read a students poem on his radio show beginning hey 
jew boy with that yarmulke on your headyou palefaced jew boy i 
wish you were dead 
twenty years later the maverick lester is again provoking 
controversy much of it related to his conversion to judaism 
theres a feeling among some that by becoming a jew i am now 
to be considered a traitor to black people said lester 49 
ive had black people say to me that they dont consider me to be 
black which is news to me since i look in the mirror and very 
clearly im black 
the man who was once in his own words anathema to jews now 
exchanges his cowboy hat on saturdays for a skullcap and prayer 
shawl and leads a conservative synagogue in song 
theres a kind of intellectual climate in black america today 
that really demands a conformity of thought he says if you 
are critical of certain things jesse jackson for example then 
people really treat you like a pariah 
ironically his book about his conversion lovesong has 
made him anathema to another group the afroamerican studies 
department at the university of massachusetts where he has taught 
for 17 years 
in the book published in february lester accused writer james 
baldwin of making antisemitic remarks in a 1984 lecture but 
lester refused to debate the matter with members of the 
afroamerican studies department who said he was misinformed about 
the speech 
colleagues saw the charge as pernicious and called lester in a 
preface to a transcript of baldwins speech that they sent him an 
antinegro negro seeking compulsively to slay the 
birthpeople enemy who exist in his malicious and unforgiving 
imagination 
he will blow in any wind that comes says michael thelwell 
who recruited lester into the department in 1971 thelwell was 
among 15 department members who signed a letter suggesting lester 
would be infinitely more comfortable elsewhere 
at the center of the storm is a lanky longfaced man who loves 
playing pool baking loaves of hallah for sabbath dinners and 
collecting stamps with the youngest of his four children david 9 
i guess i just dont care that much about how i appear to 
others he says sitting crosslegged by a field where david 
plays ball whats important to me is whom does god see when god 
looks at me 
the writings that land lester in such hot water are only a 
sideline to his teaching he says his classes are always 
overbooked and he is the only faculty member to have earned the 
universitys top three teaching awards 
he also is studying to be a cantor and writes childrens books 
which make up more than half of the 19 books he has written so far 
his latest project is the fourth volume of the retelling of joel 
chandler harriss the tales of uncle remus in a modern dialect 
a lot of people just know me for childrens books he says 
chuckling 
lester was born in 1939 to a methodist minister who was a pillar 
of black parishes in tennessee and kansas and who would race away 
from a gas station rather than accept the services of a white man 
who called him boy 
lesters greatgrandfather was a jewish immigrant from germany 
who married an exslave in the late 1800s and built a house that 
stood apart from both the white and black neighborhoods of pine 
bluff ark 
in his will his greatgrandfather pledged his love to his wife 
and wrote that he considered her my true and honest wife 
despite the antimiscegenation laws of the time 
lester grew up a model ministers son learning the bible better 
than some of his teachers 
as a child he was fascinated with kol nidre a hebrew 
melody played on the eve of yom kippur and with shakespeares 
shylock in the merchant of venice he later wrote that he 
identified with shylock in ways he could not with black leaders 
lester graduated from fisk university in 1960 and headed for new 
york even then the lure of judaism was strong although lester 
who has been married twice to whites made a living as a folk 
singer the black spirituals he played failed to move him as 
powerfully as jewish songs did

he eventually joined the increasingly militant student 
nonviolent coordinating committee and in 1968 drew attention 
through publication of look out whitey an exposition of the 
black power principles lester now says hes embarrassed by the 
book 
in my soul i had very serious questions about black power i 
left all of that out because i felt it had to speak for the 
movement the book is honest as far as it goes but is a betrayal 
of my soul he says 
my problems with black power had to do with wondering whether 
it would be different from white power it seemed to me we were 
in danger of becoming more like white people while we were thinking 
we were being different 
on a talk show he led for several years on wbaifm in new york 
he broadcast an antisemitic poem he said to focus on strong 
feelings aroused in some blacks by a struggle with jews over the 
control of schools in brooklyn 
the reading unleashed even stronger feelings it brought death 
threats demonstrations and calls from the jewish defense league 
for his ouster from the station 
so it was with shock that lesters friends and foes read in 
1979 11 years later his article beginning and so jews are 
being used as scapegoats again 
the article criticized black leaders who accused jews of 
pressuring andrew young into resigning as us ambassador to the 
united nations after he met secretly with the palestine liberation 
organizations representative to the united nations against us 
policy 
those leaders lester wrote merely show that blacks too can 
be germans 
lester who by then had been teaching at the university of 
massachusetts for nine years nearly ended up in a fistfight with a 
professor over the article he stopped attending department 
meetings 
the young episode was followed in 1985 by an article criticizing 
jesse jackson for his race for power and whites for overlooking 
his hymietown gaffe 
an unfortunate legacy of the 60s has been an almost total 
moral abdication on the part of whites where anything black is 
concerned he wrote 
the final straw for his departmental colleagues came in 
lovesong with lesters account of baldwin and the jews lester 
wrote that baldwin somehow held jews responsible for the outcry 
over the hymietown remark later he conceded that might have 
been a misinterpretation 
he had also written that he knew that baldwin was not an 
antisemite but his remarks in class were antisemitic and he 
does not realize it 
a month after the books publication a department meeting was 
called to talk about the charge soon the letter suggesting 
lesters transfer was on its way to the dean of humanities 
we have nothing against his judaism department chairman 
chester davis told the amherst bulletin but when one develops a 
vicious attitude toward blacks and black organizations jackson 
baldwin and civil rights there is some question as to the 
appropriateness of remaining 
chancellor joseph duffey termed the meeting an inquisition 
and said it raised questions about lesters academic freedom 
professor thelwell said the book raised questions about his 
professional standards 
there is no issue of academic freedom thelwell said in a 
prepared statement elements of the media and the academy created 
one in order to vent an ugly racist bias see weve always known 
that these black academics are culturally and intellectually 
deficient crude nationalist ideologues with no tolerance for or 
understanding of the nuances of civilized discourse and the 
protocols of free inquiry without the lowered intellectual 
standards caused by affirmative action they would not even be in a 
university 
a faculty committee that investigated found no evidence lesters 
academic freedom had been violated by his transfer to the judaic 
studies department which both parties agreed to 
the appointment is for one year chairman shmuel bolozky says 
making lester a permanent member of the department would be 
tantamount to putting him in a straitjacket lester himself a 
man not fond of artificial boundaries would rather be free to 
teach without departmental confinement

as a youngster she wanted to be jane goodall 
when she grew up or maybe a park ranger zoo keeper or horse 
trainer like her husband she wound up as a schoolteacher but not 
for long genny and lee barhaugh figure they have the ideal job 
running a dude ranch in the wilds of montana 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
genny barhaugh was a proper massachusetts 
preppie in her teen years studying hard with hopes of going on to 
radcliffe today shes an experienced wrangler and ranch cook and 
unofficial armwrestling champion of great falls 
she feels she has the best job in the world 
genny and her husband lee both 33 and both former 
schoolteachers manage the pine butte guest ranch a small 
nonprofit dude ranch owned by the nature conservancy and 
surrounded by wilderness 18000 acres managed by the conservancy 
and an additional 1009356 acres in the bob marshall wilderness 
preserve 
its the largest wild expanse in the contiguous 48 states and 
the pine butte swamp technically a fen is the largest wetland 
complex along the eastern slope of the rockies and one of the last 
strongholds of the grizzly bear 
its also home to bobcats mountain lions wolverines badgers 
foxes coyotes and deer virtually every mammal native to montana 
as well as hundreds of species of birds falcons eagles and hawks 
the winters are bleak as the chinooks indian for snow eaters 
howl outside for days on end the winds which are warm melt the 
snow and may bring the temperature up by 30 to 40 degrees in a 
given day everything adapts the pine trees are called limber pine 
because they give with the wind but all are stunted and twisted 
from its constancy 
genny and lee dont really get a day off from may 1 until nov 
1 they spend their sundays hauling guests to and from the great 
falls airport a 90minute drive the rest of the week genny is up 
at 6 am to oversee the cooking of breakfast she doesnt get back 
to her home until 8 or 830 pm 
the ranch accommodates up to 25 guests in nine rustic cabins 
each with fireplace private bath and handmade furniture in 
season the 595 per person per week includes airport 
transportation three familystyle meals a day with homemade 
breads and fresh vegetables bought from a nearby hutterite 
community 
two trail rides a day and a variety of naturalist programs are 
also included for the hardy there are treks led by a naturalist 
to sites of dinosaur eggs down into a fen up to a beaver pond 
high on to hills off to a swamp where birders can see up to 130 
species each evening a naturalist gives a talk or a slide show in 
the main lodge 
or the less athletic there is a heated swimming pool a center 
with a few fossils and some nice easy trails to wander alone 
through the aspen cottonwood and firs 
after labor day the horses are gone and the price drops to 450 
a week 
genny is paid 12000 a year her husband 16000 
were obviously not in this for the money she jokes 
she spent last winter sending out brochures and getting the 
cabins booked for the summer 
in the winter the chinooks which can blow up to 70 mph 
sometimes keep her cabinbound for up to five days 
i feel the elements are making some kind of statement she 
says i feel the winds are saying this is supposed to be a wild 
place i feel that maybe i shouldnt be here 
i get depressed but when its over and im outside again im 
fine 
genny who was disillusioned as a teacher by the students lack 
of motivation and discipline problems says i feel like i have a 
very wide mix of skills and here im using them to the best of my 
ability 
as a youngster genny wanted to be jane goodall when she grew 
up or maybe a park ranger zoo keeper or horse trainer 
it was all rather nebulous but i somehow knew i wanted to be 
involved with animals she says but it was a family tradition 
to go to prep school so the native of st clair mich daughter 
of a salt company executive was sent to abbot a massachusetts 
prep school now absorbed by andover 
i really studied hard but then i realized my dream was not in 
the east she says 
so she headed west and the preppie became a head wrangler a 
ranch hand who chopped and hauled wood with the men a ranch cook 
a schoolteacher a journalist 
on one of her previous jobs where she was head cook for 100 
people there was a grizzly with two cubs very close to the camp 
genny had to walk 150 yards in the darkness to get breakfast going 
there were a couple of saint bernards at the camp and i always 
took one of them with me she says not that he would have done 
much good but he made me feel better 
lee and i had great dreams of someday getting our own guest 
ranch but we didnt know where we would get that much capital 
then we heard the nature conservancy was looking and it sounded 
like such a dream we couldnt let it go 
they got the job sold their house and genny moved out to the 
ranch with her infant daughter laney lee a high school teacher 
had to finish the school term 
laney is now an energetic 2yearold with no qualms about 
climbing aboard a horse with her mother 
lee a native of casper wyo is not the equestrian his wife 
is genny who has owned her own horse off and on since she was in 
the sixthgrade has competed in riding competitions 
jenny spent one year at the university of oregon dropped out to 
tour the west with two friends in a volkswagen then got two 
degrees one in zoology from the university of montana and one in 
english from montana state 
jenny laughs at the female armwrestling title announced by her 
boastful husband 
its really unofficial she says i pride myself on being 
strong but this was at a party all the women began arm wrestling 
and i won it may also have something to do with the fact that i 
was the only sober person at the party

it all started out of concern for the loon now 
a wisconsin couple is into publishing fulltime spreading the word 
about the wonders of nature but tom and pat klein insist they are 
not crusaders theyre just running a business as tom klein puts 
it nobody wants to pay to be preached at 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
she was a former girl scout who loved to 
hike in northern woods he grew up boating and fishing and became 
director of an environmental education institute 
now tom and pat klein are trying to spread the word about the 
wonders of the land from northern california to northern new 
england with northword press inc 
the 4yearold publishing house is tucked away in a pinecovered 
area about 200 miles north of madison amid the lakes loons and 
other wildlife that are subjects of the books the husbandandwife 
team publish 
tom klein 40 northwords editorinchief and author of two of 
the companys three dozen titles said he doubted the couple could 
do its work with the same level of credibility in a big city 
i think wed quickly lose touch with our sources and the 
spiritual feel of what were about klein says 
most of their books carry an ecological message and photographs 
to inspire readers to help preserve the wilderness but the kleins 
say they are not crusaders 
i came into this with a lot of conservation crusading zeal 
but we were trying to start a business klein says nobody 
wants to pay to be preached at so you really have to work it into 
the text 
the naturalists began their publishing firm with loon magic 
a 160page coffeetable book by klein filled with color pictures 
of the darkheaded bird with the highpitched quivering call of 
the wilderness 
klein had been director of the sigurd olson environmental 
institute at northland college in ashland and was a founder of 
wisconsin project loon watch an effort begun in 1978 to monitor 
the loon population and educate lakearea landowners about the 
birds 
he wrote the book after hundreds of people at the scores of 
lectures he gave to wisconsin groups asked him where they could get 
more information about the bird 
research journals included a few paragraphs on the diving birds 
but most of the loon knowledge was still in the heads of 
researchers who hadnt put it on paper klein says so he decided 
to write a book a layman could understand using information 
gleaned from experts and people such as an alaskan bush pilot who 
had spent years counting loons on his own 
we were sure we had a best seller says mrs klein 41 who 
left her job as a sales coordinator for a picture framing company 
to launch the publishing firm originally known as paper birch press 
in 1984 
the 40 book has become the flagship publication of the firm 
with more than 60000 copies sold since june 1985 
with the purchase of two smaller madison publishers the 
northword name and additional titles the company grew it had 15 
million in sales last year klein says 
originally the couple intended to publish one book and go back 
to other jobs but they realized they did not want to waste what 
they had learned in publishing the first book mrs klein says 
what ive been astounded by is the opportunity to do the same 
kind of education work i was doing in a nonprofit organization in 
a forprofit company klein says he says the company made a 
very modest profit last year 
to sell their first book the couple sent flyers to people on 
mailing lists of conservation and nature groups they marched 
through shopping malls trying to persuade individual bookstore 
managers to stock the book or ask their corporate buyers to order 
it 
now northword is just big enough to deal directly with the 
large bookstore chains such as b dalton and waldenbooks klein 
says about 30 independent commission sales representatives also 
market northword books to independent bookstores and several 
mailorder catalogs carry the books 
but the company still does about 3 percent of its sales to 
people responding to direct mailings or magazine advertisements 
klein says 
northword will spend about 100000 in advertising and 
promotions this fall most of it for fullpage color advertisements 
in magazines published by groups such as the audubon society 
sierra club and wilderness society he says 
in september the company is introducing several new titles 
including a 160page book on the white wolf by jim brandenburg who 
spent four months photographing an arctic wolf pack on ellesmere 
island about half of the 60000 copies in the first printing had 
been sold a month before its release klein says 
pages from another new release kleins chronicle of the border 
country in the queticosuperior wilderness between the united 
states and canada decorate the walls of northwords offices in 
minocqua 
klein hoped the book would give people who have enjoyed the area 
a deeper appreciation for its history and fragility 
the business has kept klein away from the extended canoe trips 
he once enjoyed and has prevented mrs klein from hiking and 
jogging as much as she would like 
but klein who sits on the board of the wisconsin chapter of the 
nature conservancy said he enjoys just wallowing in the 
content of the books they publish 
i think its the perfect situation his advocation is also his 
vocation its something we all would ideally love to do says 
mark peterson a friend of the kleins who succeeded tom as 
institute director in late 1985 
the kleins moved their business from ashland where it began in 
their home to this northcentral wisconsin town of about 3500 
last spring 
mrs klein a milwaukee native who spent summers camping in 
northern wisconsin said the couple wanted to live on the inland 
lakes where they could hear the call of the loon 
they live about 15 miles from the office at a home on lake 
flambeau where they spend their weekends and evenings 
sailboarding and fishing 
we watch eagles ospreys and loons seven days a week from our 
porch says klein a sun prairie native who grew up in a family 
that sold boats and outdoor equipment 
klein met his wife after the two both applied for the same job 
for a nonprofit health group a job tom held for a while before 
marrying pat in 1974 and heading north

i have box seats behind the batting cage for the yankee 
games she says 
whitton grew up in philadelphia where she fell in love with 
reading at an early age 
i still love to turn off the phone and curl up with a good 
book she says im not really sure why i turned to acting 
even now i think its a borrowed imbalance i cant focus on it 
one of my memories as a kid was that i wanted to be a jockey i 
wanted to be an ikette with tina turner i wanted to be a 
journalist at one point a writer i was always writing stories as 
a kid 
i think acting was just a way for me to realize all the 
fantasies in my head i think of actors essentially as greedy 
people who want to live a lot of lives maybe its some memory 
she broke into acting on the new york stage both off and on 
broadway between roles she worked as a dog walker her first 
television appearances were on the soap operas the doctors and 
one life to live 
i still consider myself a new york actress she says you 
can mess it up at the evening show you can try anything at the 
matinee but with film once its in the can you cant change it 
the soaps subsidized my stage work 
her first primetime series was hometown which cbs aired in 
the 198586 season it was a sort of thirtysomething before its 
time the pilot script by julie and dinah kirgo had been around for 
a while but it wasnt until the big chill became a hit movie 
that cbs agreed to put it on the air 
in the best of times she worked with robin williams and 
kurt russell she played the hooker who parked her trailer on the 
county line and took credit cards robin was the only person ive 
ever worked with who broke me up she says id blow a take 
hes got a hot line to gods funny bone 
she was also in 9 weeks national lampoon goes to the 
movies and love child she was michael j foxs amorous aunt 
in the secret of my success i seduced him endlessly she 
says 
she describes louise her role in a fine romance as a woman 
who doesnt have all her sensors on 
shes very beguiling but in a manipulative way she says 
she flies by the seat of her pants and ends up in these 
situations louise is a person to whom things happen you can go in 
all directions with her 
the romance with anthony will be prickly just like in real 
life he cant resist her he thinks he wants the staid stolid 
english life but hes attracted to louise against his will and 
better judgment the humor is so offthewall im surprised abc 
went for it 
the pilot for a fine romance has already been televised on 
london weekend television there its called a ticket to ride 
which is the name of the travel show in the series in which whitton 
and andrews are the hosts

every time someone he knew died of aids 
playwright larry kramer would write the name on a small piece of 
paper and throw it into a large box when he finally counted the 
slips he discovered he had more than 500 
thats what fuels me he says all that memory and all 
that sadness and all that anger i really dont know why im 
alive 
eight years into the aids epidemic kramer is fighting on the 
front lines on the street and in the theater 
looking around at the people who are alive we all react in 
either one way or the other he says one is denial people 
just go on with their lives and try not to think about it or there 
are people who turn into walking furies like me 
on the street kramer cofounded the gay mens health crisis and 
later formed act up aids coalition to unleash power we protest 
everywhere he says proudly pointing to a photograph of his 
arrest in front of the white house 
the passion carries into the plays he writes the normal 
heart produced by the new york shakespeare festival in 1985 was 
one of the first aids plays to reach a mainstream theater audience 
the play which starred brad davis as a hotheaded gay activist not 
unlike kramer was a defiant cry a shout against bureaucratic and 
personal paralysis in the face of the devastating disease 
now he has written another play just say no which he says 
is not an aids play although it deals peripherally with the 
disease kramer calls his new play farcical its meant to make 
audiences laugh 
while a farce just say no is a very angry play kramer 
says its really another attempt to do what i did in the normal 
heart which is to bring shocking conditions to the attention of 
the public 
the setting for just say no on view at offbroadways tiny 
wpa theater is georgetown the capital of a mythical country 
called new columbia where a mrs potentate a more than just first 
lady reigns supreme other characters include her ballet dancer 
son as well as the mayor of appleberg the largest northeastern 
city in new columbia theatergoers are free to draw the obvious 
connections 
its all been checked by lawyers the playwright says with a 
sigh so many times 
kramer sits in his bookfilled greenwich village apartment his 
dog molly my muse he calls her sits at his feet as he 
talks about just say no 
its political theater the author says i guess it goes 
back to what they did in berlin in the 1920s it deals with 
contemporary public issues i dont know if people 10 or 15 years 
from now will know most of the references its very much of the 
moment i love dealing with the immediacy of today 
before working in the theater kramer spent much of his career 
in the movie industry as an executive at columbia pictures and 
united artists he produced and adapted dh lawrences women in 
love for the screen and was nominated for an academy award 
has he always been an iconoclast 
i dont know he says i think thats the reputation i 
have now because of the normal heart and all my aids activities 
i write a lot of aids blasts 
what im interested in is gossip as life exposing hypocrisy 
and sham and trying to tell the world the things the world doesnt 
know or want to know 
the normal heart was turned down by every major play agent 
in new york all the networks and more than a halfdozen producers 
until joseph papp decided to put it on at the shakespeare festival 
just say no was no easier to bring to the stage says 
kramer it got a faster reading everywhere but the play scared 
everybody just as much as the normal heart did people say it is 
outrageous in every sense of the term they either love it or hate 
it 
just say no was to have been produced by the shakespeare 
festival as a commercial offering but legal problems because of 
the festivals nonprofit status forced it to bow out however 
kyle renick artistic director of the wpa had an opening on his 
fall schedule 
the play was written about 18 months ago but kramer got caught 
up in his aids activism and put it aside he says it should have 
been done earlier and wants it on before the presidential elections 
kramer says his anger has made him unbelievably productive he 
has written another play a serious companion piece to the 
normal heart as well as the screenplay for the normal heart 
he also has a book coming out in february called reports from the 
holocaust the making of an aids activist 
its holocaust with a small h kramer says and the book 
contains about 400 pages of writing he has done on aids for various 
publications as well as about 100 new pages explaining why he 
believes the aids epidemic can be called a holocaust 
you cant be a gay man in new york without really being 
swamped by aids the 53yearold kramer says ive never seen 
such a major problem being handled by secondrate people and thats 
across the board from mr reagan obviously mr koch obviously 
but all of the people in all of the agencies from health and human 
services to fda to nih to cdc 
does kramer want to write about anything else 
there is absolutely nothing else thats of any interest to 
me he says i feel a responsibility to write about aids so 
that there is a record of it or at least my version of the record 
of it

swimming children giggle a breeze stirs 
the eucalyptus and paolo borsellino tries to forget the murder and 
corruption that are the focus of his daily work 
but a gloom that has enveloped italys war against the mafia 
follows the graying magistrate like a cloud even as he relaxes 
outside his beachfront vacation home 
a certain weariness has overcome palermo he says staring 
broodingly at the purple sicilian hills today the commitment to 
fight the mafia isnt as strong as before 
government and police officials in the sicilian capital express 
similar feelings they speak of blocked investigations of 
political indifference of threats to those who take on the mob 
the problem has grown so serious that italys president 
francesco cossiga recently demanded an inquiry into investigations 
in palermo headquarters of the mafia and its multibilliondollar 
drug trade 
shortly thereafter giovanni falcone italys top mafia 
investigator submitted his resignation saying working conditions 
were impossible 
while some blame weariness for the investigative problems 
others see the corrupting hand of the mafia 
today in these months there is a new effort by the dark 
force to reappropriate the city declares the rev ennio 
pintacuda a jesuit priest who advises the palermo government 
the case has alarmed the national government which has 
appointed a new mafia commissioner it also has raised concern at 
the us justice department which conducts joint investigations of 
the mafia with italian officials 
without falcone our efforts are really going to be 
hampered says one justice department official speaking only on 
condition of anonymity 
at the center of the crisis are a group of investigating 
magistrates who in the italian legal system draw up indictments 
using police and judicial methods they often work alone 
falcone borsellino and his colleagues instead formed a pool so 
that the mafia could not as in the past kill off a case by 
killing off an investigator 
in the five years since the magistrates intensive teamwork has 
paid off with evidence not only about the mafias local operation 
but its business in europe and the united states as well 
it culminated in 338 convictions this past december in the 
maxitrial of mafia members accused of murder robbery and drug 
trafficking to the us east coast 
it also contributed to the 18 convictions in the pizza 
connection trial of heroin suppliers who used american pizza 
parlors as fronts 
but since january when italys superior council of magistrates 
chose 68yearold judge antonino meli to head the antimafia 
pool a split has developed in the unit the council passed over 
the 49yearold falcone ruling he was too young 
a few months after meli took over the system was changed 
completely says borsellino who left the team last year 
the new director began sending mafia cases to judges outside the 
pool and assigning nonmafia cases to pool members he says 
we are returning to the system of the 60s in which each 
judge did his job and no one knew what anyone else was doing and 
no one had a global view of the mafia asserts borsellino 
he complained publicly in july and the italian president ordered 
an investigation a week later falcone resigned and his pool 
colleagues threatened to follow 
we feel we are in danger of losing a way of coordination in 
the fight against the mafia that brought optimal results says 
pool member gioacchino natoli 
melis office said he would not comment on the accusations in 
his few public remarks he has said he spread cases among different 
judges to increase the level of experience 
the other magistrates say meli with little experience in mafia 
investigations does not realize the importance of specialization 
other people insist the problem is political influence 
it could be that instead of direct pressure its an 
environment created by that part of the city that says the mafia is 
not a danger says pintacuda in that group are also 
politicians 
on sept 14 the superior council of magistrates concluded that 
no one had tried to remove the pool from mafia cases but it also 
endorsed the pools working methods 
even if the magistrates remain the split in the judiciary has 
hurt 
tommaso buscetta a key mafia informer said he would not make 
further disclosures while the judges were divided important 
investigations have languished according to us officials 
in natolis office next to a window with double rows of 
bulletproof glass hang plaques from the fbi the us drug 
enforcement administration and the new york city police department 
when all the institutions have worked together we have had 
splendid results says the 41yearold natoli 
the judges difficulties he adds have been exacerbated by a 
decline in support from such institutions as the police and 
parliament in rome 
it was parliament that provided the key to many past successes 
against the mafia in 1982 it established a new crime that of 
mafia association and allowed inspection of suspects bank records 
but there has been no movement on judges requests for a witness 
protection program or a provision to reduce informers sentences 
there have been moments in which it has appeared the state 
would resolve the problem natoli says fingering his goldframed 
glasses later it is always set aside 
more problematic he adds has been the police situation the 
detective unit that formerly handled mafia investigations has been 
destroyed by two mafia assassinations and the arrests of several 
officers in the death of one of the suspected assassins 
one of the last members of the unit francesco accordino was 
recently transferred after receiving death threats reportedly 
traced to a police telephone 
the threats to italys war on organized crime have come just as 
the antimafia pool was beginning to focus on politicians 
links to the mafia some say the timing is no coincidence 
when judges limit themselves to trying mafia chief michele 
greco fine says carmine mancuso a police inspector who also 
heads a citizens group to rally popular support against the mafia 
the problem begins when falcone and the others begin to talk 
about political investigations 
the wail of sirens has increased this summer in palermo 
magistrates and government officials speed past in police 
motorcades authorities recently increased security for those 
active in the war on the mafia even assigning bodyguards to two 
priests 
at borsellinos house a bodyguard in sunglasses and a pink 
opennecked shirt relaxes on a lounge chair his large black pistol 
hidden in a folded newspaper 
society has paid a terribly high price for the war on the 
mafia borsellino says this has created a climate of 
weariness 
mayor leoluca orlando of palermo says the public hasnt lost 
heart and he notes the government has responded to the crisis by 
naming a prominent antiterrorism investigator domenico sica as 
the mafia commissioner and increasing his investigative powers 
the state made a strong effort during the maxitrial 
orlando says the message was clear we must recover that clarity 
to move forward

in a little mudbrick room on the ruins of 
old nimrud north of baghdad an ordinarylooking engishwoman 
retired each day from the fierce assyrian sun to plot murder 
locals on the archaeological dig knew the woman as mrs 
mallowan a photographer but the books she wrote in the crude 
little room bore another name 
agatha christie 
as her archaelogist husband sir max mallowan helped chart the 
dawn of history in the desert hills miss christie sat among 
mesopotamian relics and conjured cases for the fictional detectives 
of her mystery novels 
her years after world war ii at nimrud one of the great cities 
of the assyrian empire in 1400600 bc capped decades of middle 
eastern travel and archaeological work that left traces scattered 
throughout her 77 books 
miss christie first arrived in the middle east in 1907 aged 17 
for her debutante season in cairo egypt 
we spent three months there and i went to five dances every 
week she recalled in an autobiography in 1965 
she later set at least two novels in egypt death on the 
nile and death comes as the end a tale of love and murder in 
the thebes of 2000 bc 
a deeper relationship with the area began in the 1930s when she 
took the orient express across europe to turkey and continued on by 
train and car across the wild syrian desert to baghdad 
there she met mallowan they spent most of the next 20 years 
bouncing between britain and archaeological digs in iraq and syria 
she was very unprepossessing to look at said the iraqi 
writer and critic jabra ibrahim jabra who first met her in 1949 
she was a very charming woman to talk to very attentive 
with a dry sense of humor you wouldnt know she was the great 
agatha christie 
jabra said she lived with mallowan in the former home of king 
ali on the bank of the tigris river the house and its surroundings 
made a cameo appearance in her 1951 spy novel they came to 
baghdad 
there was the persistent honking of motor horns the cries of 
vendors of various wares there were hot disputes between small 
groups of people who seemed ready to murder each other but were 
really fast friends 
all of that seems true today although the donkeys horses and 
mudbrick homes she described in the book are rapidly giving way to 
brazilianmade volkswagens and concrete highrises 
the dusty bouncing road to babylon she recounts in that novel 
is now a smooth highway 
and the meaningless pile of ruined mud and burnt brick she 
found there has been resurrected into a freshly whitewashed 
reconstruction of king nebuchadnezzars 6th century bc capital 
baghdads rashid street is still a major downtown thoroughfare 
as it was when miss christie first visited although some of its 
fancier buildings have decayed 
the tigris palace hotel where miss christie stayed still stands 
although she would never recognize the remodeled and cutrate ibn 
haitham as the graceful hotel that figured in her 1935 book 
murder in mesopotamia 
british and american expatriates in baghdad still gather weekly 
in a playreading circle that claims miss christie as an early 
member 
archaeologists at the british expedition office in baghdad say 
some of their furnishings are rumored to have once graced her 
living room 
her mudbrick workroom still stands at nimrud although its now 
used as a storage room 
the creator of the prim and proper miss marple has even had the 
honor of a banned book her remembrances of life on the digs 
come tell me how you live was blocked by iraqi censors 
because it was considered to be derogatory 
miss christie is still remembered at the charming but decrepit 
barons hotel in aleppo syria where she reportedly worked on 
several books 
but the owners of the orient palace hotel in damascus the 
syrian capital where she stayed on her first visit to the region 
did not recall her 
the onceelegant hotel still has the marble floors and dim 
lights she described but paint peels from the hallway walls and 
portraits of irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini peer sternly out 
from the front windows 
the orient palace now accommodates the families of iranians 
killed in the war with iraq who are flown to damascus on statepaid 
vacations 
the nabatean ruins at petra in jordan backdrop for 
appointment with death are no longer as miss christie wrote 
a full days motor run across the desert from amman the 
kingdoms capital 
but petra itself as real as as raw beef she described 
it remains the same 
writercritic jabra said most of miss christies books are about 
the english in a foreign country and had little to do with the 
locals 
her geographical descriptions are quite good but her contact 
with iraqis was limited he said 
but he added she was very wellliked by iraqis who knew her 
she returned that affection in her autobiography 
how much i have loved that part of the world she wrote i 
love it still and i always shall

in case you were crying your eyes out because 
the networks are losing their audience to cable and videocassettes 
the new fall schedule will make you dry up real fast 
playing it safe seems to be the name of the game for the 
networks in the 198889 television season 
nbc will win the season its fourth in a row with help from the 
summer olympics followed in october by the world series so no 
wonder its schedule is filled with spinoffs clones and ripoffs 
but you cant say much more for abc and cbs 
abc long ago committed to war and remembrance the last of 
the bigtime miniseries and sequel to the winds of war will 
start doling out the 30hour monster with an 18hour dose in 
november 
war and remembrance wasnt supposed to be on until february 
its early scheduling is one remnant of the fourmonth writers guild 
strike that will put an asterisk next to the 198889 television 
season the traditional fall preview that normally comes in late 
september has been strewn from early october until late december 
other vestiges of the strike are nbcs unsolved mysteries a 
cheap infotainment series and abcs incredible sunday a 
reincarnation of thats incredible both shows are considered 
informational and werent affected by the writers strike so 
they could go into production when the networks werent sure how 
long the strike would last 
also in response to the strike delay abc slapped together a new 
mission impossible to fill in until a fine romance comes 
on midseason while a recreated police story will fill for 
the new saturday mystery movie also delayed until midseason 
some new shows were written well before the writers strike so 
they have no excuse 
since viewers were too lazy last season to tune out the witless 
a different world spinoff that nbc slotted right after the 
cosby show nbc is trying that gambit again with empty nest 
which takes place in the two golden girls neighborhoods miami 
and saturday nights baby boom is a spinoff of the movie of the 
same name 
nbcs only immediate winner is dear john which reunites 
likable taxi star judd hirsch and taxi creator ed 
weinberger nbc has given it a cushy thursday night timeslot 
moving the degenerated night court to wednesday 
tattingers is an offbeat comedydrama about a 
handsomebuttough restaurateur and his socialite exwife it comes 
from the makers of st elsewhere and the characters are 
engaging though the show needs to find its voice 
abc seems to have the lead in development after putting on the 
fine thirtysomething last season and adding the wonder 
years in the spring the two shows won emmys in their categories 
abc also added china beach a classy drama about women in the 
vietnam war 
this year abc starts the season with one sure winner 
roseanne a sitcom with something to say from the producers of 
nbcs biggest hit ever the cosby show 
abcs knightwatch is murky film noir set around a guardian 
angelstype law enforcement group abcs murphys law casts 
george segal as a seedy insurance investigator in a plodding crime 
drama 
abc is guarding its secondplace finish of last season by 
playing it safe bringing back peter falk as columbo in the 
saturday mystery movie midseason the other two movies that 
will rotate with columbo are untested vehicles starring 
respectively burt reynolds and louis gossett jr 
cbs third in the nielsens last season seems to be trying 
murphy brown a sophisticated comedy starring candice bergen as 
a tv reporter who just got off the bottle shows promise and has a 
decent time slot on monday night almost grown is an ambitious 
study of a baby boomer couple over three decades 
but cbs also fell into nostalgia by teaming dick van dyke and 
mary tyler moore in separate shows on wednesday night moores 
show still untitled is underdeveloped the producers were so 
unhappy with van dykes pilot that it had to be redone critics 
have yet to see it 
cbs was also inspired by a popular movie and made dirty 
dancing into a series its pilot too is being redone and hasnt 
been previewed

the public broadcasting service a steady 
customer of british programming in the past is keeping most new 
programming on this side of the atlantic in 198889 unfortunately 
the result would seem to suggest were not very entertaining over

but none of it is going to bring floods of new viewers to public 
television except perhaps for the one baldfaced attempt to lure 
commercial network audiences a special on the making of nbcs hit

madefortv movies based on a true story are 
coming so close on the heels of the real event that maybe well 
soon just have the movie and skip the event world war iii 
available now on video 
liberace died only last year but abc and cbs are ready to air 
madefortv movies based on his life in early october 
last october jessica mcclure dropped down a well in midland 
texas her story will be on abc this season ryan white the 
hemophiliac teenager with aids is still in the news but his 
ordeal with a town that shunned him will be made for tv this 
season so will the story of david the boy whose father set 
him afire in a custody dispute five years ago 
the space shuttle program is still struggling to recover from 
the challenger explosion but the disaster is supposed to come to 
the small screen this season as a docudrama also on abc by 
comparison the final days an abc dramatization of the bob 
woodwardcarl bernstein book about the end of richard nixons 
presidency looks like ancient history 
cbs apparently wasnt as quick to grab up recent true stories 
so it will go back as far as singer karen carpenter who died from 
complications of anorexia the eating disorder for one 
biographical movie another truelife cbs movie concerns a doctor 
who was the first to detect aids in children 
cbs jack the ripper is based on a true story that became 
the stuff of much fancy and legend another factbased historical 
movie is day one about the manhattan project and the race to 
build an atomic bomb 
in the area of fiction cbs has larry mcmurtrys novel 
lonesome dove which will be an eighthour miniseries one of 
the longer ones these days 
this season may mark the end of the era of superlong bigevent 
miniseries which actually seemed to end with amerika but abc 
has had a longterm commitment to herman wouks war and 
remembrance the 30hour sequel to the winds of war eighteen 
hours of the miniseries will air in november 
abcs roots kunta kintes gift reunites levar burton kunta 
kinte and louis gossett jr fiddler in a question for freedom 
that will air around christmas 
nbc which has a strong regular series lineup and no new ideas 
other than ripping off already successful ventures offers not 
surprisingly little of excitement in movies and miniseries 
although they do provide offseason projects for nbc series stars 
pierce brosnan remington steele stars in a sixhour remake 
of around the world in 80 days harry hamlin la law 
stars in favorite son a political drama 
christopher reeve no nbc credit judd hirsch dear john 
anthony denison crime story and charles haid hill street 
blues star in the great escape the final chapter 
to its credit though nbc does have in development with no 
air date set and the band played on randy shilts highly 
praised nonfiction account of the political medical and social 
ramifications of aids another worthy nbc project is selma lord 
selma from the producers of the cosby show a factbased 
drama about the civil rights movement in alabama as seen through 
the eyes of two young girls

roseanne gets a primo time period amid abcs 
hit tuesday night lineup but even without the vip treatment it 
deserves to be a hit 
roseanne is from the same people who created the cosby 
show although roseanne and her brood are certainly no cosby 
family this is why some animals eat their young cracks 
roseanne barr after breaking up yet another squabble among her 
boisterous offspring 
barr a standup comic who does housewife humor cut with feminist 
and bluecollar politics plays roseanne parker the toughtalking 
mama of two prepubescent daughters and a son she works in a 
plastics factory with a crew of lovable misfits including her 
sister a sucker always signing up for the latest getrichquick 
seminar whats this one dare to be a millionaire roseanne 
inquires when her sister pitches the latest one 
john goodman raising arizona true stories is perfect 
as roseannes husband dan a huggable bear of a guy he quickly 
proves he can hold his own against his funny snide gumpopping 
costar 
is there coffee he asks when he makes his entrance at 
breakfast 
roseanne regards him with disbelief isnt there always 
coffee 
he pauses suspiciously cautious yeeessss 
in the 15 years that we been married have you ever come down 
in the morning and there wasnt any coffee 
hes still careful noooo 
then why do you always ask is there coffee 
pause is there toast 
lecy goranson plays becky the boycrazy daughter sara gilbert 
is darlene the tomboy laurie metcalf is roseannes sister 
jackie natalie west is gullible coworker crystal george clooney 
plays the handsome plant foreman booker 
in the premiere episode roseanne gets stuck with all the kids 
errands after working her fulltime job because dan an independent 
contractor says hell be busy putting in a bid on a job when it 
turns out he ended up at a friends house goofing off roseanne 
goes on a rampage about shared responsibilities just like in real 
life the conflict isnt resolved 
roseanne is not married with children the fox show 
about sniping unhappy marrieds and their ungrateful children 
though theyre never sentimental roseanne and her husband love 
each other and the show besides being a very entertaining comedy 
also pays tribute to the unheralded working class and the brave 
struggle to raise a family

in abcs new drama knightwatch its hard to 
tell who the good guys are 
that seems to be the point of the premiere of this murky film 
noir about a guardian angelstype group whose members aspire to 
defend citizens on the mean streets of new york but who 
occasionally go over the bounds of accepted law enforcement 
practices as when one of them throws a suspect off a building 
eventually it becomes apparent that the knights are indeed the 
good guys even if they are struggling a bit in their search for a 
meaningful value system amid the squalor of their ghetto 
neighborhood 
in the premiere episode a hero emerges handsome calvin dan 
franklin a goodasgold bluecollar kid who wants to follow in 
his late fathers publicservice footsteps 
calvin becomes the focal point of the groups moral dilemma when 
he cops to the cops that his partner john threw a wouldbe rapist 
off a roof the rest of the knights shun him and after wrestling 
with his conscience he discards his knights jacket 
to deal with his angst calvin rides his motorcycle to a 
soundtrack of rock music 
meanwhile the groups leader tony benjamin bratt 
alternately charms and menaces a female tv news reporter doing a 
story he hopes will raise some money for the knights she has 
questionable ethics of her own when she suggests he might want to 
dress down for the interview in order to look more needy 
tom bower plays father jim the overburdened priest who shelters 
the knights in his church basement 
the young cast is talented but knightwatchs sophisticated 
intent is bogged down by ragged execution opposite the cosby 
show itll offer an alternative to kids who dont want to be 
cheered up but its unlikely that very many will want to watch 
knightwatch

in the concluding scene in the pilot of cbs 
almost grown norm and suzie sit in a car listening to a rock 
station on the radio they have changed in the 20odd years since 
they met but the music has not 
those same three chords norm says its good to know 
theres something you can count on 
almost grown is an ambitious history of a marriage set 
against that nebulous force that formed a generation who came of 
age in the 60s and 70s rock n roll 
the show inevitably will be compared to abcs 
thirtysomething since it deals with a couple in their 30s and 
the foibles of the new age 1980s and is designed to appeal to baby 
boomers 
but its a unique engaging show that deserves a look on its own 
merit timothy daly and eve gordon star as norman and suzie each 
episode intends to flash back from the present to the prebeatles 
1960s when norm and suzie were in high school andor 1971ish 
when they were college revolutionaries 
all three phases are equally evocative and daly and gordon 
manage to play the couple convincingly from high school to 
impending middle age 
the twohour pilot premiering nov 27 begins with norm finding 
suzie in a stores shoe department wearing a white wedding gown 
it flashes back to their meeting in high school when norm was the 
goodygoody best friend of suzies brother joey albert macklin 
and suzie was a wild child hanging out with angelo the hood she 
develops a crush on norm and hears today i met the boy im gonna 
marry on the radio 
by 1971 they are living together at college hes a disc jockey 
on the university radio station shes an aspiring documentary 
filmmaker out to change the world they spout free love but become 
jealous suzie walks out after getting the message via the chambers 
brothers time has come today 
cut to the 80s two children later she is a technical 
filmmaker working in a medical lab he is a program director at a 
radio station they are divorced and suzie is about to get married 
again to a saintly globetrotting doctor who performs cosmetic 
surgery on victims of disasters 
by the end of the pilot we come full circle and learn why suzie 
was trying on shoes in a wedding dress 
the writing could be punched up but with its realistic 
references like a 1971 remark about the hallucinogen psilocybin 
and offbeat touches such as a satanist butler in 1988 almost 
grown could develop a following

shes a single gal a spunky single gal living 
in a pastel new york mom hovers nearby fussing and worried but 
basically supportive theres only one camera and no laugh track 
based on the premiere episode it might seem that cbs has booked 
the days and nights of molly dodd instead of mary tyler moores 
as yet untitled show for its wednesday night schedule 
theres even a cute molly doddstyle misunderstanding when mary 
who works for the city government tries to straighten out a 
licensing problem for a hulking dirty hot dog vendor who speaks 
six words of english mom mistakes the hulk for the sensitive 
goodlooking beau mary has been bragging about 
this might have worked with the neurotic molly who was just 
desperate enough to fall for the hotdog man but mary our mary 
would never ever be so needy and the bit falls flat she goes from 
a cute meeting to a marriage proposal in one easy episode 
its been 11 years and two failed shows since mary tyler moore 
left the newsroom in minneapolis as lucille ball found in her 
brief disastrous return to series television two years ago you 
can ride about one week on good will next week you need a good 
script 
the first halfhour is a lukewarm start at best with mary given 
awful lines such as this about her exhusband i married a man 
with principles but no property but i left a man with property but 
no principles 
the show will be about a married mary and the first episode 
lays out the possibilities for conflict she is a former peace 
corps member hes an exmarine she engages her son in dialogue 
he gives his kids orders her mom is an old leftist who spouts 
slogans about the masses his dad is so far right that he takes 
his vacations at west point 
a key to the shows success will be the development of costar 
edward j moore who is handsome and sensitive yeah another way 
of saying dull in the first episode he has to do better 
mary does have strong support in mom eileen heckart a 1972 
oscar winner for her supporting role in butterflies are free 
and john randolph a tony award winner for his featured role in 
broadway bound in 1987 who plays her new fatherinlaw 
marys fate on tuesday night opposite abcs head of the 
class and nbcs unsolved mysteries partly depends on the 
success of former costar dick van dyke who is also returning to 
series television 
the van dyke show was not available for review which is not a 
good omen for the former mr and mrs rob petrie

credit tv 101 with truth in titling its 
not for advanced viewers however this production from grant 
tinkers new gtg entertainment for cbs figures to be one of the 
seasons better offerings for the teen audience 
tv 101 may confront teens with some of the hard issues that 
television rarely even puts before adults 
its also a rare instance of television looking at itself with 
the cameras following a high school class learning to use 
television instead of publishing the usual newspaper jumpy amateur 
camera work mixed with the professional work keeps the pace lively 
although looking through the viewfinder quickly gets old 
sam robards stars as kevin keegan a 29yearold video producer 
who is lured into a teaching job by his old high school journalism 
teacher emily walker brynn thayer whos not so much older 
lets issue a preliminary mrs robinson alert here and see 
what develops 
keegan may be pathetic when hes in his dirty living room 
mooning over his broken marriage and his distant daughter but back 
at fdr high he has all the swagger that made him such a terror as a 
teenage horace greeley maybe his old nemesis the dimwitted 
reactionary principal edward steadman leon russam gets his 
juices flowing 
the journalism class is a most appealing collection of young 
talent the focus in the first episode is on andrew white who 
plays bright underachiever vance checker 
checker is first spied smoking dope in the parking lot but 
dont worry about the show being soft on drugs drugs lead to 
death fortuitously the death also makes for some compelling video 
that helps the student station overcome the opposition of the 
principal 
yes tv 101 tends to slam its messages home and events 
unfold in predictable fashion but the lessons are skillfully 
sugarcoated with its high school setting tv 101 is 
positioned to explore any and all issues of interest to teens 
it deserves a look though it faces hard competition on tuesday 
night from abcs whos the boss and nbcs matlock

most of the people involved in murphy brown 
need to be slapped hard for their own good theyre messing up 
what could have been one of the bright shows of the new season 
candice bergen is terrific in the lead role of a driven network 
star sort of a tall barbara walters who plunges back into the 
stresses of the job after a month drying out at the betty ford 
clinic 
bergen is elegant understated and believable however her 
supporting cast adopts a buffoonish style better suited to the moe 
larry and shemp production of maratsade 
the worst offender is grant shaud who plays young executive 
producer miles silverberg its a funny idea that murphys boss is 
a short nerdy harvard mba but shaud isnt allowed to stop there 
he acts like a disturbed adolescent reduced to hugging a desk and 
all but drooling after the climax of the episode 
in the premiere murphy gets an exclusive interview with a man 
who has been romantically linked with a candidate for vice 
president who already has a husband the interview is offered on 
condition that murphy not ask the big question did he sleep with 
the candidate murphy asks anyway 
incredibly we dont see his reaction to this doublecross 
there isnt a clue why miles is gibbering at the end of the 
interview which should have been ambush journalism at its best 
the script of the first episode also suffers from toilet humor 
including the possibility of mispronouncing shiite and milking 
a cheap laugh about tampons 
however there are glimmers of a great show struggling for air 
particularly in murphys first meeting with the male bimbo ill 
bet that sheepish grin of yours got you pretty far the 
suspicious murphy tells him 
how far will murphy go cbs has given the show a sporting chance 
with a 9 pm monday slot leading into designing women 
competing with abcs monday night football and nbcs monday 
movie 
murphy brown could be smart and stylish this seasons 
la law it needs to get off gilligans island and fast

judd hirsch is back on television once again 
the sad sack in a crew as strange as the bunch on taxi 
hirsch plays the newly divorced john lacey who returns to new 
york city after being booted out of his suburban home by an 
unfaithful wife this is not glittering manhattan either but 
frumpy funky rego park in queens where john hopes to start over 
to that end he tries to join a singles club when he mistakenly 
wanders into an alcoholics anonymous meeting and explains that 
there werent any signs the group leader demands well what did 
you expect emotionally shattered this way lushes to your 
left 
no one needs to paint a losers sign to explain the one to 
one club or its leader louise mercer jane carr louise isnt 
very interested in the members as people but she is insatiably 
curious about any sexual problems that might have broken up their 
marriages 
jere burns has the delicious role of kirk the selfmade lounge 
lizard who acts and talks alarmingly like dan aykroyd in the old 
two wild and crazy guys sketches with steve martin on 
saturday night live 
stick with me youre gonna make out like a bandit kirk 
tell john eyeing the room kirk adds we could really get our 
turkeys tetrazzinied in this place 
barry groener is ralph whose bulgarian wife left him five hours 
after the wedding ceremony and isabella hofmann plays a normal 
woman at least in the first episode who seems destined for a 
larger role in johns life 
the show reunites hirsch with ed weinberger one of the 
executive producers of taxi and a veteran of the mary tyler 
moore show 
given its strong cast good writing and thursday night timeslot 
after cheers on nbc dear john figures to be around a while

right off you know this is no ordinary show 
call me angel says the disembodied voice at the bottom of 
the grave our vantage point as we see jack killian gary cole 
standing above thats jack killian he put me here but i dont 
blame him 
the alert viewer will immediately realize the two possibilities 
for nbcs midnight caller it is either a delicious semisatire 
on film noir detective movies or a mindless selfimportant crime 
drama that a network mistook for daring television 
oh just take a wild guess 
angel we learn is a murderess in a wedding dress no less 
put to rest by killian a former san francisco cop turned 
latenight radio talkshow host who occasionally steps out of the 
booth to blow away bad guys or gals as the case may be 
we know killians a sharp talker because in a flashback he 
regales his partner with ohsofunny tall tales about meeting 
elvis but the laughs end when the two cops get tripped up by drug 
dealers and killian accidentally blows his partner away 
killian is sitting around wallowing in selfpity and presumably 
wasting good oneliners so enter devon king who makes up these 
names played by wendy kilbourne who owns a radio station and 
needs a latenight talk guy she hires killian to dispense crime 
prevention advice and otherwise entertain people who are up in the 
middle of the night telephoning radio stations 
in between killians witty radio repartee thats my name 
dont wear it out for petes sake he inadvertently elicits 
callins from killers 
such is angel a hooker who demands that her customers love her 
or else turns out her boyfriend threw her over and married another 
gal thatll turn em into serial killers every time 
cole is a smoldering presence and midnight caller is quite 
stylish owing no doubt to coexecutive producer robert butler who 
directed the pilots of hill street blues and moonlighting 
but a show about clever talk needs some clever writing and 
midnight caller doesnt have it 
artistic justice being what it is on network television that 
probably wont matter because midnight caller will undoubtedly 
appeal to the allimportant male 1834 demographic and nbc has put 
it up against tuesday nights femaleappeal thirtysomething on 
abc and a historically lowrated movie on cbs

hardly anyone felt bad or even noticed when 
kooper with a k starring george segal suffered sudden death 
on cbs last season its real cause for regret now however 
because segal was freed to do his worst in murphys law for abc 
in truth the title should be sam spade meets the avengers and 
impersonates columbo 
murphy is a downattheheels dick in san francisco who adores 
yeats and keats wears an old raincoat and lusts after a eurasian 
model who has fabulous gams and shares his amazingly colorful 
residence 
am i not fey his character seems to say is my battered 
fedora not angled rakishly does my rumpled raincoat not evoke pity 
and amusement 
maggie han who plays girlfriend kamiko fannuchi is the only 
excuse to watch the show though even her smart sassy character 
loses luster once she succumbs to murphys labored attempts at 
charm 
the avengers connection appears in the comicbook villain 
an oriental guru who is suspected of murdering a wealthy disciple 
murphy finds the guru in a lotus position before a complex model 
train layout of the new york city subway system there are even 
tiny plastic muggers on one platform 
john steed would have raised an eyebrow about oneeighth of an 
inch segal registers shock horror and indignation a facewarp 
that is his standard reaction to most any development 
the audience meanwhile registers revulsion as segal pulls out 
the vox humana stop and revs up the tremolo as he fights for 
visitation rights with his 10yearold daughter hes never 
actually met the girl what with being colorful and dissolute and 
drunk but judge cant you see he has a heart o gold 
the mother who has fabulous gams interrupts her chainsmoking 
just long enough to hurl abuse at murphy however when murphy is 
gone she tells her attorney i wouldnt gloat charles hes 
still twice the man youll ever be 
gee whiskers they just dont write dialogue like that anymore 
for this abc canceled spenser for hire 
murphy gets a break that abcs programmers seldom gave 
spenser this show isnt up against nbcs popular hunter 
but comes on at 8 pm est on saturday where it is unlikely to 
beat either 227 or amen on nbc

as if the fact that it comes from the same 
producers werent enough nbc is even giving tattingers the 
old st elsewhere time slot 
if that wonderful and latelamented show was a square peg in a 
round hole tattingers is a trapezoid it seems that nbcs 
wednesday 10 pm slot is set aside for television that defies 
categories the networks lostandfound 
tattingers seems to be aiming for classythoughabsurd but 
it tries too hard to be wacky a quality that came naturally to 
st elsewhere 
while tattingers looks for an identity the search party is 
pretty intriguing 
first theres nick tattinger played with aplomb by the 
underrated stephen collins hes a streetfighter who has turned 
business sense and personal charm into a successful manhattan 
restaurant that serves the swells and acts as the backdrop to drama 
of both the crime and family variety 
nicks exwife hillary played by blythe danner as a goodsport 
socialite is trying to raise two teenage daughters and establish 
a meaningful relationship with the quintessential good man norman 
simon jones 
mary beth hurt doesnt appear in the pilot but will play the 
chef jerry stiller is sid the restaurant manager and nicks loyal 
friend british actordirector roderick cook is a snotty 
headwaiter patrice colihan and chay lentin play the tattinger 
daughters nina and winnifred why would a guy like nick let his 
kid be named winnifred 
in the premiere episode airing oct 26 nick has returned from 
paris where he fled after a deranged drug dealer took a potshot at 
him zach grenier who somehow manages to make his eyes roll in 
different directions will apparently be a regular as gunhappy 
degenerate sonny franks 
nick had sold the restaurant but when an evil real estate 
developer tries to muscle the residents of the tattingers 
block jack gilford has a cameo as shlomo the newsstand operator 
the juices start flowing and nick just cant resist a good fight 
by the end of the episode he has reclaimed the restaurant and 
set up a line of sexual tension with his exwife who has delivered 
the ultimatum that he is to be a good father or goodbye 
so hell try to be both a junkyard dog and a debutantes dad 
when he shows up disheveled at ninas coming out party she 
complains why you be like the other fathers they never get shot 
at 
the gershwinlike theme music heralds the costar of the show 
new york city where tattingers is filmed the creators 
combination of affection and fear for their locale is tangible 
although the pilot is not terribly impressive theres too much 
talent behind tattingers to write it off its a character 
piece that will take time to evolve perhaps as it did with st 
elsewhere nbc will give it some

empty nest an addition to nbcs saturday 
night schedule has one outstanding performer an actor who can 
convincingly convey love or impatience or gratitude with the twitch 
of an eyebrow 
unfortunately bear is confined in a small supporting role as 
dreyfuss dog and confidant to dr harry weston richard mulligan 
harry who has been widowed 18 months fusses over three 
daughters carol dinah manoff whose husband recently left her 
barbara kristy mcnichol who is a cop and emily who phones 
frequently from college 
nextdoor neighbor charley david leisure the lying salesman 
from the isuzu ads drops in frequently while harrys office is 
supervised by nurse laverne park overall 
one hopedfor episode of empty nest would send charley and 
laverne on a cruise to the bermuda triangle laverne is especially 
annoying doing jokes in which the punchline is some variation on 
im from arkansas therefore i am a hopeless hick the state 
should sue 
empty nest by the producers of golden girls 
exemplifies this years more of the same programming philosophy 
at nbc it follows right after golden girls on the saturday 
night schedule and is set in the same miami neighborhood 
if that philosophy worked for lisa bonet in the different 
world spinoff from the cosby show why not for a saint 
bernardgerman shepherdgolden retriever mix 
theres nothing really wrong with empty nest and nothing to 
particularly recommend it the show runs half an hour and has 
commercial breaks which fills the time for nbc maybe it will do 
the same for others

in the neverending struggle to find something 
to run against nbcs hit comedy lineup on thursdays cbs is trying 
another genre the western 
lee horsley matt houston returns to primetime television 
as ethan allen cord no relation to the furniture folks a 
mysterious gunslinger who inherits a passel of young uns when his 
sister dies back east 
it seems since he sent her a picture of himself standing in 
front of the towns dry goods store his dying sister mistook him 
for a successful businessman who would make a perfect dad for her 
kids instead hes a downattheheels gunfighter whos running 
from a slew of bad guys and is temporarily holed up in the 
depressed mining town of paradise 
although the writing needs to be beefed up the series admirably 
aspires to a lean terse authentic feel and horsley in real life 
a colorado horseman was made to play westerns in the pilot cord 
tries to shield the kids from his violent way of life even as the 
boys become fascinated by gunplay and cord seeks revenge against 
the men who shot him 
the kids are inoffensive in the pilot they are 13yearold 
claire played by jenny beck 11yearold joseph matthew newmark 
8yearold benjamin brian lando and 5yearold george played by 
michael carter 
they could provide some kid appeal if the show were at an 
earlier time but it is sandwiched between distinctly adult hours 
cbs news show 48 hours and the nighttime soap knots 
landing 
to get a more adult audience the series could and should make 
more of the romantic tension between the handsome desperado cord 
and the ice queen amelia lawson the local merchant played by the 
fine sigrid thornton man from snowy river 
paradise premieres oct 27 and is on opposite nbcs hit 
comedy lineup on thursday a timeslot that is definitely not 
paradise

baby boom is perhaps intended to appeal to 
two types of viewers single women whose biological clocks are in 
alarm mode and single mothers who wish raising a child was that 
easy 
another instance of nbcs current nothingbutclones 
programming philosophy baby boom isnt just based on the film 
starring diane keaton it is produced by the same people and has 
the same guy sam wanamaker playing the boss plus the same kid 
actually the twins michelle and kristina kennedy 
kate jackson takes over the lead role of jc wiatt a tigress 
of industry who quite accidentally acquires a baby this 2yearold 
seemingly travels alone across the atlantic and arrives via a 
freight company viewers who swallow that are what the advertising 
community calls a desirable audience 
jc has oodles of money a harvard education a nanny a huge 
apartment and a toddler who doesnt cry the biggest prroblem to be 
solved in the first episode is finding the childs blanket and 
jc is absolutely equal to the challenge 
baby boom is about angst among the pampered which is far 
down on anyones list of important or interesting problems 
the show may at least answer the question of whether two babies 
are cuter than one john ritter whose hooperman on abc is the 
competition on wednesday night along with cbs the equalizer

a producers nightmare 
you make a nice thoughtful little show about a single dad 
trying to raise a teenage daughter first a writers strike 
delays the show next the network gives it a lousy time period and 
changes the shows name then the network holds the lousy time 
period until the shows premiere with a really dumb show that has 
the same premise 
you wake up in a cold sweat after dreaming the headline 
network show gets zero rating for first time in history 
james naughton stars as donald the single dad in cbs raising 
miranda formerly close to home costarring as miranda is 
one of the better child actors to show up on television royana 
black 
in the pilot donalds ditzy wife goes out shopping and never 
comes back although she does phone to inform him she must find 
herself 
this idea has been done to death todays tv dads are all 
widowed or abandoned my two dads full house whos the 
boss the hogan family empty nest and of course the 
silly first impressions which had the miranda premise and 
time period and made a mess of both 
raising miranda does it better the cast is excellent 
especially naughton as the wellmeaning but clumsy dad and black 
as a smart kid grappling with the the confusion of adolescence 
miriam flynn and steve vinovich play longmarried neighbors 
theres comic relief and a potentially interesting character in 
bryan cranstons uncle russell the 60s burnout brother of 
donalds nowabsent wife who intends to remain on the premises 
living in his van in the driveway 
the characters in the pilot are written too broadly but that 
tends to sort itself out if a show stays on the air long enough 
raising miranda is from gtg entertainment grant tinkers 
new production company of note michael kozoll the cocreator and 
early cowriter of hill street blues is listed as executive 
consultant on the show 
miranda is on saturday cbs lowest night of viewing so the 
ratings will be poor its a respectable show that deserves better

on screen nbc anchorwoman jessica savitch was 
televisions golden girl authoritative beautiful 
intelligent off screen the glitter quickly vanished 
five years after her death two biographies dig beneath the 
radiant image though savitchs family and friends dispute their 
findings both books describe a life marred by drugs psychological 
problems her husbands suicide and intense ambition 
her whole life was a suicide mission says alanna nash 
author of golden girl ep dutton 1895 
gwenda blair author of almost golden simon amp schuster 
1895 says savitch was the wrong woman in the wrong place at the 
wrong time 
drive and ambition certainly got her to the top but it didnt 
provide her with the stability needed to withstand the pressure of 
that place in the sun but even more than that the changes that 
were taking place in the news industry that both elevated her and 
punished her is worth telling 
popular with viewers but not with most colleagues savitch 
skyrocketed to television stardom in the 1970s first as a local 
anchor on philadelphias kyw and then as anchor of nbcs weekend 
news digest 
by the late 1970s the petite blonde with the uncanny knack of 
romancing the television camera was dubbed nbcs golden girl by 
newsweek magazine 
five years later her star fading she and new york post 
executive martin fischbein drowned when her car toppled into a 
canal in bucks county pa 
the medical examiners report said drugs were not involved 
however both books argue that savitch had a cocaine problem that 
had crippled her career 
there was evidence of instability early on her main ambition 
was to become the first female network anchor and to do it by time 
she was 30 
she gave herself an edge she shaved a year off her age but 
then her dream was shattered when abc hired barbara walters at 1 
million a year to coanchor the nightly newscast 
jessicas highly audible outrage lasted for a long time then 
she went into a corner of the kyw newsroom and cried nash 
wrote 
her tirades and tantrums were legendary within the business 
according to the biographers kyw cameras captured one particularly 
vivid outburst in which savitch berated the crew during a 
commercial break ranting raving screaming and then coolly 
returned to the newscast 
kyw staffers set the videotape to music and sent it to savitchs 
new network colleagues at nbc before her arrival 
as her star rose so did her prima donna status besides 
walters she was the only anchorreporter to travel with an 
entourage that included a driver hairdresser personal assistant 
and secretary 
both books delve into her two marriages a long affair with an 
abusive news producer the suicide of her second husband dr 
donald payne and alleged lesbian liaisons they differ in their 
approach 
blair concentrates on the selling of television news 
blaming much of savitchs rise and fall on the nature of the 
industry 
she broke in at a time when television news was undecided 
whether it was news journalism or entertainment blair said 
savitch was often criticized as being a lightweight a reporter 
who had not paid her dues said blair at the time she was 
exactly what they wanted her to be a pretty face who brought in 
ratings 
nash on the other hand delves into savitchs background her 
fathers death of kidney disease at age 33 her chilly relationship 
with her mother her crippling insecurities 
citing several psychiatrists including a few who treated 
savitch nash concludes that savitch had a borderline 
personality disorder which is characterized by psychological 
instability impaired social behavior mood swings and trouble with 
interpersonal relationships 
she argues that savitchs problems can be traced to a childhood 
incident when she argued with her father and then ran away hiding 
for hours in a field near her home when she reappeared her father 
berated her and screamed that she would never amount to anything 
soon after he died 
savitch always believed she was the cause of his physical 
deterioration nash said blair agreed the person whose approval 
she wanted the most her father she could never get 
drugs the authors said fed all her other problems and led to 
the destruction of her professional life those tuned into nbc news 
digest the night of oct 3 1983 saw that destruction firsthand as 
the anchorwoman appeared to suffer a breakdown on camera she was 
dead 20 days later 
savitchs mother and sisters stephanie and lori did not 
cooperate with either author lori savitch an anchorwoman at her 
older sisters former station kyw in philadelphia has denied her 
sister was addicted to cocaine 
nashs book is the more gossipy of the two full of details 
about savitchs troubled relationships with men 
some have questioned the purpose of such an intense and personal 
review of savitchs life but both authors feel theres a lesson to 
be learned 
it is a cautionary tale and a sad one said nash 
i think its about the corrupting influence of fame about 
misplaced ambition she was a woman who didnt know who she 
was she only existed on camera

what ever happened to the revolutionaries of the late 60s and 
early 70s the question bubbles below the placid surface of 1988 
and one answer has arrived in a riveting new film 
running on empty offers a story so current it is mimicked in 
real life even as it is released the recent surrender in oakland 
calif of a 60s fugitive who gave up for the good of her children 
is eerily close to the story naomi foner has written for the screen 
the film is the story of annie and arthur pope christine lahti 
and judd hirsch fugitive leftovers from the days of violent 
antivietnam war protest more significantly it is the story of 
their brilliant musically gifted teenage son danny river 
phoenix 
running on empty is certain to be remembered as the film 
that made phoenix a star the teenager with the 60s name has 
intensity and dramatic control far beyond his years 
under sidney lumets masterful direction the viewer is drawn 
quickly into the odyssey of the popes who are wanted for the 1971 
bombing of a defense intallation in which a janitor was maimed 
since then theyve been on the lam moving from town to town as 
the fbi came close teaching their two young sons to live a lie 
the boys have new names in each new school and are careful never to 
appear in a class picture the parents hold jobs and derive 
substantial support from a vague underground network the ruse 
works for 17 years 
the crisis that propels this film is dannys impending high 
school graduation his musical gift which demands further schooling 
and his romance with the daughter of his music teacher young 
martha plimpton as the girlfriend plays in perfect counterpoint to 
phoenixs sensitive engaging danny 
the parents must decide whether to uproot danny one more time 
hirsch with the least sympathetic role as the selfinvolved 
aging radical father summons up the most realistic reflection of 
the radical life as it was 
lahti an actress who displays new depths with every 
performance has the movies most affecting scene in a reunion with 
the grieving father she left behind there wasnt a dry eye in the 
house at a recent screening 
tackling such a prickly subject has pitfalls and running on 
empty has its flaws the resolutions are too pat the kids 
resilience strains credulity and the norman rockwell style settings 
including a high school with the grandeur of harvard are a bit 
much the rosy glow of conservative america pervades this film 
the political passion beneath the popes predicament is barely 
explored lahti offers the lame explanation it was over when the 
war was over 
but running on empty aims to win our hearts rather than our 
minds and it does that with great success 
running on empty is rated pg13 for its general subject 
matter and the sexual affair between teenagers

the stories of eight men out 
and of its director and writer john sayles begin at the same place 
with youth and innocence 
the athletes in sayles movie about the 1919 world series 
rigged by gamblers love their work for them baseball is play 
sayles too has a measure of that boyish pluck he enjoys making 
movies 
the difference is that the baseball players sold out throwing 
the series for a few thousand dollars ditching their virtue and 
their futures in the process 
sayles has stood tall surrounded by the same kind of 
dealmaking and influencepeddling that proved toxic to the white 
sox the 38yearold sayles has moved through hollywood with his 
integrity pretty much intact 
he didnt give eight men out a happy ending as others might 
have done 
we wanted to make eight men out not one man out or two 
men out or whatever the more hollywood version would be sayles 
said that seemed like taking a dive to us that was a version of 
throwing the series for us and we held out it took us seven years 
but we got to do it eventually 
sayles has had to personally raise the money for most of his 
movies its the only way to get them made the way he wants them 
but its not a question of smugness from 1983s lianna a 
young woman copes with lesbianism to 1984s brother from another 
planet a black space alien visits harlem to last years 
matewan coal miners strike in west virginia sayles has 
explored subjects that are politically riveting and brazenly 
uncommercial 
to support himself he turned to commercial screenwriting 
including scripts for the howling piranha clan of the 
cave bear and the tv movie unnatural causes 
with eight men out starring john cusak and david 
strathairn sayles may have discovered a new mix opening to both 
good notices and long lines 
the movie may finally introduce the uninitiated to one of the 
countrys more independentthinking directors and his reflections 
on common people facing uncommon choices 
potential producers however were skeptical of eight men 
out 
a lot of the turndowns we got were people who said this is a 
great story you did a really good job on it but we dont think we 
can make money on this thing 
thats why a lot of good movies dont get made and continue 
not to get made the widest audience that you can go for is 
probably the one that doesnt want any waves 
the major hollywood studios told sayles eight men out was a 
15 million movie and didnt have the ooomph to make back the 
money 
and wed say we can make it for 6 million or 7 million 
and finally they saw enough of the things that we had done that 
looked more expensive than what they cost they started to believe 
us he said 
told in straightahead style with authentic period detail the 
movie examines how personal and professional pressures seduced a 
group of athletes to betray both the national pastime and the 
national trust unlike the natural with its happy ending this 
is not a saccharine piece 
some of the players were motivated either by greed or fears of 
hardnosed gamblers who told them to throw the game or else 
others were provoked by pennypinching white sox owner charlie 
comiskey who was so cheap he charged his players for washing their 
uniforms the team was called the black sox even before the 
1919 series 
the movie is about an exploitative situation sayles said 
the owners were owners you belonged to that guy some of the 
white sox sayles added were paid half as much as equally talented 
players on other teams 
the day that they the eight white sox were acquitted 
comiskey said well im glad my boys are back and the day that 
they were kicked out which was literally the next day he said 
well good good riddance baseball doesnt need these guys well 
build from the ashes 
sayles wrote the script for eight men out based on eliot 
asinofs book 11 years ago as a screenwriting sample like much of 
the work that followed the script reflected sayles interest in 
labor and class struggles 
eight men out was made only when sayles and producers sarah 
pillsbury and midge sanford rivers edge demonstrated a 
remarkable ability for making expensivelooking movies on a 
shoestring 
sayles plays journalist ring lardner in the movie every time 
i can play a role thats one less person i dont have to worry 
about hes not going to give me any trouble he said 
hell devote his time now to writing a tv movie about a 
lowrent lawyer and a feature film on the spanish civil war 
and i want to go back and write a book that ive been working on 
for a long time a novel based on the cuban community in miami 
sayles said his movies carry a variety of messages rarely is 
it a message that you can put on a quilt cleanliness is next to 
godliness so there he said 
with this movie you should think about how people are 
corrupted or lose their dreams without really knowing thats 
happening it should make you think about youth and innocence and 
whats overrated about youth and innocence and whats actually 
valuable about them and what we miss about them when theyre 
gone

chicago 19 reprise chicago 
 
chicago the band is approaching its 20th year in showbiz 
firmly planted in the netherworld of adult contemporary music 
chicago 19 the latest offering by the former kings of top 40 
gives a bad name to contemporary adults everywhere 
a totally forgettable assortment of weak songs straining to be 
anthems of love the album has only one song the pretty we can 
last forever with any potential as a pop hit something which 
used to be chicagos stock in trade 
lyrically the songs fall into three general categories there 
are a few ive been hurt but ill survive numbers a couple of 
i know youve been hurt but ill make things better tunes and a 
some standardissue whines about lost love 
there are artists who can make out of such emotions music that 
is tough strong and moving then there are records such as 
chicago 19 which take the same ingredients and spin around 
about 33 times a minute 
there are no satanic messages on chicago 19 and no 
endorsements of drug abuse but this one really deserves a warning

the indescribable wow virgin sam phillips 
 
behind a shocking pink cover and even more ostentatious title is 
an utterly charming record sam phillips the indescribable wow 
is a describable delight 
as leslie phillips she recorded several christian albums before 
turning to the pop music market she decided to change her first 
name supposedly ignorant of the sam phillips who founded sun 
records 
the 26yearold california native has a littlegirl voice and a 
knack for writing memorable melodies with producer and boyfriend 
tbone burnett shes crafted an inventive record rich with 1960s 
influences 
the wistful she cant tell time sounds like an outtake from 
the beatles rubber soul while remorse quotes liberally 
from the fab fours shes a woman 
like most albums the indescribable wow has its strong songs 
and filler but phillips and burnett save their most imaginative 
arrangements for the weak songs keeping boredom at bay 
what do i do for instance is so slight it would probably 
sound incomplete if strummed on an acoustic guitar burnett and 
guest van dyke parks turn it into a minioperetta with a full 
orchestra and dreamy staggered vocals 
holding on to the earth is sinistersounding with a farfisa 
organ and what sounds like a sitar 
burnett is savvy enough to let the strong material stand almost 
by itself phillips voice is so seductive in i dont want to 
fall in love that she wont be able to say the same for her 
listeners i dont know how to say goodbye to you and i cant 
stop crying are two other heartbreakers 
phillips and burnett make a fine studio team as any lover of 
classic pop music will be able to attest

irrepressible wendy bagwell has spent 
more than a quarter century as a gospel music singer and humorist 
and still has trouble tuning his welltraveled guitar 
i still dont know how bagwell says in a cheerful burst of 
selfdeprecation 
moments before performing in carnegie hall 25 years ago he had 
to seek help to get his trusty guitar ready 
i asked somebody in another group if it sounded like it was in 
tune he recalled that tells you where i am as a musician 
where he is as an entertainer is celebrating the 30th 
anniversary of wendy bagwell and the sunliters one of gospel 
musics most popular and enduring groups 
its been great he said alluding to sweet memories of 
singing and cracking jokes in hot school auditoriums and small town 
churches and dusty fairs since the late 1950s 
if i wipe out this year i can look up at the lord and say 
thanks for letting me make it with no talent 
the record indicates otherwise the fivemember group has 
recorded 60 albums toured europe sold several million records 
has a wall covered with awards and has made countless people laugh 
bagwell is best known for his record here come the 
rattlesnakes an amusing song based on a true story about the 
time the sunliters performed in a church near the kentuckywest 
virginia line soon they discover church members getting rattlers 
out of a box as part of the worship service 
in the key line the terrified bagwell discovers theres no back 
door 
where do they want one he asks 
the song is on the album this that and the other which 
continues to sell two million copies have been sold an 
extraordinary amount for gospel music 
it got us off big orange drinks and weenies for a while to 
come bagwell says 
it also led to him being named comedian of the year by record 
world magazine i didnt even know i was a comedian he said 
the sunliters concerts held just about every weekend are a 
5050 mix of music and humor 
some of the humor is inspired by the audience such as when 
someone gets up and walks toward the back 
dont write nothin on the wall bagwell is fond of saying 
to the redfaced person 
toward the end of the performance the light touch is set aside 
and veteran singer jan little jan buckner tells about how 
when she was a baby her mother was killed by a drunken driver 
she recounts her time in orphanages and foster homes and then 
the group performs the gospel song i firmly promise you 
the best compliment we get is from people who say they laughed 
til their stomach hurt and then they cried at the end of the 
program bagwell said 
down through the years bagwell said cautious record companies 
have wanted him to tone down his humor these days he refuses 
saying people arent all that starchy about things 
hes resisted offers to cross over into pop music saying 
were blessed where we are its mighty good people we sing to 
the group rarely works seven straight days for a couple of 
reasons for one they like to be home on sunday to attend their 
own church 
i never wanted to wear people out bagwell adds whats 
that saying i love turnip greens but not seven days a week 
hes been telling audiences for years that hes from smyrna 
ga just outside atlanta thats not true 
i really live in hiram it aint on the way to nothin the 
only way youd come here is on purpose theres no oneway streets 
or red lights 
and still he struggles with his guitar 
i played just three chords as a young man nowadays with this 
complicated stuff theres songs i still cant find the chords to

john cheek was hired by the metropolitan opera 
in 1977 after james levine heard him praised often enough to 
audition him he was hired by the new york city opera nine years 
later after beverly sills heard his voice in her dentists office 
its more usual for an upandcoming american opera singer to 
move from the new york city opera to the met 
but cheek this season will sing at both places to the 
satisfaction of himself the two opera companies and the public 
how he came to be engaged by miss sills is an improbable story 
cheek says but its the one she told him so he believes it 
visiting her dentist she complained about the noise of the 
drill he handed her earphones and challenged her to guess who was 
singing two of the devils arias from faust she couldnt 
told it was john cheek whom shed heard but in roles not 
requiring personality projection she immediately called cheeks 
manager and said she was interested in him for mefistofele 
this season at the new york city opera the 6foot3 
bassbaritone will sing three evil title roles in mefistofele 
attila and the premiere of rasputin by jay reise 
at the met hell be a nicer guy singing the title role in the 
marriage of figaro as well as basilio the music teacher in 
the barber of seville and colline a philosopher in la 
boheme 
next season hell sing his first don giovanni at the new 
york city opera and his first wagner role gunther in 
gotterdammerung at the met 
cheeks entry level at the met wasnt the top he says my 
second season i had about 120 performances almost a record it 
wasnt a question of being pushed vocally my manager said my small 
roles were dinner is served and my large roles were dinner is 
not served 
the met no longer is a place where singers like james mccracken 
could only break out of tiny roles by going to europe and coming 
back a star cheek says its very much levines idea to take 
young american singers nurturing them there and allowing them to 
move on to whatever their talents permit 
when miss sills offered him mefistofele which the met 
doesnt perform cheek asked for levines advice he said it was 
great should be really good for me and i should go do it cheek 
said 
at the met i was sort of getting into standupandsing parts 
old men and priests thats fine but i wanted to do parts that 
require a lot of acting and physical movement 
his biggest part at the met so far is figaro who has a lot of 
stage action as well as singing and second biggest is don alfonso 
the old man in cosi fan tutti 
he has sung the four villains in the tales of hoffmann in 
cincinnati and will sing them again in april in pittsburgh 
mefistofele certainly fulfilled cheeks desires for acting 
and physical movement the devil is the centerpiece of frank 
corsaros production its wonderful to sing such a powerful 
character that just dominates the stage whenever he appears and 
moves with demonic abandon 
ive never done anything else needing that much stage 
presence he has to be this irresistible force hes a loser god 
wins in the end but hes a formidable opponent 
physically its the most demanding part that ive ever done 
and hopefully it will continue to be 
cheek says if he didnt exercise on a machine that simulates 
crosscountry skiing he doubts hed have the strength or endurance 
for mefistofele 
the devil has a strange walk where i drag the top of my toes 
i wear a body stocking which makes me look snakelike like im 
stalking my prey theres a throne about 10 feet high i climb on 
and off the top of several times that took quite a bit of getting 
used to particularly since im not fond of heights the first 
rehearsal was a disaster i couldnt breathe or sing 
the thing that bothers me the most now is that the throne 
tends to rattle and shake a bit that can be real unnerving 
cheek isnt sure he overcame his fear of heights but his 
motivation is sufficient to send him scrambling up the throne 
saving enough breath to sing im willing to try almost 
anything he said 
the singer was born in greenville sc his parents who taught 
spanish and french moved the family to north carolina when he was 
6 months old he and his brother grew up in wilmington nc 
his wife lee young studies singing and works in massage 
therapy cheek says she is very good she went to japan with me 
on the tour and was kept very busy singing can be very stressful 
the difficult thing is to get the right muscles working and the 
ones that arent supposed to be working relaxed 
his career so far has been mainly with american opera companies 
and orchestras he has sung walter in luisa miller at the paris 
opera and still another devil in the damnation of faust in 
berlin he notes that most opera records are made in europe using 
singers who are known there and hed like to be part of that scene 
its all right with cheek that his repertoire is different at 
the met and new york city opera i get bored with doing one thing 
all the time if i had to rehash five or six roles i think very 
quickly i would lose enthusiasm and im sure the performances would 
reflect that ive seen it happen that takes the joy out of it 
its just not worth it unless you have that

newly wed and busy in her career as singer and 
composer carly simon dreams of having a little house in the 
suburbs 
how i picture it is a little stone house with maybe two or 
three bedrooms tiny though she said ill do all the 
housework myself with a nice living room with fireplace and a cozy 
kitchen 
it doesnt need to have a lot of ground but it needs to have 
trailing vines wisteria or honeysuckle and definitely a magnolia 
tree if possible thats what i want to escape to on weekends from 
the city 
this is not however a woman looking forward to retirement she 
had a new album out in august which was taped during her first 
concert performance in eight years 
shes also scoring a movie for mike nichols that will include a 
love theme she wrote for her new husband jim hart and she has 
done two private concerts which were her contribution to a benefit 
auction on marthas vineyard 
the arista records album carly simons greatest hits live 
was taped and so was a home box office special at one of two 
concerts on a marthas vineyard beach 
i was promoting the coming around again album which came 
out in april 1987 consequently there are many songs on the live 
album that also are on that album i also did youre so vain 
loving you is the right thing to do and nobody does it better 
i didnt do jesse thats the way it should be and havent got 
time for the pain 
simon talked about her life and work in her manhattan apartment 
where winter coats hung from a row of hooks in the entryway 
about the live album she said my favorites are songs that 
never really got exposure and i wanted to give a second life like 
never been gone which is my favorite song on the album and it 
happens every day 
its funny how certain songs that ive written i always 
thought were terrific songs but they were never picked up from 
albums as singles or they were on albums that were flops or they 
were never recorded properly 
i think it happens every day is such a neat song compact 
concise emotional it was on hello big man an album i did for 
warner brothers which was never particularly popular i think its 
one of my best albums it was at a time warner brothers was 
thinking of sending me to siberia i dont think they invested a 
whole lot in promoting that album they wanted me to do more things 
that were contemporary 
they certainly didnt want me to record torch which was an 
album of standards before linda ronstadt did her album of 
standards they didnt want to release it finally did release it 
and it has gone gold 
the curse of the recording industry she said is radios top 40 
playlists it kills your artistic motivation she said but 
credited arista records president clive davis for helping to keep 
her going 
you really cant sell albums in record stores that dont have 
some outlet on radio clive says you have to be yourself but you 
also have to give me something that i can sell to radio 
i dont know if i consider myself an artist so lets call me 
a musician with an identity and a path ive got somewhere that im 
going to im not going to do the same kinds of songs now that i 
did eight years ago a good businessman if he has a musician whos 
in it for the long haul will let him or her do what he or she 
wants to do with a certain amount of gentle guidance toward the 
revolting top 40 playlist 
carly simon became mrs jim hart on dec 23 the couple met on a 
train in upstate new york in may 1987 
he was an insurance salesman he said saying that got rid of a 
lot of people at cocktail parties she said 
he riveted me i was just fascinated it didnt matter what he 
did id never gone out with a man who had a straight job before 
im used to artists and musicians he thought i was one of those 
female singers but he wasnt sure which one he wasnt into popular 
music at all 
hart who had already begun a novel quit his job and moved to 
marthas vineyard with simon hes an incredible poet and his 
novel is just so exciting she said i read it at every stage 
simon avoids stage performances because of claustrophobia which 
also bothers her on airplanes and subways 
it probably stems from a childhood stammer she said i 
was always afraid of being humiliated by having to talk in public 
ive worked very hard many many years to try to rid myself of it 
on a stage i feel trapped by the lights as if i cant get 
off then i panic outside last summer it was a lot better i 
felt there was more air for me to breathe and i felt less trapped 
she also performed two miniconcerts this summer after offering 
her services at the marthas vineyard community services auction 
the highest they ever went before was 4000 for a sail on 
walter cronkites yacht with walter cronkite she said 
when the bidding got to 11000 for her concert she suggested

videos reviewed this week zelly and me the milagro 
beanfield war 
 
zelly and me rcacolumbia home video vhsbeta 7995 
rated pg 
 
zelly and me is a womans movie with a female 
writerdirector and a cast that only briefly and peripherally 
includes men that should appeal to men and women it shows the 
ties that bind two women to a girl and the pain they can cause each 
other 
zelly isabella rossellini is governess to an orphan alexandra 
johnes who lives on a virginia estate in 1958 with her wealthy 
grandmother coco glynis johns a lonely possessive woman 
unable to ask for love or give it freely 
rossellini is beautiful and touching as zelly a gentle loving 
woman far from the brooding frightened character she played in 
blue velvet zelly and phoebe have a sweet nurturing 
relationship coco is unpredictable from doting to devilish 
tina rathbones 1988 movie is very pretty as zelly and phoebe 
frolic in the gardens put on a wedding for two stuffed animals or 
share their fascination with the legend of joan of arc into this 
idyllic life comes coco who destroys her granddaughters 
playthings and tries to estrange zelly and phoebe as she lashes out 
from her jealousy and isolation 
the film successfully and occasionally too cloyingly puts 
viewers into the life of this pretty vulnerable child the climax 
comes with the opportunity for zelly and phoebe to escape coco 
and the resolution is satisfying and realistic

the milagro beanfield war mca home video vhsbeta 8995 
rated r 
 
an aging angel in a sombrero watches over milagro nm and 
its a good thing too the evil land developers have come to town 
and theyre none too happy about the handyman whos decided to 
water his beanfield at their expense 
in this texmex version of the david and goliath story set in 
the stunning new mexico high desert and directed by robert redford 
what starts as accidental irrigation becomes a cause celebre in the 
sleepy village of milagro where little has changed for 300 years 
as the beanfield grows so does the communitys social 
consciousness support for the old ways and resistance to the 
threat posed by the new resort surge to the point where even the 
developers hatchet man played by a stonefaced christopher 
walken can do little to keep the townsfolk in line 
this is a funny feelgood film with plenty of good 
performances particularly from ruben blades as the laconic 
sheriff sonia braga as the revolutionary garage owner ruby and 
carlos riquelme as the elderly amarante who pampers his pet pig 
and carries on frequent friendly arguments with milagros guardian 
angel robert carricart the pig is good too 
ignore the r rating which is inexplicable there is no sex 
or gore and little foul language this is a sweet family picture

to save ethel st lawrence from the aneurysm 
pressing on her brain doctors killed her for 40 minutes they 
put her in a coma stopped her heart chilled her by 40 degrees and 
drained her body of blood 
st lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls a 
cottonpickin miracle a sort of suspended animation that lets 
surgeons cure hardtoreach highrisk aneurysms that once were 
considered inoperable 
it is everything that technology can possibly offer said 
her neurosurgeon dr robert spetzler at barrow neurological 
institute in phoenix 
it may be the surgery of the future in cases where bleeding 
poses the greatest risk to the operation said dr julian e 
bailes a neurosurgeon at allegheny general hospital here who 
studied with spetzler thats the biggest cause of death in 
surgery if you could put someone in a state of suspended 
animation you could operate in a totally bloodless field 
in a severely cold bloodless state the brain can be deprived 
of oxygen up to 55 minutes giving surgeons time to remove the 
aneurysm a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood 
vessel and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive 
bleeding and certain death 
of 15 patients who have undergone the procedure at barrow one 
has died bailes said most had excellent results a few 
reported some weakness but otherwise did well and most remained in 
a coma no more than five days 
its getting through the surgery said dr steven shedd a 
barrow neuroanesthesiologist who worked on st lawrence if 
youve tolerated the procedure and you wake up youre going to be 
ok 
but the risks including that the heart wont restart are too 
great to use the procedure where normal anesthesia can adequately 
do the job 
its what birdseye discovered it you freeze a fresh fish it 
will come back and you can use it the problem is some people 
dont said dr louis caplan of bostons new england medical 
center and chairman of the american heart associations stroke 
council 
and because the patient has to be taken to the point of clinical 
death for the operation to succeed doctors approach it with a 
lot of respect said shedd every time i do one of these i get 
very nervous 
youre taking a patient thats alive and breathing and 
stopping their hearts and putting them into this state they are 
nothing there is no breathing no heart function the brain 
function is nil we tilt the table up and drain all the blood into 
the pump 
i dont want to say the word dead but the patient is 
definitely suspended at that point cellular activity is still 
occurring but at a rate so low that we cant detect it theyre 
not doing anything were talking cold 
st lawrence a 61yearold phoenix secretary was rushed to 
barrow on june 2 suffering from a severe twoday headache and 
unable to open her right eye tests showed that a sinus aneurysm 
detected four years ago had grown 
partly because of heavy doses of barbiturates given before 
surgery to help prevent stroke or brain damage st lawrence 
recalls nothing about the june 6 operation but she does recall 
experiencing a very strong sensation 
i just had this immense feeling that i was being cared for it 
felt like somebody was just holding me in their arms and taking 
care of me and that i would be ok it was just a feeling of peace 
four months after surgery she needs no medication and the 
severe headaches are gone though she still is unable to fully open 
her eye 
its just a cottonpickin miracle it truly is they do say 
god works in mysterious ways and one of his ways of working is to 
have capable people who know how to do things and in this case 
extremely capable surgeons 
bailes is confounded though by cecilia duffy a 76yearold 
pittsburgh woman who spent 51 minutes in suspended animation aug 
31 while surgeons removed an eggsized aneurysm that had almost 
completely disabled her 
duffy hasnt come out of the druginduced coma even though her 
brain activity is improving there is no evidence of brain injury 
and she moves her legs when stimulated quite frankly im 
worried about her because i would have thought she would have come 
out of it by now bailes said 
its hard to know why she hasnt because shes old and her 
liver isnt working that well he said shes not breaking down 
drugs that quickly so thats made it a little more confusing 
as we go longer its more likely she will have suffered some 
stroke some sort of brain injury 
cooling the body and stopping the heart before an operation was 
pioneered decades ago by cardiac surgeons particularly in children 
where there is little room to maneuver and bleeding is difficult to 
control said dr george magovern jr a heart transplant surgeon 
at allegheny general who worked on duffy 
hypothermia is an intricate part of cardiac surgery 
particularly moderate hypothermia in which the body is cooled 20 
to 30 degrees magovern said profound hypothermia in which the 
temperature is lowered 40 degrees is not done frequently but 
its done enough 
to achieve hypothermia doctors lower the operating room 
temperature to about 55 and wrap the patient in cooling blankets 
they remove several pints of blood and replace them with 
refrigeratorcold saline solution a heat exchanger like a 
radiator then runs the salineblood mixture through ice and back 
into the body when the body is cold enough the blood is removed 
entirely 
its quicker and more efficient to repair the heart in a 
bloodless field and sometimes the only way you can accomplish that 
is with profound hypothermia magovern said but the downside 
is that it limits you to 55 minutes of surgery and theres always 
the potential for neurological injury 
the difficulty in applying it to brain surgery said caplan is 
that doctors dont have a good way to monitor the person to see 
how the brains working if you purposely put them in a coma and 
decrease temperature and blood pressure you have no way of knowing 
if theres been damage until later 
its an extreme way of doing an operation that requires 
extreme measures said dr arthur day of the university of 
florida at gainesville and chairman of the cerebral vascular 
department of the american association of neurological surgeons 
the side effects are quite subtantial potentially day said 
so its not an operation technique that we do for the 
runofthemill aneurysm but for certain uncommon ones it may be 
the only way 
the problem is what would you be like if you didnt have the 
surgery most of the time having the aneurysm is such a bad thing 
that youre willing to take a much greater risk

working from a plywood shack 
and a collection of tents perched on the flank of augustine 
volcano researchers are setting up a hightech system to measure 
the volcanos shudders to within an inch 
when theyre done scientists using briefcasesized laser 
instruments could detect less than that but its a matter of 
whether you believe it says gene iwatsubo of the us geological 
survey one of the researchers trying to puzzle out how the volcano 
works and whether its eruptions can be predicted 
the thrust of the research is to try to find precursors signs 
of eruption says juergen kienle a university of alaska 
geophysics professor the more precursors you have the better 
off you are 
augustine volcano juts 4000 feet out of kamishak bay on the 
west side of cook inlet it appears benign but there have been six 
major eruptions since its discovery in 1778 one in 1883 
triggered a 30foot wave that destroyed houses and boats at port 
graham nearly 50 miles away 
computer models show a slidegenerated tsunami would reach 
homer a kachemak bay fishing community of 4000 people about 70 
miles away in about an hour a smaller wave would reach anchorage 
175 miles away three hours later 
we cant assess the probability of a slide occurring says 
state seismologist john davies all were saying is there is a 
possiblity we have no way to calculate the likelihood but if we 
cant calculate the possibility we feel its best to monitor it 
information that may enable scientists to predict eruptions 
accurately at augustine may be of great value to other parts of the 
world where millions of people live in the shadows of volcanoes 
or on them 
if you tell a mayor there is a 5 percent chance his town will 
be wiped out its hard for him to take action davies says if 
you tell him theres a 75 percent chance his town is going to be 
wiped out he can act 
kienle and seven researchers from the university of alaska 
geophysical institute and usgs have been pounding in benchmarks and 
performing surveys and gas studies a 100000 effort by the 
statefederal cooperative alaska volcano observatory formed this 
year a magnetic study also is planned 
this is really an uncomplicated volcano kienle says this 
one is really easy to deal with its very beautiful very active 
augustine the most active of some 60 volcanoes in the aleutian 
arc erupted in 1812 1883 1935 1964 1976 and 1986 when it 
spewed ash over much of southcentral alaska disrupting air 
traffic 
seismographs sensitive enough to detect passing planes nearby 
boats and high winds were placed on the volcano in 1970 their 
tracings on machines in fairbanks mapped the 1976 eruption and the 
eight months of seismic activity before the eruption 10 years later 
in january and february of 1986 scientists began briefing the 
air force federal aviation administration and state division of 
emergency services about a possible eruption early march 26 the 
seismographs showed earthquakes at the rate of about 50 per day 
within hours the rate to 500 then 5000 augustine blew its top 
the next day 
its a constant process of becoming better at forecasting when 
the volcano will become active kienle says we are getting 
better we will continue to get better 
four seismographs ring the volcano at an elevation of about 
1000 feet and two are near the peak three sets of tiltmeters 
measure changes in the surface 
one of the things were discovering is that most volcanoes 
have their own uniqueness davies says not every detail that 
one learns at one volcano is applicable to another its the 
hopeful assumption that you can apply it elsewhere i dont think 
it is a longshot hope i think its likely 
the value is obvious

the great pyramid of cheops pocked 
by thousands of years of vandalism and stonerobbing is finally 
getting a facelift 
the effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone 
blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work 
ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient 
worlds seven wonders 
this is not just cosmetic work said zahi hawass the 
egyptian antiquities organizations directorgeneral for the 
pyramids area were afraid unless we do something to stabilize 
the outer stones there could be a tragedy 
people have a tendency to think that pyramids will be here 
forever because theyre so massive but each is suffering from wind 
and sand erosion rain and salt and to a great extent because 
of the hands of man 
work began inside the great pyramid last winter to remove salt 
that oozed through the limestone and accumulated along passageway 
walls the work on the outside began in late august 
from a distance the pyramid appears fine close up its 
obviously far from healthy many of the massive blocks weighing an 
average 2 tons have eroded or disappeared others hang 
precariously on uneven ledges 
in 1976 a stone weighing several tons fell from the southern 
side no one was injured because tourists were being kept away 
during a dignitarys visit hawass said we chose to begin 
restoration with cheops pyramid first because we know theres a 
chance more stones will fall 
when put in place 4600 years ago the estimated 23 million 
blocks were assembled with such skill that only a thin sheet of 
paper would pass between 
the new project aims at duplicating such precision workers 
skilled in climbing scurry over the rocks binding loose stones 
with natural mortar like that used by the ancients and repairing 
damage caused by millenia of nesting birds desert animals and 
human ravagers 
historical records and legends indicate the first manmade 
damage occurred as early as 500 years after the death of cheops 
the second pharaoh of ancient egypts fourth dynasty the egyptians 
were in revolt against tyrannical and oppressive practices of the 
past hacking and destroying statues and monuments from the earlier 
days of the pharaohs 
less than a century later the 12thdynasty pharoah amenemhet 
took many stones from cheops pyramid complex to build one for 
himself at ellisht south of giza plateau teams from new yorks 
metropolitan museum who excavated amenemhets pyramid found 
hundreds of the decorated pieces 
nobody knows when or why but the great pyramid at some time 
lost 30 feet of height leaving it still enormous at almost 453 
feet its outer surface originally was covered with a protective 
layer of fine hard limestone only traces of which survived 
desecration and looting 
thousands of its stones were stolen over time but the pyramid 
remained structurally intact until the late ninth century writes 
ies edwards the british egyptologist acknowledged as the 
authority on egyptian pyramids 
at that time arab raiders broke a large hole just below the 
main entrance and entered the monument in a vain search for 
treasure edwards wrote in his showpiece work the pyramids of 
egypt 
subsequently it became a copious and convenient quarry 
providing the stone required for bridges over irrigation canals 
houses walls and other buildings in the neighborhood of giza and 
cairo he wrote 
in the early 19th century the albanian mohammed ali credited 
with creating the modern egyptian state as part of the ottoman 
empire thought nothing of using blocks from cheops and other 
pyramids for construction 
the english egyptologist flinders petrie wrote in the 1880s of 
watching as a steady stream of camels hundreds daily carried 
massive blocks into cairo from nearby abu rawash pyramid built by 
cheops successor djedefre 
today the pyramid area is littered with toppled building blocks

for the first time since the 1970s automakers 
are back in the business of making cars and trucks with a 
vengeance and their offerings for 1989 show it 
performance handling and windcheating styling are required 
just to get into the game 
for 1989 engines are fuelinjected turbocharged supercharged 
multivalved or just plain bigger and faster many cars have 
antilock braking a computerized system that prevents lockup 
advanced suspension systems aimed at a variety of driving tastes 
more responsive fourspeed automatic transmissions and styling that 
makes the large and small econoboxes of the early 1980s nothing 
more than a bad memory 
buyers looking for plain basic transportation can still find 
it but for 1989 the pure pleasure of driving is once again a key 
factor in the automotive equation 
here are highlights of whats new for 1989 
general motors 
chevrolet chevys imports the suzukimade sprint minicar 
isuzubuilt spectrum subcompact and toyotagm nova along with the 
new suzuki tracker sportutility vehicle will be sold under the 
lineup name geo at chevrolet dealerships beginning in 1989 geo is 
the result of chevys various attempts to sell imports to buyers 
who dont usually shop its dealers for 1989 the threecylinder 
50 mpg sprint becomes the metro and the toyota corollabased nova 
becomes the prizm 
during 1989 chevrolet will get its first member of the gm10

corsica sedan introduced as a 1988 model gets a hatchback 
version with folddown rear seat for 1989 another option the ltz 
touring sedan has a 130horsepower 28liter v6 engine and sport 
suspension 
the cavalier subcompact will be the first car with gms 
socalled selfaligning steering wheel which sits on legs that 
collapse on impact flattening the wheel against the drivers torso 
to evenly distribute impact force and reduce chest injuries 
the big 22yearold reardrive 1989 caprice fullsize sedan 
comes with a 50liter v8 engine and air conditioning 
for 1989 chevys corvette sports car gets the most powerful 
smallblock v8 ever at 57 liters a sixspeed manual transmission 
bigger wheels and on the z51 performance model adjustable 
suspension convertibles will get an optional removable hardtop 
like most of its competitors chevys compact s10 pickup trucks 
and blazer sportutility vehicles come with standard rear antilock 
brakes for 1989 big 43liter v6 engines are offered on both 
chevy fullsize pickups and astro rearwheeldrive compact van also 
get rear antilock brakes 
pontiac the grand prix coupe pontiacs gm10 model starts the 
model year with a 28liter v6 engine upgraded to a 31liter 
engine later in 1989 air conditioning is standard also later 
pontiac will offer a limitededition mclaren turbo grand prix with 
a turbocharged 31liter engine and automatic transmission and 
antilock brakes both standard 
antilock brakes also are available on the pontiac bonneville

with little advertising and less fanfare the 
ford probe is speeding through dealer showrooms keeping most 
buyers waiting at least six weeks for delivery of a car that may be 
carving its own market niche 
since its formal introduction last may the probe built beside 
the mazda mx6 at mazda motor manufacturing usa corps flat rock 
plant south of detroit is being sold three months in advance of 
assembly line runs ford motor co analyst ray windecker said 
delivery time can vary depending on what kind and color 
automobile a customer wants 
the american carbuying public got a dose of what ford had in 
mind months before its formal introduction the news media 
specifically the automotive magazines sang the cars praises 
by the time the cars were introduced more than onethird of 
the carbuying age populous was aware of the car windecker said 
i dont think theres been that much excitement about a 
domestic car since a taurus another ford that was introduced in 
december 1985 said beth fusco an auto analyst with moodys 
investor services in new york city 
they did a lot of advance promotion for the car in 
magazines she said i thought that was a pretty sophisticated 
sendoff i think they did a good job promoting it and i think the 
car is selling itself 
probes base price is 11490 with a 22 liter fourcylinder 
engine the car with hidden headlamps and a sweptback rear deck 
can be upgraded with a turbocharged engine and option packages to 
17292 
earlier this summer scores of probes reached the end of the 
assembly line at flat rock needing repairs 
mazda quality control manager james g bouck said the quality 
problems were created when a second shift was added at the plant 
a jointventure between ford and mazda and some workers were 
retrained and moved from one shift to another 
bouck who moved to mazda from general motors corp said mazda 
has more stringent quality demands that some other automakers that 
can result in more cars landing in repair lots before being shipped 
to dealers 
our repair inventory is about 300 now he said calling it 
an expected number 
probe sales have grown at a steady clip about 600 cars more 
are sold each month than in the preceding one no one at ford would 
reveal projected sales figures but windecker said demand has 
outstripped those projections 
its too early to tell exactly where probe will fit into the 
american car market 
they are creating a different niche for themselves fusco 
said but she cautioned i think you have to be really careful 
when youre creating a niche 
look what gm did with fiero she said referring to the 
pontiac twoseater that sold well in its first few years on the 
market before falling off dramatically gm stopped making the car 
earlier this year 
analysts said the probe has capitalized on the no 2 and most 
profitable automakers strengths solid design careful marketing 
and reliability 
they have done many things right said richard henderson an 
analyst with the pershing division of donaldson lufkin and 
jenrette in new york city its a combination of many many 
little factors some borrowed from europe some from north america 
and some borrowed from mazda 
combine that with a nice fit in its product mix and youve 
got a very successful car henderson said 
like other newly introduced cars probes engineering initially 
may take a back seat to its looks 
what is there out there in that price range that looks that 
neat asked fusco i think people buy cars because they look 
good and secondarily because the quality is good and the warranty 
is good 
like other fords probe carries a oneyear bumpertobumper 
warranty and a sixyear 60000mile powertrain warranty

the nations automakers and suppliers are 
offering a growing array of antitheft devices in an effort to stem 
the growing number of stolen vehicles 
most of the devices marketed by the big three honda mazda 
nissan and toyota involve alarms that honk the horn and flash the 
headlights to scare off a wouldbe car thief others systems 
disengage starter motors 
most of the devices supplied by automakers as standard equipment 
come on the makers more expensive cars the systems are optional 
on many lessexpensive models 
then there are devices that an owner can pick up at a local auto 
parts store things that fit around the steering column like a big 
doughnut menacinglooking hooks that lock the steering wheel to 
the brake pedal and still other systems that detect motion and 
sound such as breaking glass 
despite all the technology put into antitheft systems by 
automakers and parts suppliers there was a 53 percent rise in the 
number of car thefts in the nation from 1986 to 1987 the latest 
annual figures available from the fbi 
and the national auto theft bureau in chicago says while those 
devices may stymie thieves most of the cars stolen nowadays fall 
into two categories cars in which keys were left in the ignition 
and cars that were simply towed away 
approximately 13 percent of the recovered stolen vehicles 
still had the owners keys in the vehicles said tim kett of 
the organization about 10 percent of the vehicles were towed 
this is a common technique used by thieves in urban areas 
when tow trucks arent used by thieves there are a variety of 
products offered outside dealerships designed to keep a drivers 
car where the driver left it 
collars that cover ignition switches and joints in steering 
columns can prevent the plastic covering from being easily removed 
exposing wiring for the column controls including the ignition 
alarms that sound when a door is pried open when windows are 
smashed or when the car moves also are available 
motion detectors have caused some headaches especially in 
heavily urban areas when they can be activated by a nudge from a 
passerby or another vehicle for instance 
aaron lowe director of government affairs for the vehicle 
security association a trade organization for makers and marketers 
of alarm and vehicle protection systems said the security industry 
is beginning to make more sophisticated and lesssensitive motion 
detectors 
there are some systems available in the aftermarket which can 
alert a driver through a pager that someone may be trying to get 
into a car there are systems which interrupt the electrical or 
fuel systems when a door hood or trunk is opened 
there are a wide range of things a consumer can get depending 
on where they are and what they want to protect lowe said

the likelihood of injury from a car accident 
ranges widely among different car models but for the most part 
safety increases with automobile size according to an insurance 
industry report 
the report on injury claims involving 207 popular models shows 
that small cars have by far the highest injury loss records while 
station wagons and large cars often afford the greatest protection 
according to the insurance group the mercedesbenz sdlsel 
sedan which is equipped with a driverside airbag had the best 
safety record with injury losses that were 58 percent lower than 
the average for all cars close behind was the pontiac safari 
station wagon 
the least safe car was the 4door chevrolet spectrum which had 
injury losses that were 78 percent above average followed by the 
4door chevrolet sprint and 4door hyundai excel both of which had 
losses 67 percent above average the report said 
of the 10 cars with the best injury loss record nine were 
categorized as large cars including five station wagons and 
vans the saab 9000 was the only midsize car in the top 10 
vehicles ranking fifth best with injury losses 51 percent lower 
than average 
the 10 vehicles with the worst injury loss record were all in 
the small sedan or small sports car category 
exceptions to the general trend that small cars afford the least 
protection include another saab model the saab 900 as well as the 
volkswagen vanagon the toyota van porsche 944 coupe and mercedes 
benz 380560 sl convertible all are in the small category but 
had better than average injury loss records 
but except for the saab 900 all 60 of the small sedan 
models had higher injury losses than average 
the report by the highway loss data institute an insurance 
industry research group covered 198587 model cars but spokesmen 
said the findings can be used as a guide for later model vehicles 
as well 
the loss experience of most cars is consistent from one model 
year to another said brian oneill the institutes president 
the report said the results were adjusted to take into account 
various nonvehicle factors such as types and ages of drivers 
that might be associated with particular vehicles 
the 2door chevrolet cavalier was the only midsize car to have 
substantially worse than average injury losses 36 percent 
worse than average for all vehicles 
all but two of the 35 large cars station wagons vans and 
speciality cars had lower than average injury losses the 4door 
oldsmobile delta 88 and cadillac fleetwooddeville were the 
exceptions ranked as average 
of the 207 cars and vans included in the study 40 had safety 
records that were characterized as substantially better than 
average while 32 were substantially worse

here are the cars ranked as having 
substantially better and substantially worse injury loss 
records according to the highway loss data institute an insurance 
industry research group 
these vehicles have injury loss records of at least 30 percent 
greater or 30 percent less than the average for the 207 vehicles 
examined 
the number in parenthesis after each vehicle represents the 
relative injury loss rate the lower the number the better the loss 
rate 100 is the average for all vehicles for example a 40 would 
mean a loss rate of 60 percent below average a 140 would be a loss 
rate of 40 percent greater than average

driving speed will not have much effect on tire performance or 
wear according to test engineers at goodyear tire amp rubber co 
in terms of getting from point a to point b the increase in 
speed will compress the time needed to make the trip but it wont 
have any appreciable effect on either tire wear or performance 
unless you engage in sharp cornering braking or similar maneuvers 
at high speed says walt devinney director of tire testing 
goodyear also had this advice 
cold air pressure readings on your tires should not exceed 
the maximum air pressure specified on the tire sidewall 35 pounds 
per square inch on most cars tire inflation checks should be made 
often 
tires on automobiles and light trucks should be rotated at 
6000 to 8000 miles and again at 18000 to 24000 miles except 
when the manufacturer advises otherwise rotation usually will mean 
more even treadwear says goodyear 
all four tires should be of the same type of construction 
except winter tires on drive wheels or temporary spares supplied 
with the wheels 
if replacing tires and you need only two mount the newest and 
besttreaded on the drive wheels

with winter and its rain snow sleet and subfreezing 
temperatures in the offing car care becomes especially important 
motorists are advised to have a professional technician check 
for signs of wear on the car 
walt alley director of training at the midas insitute of 
technology in palatine ill suggests checking these car service 
areas 
brakes checks brake pads and shoes for wear 
exhaust system look for holes in the muffler exhaust or 
tailpipe 
oil and lube use the proper winter weight motor oil and give 
your car a lube job to help protect suspension and steering parts 
shocks wornout shock absorbers can hinder braking 
especially during sudden stops and allow excessive body rolls on 
curves 
alley also suggests assembling a winter survival kit to keep 
in the trunk to include booster cables shovel tow chain rock 
salt or sand emergency flares flashlight and firstaid kit 
racing driver alan kulwicki advises car owners also check tires 
the gas tank running out of gas and flat tires and the two 
leading nonmechanical causes of highway breakdowns he says and 
antifreeze 
check your antifreeze to make sure both that you have enough 
and that the system is clean says kulwicki who drives his own 
racing cars for the zerex racing team a good habit to get into 
is to check the antifreeze every time you check the oil especially 
if youve been driving hard 
always be sure the ignition is off and the engine cold when 
opening the radiator he says 
if the coolant looks dirty he says have the cooling system 
flushed and replace the antifreeze if the level is low add some 
a 5050 mix of antifreeze and water usually provides the best 
protection against overheating kulwicki says

many motorists who wear seat belts are still 
exposing themselves to serious injury by wearing them improperly 
according to a federal study that says women children and 
motorists over 50 are most likely to put themselves at risk 
the national transportation safety board study raised questions 
bout the way some belt users wear the safety devices after 
examining 167 accidents in which at least one occupant was belted 
twentyone percent of the motorists wearing belts had too much 
slack in the shoulder harnesses and 7 percent of the occupants 
often children wore belts that were improperly routed behind the 
back or under an arm 
thirtyone states have laws requiring use of safety belts but 
ntsb chairman jim burnett said we have a lot of misuse and that 
problem has to be tackled 
overall the safety board said lapshoulder belts provide 
excellent protection with 80 percent of the belted occupants 
suffering minor or no injuries but the study suggested the results 
could have been even better were it not for improper wearing of 
belts 
the ntsb study was not a random sample and therefore does not 
necessarily translate into similar percentages for all motorists 
said lynne smith who was involved in writing of the report but 
she added the data are consistent with previous findings of 
widespread misuse 
the fourmember safety board urged the national highway traffic 
safety administration to require that safety belts meet standards 
for the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt 
systems be equipped with a pretension device that 
automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash 
the safety board questioned the widespread use among us 
carmakers of a belt design that allows a person to pull the belt 
out to its full length without it automatically retracting most 
foreign manufacturers use another design which automatically keeps 
the belt snug against the occupant but which has been criticized 
as being less comfortable and therefore less likely to be used 
the safety board said there is evidence indicating drivers aged 
50 years or older and female occupants are the most likely to 
misuse belts especially wearing them too loosely ms smith said 
that generally slack equal to no more than the width of a fist 
should be allowed in the shoulder belt 
a particularly high misuse of belts was found among children 
onethird had part of the belts behind the back or under an arm 
such misuse seriously degrades the protective capabilities 
of the lapshoulder belt reducing it to a laponly belt with 
inferior crash protection the safety board said 
nhtsa which issues auto safety regulations was reviewing the 
ntsb report said spokeswoman betsy tyson

a passenger vehicle 
some van converters start with a sheet metal box a motor and 
wheels and add seating sidewalls insulation wiring seat belts 
wood trim radios and tvs windows and exterior trim 
conversion van sales increased 13 percent in 1987 according to

matching dies were made for each of the components at least 50 
parts for each model which was then painted and handpolished 
among the models is that of the 1931 bugatti royale which 
weighed in a 7150 pounds and now valued at more than 8 million

the name game was played at the recent greater new york 
international automobile show would a car by any other name sell 
as well 
can you guess where the names come from 
volkswagen jetta was named after the jetstream as the scirocco 
came from the italian for a north african wind and the golf from 
the german golfstrom for gulfstream 
celestial bodies were the source for the toyota corolla the 
suns outer edge and the subaru alcyone part of the star cluster 
pleiades which adorns the subaru hood 
the bentley mulsanne s was named for the mulsanne straightaway 
at le mans site of five bentley racing wins and a region in 
southern france inspired the rollsroyce corniche 
a more scientific approach is taken by namelabs a san 
franciscobased consulting firm that sorts through thousands of 
morphenes a small meaningful word part to create an image the 
automaker wants to project the company has blended word parts to 
come up with names like sentra and acura among others

texans seem to be driven by stronger passions 
than the rest of the nation when it comes to cars and trucks 
according to a new survey they like pickups custom paint jobs 
car telephones and big hood ornaments 
the survey throughout the whole country shows that cars are 
important in other areas but texans really seem to be turned on 
about their cars said rick williams a marketing specialist for 
chevron usa inc which commissioned the survey 
the freewheeling tradition that people like sam houston and 
davy crockett carved out years ago continues to this day 
williams said 
the telephone survey taken in late may questioned more than 
1000 americans roughly half men and half women 
participants were asked to pick the vehicle they wanted from 
several choices given and to rate how well their choice fit their 
lifestyle 
another question listed several areas such as performance fuel 
economy appearance and maintenance asked people to rate how 
important it was 
a third listed several things such as the hood ornament and 
asked how much each appealed 
among texans 50 percent found a luxury car like a cadillac fit 
their lifestyle at least moderately well thats nearly 10 
percentage points more than americans overall 
texans also favored utility vehicles 723 percent vs 506 
percent pickup trucks 712 vs 532 sports cars 40 vs 336 
and basic american sedans 676 vs 637 
on the other hand 396 percent of americans found european 
luxury sedans like a mercedes very wellsuited to their lifestyle 
while 378 percent of texans surveyed agreed 
some 372 percent of texas drivers love their car phones the 
survey found while the devices found favor with 206 percent of 
americans overall custom paint work was favored by 202 percent of 
the texans while only 127 percent of americans found the paint 
mattered a lot 
overall 92 percent of respondents said they liked ornate hood 
ornaments while 145 percent of texans replied in the affirmative 
the margin of error for the overall survey was plus or minus 3 
percent a higher margin of error would apply to subgroups like 
texans

it is too early to say whether higher speed limits on rural 
interstate highways are unsafe but preliminary figures show only a 
1 percentage point difference in traffic fatality rates the 
transportation department reported the department said that during 
the first nine months of 1987 traffic fatalities on highways with 
the 65 mph limit rose 18 percent from a year earlier in the 37 
states that had adopted the higher speed compared with a 17 
percent increase in 11 states that had not 
however the 65 mph speed limit has not been in effect long 
enough to determine its longterm impact on safety said the 
report to congress required by a law allowing states to exempt 
some rural highways from the 55 mph national speed limit 
most of the states raised their speed limits in april and may of 
last year arizona california louisiana and new mexico accounted 
for 70 percent of the fatality increase in states that raised the 
rural speed limit the study said 
from jan 1 1987 to the time of the speed limit change 
fatalities had increased 10 percent from the corresponding period a 
year earlier after the speed limit was raised through sept 30 
1987 fatalities were 23 percent higher than a year earlier the 
study said 
the increase was statistically meaningful but the study 
cautioned against applying it to broad conclusions about the 
longterm effects of the higher speed limit 
while americans debate the pros and cons of a 55mph speed 
limit most west europeans legally drive much faster than that and 
theyve been doing so with a lower fatality rate than the united 
states 
west germans can go as fast as they want on their highway system 
known as the autobahn so long as they obey other traffic rules 
such as the proper use of directional signals when changing lanes 
elsewhere in western europe speed limits range from 866 mph in 
italy to 55 mph in ireland which does not have an extensive 
superhighway system 
the latest statistics of the 12nation european economic 
community for 1986 when a uniform 55mph limit was still in 
effect in the united states indicate a highway fatality rate of 
144 per 100000 population in contrast to 199 in the united 
states that year 
the 1986 highway death toll for eec nations with a total 
population of 320 million was 46046 in the united states with a 
popultion fo 242 million the motor vehicle fatalities numbered 
47900 
this past march however the us department of transportation 
said traffic fatalities in the united states for 1987 were the 
lowest in history as measured by 100 million miles of travel it 
put the rate by that measurement at 24 deaths compared to 25 in 
1986 33 in 1980 and 2408 in 1921 the first year the calculation 
was made 
the department attributed the 1987 decline to the increasing use 
of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving 
seat belts are required in most west european countries as they 
are in 32 us states and the district of columbia italy plans to 
require seat belts by september 1989 
many european countries also have stiff penalties for drunken 
driving

safety will be among the choices new car buyers will have this 
year according to the national coalition to reduce car crash 
injuries 
air bags and antilock brakes are two of the major safety 
devices that many manufacturers are offering threepoint rear seat 
belts will also be more commonplace this model year the coalition 
points out 
eleven of the worlds 17 largest automobile manufacturers will 
offer inflatable air restraint systems as either standard or 
optional equipment according to a study conducted by ralph nader 
consumer advocate 
four other manufacturers have committed to air bags beginning in 
1990 and general motors which offers them as options on the delta 
88 says it will offer 3 million cars with air bags by 1992 
antilock brakes were offered as standard or optional equipment 
by 17 of 23 auto manufacturers recently surveyed by the insurance 
institute for highway safety 
cary corbin coalition coordinator says most auto manufacturers 
are phasing in standard rear seat shoulder harnesses in the 1989

comparison shopping for an auto insurer can result in 
sharply reduced insurance costs 
while all auto insurance policies may appear similar quite 
the opposite is true says charles f wright assistant vice 
president aetna life amp casualty and a smart consumer can often 
save hundreds of dollars 
some of the moneysaving discounts offered by various companies 
he says include 
a total account credit to those who insure both car and 
home with the same company the credit differs from state to state 
wright says but is usually 10 percent off the auto premium or 5 
percent off both auto and homeowner premiums 
some companies offer a first accident forgiveness which 
after five continous accidentfree years guarantees that rates 
will not go up after a first atfault accident 
car pool commuters often qualify for discounts 
installing antitheft devices in your car may qualify you for 
a discount a 5 percent credit is typical for an alarmonly 
device or an active disabling mechanism which prevents the car from 
starting says wright some companies offer a 10 percent credit 
for a passive disabling device that automatically prevents the car 
from starting 
you can save money by insuring children who drive infrequently 
because they are away at school on the parents policy rather than 
separately 
check the companies that make discounts available to females 
between 30 and 64 years old who are the only drivers in the 
household 
good driver discounts are offered by some companies to drivers 
with accidentandviolation free records and to motorists driving 
fewer than a certain number of miles a year 
some states require discounts be given to drivers who take 
driver training or defensive driving courses 
drivers still at school may be entitled to a good student 
discount program by maintaining a high scholastic average

for the twoyear period 
in contrast the income of americas topgrossing executive

the home presley purchased in 1957 for 100000 that now is a

a judge monday postponed a hearing on the 
governments 3 billion lawsuit against union carbide corp seeking 
compensation for the 1984 gas disaster that killed 2800 people and 
injured more than 20000 
bhopal district judge mw deo reset the hearing for oct 1 
after both sides said the supreme court had yet to rule on appeals 
for interim relief to those injured in the worlds worst industrial 
accident 
the indian government is contesting a high court ruling that 
reduced interim relief from 35 billion rupees 270 million to 
25 billion rupees 192 million 
union carbide is challenging both awards saying the courts 
cannot order relief payment until responsibility for the leak has 
been determined 
a decision on the appeals is expected within a week advocate 
general am mathur told the judge 
the disaster occurred on dec 3 1984 when toxic methyl 
isocyanate gas leaked from the pesticide plant operated by union 
carbides indian subsidiary 
the government filed the lawsuit against union carbide in bhopal 
district court in 1986 after passing a law making it the sole 
representative of all the victims 
the government claims the accident was caused by negligence and 
filed criminal charges against seven carbide officials union 
carbide maintains the leak was due to sabotage by a disgruntled 
employee 
the government also has presented copies of claims filed by more 
than 5000 people injured in the accident and has asked the court 
to order union carbide to produce a copy of its insurance policy 
union carbide based in danbury conn earlier said it could 
not be sued because the bhopal plant was run by its subsidiary 
union carbide india ltd the government contends the insurance 
policy will prove that union carbide controlled the plant and 
therefore should pay compensation to the victims 
we will inform you at the next hearing on whether we are 
filing the insurance policy or not anil diwan a lawyer for 
union carbide told the judge

saudi arabia is intentionally exceeding its oil 
production quota in response to the breakdown in discipline within 
opec and in hopes of influencing an upcoming price committee 
meeting a respected oil industry newsletter said monday 
the petroleum intelligence weekly said saudi arabia is exceeding 
its quota in an effort to challenge other quota violators to stop 
overproduction the newsletter said the saudis are expected to 
offer to return to their quota only when other opec members do so 
meanwhile opec president rilwanu lukman said the organizations 
fivemember price committee will meet either on the indonesian 
island of bali or in vienna on sept 25 and 26 
lukman speaking on his arrival at the site of the asiapacific 
petroleum conference declined to be specific telling reporters 
why dont you ask subroto 
opec secretary general subroto currently is in the austrian 
capital 
although the price committee cant make pricing adjustments it 
has the authority to call a full meeting of all 13 members of opec 
oil prices rose last week when the meeting was announced 
reflecting the markets optimism that such a gathering could mean 
that the organization of petroleum exporting countries was 
interested in restraining output and raising world oil prices 
prices eased late in the week however partly in response to a 
statement from iraq that it would not go along with an opecimposed 
quota 
iraq as well as other opec countries have been exceeding their 
quotas dumping more than a million barrels of oil a day more than 
the market can absorb according to some analysts 
last week the saudis announced special discounts to some 
countries leading some analysts to speculate that opecs largest 
producer had given up its quota in favor of competing for market 
share 
the weekly newsletter said the saudis had violated their 
435millionbarreladay quota in order to influence the sept 25 
meeting but did not say by how much 
saudi arabia is expected to formally confirm its supply 
violation to fellow committee members the newsletter said 
lukman meanwhile took issue with the saudi report saying 
exceeding quotas was not the way to solve the oversupply problem 
lukman also said reports that opecs production had reached 20 
million barrels a day were exaggerated he declined to say how much 
the cartel is producing 
lukman also said unilateral efforts by opec to shore up the oil 
market through production quotas in the face of excess world supply 
allowed other producers to take a more than twothirds share of 
global production 
this he said sowed the seeds of the oil market crisis of 
1986 
lukman said he would be meeting with representatives of nonopec 
countries attending the appec sessions regarding the shaky crude 
oil market 
nonopec oil producers at appec include egypt malaysia and 
oman lukman declined to comment on the nature or extent of the 
meetings

japans powerful zenchu agricultural union said it 
plans to seek support from us farmers in its fight to protect the 
japanese rice market from foreign imports 
a spokesman for zenchu the central union of agricultural 
cooperatives said at a meeting monday it would send a team of 
representatives to the united states to seek support directly from 
american farmers 
the union monday also called for a demonstration by 1 million 
japanese in october to show their support for the unions stance 
last week the us rice millers association filed a complaint 
with the us trade representatives office under section 301 of 
the recently passed us omnibus trade law which requires the 
president to retaliate against a country failing to give equal 
access to its markets 
the us trade office turned down a similar complaint under the 
old section 301 before the omnibus trade law was passed 
union executive director tokuo matsumoto emphasized at the 
meeting that the rice growers have the support of japanese 
consumers 
matsumoto also said that the us market for corn and wheat 
is effectively closed so it is strange to criticize the closed 
nature of the japanese rice market 
matsumoto said it was impossible to make a simple comparison 
between prices in an open and closed market 
it is necessary to consider various factors such as wages and 
consumer prices in general he said

how many junior executives does it take 
to cross a stream with three wobbly boards 
about a dozen but wait till you try 
imagine getting a team of aggressive independentthinkers to 
stop overanalyzing the situation long enough to scramble across 
the creek in 20 minutes 
thats the mission of one outward bound exercise that comes with 
a package of adventure training here in the rocky mountains 
the creek crossing is part of a day of problem solving 
designed to force participants to work as a team in a rough very 
rough equivalent of a business crisis 
one team of managers that recently attempted the socalled 
acid river test included this reporter drafted by the 
associated press to experience the training firsthand 
our team made up of managers from a number of different 
companies ventured to the streams edge with another group from 
the champion spark plug co 
my group consisted of three people who ran their own businesses 
including a grandmother plus an insurance salesman two 
educators two program directors for philanthropic organizations a 
securities lawyer a utility executive and the chief operating 
officer of a gas pipeline company 
each team was given three boards which we could use to reach 
blocks strategically placed in the water if any board touched the 
water we had to forfeit it 
whats worse we had to bring the boards with us as we went 
since the boards werent long enough to simply lay end to end 
across the stream and if anyone fell into the water they would be 
penalized by being forced to wear a blindfold 
our team leader a woman in her late 20s was confounded like 
the rest of us while she was open to suggestions the route to dry 
ground proved more anguishing than a threeaspirin meeting with the 
boss 
first there was silence then frustration a sprinkling of 
debate and finally anxiety 
you have 10 minutes left shouted the instructors 
we quickly consigned an insurance salesman from florida to be 
our advance man since he seemed most fit and least likely to 
lose the boards in the drink as we experimented with different 
jerryrigged configurations 
the minutes clicked by though and it seemed obvious we just 
didnt have enough boards some of us were ready to give up 
the key came first to a woman who runs her own consulting 
business she saw that two boards placed in a tpattern would reach 
the blocks and allow us to complete a makeshift bridge with the 
third board 
grabbing each others shoulders or hands for support our group 
made it across with a few seconds left and yelped in triumph like a 
pack of day campers 
looking back on it there was no single leader no strategy by 
decree everyone did something to contribute in retrospect the 
solution seemed surprisingly obvious 
some of us also took comfort in the fact that the champion spark 
plug group got eaten by the acid

for a connecticut company that buys and 
sells used machinery an aging lathe or blast furnace may be just 
what the customer ordered 
in its 31 years in business the gavlick machinery corp has 
become a matchmaker of sorts introducing companies that have 
equipment to sell to firms that want the goods 
the whole fact of the matter is finding a buyer and seller and 
that can be done just as easily with the smaller pieces as with the 
larger ones said nancy e gavlick the companys assistant vice 
president 
the used machinery market is known for its breadth and gavlick 
spans it with divisions specializing in machinery for all kinds of 
industries machine tools video electrical equipment plastics 
graphic arts chemicals and data processing among others 
gavlick takes several different approaches to matchmaking 
sometimes it purchases equipment cold from companies knowing that 
it will be able to find buyers on other occasions gavlick brokers 
deals between companies or auctions off equipment for firms going 
out of business or closing plants 
if a machine doesnt suit the specifications of a prospective 
buyer gavlick is also equipped to rehabilitate or redesign it 
its as though were an arm of the client company or a 
department because we do everything from market research and 
valuation to even helping them sell their products said richard 
e gavlick the companys president and chief executive officer 
a former machine tool salesman gavlick founded the company with 
his father isadore t gavlick in 1957 now his daughter nancy 
also works there 
with 16 divisions and a computer database of more than 200000 
possible sellers and buyers around the world the privately held 
company prides itself in its ability to tackle tall orders 
for example the general electric co was seeking to phase out a 
specialized machinery line for producing wire for electrical 
conductors at the same time a chilean copper company wanted to 
phase one in gavlick put the sale together last year moving 
general electrics dipform line to metalurgica coplasa sa 
chile is one of the most important exporters of copper 
richard gavlick said metalurgica coplasas use of the dipform 
line could have a significant impact on the countrys copper trade 
and economy 
but while gavlick may have helped expand chiles economy 
another deal helped close down a segment of great britains 
in 1981 gavlick acted as coagent for the sale of 500 million 
worth of surplus steelingmaking equipment that once operated under 
the banner of the british steel corp the sale executed over two 
years cost workers in 14 steel mills across england their jobs 
not all gavlick deals have international consequences and its 
500000squarefoot warehouse in bristol is overflowing with 
machinery in all shapes and sizes being rebuilt or awaiting sale 
the company also has offices in miami and cleckheaton england 
with about 100 employees at the bristol headquarters and 40 
representatives abroad the company is ready to strike quickly when 
opportunity arises ms gavlick said 
were pretty much wide open and ready to go at a moments 
notice said ms gavlick who left a career as an account 
executive with a new york advertising firm to join her father in 
business were really going out and seeking opportunities 
rather than being reactive 
its the companys readiness that makes it attractive according 
to rudy eberstadt a former executive at microdot corp in 
greenwich conn a gavlick customer 
they stay in constant contact with the customers and they are 
on top of the market eberstadt said 
richard j callahan who heads business information services 
inc publisher of newsletters covering the wire fastener and 
supplier industries said gavlick is able to respond when a 
business suddenly booms and needs equipment fast 
when things turn around and you need it in a hurry theyll 
have it for you callahan said 
the company which would not disclose any financial figures has 
also seen its share of lean economic times a 1973 fire destroyed 
its 104000squarefoot complex in torrington conn and the 
downturn of the steel industry during the early 1980s hurt gavlick 
officials said 
gavlick said the company made a series of purchases in the early 
1980s and extended its credit only to face a shrinking market he 
said at the height of the depression in the steel industry gavlick 
sold machinery at a loss just to meet payroll 
he said the steel market is now on the upswing and gavlick 
machinery along with it 
the company whose sales are 60 percent foreign and 40 percent 
domestic has guided companies large and small through the sales 
process 
once general motors corp was looking for a market for its ring 
forging machine a device that produces the outer ring of a 
railroad car wheel bearing it got an offer of 225000 but 
gavlick recommended it hold out for 475000 
the machine was eventually sold for 400000 
we were seen as heroes richard gavlick said

the index of industrial production in the 
european economic community rose an estimated 35 percent in the 
first half of 1988 from the same period last year the eec said 
eurostat the trading blocs statistics agency said monday that 
by comparison industrial output in the united states rose 6 
percent in the first half and in japan by nearly 11 percent 
the increase in the eec index was led by a 61 percent jump in 
production of capital goods eurostat said output of consumer 
goods rose 32 percent and of intermediate products by 26 percent 
the index using 1980 as a basis year at 100 was calculated at 
1115 in june up from 1101 in may and an average 1074 for all of 
1987 
eurostat said the gains in output in the first half in the 12 
eec nations varied from 25 percent and 3 percent in west germany 
and france to around 5 percent in britain italy and spain and to 
nearly 10 percent in luxembourg and ireland 
the netherlands was the only eec country where industrial output 
fell in the first half it declined by 33 percent mainly because 
of a drop in natural gas production

two giant international airline reservations 
networks are to appear in european travel agencies next year but 
the debate is already raging over whether they will be a boon to 
air travelers 
the networks called galileo and amadeus will replace the 
fragmented reservation systems of europes national airlines which 
critics say discriminate against smaller airlines and hamper 
competition on this side of the atlantic where fares are higher 
than in the united states 
the two groups of european airlines backing the competing 
networks claim their technological sophistication will make travel 
agencies more productive and better inform travelers 
more important the airlines promise that the systems will be 
neutral meaning they wont favor individual carriers any airline 
will be able to have its flight information listed in these 
systems for a fee 
our ultimate customer is the person who chooses to travel or 
not to travel we want to make his journey more costefficient and 
timeefficient said justin dukes chief executive of galileo 
bernard anques strategic planner for amadeus says the system 
will enable the travel passenger especially the business 
passenger to have better products at a best price the consumer 
will be better off 
but not everyone is convinced that the new systems will foster 
competition critics say the smaller airlines will remain at a 
disadvantage because the new networks are owned largely by big 
carriers 
existing systems have been accused of burying competitors 
flight information or delaying its entry into the computer 
charging high fees to list competitors unfairly exploiting their 
access to competitors schedules and fares and locking travel 
agents into long contracts with high cancellation fees 
such criticisms have dogged the five airlineowned reservation 
systems in the united states where a congressional study recently 
criticized the systems for stifling competition and padding profits 
for their airline owners although the airlines that own the 
systems are prohibited from listing their flights first the 
systems still give those carriers a big advantage the study said 
critics of the european systems warn that because the two new 
networks are separate the skies will be ruled by two big blocs of 
airlines and that until they interconnect the traveler cannot be 
assured of access to the full range of flights available on a 
particular route 
hugh welburn managing director of travel trends international 
a london research firm said one of the effects is likely to be 
an increase in the power of the bigger airlines against the small 
basically they offer the provider of the systems an opportunity to 
handicap competitors especially smaller competitors 
ultimately experts predict galileo and amadeus will 
interconnect technological development is bound to provide means 
of linking these two systems the effect of that would be to make 
more choices available to the consumer welburn said 
swindon englandbased galileo whose airlines carry a total of 
120 million passengers a year is made up of shareholders british 
airways klm royal dutch airways swissair aer lingus alitalia 
austrian airlines olympic airways sabena tap air portugal and 
covia 
covia which operates the usbased apollo computer reservation 
system is 51 percent owned by united airlines 
madridbased amadeus whose airlines carry 91 million passengers 
annually is made up of partners air france iberia lufthansa and 
scandinavian airlines system plus eight associate airlines 
like other airlines the network owners will have to pay to use 
the system and have their flight information listed fees will vary 
depending on the services the customers take and the competitive 
conditions in the geographical area 
the owners believe the networks which also will include 
information about train ferry hotel and car reservations will 
make them money as the european airline industry slowly becomes 
deregulated which should encourage people to travel more 
more deregulation will bring a confusing array of new routes and 
fares which will have to be put into some kind of order if they 
are to be sold successfully 
already deregulation has spawned small independent airlines 
like virgin atlantic airways of britain the french air liberte 
and transaviaholland 
observers say fare wars could break out after 1992 when the 
12nation european economic community is to become one barrierfree 
marketplace of 320 million consumers 
us computer reservation systems were the first to enter the 
european market in pursuit of postderegulation opportunities 
united airlines and american airlines started selling their systems 
in europe in 1985 way ahead of galileo and amadeus 
underscoring how big the stakes are british airways refused to 
let american airlines sabre system issue british airways tickets 
even though it had been doing so in the united states until june 
when the two airlines reached a settlement 
the market is ripe for selling more automation since only 65 
percent of the international air transport associations iata 
10500 licensed travel agencies have computer terminals compared 
with almost all 26500 us agencies in the international airlines 
travel agent network 
systems already are going global for example amadeus intends 
to sign a cooperation agreement with abacus an asian system 
so far official efforts by the eec and others to produce codes 
of conduct to govern the new systems have been piecemeal and their 
conclusions may vary said david kyd an iata spokesman 
but proponents of the systems believe the new networks will aid 
consumers by moving more reservationmaking to the travel agents 
away from the individual airlines thus dampening the incentive for 
biased booking 
i think all competition tends to ensure that the consumer gets 
the best possible value if the customer can choose the best fare 
route that is what the system will ensure galileos dukes

august with a lift from fresh evidence that economic growth was 
slowing to a moderate pace 
the government reported a largerthanexpected decline in the

most analysts agree that the recent slackening in the pace of

the number of working oil and gas rigs showed the 
biggest singleweek decline since midjuly dropping by 17 to total 
921 as production was partially interrupted by preparations for 
hurricane gilbert baker hughes inc reports 
it was the lowest level reported since the count reached 894 on 
aug 1 baker hughes economist ike kerridge said monday 
the dip in the number of working texas rigs centered in the 
states gulf coast region signaling that weather played a factor 
in the lower numbers kerridge said the count probably would have 
plunged still lower if a more accurate method were available for 
recording offshore rig evacuations he added 
the offshore count really does not reflect the shortened rig 
count in the gulf due to hurricane gilbert kerridge said our 
feeling from what we have heard is that most of the rigs in the 
gulf were shut down at least a few days 
the count had increased by five in last weeks tally to total 
938 halting a monthlong trend of small declines 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
the rig count reached a peak of 4500 active rigs in december 
1981 which was the height of the oil boom but oil prices plunged 
to less than 10 per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the 
rig count went with it dropping to 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states louisiana had 11 fewer working 
rigs followed by texas 10 wyoming four oklahoma three and 
kansas which declined by one 
north dakota and pennsylvania both increased by four working 
rigs while ohio gained three and colorado california and new 
mexico added two apiece michigan gained one 
although texas declines primarily were reported along the coast 
kerridge said louisianas were scattered throughout the state

for a nation accustomed to enormous debts in its 
consumer business and government sectors the idea of 
trilliondollar social security surpluses tends to sound like a 
financial fairy tale 
the idea of a surplus anywhere in uncle sams books would be 
hard to accept but to believe that it will appear in the social 
security account just recently rescued from insolvency sounds 
utterly implausible 
but implausibility gets strained further the surplus talked 
about is in amounts almost incomprehensible not just to ordinary 
folks who have a difficult time adjusting to millions of dollars 
but even to actuaries 
as calculated by the social security administration the surplus 
could grow to 12 trillion in about 40 years and since the 
surplus would have to be invested in treasury securities it might 
absorb the entire national debt 
the scenario becomes more incredible with the federal deficit 
vanished a string of surplus years might occur in the next 
century forcing interest rates down and conceivably spurring or 
retarding economic growth 
but there is another side to the story too and it adds to the 
incredible nature of this financial phenomenon is it possible for 
highly trained actuaries to make multitrilliondollar errors could 
all this be a dream 
there are those who say it is writing for the heritage 
foundation a conservative think tank professor peter j ferrara 
of george mason law school calls the projections the great social 
security surplus hoax 
the trouble is that there is and will be no cash mountain 
he says those who think there will be have been misreading us 
government social security projections and do not understand 
federal budget accounting 
a study by donaldson lufkin amp jenrette a securities firm 
questions some underlying assumptions it claims estimates are 
based on an absence of recessions mortality rates that improve too 
slowly and an uninterrupted and unlikely increase in real wages 
of 14 percent a year 
in fact the social security administration itself offers a 
pessimistic scenario of slow growth and relatively high inflation 
that has the surplus peaking at 33 trillion in 2015 rather than 
at 12 trillion in the year 2030 
thats a difference of 87 trillion 
in the view of some who view the entire surplus projection as a 
pipe dream the huge range in official estimates demonstrates that 
sensible people should retreat from the future to more practical 
problems of the moment 
generally these critics argue that the projections are based on 
invalid assumptions regarding demographics health income 
interest rates fertility rates and a dozen other considerations 
many of them economic and political 
moreover they point out even if the surplus does accumulate to 
12 trillion by 2030 it might all disappear in payments to 
recipients over the following two decades that is any surplus 
would be temporary 
still critics say repeatedly politicians cannot be trusted to 
keep their hands off any pile of money inevitably it is said 
they would devise ways to spend it if you do not believe it they 
say you deserve to be hoaxed 
not taking any chances howard stein chairman of dreyfus corp 
commissioned a study of what an end to federal deficits might mean 
for investors to begin with longterm bonds would appear to be 
an extraordinary value 
an editorial in a newsletter for investors in dreyfus mutual 
funds this month warned there will be all sorts of ingenious 
proposals for diverting this money to worthy programs 
buttressed by equally ingenious arguments 
it reminded readers it really isnt the governments money 
it belongs to every working american man and woman today and in 
the future it suggested they be vigilant

a majority of americans believe immigrants 
have a negative impact on the economy and almost half said the 
newcomers contribute little to american culture according to a 
poll published today 
a lot of our old prejudices are still at work said maurice 
a roberts editor of interpreter releases a washingtonbased 
national immigration journal said of the los angeles times poll 
the poll surveyed 1418 people nationwide last weekend four 
months after the oneyear immigrant legalization program ended and 
two months after the government began full enforcement of sanctions 
against employers who hire illegal aliens 
asked whether immigrants get more or less from the us economy 
through social services and unemployment benefits than they 
contribute through taxes and work 64 percent of the respondents 
said immigrants take more than they give 
nineteen percent said immigrants contributed more while 4 
percent said immigrants benefited and contributed equally to the 
economy the rest of the respondents had no clear opinion 
according to the poll 
asked whether immigrants have made a contribution in the last 
decade to american culture 46 percent said they havent while 40 
percent said immigrants have enriched the culture the rest had no 
clear opinion 
the margin of error was four percentage points in either

unisys corp working to retain the loyalty of 
its big customers on monday announced faster mainframe computers 
as well as software that speeds up transactions such as airline 
reservations and banking 
however unisys announced a threemonth delay in its previously 
announced 2200400 computers which will be available by march 
instead of by the end of 1988 
the new 2200600 mainframe computers which had been delayed two 
or three years are expected to slow or stop the defection of 
unisys customers to other makers of big computers particularly 
international business machines corp said jay stevens an analyst

which are heavy users of a style of computing called online

hitachi ltd but unisys said it intends eventually to drop its 
reliance on the japanese company

new york new england and southern california have 
the highest ratio of housing costs to wages in the nation and are 
facing severe labor shortage because of it a new study shows 
while american business is spending billions to help house its 
workers it also is being impelled to join the lobby for federally 
sponsored housing reform which promises to be a major business 
concern of the 1990s according to the study published in the 
harvard business review 
some of the effects of the crunch include companies abandoning 
big cities managers refusing transfers from places like denver and 
houston to boston or san francisco and unions fighting for wage 
increases tied to the cost of housing 
the housing shortage continues to drive up wages drain the 
work force of every region it afflicts and force businesses to 
pour capital into ballooning recruitment and relocation budgets 
said the study which appears in the magazines septemberoctober 
issue 
calculating an affordability ratio of housing prices to 
wages the study found that boston anaheim calif hartford 
conn new york providence ri and san francisco are the 
leastaffordable places in the country to live 
in boston the median 1987 price of a singlefamily home was 
177200 while the average annual wage was 23148 for a ratio of 
77 that makes housing unaffordable according to the study since 
a household would need an income of 59449 to buy the average 
house 
the average national ratio was 42 85600 for the house with 
a 20615 income but a family still would need 28718 to afford 
the payments 
consequently businesses in highcost housing regions are 
spending billions of dollars to finance employee mortgages 
relocate workers around the country and subsidize incomes to help 
meet housing costs the study found 
often companies just cant lure people to work in places with 
expensive housing the study said 
many big and middlesized firms around the country are having 
a difficult time attracting employees peter dreier housing 
director for the boston redevelopment authority and one of the 
studys authors said monday 
an engineer who sells his threebedroom house for 80000 and 
moves to the east or west coast finds that for that money he can 
maybe get a onebedroom condominium 
dreier said 75 percent of bostonarea employers recently 
interviewed had raised wages or benefits beyond inflation 
adjustments because of the citys housing woes a new contract for 
the local hotel and restaurant workers union ties wages to housing 
costs rather than consumer prices 
the singlefamily house price in greater boston is the nations 
third highest behind honolulu and new york and rents average more 
than 800 a month for a twobedroom apartment a more than 25 
percent increase since 1981 the study said 
in the san francisco bay area only 15 percent of households 
could afford the 1987 median singlefamily home of 171400 and 
rents rose over 25 percent from 198186 the situation is similar 
in anaheim san diego and los angeles the report said 
its a very serious problem in the bay area said stephen 
barton a housing policy analyst with the bay area council a 
businesssponsored civic group concerned with housing employment 
and transportation 
to help fight the trend san francisco companies have worked 
with the nonprofit bridge housing corporation to create more than 
3000 units of housing in five years valued at 238 million 
but in the new york city area alone last year mobil oil 
international paper co jc penny co inc and lillian vernon 
corp all announced they were moving taking almost 4000 jobs from 
the area the grumman corp opened new engineering centers in texas 
and florida instead of near its bethpage li headquarters 
because of high suburban housing prices 
a hightechnology research consortium earlier this year cited 
housing as a reason for locating a 15 billion semiconductor 
research project in austin texas instead of greater boston 
the study criticizes the reagan administration for slashing the 
federal housingassistance budget 75 percent since 1980 to 8 
billion from 33 billion it says american business has 
shouldered much of the housing burden and calls for corporate 
leaders to lobby congress for a comprehensive housing policy for 
the rest of the century 
said dreier business needs to pay attention to housing not 
out of a sense of dogooderism or civic pride but out of concern 
for their own bottom line

an investor group trying to acquire interco inc 
for 26 billion warned the manufacturing company monday of 
unfortunate consequences if it proceeds with an antitakeover 
restructuring that includes asset sales 
you have refused to communicate with us concerning our 
interest in acquiring interco for nearly two months complained 
steven and mitchell rales the brothers who lead the takeover 
group cardinal acquisition corp in a letter to intercos board 
the letter was released publicly 
it was the rales response to an interco filing with the 
securities and exchange commission last week in which the st 
louisbased company disclosed the possibility of a defensive 
restructuring to thwart an unsolicited takeover 
interco said it had retained a group of unidentified bankers to 
explore how to finance the restructuring which could include the 
sale of assets such as the companys ethan allen furniture concern 
such a move could make interco a diversified manufacturer with 
products that also include london fog raincoats and florsheim 
shoes an unattractive acquisition target to the rales brothers 
washingtonbased investors known for their takeover forays 
their letter assailed what they called intercos vague 
references to a recapitalization plan which to date is only 
mythical not once have you provided stockholders with any 
information concerning timing or value 
the letter also reiterated that the rales groups 70ashare 
offer is good only for the company in its present form 
in order to avoid any unfortunate consequences should you 
decide to pursue asset sales we expect to be consulted well in 
advance so that we can evaluate the effect that any such sale would 
have on our offer the letter stated in addition we wish to 
participate in any such sale process with a full and fair 
opportunity to bid 
the group did not elaborate on the meaning of unfortunate 
consequences but presumably was warning of legal action or a 
shareholder proxy fight to block any restructuring that would spoil 
its strategy 
interco spokesman david garino said the company had no comment 
on the rales letter 
the rales group first moved to acquire interco in late july but 
the company has repeatedly rejected the overtures the group owns 
about 87 percent of intercos 384 million shares outstanding

the government said monday it had 
approved a joint venture that will permit the sale of the soft 
drink pepsicola in india 
food processing minister jagdish tytler said the project which 
also envisions production of food products was cleared after a 
meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs 
pepsico inc which makes pepsi soft drinks and fritolay snack 
foods said from its headquarters in somers ny that it first 
proposed a joint venture to the indian government more than three 
years ago 
its partners in the deal are the punjab governments 
agroindustries corp and the tata group one of indias largest 
industrial companies 
the agreement calls for an initial investment totaling 17 
million 
the project involves setting up agroresearch facilities a 
potato and grain processing plant a fruit and vegetable processing 
unit and a plant to manufacture softdrink concentrate 
in its announcement pepsico said the research facilities will 
be used to develop highyield crops and diseaseresistant seed 
varieties 
it said the potato and grain processing plant will make snack 
foods for local consumption while the fruit and vegetable 
processing plant will manufacture fruit juice concentrates and 
tomato paste mainly for export 
soft drink manufacture will occur locally through a group of 
franchised bottlers which will be supplied by an indian plant that 
produces soft drink concentrate pepsico said 
pepsicos share in the project is pegged at 399 percent in 
compliance with a law that limits foreign involvement in a joint 
project to 40 percent 
the project is to be based in the northern state of punjab a 
rich farming state which has seen its oncebooming economy 
shattered by six years of guerrilla warfare by sikh extremists and 
has been desperate to lure new industry 
tytler said the project would create 50000 jobs in india of 
which more than half would be in punjab 
indians were cut off from foreignmade sodas in 1977 when 
cocacola co pulled out rather than follow a government directive 
to dilute its ownership and reveal its secret formula 
last year double cola co from chattanooga tenn was allowed 
to sell in india under a special program to encourage investment 
from nonresident indians indian businessmen based in london 
secured the governments approval and have opened three plants 
pepsico will have to comply with some exacting conditions of the 
indian government 
the softdrink production will be restricted to 25 percent of 
the projects sales and exports of food products will have to be 
five times the value of imports 
the proposal was stalled for over two years by opposition 
politicians and domestic bottlers 
chandra shekhar leader of the opposition janata party 
describes the pepsi plan as a diabolical attempt to abandon the 
chosen path of selfreliance 
george fernandes also of the janata party said in a statement 
that his party would physically prevent the installation of 
facilities to produce pepsi in the country 
domestic indian sodamanufacturers had also tried to block 
pepsis entry into india we are a poor country and we need to 
develop industry our own industry and this is not the way 
ramesh chauhan owner of indias largest sodamaker parle exports 
private ltd said in an interview last year 
parle is estimated to control 60 percent of indias 460 million 
annual market for soft drinks and will probably be the hardesthit 
by the entry of pepsi into india 
but pepsi officials say their aim is to stimulate demand to 
double its present size and carve out a share of the increased 
market 
there was no indication whether pepsi would be able to use its 
brand name while marketing its cola the monthly india today 
magazine said in a recent article that the name pepsicola would 
give it an obvious advantage over local brands and be too 
much a symbol of multinational neocolonialism

csx corp said monday it would buy back up 
to 60 million of its common shares and sell off two natural gas 
units in a billiondollar restructuring that will allow the company 
to concentrate on its transportation business 
csx said it would begin repurchasing shares this week through a 
dutch auction in which shareholders are invited to offer their 
holdings at a price between 28 and 33 per share the company will 
choose one price and purchase up to 40 million shares offered at or 
below that price 
depending on market conditions the remainder of the 60 million 
shares would be purchased on the open market or in private 
negotiations officials said

198 billion 
investors reacted enthusiastically to the csx announcement and 
bid the companys stock up 375 a share to 3050 in new york 
stock exchange composite trading 
wall street analysts said the proposal would benefit csx 
shareholders

the dollar weakened marginally monday in scanty 
trading reflecting currencydealer reluctance to do much business 
ahead of some potentially significant meetings and economic reports 
gold prices eroded further persisting in a slide that has 
pushed bullion to the lowest levels in about 18 months republic 
national bank of new york quoted gold at 40920 a troy ounce as of 
4 pm edt down 255 from friday 
foreign exchange brokers said a spate of possibly marketmoving 
news expected during the week incited a cautious attitude toward 
the dollar 
aside from meetings planned by the international monetary fund 
world bank and the finance ministers of leading industrialized 
democracies the united states will report a final revision of 
secondquarter economic growth and the august rate of inflation in 
addition japan will report a range of economic statistics and 
britain will report its money supply growth figures 
there seems to be a thousand reasons not to trade and that 
seems to be what happened said john baker chief dealer at the 
new york branch of bank julius baer amp co 
some dealers said they were growing pessimistic about the 
dollars ability to strengthen they said the currencys failure to 
appreciate sharply in the aftermath of a large reduction in the 
us monthly trade deficit reported last week was viewed as a 
reason to start selling dollars 
in tokyo the dollar rose 004 yen to 13380 yen later in 
london it was quoted at a higher rate of 13390 yen but by the 
time trading ended in new york the dollar weakened to 13354 yen

soybean futures prices fell sharply monday on the chicago board 
of trade reflecting disappointment in the lack of foreign and 
domestic demand analysts said grain futures prices also declined 
on other markets gold and platinum futures retreated while 
silver rallied energy futures rose livestock and meat were mixed 
and stockindex futures advanced 
several soybean contracts traded down the permitted limit of 30 
cents a bushel during the session but recovered slightly before the 
close prices ended at their lowest levels since aug 23 
a lot of bulls are throwing in the towel backing away from 
the market said mario balletto soybean market analyst in new 
york with merrill lynch capital markets inc 
theres no buying showing up from users he said thats 
still the big lament in the market 
mickey luth soybean analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
chicago termed export sales and shipments lousy adding that 
the soybean market was beginning to feel pressure from the 
advancing harvest 
more soybeans usually come to market at harvesttime as farmers 
and grain handlers clean out their bins to make room for the new 
crop 
luth said the soybean markets recent pattern of long slow 
rallies followed by sharp breaks was typical of tightsupply years 
the agriculture department expects soybean production this year to 
be 23 percent below last years level 
the market has been trading in a broad range from 8 to 10 a 
bushel and is unlikely to go higher barring major problems with the 
brazilian soybean crop he said 
corn and wheat futures followed the soybean market but losses in 
wheat were limited by talk of new export business with morocco and 
algeria analysts said 
the usda confirmed after the close it had accepted bids from 
exporters on sales of 100000 metric tons of subsidized wheat to 
morocco and 50000 metric tons to algeria 
wheat settled 1 cents to 6 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in september at 396 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 7 
cents lower with september at 271 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 
6 cents lower with september at 252 a bushel soybeans were 12 
cents to 28 cents lower with september at 821 a bushel 
gold futures prices declined for the fourth straight day on new 
yorks commodity exchange and posted new 18month lows 
but gold appeared oversold from a technical standpoint said 
stephen platt an analyst in chicago with dean witter reynolds inc 
it looks like youve basically exhausted the downside momentum 
for now he said 
precious metals futures all opened lower on monday but drew 
support from a late firming of crude oil prices platt said silver 
closed higher gold finished slightly lower and platinum was down 
sharply 
the platinum market seemed like it finally caught up with some 
of the weakness in both gold and silver he said 
platinum traded on the new york mercantile exchange settled 
1310 to 1490 lower with october at 503 a troy ounce 
gold settled 270 to 310 lower with october at 41020 a troy 
ounce silver was 05 cent to 35 cents higher with september at 
637 a pound 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 16 cents higher with october at 
1473 a barrel heating oil was 01 cent lower to 12 cent higher 
with october at 4136 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 25 
cent lower to 15 cent higher with october at 4424 cents a gallon 
live cattle prices were mostly lower with october and december 
deliveries hardest hit in response to fridays monthly usda 
cattleonfeed report 
the report showed fewer marketings and fewer cattle placed on 
feedlots during august than the futures market had expected the 
numbers suggested supplies of slaughterready cattle would remain 
plentiful through the end of the year then tighten a bit early 
next year 
hog futures also wee mixed partly in anticipation of the usdas 
quarterly hogs and pigs report which will be released sept 30 
analysts said while frozen pork bellies declined in a technical 
selloff 
live cattle settled 35 cent lower to 10 cent higher with 
october at 69 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 55 
cent higher with september at 7985 cents a pound hogs were 30 
cent lower to 27 cent higher with october at 3767 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 70 cent to 120 cents lower with february 
at 4952 cents a pound 
stockindex futures advanced slightly on the chicago mercantile 
exchange with the contract for december delivery of the standard amp 
poors 500 index settling 20 point higher at 27185 points

a federal judge on monday ordered the loreal 
cosmetic company to pay 21 million to an illinois hair care 
business for copyright infringement and barred the french 
corporation from selling its zazu line of products in the 
united states 
were happy to have this verdict said james fitzgibbon the 
attorney for zazu designs a hinsdale illbased hair salon that 
also manufacturers and sells hair care products this was a case 
where the evidence unquestionably supported the findings 
in a 26page decision us district judge prentice marshall 
ruled that parisbased loreal took an arbitrary exciting mark 
which belonged to plaintiff and destroyed it 
it regarded plaintiff zazu as a small town nuisance 
marshall said 
he ordered loreal to pay zazu designs 100000 for lost 
profits 1 million to help the firm restore the trademark and 1 
million in punitive damages 
the judge also ordered loreal to stop selling its zazu products 
and ordered the firm to remove them from store shelves around the 
country 
neither loreal officials nor their attorneys could be reached 
for comment on the ruling monday night no one answered at the 
offices of the companys new york attorney russell falconer 
loreal had moved to dismiss the case on grounds that it was not 
subject to the jurisdiction of the northern illinois district 
court marshall noted but he said the motion was denied because 
defendant loreal is present in this district and has committed 
the wrongful acts attributed to it in this district 
zazu designs hair salon was founded in 1979 by raymond koubek 
and salvatore segretto and the name was registered with illinois 
authorities 
the store quickly became known in the chicago area and its 
revenue increased from 40000 the first year to 450000 in 1986 
and 600000 in 1987 according to court documents 
koubek and segretto represent the great american dream 
marshall wrote in his decision they have taken their skills 
undergone extensive training and emerged as very successful 
entrepreneurs in a highly competitive business 
in 1985 koubek and segretto began selling hair care products 
bearing the zazu trademark the same year loreal began planning 
its line of hair cosmetics a year later loreal chose zazu as the 
name for its new products court records showed 
in their investigation into whether the trademark was available 
loreal officials called zazu designs but did not speak to the two 
owners all that was asked was whether zazu products were sold at 
the store the judge said 
the investigation was perfunctory cursory and of little or 
no value marshall said plaintiff zazu was looked upon as a 
nettlesome fly to be brushed aside despite the fact that it had 
registered the mark zazu in the very industry that defendant 
intended to enter under that identical name
