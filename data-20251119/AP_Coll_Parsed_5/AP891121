japanese lumber mills are paying three or 
four times us prices and trees worth millions of dollars cut 
from national forests may be exported illegally each year at a cost 
of american jobs 
northwest timber exports in 1988 were at least 43 billion 
boardfeet up 20 percent from 1987 most of that was legal cut 
from private and state lands or under limited authorization from 
national forests but federal law requires that national forest 
timber be milled in the united states 
since its illegal nobody really knows how much is going off 
the docks as a wild estimate i would imagine that maybe 5 percent 
might be federal logs youre talking about 115 million to 120 
million in lost revenue said chuck sisco a forester for the 
national audubon society 
ted ladoux a spokesman for the northwest independent forest 
manufacturers association disputes that estimate 
there are people that have made claims that some are being 
exported he said our opinion is that if it is occurring it 
is a real small percentage we dont think its a major problem 
but three men are awaiting trial in montana on charges of 
diverting more than 500000 boardfeet of national forest timber 
for illegal export and the us forest service says it doesnt 
know for sure how big the problem is there are no fulltime law 
enforcement agents assigned to illegal export 
we still dont have the blessing of the powersthatbe to go 
ahead with it to any great extent said john mccormick an 
investigator at the agencys office in portland ore adding that 
congress generally sets the priorities 
they control the purse strings mccormick said during the 
summer months drugs are our priority practically everyone is 
working on drugs primarily marijuana growing 
forest service uncertainty over exports comes amid timber 
shortages blamed for layoffs sawmill closures and increased 
industryconservationist rancor 
people could get killed out there if more trees arent made 
available said a speaker at the annual meeting of the montana wood 
products association 
the region may suffer shortages at sawmills but not at the 
docks 
exports of raw logs from the pacific northwest to pacific rim 
countries jumped from 37 billion boardfeet in 1987 to 43 billion 
boardfeet in 1988 said us rep peter defazio dore a fourth 
of all trees cut in oregon and washington were exported in 1988 at 
a cost of up to 30530 mill jobs he said 
roughly a fifth of the timber from the 12 western states is 
exported the western wood products association says 
the audubon societys sisco said commerce department figures 
used by the forest service frequently underreport log exports and 
he put the total at 5 billion boardfeet in olympia wash for 
example audubon society researchers found exports of 230 million 
boardfeet two years ago while the commerce department and forest 
service reported around 26 million boardfeet he said 
logs from federal lands are illegally included in the exports 
since they add up to a lot of money very quickly said doug 
marke with the logs sitting there people dont look 
youre talking about a serious amount of money being lost 
either to the government or money being drained from the timber 
industry marker said 
sisco said its such big money that is why the big companies 
have essentially closed their mills and theyre into log exports 
now the log exports bring so much more money than the lumber 
would bring 
he said that the japanese pay at least three and four times 
the us market price and that political pressure has blocked 
enforcement of the export ban on federal timber 
congressional pressure to enforce the ban is mounting said 
us rep pat williams dmont who wants the annually renewed ban 
made permanent the most important reason why congress has not 
pressed on this is because frankly timber companies do not make 
one peep in support of proper enforcement of the export ban law 
the same timber company that will argue about job losses 
because of environmental standards creates many many times that 
job loss due to their exporting logs which also happens to be a 
very profitable operation 
a general accounting office report on job loss and law 
enforcement related to federal timber exports is due this month 
and a senate banking subcommittee held hearings nov 7 on proposals 
by sen bob packwood rore to let states prohibit export of 
stateowned logs and to make the federal ban permanent 
public lands should contribute to addressing public needs 
oregon gov neil goldschmidt testified adding there is a real 
timber supply need in the pacific northwest right now 
timber that is harvested from our federal and state lands can 
make an important contribution to meeting this need he said 
limiting exports is one positive way to do this while protecting 
other nontimber resources and saving american jobs 
defazio and williams have introduced companion measures in the 
house 
the statetimber bill would legitimize alaska oregon 
california and idaho laws requiring instate processing of logs 
said a packwood aide jon stephens 
meanwhile in what prosecutors believe is the first trial of its 
kind three washington men are to go on trial nov 20 in helena on 
charges of conspiring to export unprocessed federal logs to japan 
john tortorelli of bellevue winston bentley of spokane and roger 
britz of orting were indicted on charges in the shipment of 558515 
boardfeet of timber from national forest in montana 
there are only so many logs for our mills said us 
attorney pete dunbar if they are exporting logs illegally 
doesnt that take away from the capability of montana mills

were it not for one violent day 
in 1985 evelina de bruin would be like countless other black south 
african women an illiterate maid in her 50s raised in a isolated 
farming district mother of 10 
today she is the only woman on death row alone confused and 
ill her prison cell in pretoria is the farthest shes ever been 
from home 
she cannot eat she cant sleep said her lawyer andrea 
durbach of cape town its a very dramatic thing to say but i 
used to think to myself that shes just going to die of a broken 
heart 
mrs de bruin and 13 men were sentenced to death in may for the 
mob killing in november 1985 of a black policeman lucas sethwala 
in paballelo the black section of the remote northwestern town of 
upington 
twentysix people were tried for the killing and four men were 
found to have physically contributed to the death of sethwala who 
was chased from his home stoned beaten and set afire 
in addition to those four mrs de bruin and nine others were 
convicted of murder under the doctrine of common purpose which 
holds them responsible because they were part of the crowd that 
sought to kill sethwala 
sethwalas death occurred at a time of nationwide black unrest 
hours before he was slain several thousand blacks gathered at a 
soccer field in paballelo to protest rent increases and other 
grievances 
after police dispersed the crowd with tear gas about 300 people 
regrouped around sethwalas home and threw stones to force him 
outside 
militant blacks have frequently attacked black policemen 
accusing them of collaborating with the government and its 
apartheid policies 
mrs de bruin and her commonlaw husband who also has been 
sentenced to death were identified as having thrown stones at 
sethwalas house according to the states evidence she allegedly 
yelled the dog is in the house bring him out and burn him 
alive 
mrs de bruin testified during the trial that she and her 
husband went back to their own house after the protest meeting was 
broken up and were not present at sethwalas home 
mrs de bruin who had no previous criminal record and worked 
for the same white family for 30 years has little understanding of 
what is happening to her ms durbach said 
mrs de bruin suffers from arthritis heart disease and has high 
blood pressure the lawyer said she does not know in what city her 
prison is and thinks shes been imprisoned for at least a year 
when in fact it has been six months 
she sees her husband for 30 minutes once a month they are 
separated by a window and communicate through microphones only 
three of her 10 children have been able to visit her ms durbach 
said 
because she cannot read and is too ill to exercise mrs de 
bruin does little but listen to governmentrun radio that is piped 
into her cell said ms durbach who visits her every three weeks 
she has been treated well by the prison staff and has developed 
a good relationship with one of the guards ms durbach added 
a judge ruled in september that the 14 people sentenced to death 
could appeal their sentences but a bail request for mrs de bruin 
was turned down 
two psychologists testified at her bail application that she had 
suffered mental and physical deterioration including memory loss 
since her imprisonment 
ms durbach said no date has been set for the appeal but she 
hopes it could be early next year 
in a similar mob killing the appeal court the countrys 
highest court last year upheld under the common purpose 
doctrine the death sentence of six blacks known as the 
sharpeville six 
however after a storm of domestic and international protest 
thenpresident pw botha commuted their death sentences to lengthy 
prison terms 
the last woman to be executed in south africa was sandra smith 
25 who was of mixed race she was hanged in june after being 
convicted of joining her boyfriend in the brutal knife murder of a 
teenager 
more than 50 people mostly black have been executed so far 
this year and more than 100 were hanged in each of the previous 
three years 
botha and his successor fw de klerk have commuted 54 death 
sentences this year

a massive offensive left no 
doubt about the salvadoran guerrillas military capacity and drove 
home their point that serious negotiations and government 
concessions are necessary to end the 10yearold civil war 
and the killings of six jesuit priests during the offensive 
galvanized opposition in the united states to continued aid for the 
rightist salvadoran administration which must be considered plus 
for the leftist rebels 
but the farabundo marti national liberation front paid a high 
price for its achievements they turned densely populated urban 
districts into battlefields and the lives of tens of thousands of 
workers became a weeklong nightmare of death and destruction 
residents of soyapango zacamil mejicanos and ciudad delgado 
the humble neighborhoods devastated by the fighting that began nov 
11 were angry at a government that sent warplanes to strafe and 
bomb guerrilla positions amid their homes 
but those same residents seem to have saved most of their 
resentment for the rebels 
we just want the boys to leave so we can go back to work 
and finish raising our children said porfirio alvarez as he fled 
with his wife and two daughters from zacamil 
the guerrillas maintained fortified positions in and around a 
complex of lowincome apartment blocks there for four days 
virtually the entire noncombatant population evacuated under fire 
when it appeared most of the civilians had left government 
forces subjected zacamil to a sixhour barrage of bazookas rockets 
and cannon fire that left the complex smoldering and practically 
ruined 
i know women whose sons are with the guerrillas and i see how 
they worry about their children and suffer when they are killed 
theyre human too but because of them we almost get killed if 
they would not have come this would not have happened said 
marta rodriguez sweeping her arm across her humble cinderblock 
soyapango home hit by bullets and shrapnel 
it is difficult to imagine that the rebels made many converts in 
neighborhoods where the fighting was heaviest but guerrilla chief 
facundo guardado interviewed at his command post near mejicanos 
said the display of strength organization and morale was 
motivating adolescent men and women to incorporate themselves 
into the struggle 
i hold the fmln in high regard professionally retired us 
army gen fred woerner told the associated press last week 
the war cannot be resolved militarily said woerner who 
drew up a strategic plan for the war in 1981 and was head of the 
us southern command in panama until the end of september 
woerner said the guerrillas cannot be overcome until the roots 
of war unfair distribution of wealth and pervasive social 
injustice are addressed 
in what appears to have been a response to the insurgent push a 
squad of assassins murdered and mutilated six jesuit priests and 
educators considered leftist ideologues by the countrys rabid 
right 
two witnesses who for the moment remain in hiding reportedly 
saw men in army uniform commit the massacre 
the time has arrived for president alfredo cristiani to make 
good on his promise to control those officials in his government 
and in his party who in a good measure are responsible for the 
civil war sen christopher dodd dconn said after the 
slayings 
in a time of reduced foreign aid we must ask ourselves what 
it is we are achieving with the dollars we send said sen john 
kerry dmass 
but president bush said the united states should not undermine 
a fragile democracy by withdrawing aid and on monday the house 
voted narrowly against restricting military aid but the debate was 
bitter and at times personal and the issue had clearly become 
controversial again 
the united states has provided more than 35 billion in 
economic and military aid to a succession of salvadoran governments 
this decade it is generally conceded even by us officials that 
the rebels would have won the war by 1985 had it not been for 
massive us assistance 
the guerrillas said this year they are willing to abandon armed 
struggle and convert the fmln into a political party in exchange 
for sweeping political economic and social reform 
rebel and government representatives sat down together in 
september and october to try to find a way toward peace 
the government rejected the possibility of fundamental overhaul 
of the reigning system and limited its negotiating position to a 
demand that that the rebels lay down their arms and join the 
democratic process 
when a bomb killed 10 unionists at a leftist labor federation 
the rebels broke off talks 
pope john paul ii late last week issued a call for truce and an 
exhortation to both sides to resume peace talks 
gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary bishop of san salvador said 
both sides have agreed in principle to heed the popes call and to 
accept the church as mediator 
but the means of working this out are complicated and causing 
us a lot of work rosa chavez said sunday 
the rebel offensive against the capital appeared all but over by 
early this week it did not bring down the cristiani government 
but left it shaken 
with the capital and several provincial cites besieged and 
paralyzed and a protracted standoff apparently the best the armed 
forces could manage leaders of the countrys business and 
industrial sectors reportedly talked with military and political 
elements about replacing the government with a provisional regime 
diplomats said discussion of such a change whether peacefully 
or by a coup was preliminary a kind of worstcase contingency 
but that it was talked about at all is another indication the 
guerrillas delivered a telling blow

a nights stay costs 160 if you use the 
hot tub and summer reservations must be made months in advance 
but once youre at rockwell lighthouse the price and the wait seem 
a bargain 
the privacy of the island lighthouse its 360degree view of 
sitka sound and the peaceful symphony of waves and sea birds are 
enough to warm even the coldest of hearts 
since it was completed in 1985 rockwell lighthouse really a 
house although it does have a navigation light for sailors has 
been the site of 14 weddings dozens of honeymoons and bunches of 
affairs says owner burgess bauder 
bauder built it because he loves lighthouses and couldnt figure 
what else to do with rockwell island a threequarteracre clump of 
rock spruce and driftwood less than a mile from sitkas waterfront 
he bought the island on speculation in 1973 for 3000 then a 
decade later was unable to sell it at a profit thank god we 
didnt because this has turned out better than any business 
venture he said 
bauder the town veterinarian and an occasional carpenter began 
building the fourstory woodframe structure in 1983 an architect 
provided a scale drawing in exchange for bauder spaying his dog 
except for some help with the framing bauder did all the 
construction himself 
the project raised some eyebrows in this scenic southeast alaska 
fishing port and mill town about 90 miles south of juneau 
there were three people who through the grapevine told me that 
it was a potential eyesore because it was visible from all over 
town bauder recalled and now its the most photographed home 
in sitka 
in spite of virtually no advertising rockwell lighthouse also 
has become the most hardtoget overnight lodging in the alaska 
panhandle its open yearround but summer reservations are 
recommended four to five months in advance most of next august 
already is booked 
although the lighthouse was built primarily as a romantic 
getaway its little red beacon does aid mariners entering the 
islandstudded sound the coast guard even commissioned the 
building in july 1985 making it sort of an honorary lighthouse 
the whiteandred lighthouse is a cozy escape from sitkas 
weather which usually is wet and cool even in summer the interior 
walls are covered with cedar black walnut hemlock fir the 
spiral lattice staircase is handmade of philippine mahogany 
its a cut above rustic bauder said modestly 
there are all the amenities of home except a television dont 
even think of asking bauder if you can bring one 
i say if you want to watch television why even go out there 
the background music with the stereo system is an imperative to me 
but the visual youre inundated with the visual everywhere you 
look bauder said 
the entire lighthouse rents for 125 per night for up to five 
people the hot tub is an extra 35 
above the round living room is the tower with three small 
bedrooms including an intimate cupola room with 10 picture windows 
affording the 360degree view 
the lighthouse boosted bauders reputation for being somewhat 
eccentric a description he savors 
for sure he said eccentric away from the center but 
thats not by design thats just who i am 
the success of his island retreat has exceeded even bauders 
expectations 
it is a romantic place he said it is private it is 
beautiful at the risk of paraphrasing john denver it fills up 
your senses 
in the living room is a collection of guest books filled with 
the remembrances of hundreds of visitors 
they tell of sunny views of volcanic mount edgecumbe of nights 
spent weathering violent winter storms gushing newlyweds declare 
their love with words and little hearts wouldbe poets try their 
hand at verse 
we cannot tell you how much we enjoyed our stay the fog the 
beautiful views the eaglewatching a florida couple wrote 
when were back home in the terrible heat well think of july 
in sitka with the fireplace roaring

palestinian youths 
unseen behind a row of tinroofed shanties showered a squad of 
israeli soldiers with stones and taunted them with curses 
the israelis encumbered with automatic rifles riot helmets and 
tear gas canisters lumbered around a corner in pursuit but the 
teenagers had vanished 
musing about the elusiveness of the palestinians brig gen 
ehud gross chose a quotation from shakespeares macbeth the 
earth has bubbles whither are they vanished 
the soldiers frustration at such encounters became quickly 
apparent as gross the armys chief education officer gathered a 
dozen troops under a tree to talk about army orders limiting the 
use of force in battling the palestinian uprising 
i think our hands are tied you cannot do anything you dont 
fire because youre not allowed to said pvt eitan 21 cradling 
his riot helmet as he leaned on his galil rifle 
defending the orders not to fire on stone throwers unless their 
lives were in danger gross asked so whats wrong with that 
you dont capture anyone all day long you go around and 
around and you dont catch anyone said eitan whose full name 
could not be used in keeping with army regulations 
as he spoke stones smacked into the dirt near the gathering 
first singly then in flurries two soldiers stepped out of the 
semicircle and gave chase they returned emptyhanded all the 
while there was whistling which is used by palestinian lookouts to 
signal that soldiers were in the camp 
gross asked if the soldiers believed they should be given more 
freedom to respond and what the consequences might be 
a soldier wearing sunglasses argued that troublemakers those 
who deserve it should be punished even beaten 
im not saying shoot to kill but make it seriously painful for 
them and not give them two slaps on the face he said 
the army recently allowed soldiers to open fire with live 
ammunition against masked palestinian activists who refused orders 
to halt but most stonethrowers dont wear masks 
other soldiers protested that tougher action would only increase 
the hostility of the population escalate violence and undermine 
the morality of the army 
they are limitations on the use of force because thats how 
we were educated we were not educated to kill especially women 
and children said one soldier we are a moral army 
in the course of the twoyear uprising 615 palestinians have 
been killed in encounters with israelis and 42 israelis have been 
slain by palestinians thousands on both sides have been wounded 
gross said pentup desires for revenge were natural 
its not a shame to be angry and feel a tremendous urge to 
beat someone but its important to control yourself he said 
no matter what political solution emerged gross said israelis 
and palestinians would have to live together we have to try to 
avoid the expansion of circles of hate he said 
during the uprising 530 officers and soldiers out of nearly 
100000 who have served in the occupied lands have been disciplined 
for overstepping the oftenambiguous limits on the use of force 
army officials say 
punishment criticized by liberals for being inadequate has 
ranged from loss of pay vacation or rank to a maximum jail term of 
two years 
a captain speaking at a gaza strip military base unbuttoned 
his shirt pocket to reveal a wad of written orders one booklet 
stresses soldiers have no right to use force in order to punish 
and that army units should not humiliate the arab population or 
damage property 
the captain also named eitan conceded some violations go 
unreported because officers are reluctant to undermine morale by 
reporting the misdeeds of their soldiers 
basically we rely on the humanity of the soldiers and the 
commanders he said 
during the threehour patrol in the beach camp where 41000 
palestinian refugees live along the sandy mediterranean shoreline 
soldiers walked dirt streets alongside open sewers and squeezed 
down passageways so narrow they couldnt carry their rifles 
sideways 
the patrol first encountered hostile looks then stones and 
curses the soldiers aimed their rifles threateningly but did not 
fire 
before the patrol began there were no signs of unrest and the 
openair market was jammed with shoppers 
the calm appears real but in fact the palestinians had 
created a private army inside with masked people walking around in 
the daylight they started to run the daily life and soon they 
would have appeared with weapons said lt col bouzi a unit 
commander interviewed in a tent encampment nearby 
he said his soldiers had wounded 30 palestinians with plastic 
bullets in efforts to establish order during the units first week 
in beach camp he also criticized a previous unit that refrained 
from entering the camp because of the outward calm 
with all due respect to the quiet if you dont get in once or 
twice a day and show them that we can go there whenever we want 
they will take the initiative

superstar french chefs paul bocuse and joel 
robuchon and the swiss fredy girardet have been named chefs of 
the century by the gaultmillau guidebook 
the honor also was a return to grace for bocuse because the 
quide gave him back his fourth toque or chefs hat the toque is 
gaultmillaus symbol for excellence and bocuse was demoted to 
three toques by last years guide 
according to the guidebooks president and editor christian 
millau bocuses problem last year was turning out the same basic 
menu for years while other chefs were getting ahead with new ideas 
known as the emperor of cuisine bocuse also was criticized 
for travelling around the world rather than tending to his stock 
pots at his restaurant near lyon 
bocuse accused millau of always bringing his dog to the 
restaurant and not asking for the bill but the spat simmered down 
as millau and bocuse kissed and made up 
i was very happy to be named a chef of the century and weve 
settled our differences said bocuse but the century isnt 
over yet he added i think theres room for more of us up 
there 
he said he was flattered to be in the company of two legendary 
chefs who were posthumously named chefs of the century auguste 
escoffier and fernand point escoffier was the master of us 
all said bocuse and point was the first chefowner who ran 
his own show before that chefs were hidden away as restaurants 
were owned by maitre ds or entrepreneurs 
bocuse deserves his place at the top said millau who said 
his guidebook was celebrating its 20th anniversary he is an 
exceptional personality who has done more than anybody else to 
promote french cuisine abroad 
but i consider robochon and girardet more creative and 
visionary chefs added millau especially robuchon who has 
known how to marry traditional cuisine with new tastes 
robuchon made quite a name for himself by bringing back the 
mashed potato as a gourmet favorite on menus with other 
specialties like sweetsour migononettes of venison and hot 
foie gras with cream of lentils 
all three chefs of the century are regularly awarded the top 
three stars in the michelin considered the bible of guidebooks 
gaultmillau nearly as wellknown in france as the michelin 
has a circulation of about 200000 versus 720000 for the michelin 
the venerable guidebook that was first published in 1900 
gaultmillau is avidly read for its picturesque and peppery 
commentaries a different style from the michelin whose terse 
listing is a very serious reference for gastronomes in a country 
that takes its gastronomy seriously 
at least 1200 french chefs and 15000 guests packed an 
exhibition hall last week at the futuristic la defense area west of 
paris for the gaultmillau awards followed by a tasting of regional 
food and wines 
i have special prizes for our top chefs announced millau 
provided they promise not to eat them he presented each with a 
live bresse rooster a symbol of france raised in the region known 
for producing its most succulent poultry bocuse looked his fowl 
right in the eye claiming to hypnotize it 
in the highest category of four toques and a grade of 195 out 
of 20 gaultmillau listed 13 restaurants for 1990 adding three new 
establishments the auberge de leridon at annecy the auberge de 
lill at illhaeusern in alsace and the cote dor at saulieu in 
burgundy country 
no restaurants fell from the fourtoque category this year but 
three famous gourmet meccas were demoted from three toques to two 
le grand vefour laurent and la maree all in paris

turkeys are topical right now but farmers 
say americas growing preoccupation with health has turned the 
birds into a yearround moneymaker 
gary twist who has 8000 toms fattening up for market says 
hes learned turkeys are quite a bit smarter than most people think 
theyre very sociable docile and interested when people 
come in here said twist the old wives tales we heard werent 
true theyre intelligent and we enjoy them 
so do consumers per capita consumption of turkeys has risen 
from 85 pounds in 1975 to 17 pounds a year in 1989 
people are seeing turkey as a healthy economical alternative 
to red meat said laurie wilson of the national turkey 
federation there also are a lot more products available and 
thats what people want variety and convenience 
whole turkeys still are popular for holidays like thanksgiving 
and christmas but the real growth in the turkey industry has been 
with products like turkey ham hot dogs sausage bacon and fresh 
breast cutlets 
farmers raised 164 million turkeys in the united states in 1982 
and the flock increased to 255 million birds this year 
twist whose turkeys end up in hospital meals and fastfood 
turkey sandwiches expects to raise about 80000 of the birds this 
year 
the twist family has been farming in dewitt county since 1852 
chickens were added to the grain farm in 1969 and commercial egg 
production began in 1973 twist said turkeys seemed a perfect way 
to balance the fluctuations in egg and grain markets 
its one area of our business where we dont have to listen to 
the noon news to see if were profitable said twist who raises 
the turkeys for trevcam a company based in forrest 
young turkeys hatched by the company are shipped to twists 
starter building where they are fed and kept warm for eight weeks 
they then move to the two 50 by 480foot finishing buildings 
where they eat a cornsoybean mixture reaching market weight of 
about 27 pounds in a total of 18 weeks 
they are slaughtered and processed in indiana 
twist said he is paid 9 cents a pound for the finished birds 
and it costs about 3 cents to raise them

victor stello jr will get another chance in 
january to plead his case to head the governments nuclear weapons 
production program following the bush administrations failure to 
win quick senate confirmation 
the senate armed services committee announced monday it would 
not act on the nomination before the holiday recess which is 
expected to start before thanksgiving 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman said more time was 
needed to analyze newly received documentation on stello who 
appeared before the panel last wednesday nunn said further 
hearings on stello would be held after congress returns jan 22 
we have an incomplete record now nunn said 
stello did not return a reporters telephone call monday after 
nunns announcement 
energy secretary james d watkins in an unusual personal appeal 
to the committee at stellos confirmation hearing last week said 
he urgently needed a confirmed chief of nuclear weapons production 
to carry out needed reforms 
in a statement issued on monday watkins said stellos 
nomination was one of my top priorities and said he expected 
him to be confirmed when congress reconvenes 
i am certain that additional hearings will prove that the 
accusations raised in the waning hours of this session are those 
same accusations investigated years ago and resolved watkins 
said 
there was no indication monday whether the white house would 
install stello in the job temporarily for one year by making an 
appointment while congress is in recess 
stello said last week he told watkins he would prefer not to 
accept a temporary appointment 
stellos opponents led by democratic sens timothy wirth of 
colorado and john glenn of ohio believe stello is not sufficiently 
committed to nuclear safety stello strongly denied this and vowed 
to carry out watkins orders to improve management of the nuclear 
weapons complex 
some committee republicans including sen john mccain of 
arizona have accused democrats of politically motivated delay 
tactics in order to kill the nomination but sen john warner of 
virginia ranking republican on the panel said monday the decision 
to hold further hearings was a fallback procedure 
this should not be interpreted as a weakness in support in 
this nominees chances of winning confirmation warner said 
adding he did not expect the january hearings to produce anything 
new that we havent heard about stello 
greenpeace usa an environmental group that has spearheaded a 
campaign to defeat the nomination praised the committees decision 
to postpone a vote 
we managed to beat back enormous white house pressure to 
quickly confirm stello said stephen schwartz the greenpeace 
legislative coordinator its the right move by the committee 
stello technically is still employed by the nuclear regulatory 
commission where he holds the title of executive director of 
operations but he has been working fulltime for watkins since 
july as an adviser on preparations for the restart of the 
departments idled savannah river nuclear reactors

soprano ruth welting not heard at the 
metropolitan opera since its 198182 season returned to sing a 
part she sang that season olympia the mechanical doll in 
offenbachs the tales of hoffmann 
she was a delight singing the coloratura lightly beautifully 
and acting amusingly charmingly 
miss weltings doll doesnt stay in the same mood throughout act 
1 she gets increasingly aggressive flailing her arms at people 
swinging hoffmann too fast in the dance then clasping her hands 
around his neck to swing him in a veritable stranglehold 
sometimes the met casts the same soprano in all of hoffmanns 
tales the most recent was dame joan sutherland on monday night 
in the operas first presentation this season three women sang the 
parts 
luis lima was singing hoffmann for the first time at the met 
hoffmanns voice should be produced fully with strong tone and 
resonance lima did that but in act 1 he sometimes seemed to be 
trying to make up for difficult high notes by increasing volume in 
act 2 he sounded vocally strained and tired but he didnt sound 
tired anymore in act 3 altogether it was a good job 
diana montague from winchester united kingdom who made her 
met debut in 1987 was splendid as hoffmanns friend nicklausse in 
mens clothes she still looked feminine but that didnt matter 
her singing was clear flexible and appealing 
jose van dam sang all four villains he sang well but chose a 
path of subtlety which meant the audience missed the malevolence 
which makes the opera chilling this especially was evident in his 
aria in venice presented by the met but not everywhere as act 
2 
judith forst of new westminster british columbia sang 
giulietta the venice courtesan she sang well but didnt sound 
seductive 
the third acts antonia originally announced to be judith 
blegen was sung by myra merritt of washington dc her voice is 
lovely but she didnt build the drama of this most dramatic of the 
tales 
both miss forst and miss merritt sounded more like singers being 
serious than like the characters they portrayed 
donald kaasch a native of denver made his met debut as the 
physicist in act 1 he sounds like a tenor of much promise and 
despite his white einstein wig capered with unusually youthful 
agility adding to the acts merriment 
sylvain cambreling of amiens france conducted and the 
orchestra sounded marvelous 
this production was new in 1982 act 1 is in a big room with a 
magical back wall of perpetual motion machines but acts 2 and 3 
are gloomy act 3 is even darker than at first no longer can the 
picture of antonias mother be seen to become a real person who 
sings now it becomes darker and singing comes from that direction

a ban on the use of crop fungicides would 
cause consumer food prices to rise by 13 percent and the supply of 
fruits vegetables and peanuts to decline by 24 percent a farm 
chemical trade association says 
no total ban on fungicides has been proposed and the 
environmental protection agency said none is in the works 
but jay vroom president of the national agricultural chemicals 
association said he wanted to call attention to the enormous 
benefit and the very small risk that result from the use of 
fungicides and other hightech farming methods on food supplies 
in my view the debate regarding the safety of our food is 
almost totally riskdominated vroom said there is precious 
little mentioned about the benefit side of the equation 
an economic study showing the effects of a ban on fungicides 
chemicals applied to crops particularly fruit and vegetable to 
prevent plant diseases was released by the association at a news 
conference monday 
the study paid for by the association was done by grc 
economics a washington dc consulting subsidiary of hill and 
knowlton inc 
the environmental protection agencys spokesman on pesticides 
al heier commented we have always been concerned about 
fungicides but were not going to cancel all of them he noted 
federal law requires the agency to balance benefits against risks 
when judging any pesticides and said the agency adheres to that 
mandate 
john m urbanchuk senior vice president and director of 
economics for the consulting firm said if fungicides were 
eliminated you the consumer would pay more for lowerquality 
produce you would find that many fruits and vegetables no longer 
look or taste the same as before and they would cost much more 
for example he said crops hit hardest with price increases 
would include popular salad bar items such as carrots which would 
rise 80 percent lettuce 40 percent tomatoes 40 percent and 
onions 34 percent 
prices of other major crops also would go up sharply he said 
peanuts and peanut butter would rise 68 percent peaches 37 
percent and potatoes 37 percent 
some foods may not be available at all urbanchuk said if 
fungicides were no longer used by american farmers consumers would 
not have bananas to slice on their morning meal and children may 
not have peanut butter for their lunch sandwiches 
production of fruits would decline by 32 percent vegetables by 
21 percent peanuts by 68 percent and the major grains such as 
corn and wheat by 6 percent he said 
urbanchuk said in his statement that poorer families would 
suffer the most by not being able to afford higher prices for 
fruits and vegetables 
lisa lefferts of the center for science in the public interest 
said she had not studied the chemical industrys report and had no 
comment on the studys specific figures 
but she said the current way of growing food with large 
amounts of fungicides and other chemicals isnt the only way to 
do it in fact she added the national academy of sciences 
recently reported on alternate ways of farming to reduce the 
contamination of soil water and air by cutting back on chemicals 
were confident and so is the national academy of sciences 
that we can produce foods profitably and competitively using far 
fewer fungicides and other pesticides lefferts said in a 
telephone interview 
the most telling statistic would be not how much reduced 
fungicide use would cost consumers but how much it would cost the 
chemical industry she said 
fungicides represent about 370 million or 74 percent of the 5 
billionayear farm chemicals industry association officials said 
an advisory board for the study included representatives of the 
association the national association of wheat growers national 
food processors association fertilizer institute resources for 
the future and the agriculture department

james cason turned away by the senate for a 
top environmental job in the bush administration has asked the 
white house to withdraw his nomination 
the action effectively ends an eightmonth battle between 
president bush and environmentalists over the controversial nominee 
for assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and 
the environment 
withdrawal of this nomination is a great disappointment 
said agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who announced casons 
request on monday the lobbying effort against him was both 
misguided and unfair 
there was no immediate responses from the white house which 
never wavered in its support of cason despite repeated requests 
from individual senators to withdraw the nomination 
cason was opposed by the sierra club national wildlife 
federation wilderness society league of conservation voters and 
national audubon society 
the groups alleged that casons record in several top interior 
department positions during the reagan administration showed 
favoritism toward private development of public lands despite 
environmental concerns 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee worked to defeat cason after his committee sent the 
nomination to the floor on a 127 vote 
the senate sent the nomination back to the white house on friday 
and asked that it not be resubmitted 
it was the first rejection of a bush nominee by the full senate 
since john tower was voted down as defense secretary in march

donald regan is getting the last word or at 
least the latest in his little tiff with nancy reagan over which 
one of them did more damage to ronald reagans presidency 
in a review of mrs reagans book my turn the former white 
house chief of staff says his former boss wife seems incapable 
of understanding how her words and deeds might seem selfish 
hypocritical and indeed even frightening to those on the 
outside 
very sadly this book gives aid and comfort to those who 
still believe that ronald reagan never should have been elected 
president in the first place regan said 
his review in the december issue of washingtonian magazine 
also replied to mrs reagans criticism of his disclosure in his 
memoirs that she had come to rely on the advice of an astrologer 
for scheduling reagans activities 
wrote she it never ever occurred to me that don regan would 
do what he did that he would take this information about my 
interest in astrology and twist it to seek his revenge on ronnie on 
me 
wrote he in his review frankly i hesitated before putting 
this astounding fact into the historical record i certainly did 
not take this information and twist it to seek revenge 
the fact is i wrote about astrology because it was an 
essential truth about the way the reagans operated my description 
of white house life in my period as chief of staff would have made 
little sense if i had omitted it 
mrs regan minimized her dependence on astrology saying she 
called the astrologer only once or twice a month but regan said 
astrology played a significant role in shaping the reagan 
presidency 
it was a daily sometimes hourly factor in every decision 
affecting the presidents schedule he wrote he or in this 
case she who controls the presidents schedule controls the 
workings of the presidency 
mrs reagan wrote that she urged her husband to fire regan after 
a stream of high government officials and congressional leaders 
came to her with the same message regan had poor relations with 
congress and the press was restricting access to reagan was 
intimidating subordinates 
anyway she said regan deserved to be fired because the 
irancontra affair occurred on his watch 
regan for his part said it apparently never registers with 
the former first lady that she damages her husband and his 
presidency in the way her book acidly criticizes many of 
president reagans closest advisers including edwin meese iii 
james a baker iii david stockman alexander m haig william 
clark and william casey 
after all he wrote these were ronald reagans choices 
made after close consultation with his financial and political 
supporters and friends in california he must have thought that 
they met his own standards 
his conclusion nancy reagan and donald regan both have 
written for the historical record others will no doubt do the 
same and to that end history that greatest of all polygraphs 
will makes its judgment i am comfortable with that

congressional negotiators reached agreement on 
a 148 billion deficitreduction package for this year early 
tuesday and leaders of both parties predicted the measure would be 
quickly approved by congress and signed by president bush 
the deal would bring to a close a partisan budget standoff that 
has lasted most of the year 
it will pass overwhelmingly i think in both bodies because 
its a pretty good package said rep bill frenzel rminn 
ranking republican on the house budget committee 
it is a very strong effective deficit reduction package 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine told his 
colleagues 
leaders scheduled votes on the agreement in both chambers on 
tuesday 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said he had been 
told by treasury secretary nicholas brady and budget director 
richard darman the white house will support this package 
the package includes about 57 billion in new tax revenues as 
well as a collection of spending reductions and accounting changes 
that result in lowered spending this year 
it also claims 46 billion in savings by leaving cuts in 
federal programs imposed by the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
in effect through the first week of february those cuts were 
triggered on oct 1 when bush and lawmakers failed to reach a 
budgetcutting deal 
house and senate leaders from both parties held meeting after 
meeting through the day on the two biggest unfinished pieces of the 
puzzle deficit reduction bill and a repeal or scaleback of 
medicare catastrophic health insurance 
the health plan designed to prevent retirees from being 
financially ruined by major illness was passed last year with 
strong bipartisan support and was considered one of the last major 
achievements of ronald reagans presidency 
but congress was forced to rethink the legislation this year 
because of a storm of protest from the wealthy elderly who would 
be taxed up to 800 a year to cover their new benefits 
the house on sunday on a 34957 vote reaffirmed its position 
that the entire law should be scrapped surtax and benefits 
together the senate however favors a plan to scale back the 
benefits enough to drop the surtax in exchange for a small annual 
premium 
the two chambers resumed negotiations monday in hopes of a 
compromise 
another mustpass piece of legislation was a collection of 
about 53 billion in new taxes a bunch of accounting changes and 
some acrosstheboard spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit 
president bush has said he wants at least 14 billion in deficit 
reduction for the current fiscal year 
threeway talks involving the house senate and the white house 
were negotiating that deal which covers a broad range of issues 
including a new system for paying doctors for services to medicare 
patients 
in the long run said sens jay rockefeller dwva and david 
durenberger rminn two of the sponsors the change will hold 
down medical costs and help assure that highqualify medical 
services are available to rural areas and inner cities 
the plan establishes a national fee schedule based on costs of 
providing services physicians now are reimbursed on the basis of 
historical fees that often have little relationship to costs of 
providing care 
the governments costs for physician fees have been increasing 
at about 15 percent per year and in the last fiscal year totalled 
245 billion 
the new fees would be based on the skill training and time 
required to perform the service the fee structure would be aimed 
at bringing down high fees for certain services such as surgery 
relative to fees for treatment provided by family practitioners and 
internists who may perform fewer procedures but whose 
treatment even if only counseling may require equally high skill 
and knowledge 
adding to the incentive for approving the deficit bill was 
indirectly the pay raise that congress decided last week to give 
itself 
the pay raise package includes initial costofliving 
adjustments of 79 percent in the house and nearly 10 percent for 
the senate but those raises wont happen until the budget bill is 
enacted enactment would cancel spending cuts ordered oct 1 under 
the grammrudman law because congress and the president failed to 
meet their deficitreduction goals 
on the spending front president bush on monday vetoed his 
second appropriations bill in two days because he objected to 
abortion provisions 
bush on sunday vetoed a 146 billion foreign aid bill because 
it contained 15 million for a united nations population control 
agency that operates worldwide including china 
china has a onechildperfamily policy that bush said results 
in coerced abortions and he said us aid to the un agency would 
make the united states a party to that practice 
the house which does not have a twothirds majority to override 
bush on abortion questions approved and sent to the senate monday 
a bill without the money for the population control agency and the 
senate followed suit later in the day 
bush on monday vetoed the annual district of columbia 
appropriations bill while congress barred the city from using 
federal money for abortions it had taken out out a similar 
restriction on the citys use of its own local tax dollars 
the house immediately took up and passed by voice vote a new 
version designed to meet the presidents objections sending the 
bill to the senate which also passed the clean version of the bill 
just before midnight 
the house by voice vote on monday sent bush a third spending 
bill vetoed earlier in an abortion dispute in a form more to his 
liking 
the 1567 billion appropriation for the departments of labor 
health and human services and other agencies was vetoed earlier 
because congress voted to allow federal money to pay for abortions 
for poor women who were victims of rape and incest at bushs 
insistence the new bill would cover abortions cases only when the 
life of the mother was in danger 
although its adjournment target dates are typically in early 
october congress typically works until nearly christmas in 
nonelection years the last time it adjourned before december in 
an oddnumbered year was in 1983 when lawmakers went home on nov 
18

bush got his way last week as senate authors carl levin 
dmich and warren rudman rnh made lastminute changes to make 
sure the lobbying restrictions leave out presidents 
the restrictions including the first application to former 
members of congress were approved early saturday as part of the 
legislation to raise pay of lawmakers judges and top executive 
branch officials 
a house source speaking monday on condition of anonymity said 
its the white house thats been yelling parity parity 
parity to make sure that top officials in all three government 
branches were covered when they left government that meant 
cover everybody else but me the source said referring to bush 
but white house spokesman stephen hart said the administration 
had good reason to seek the exclusion for presidents the bill may 
have prevented a current president from consulting with a past 
president he said 
we felt the president should be removed because of his unique 
status said hart the president wouldnt be able to talk to 
anybody in the government his work involves the entire 
government its in the national interest for a sitting president 
to be able to consult past presidents 
hart said theres never been an example of a president lobbying 
the government after leaving office adding the notion that it 
would occur is somewhat demeaning to the presidency 
he noted exvice presidents are covered by the restrictions and 
should be because many have entered private business 
current antilobbying language is silent on presidential 
coverage but presidents are considered excluded under a justice 
department ruling 
in every version until the last one the intention was to 
cover the president we exempted the president at the white houses 
request said robert stevenson rudmans spokesman 
rep barney frank dmass the prime author of lobbying 
restrictions in the house called the bush administrations 
position inconsistent 
bush he said lobbied so hard to make the restrictions 
tougher the president wanted a provision that people couldnt even 
lobby for free 
frank said he reluctantly accepted the presidents request when 
the pay and ethics package reached the house because we couldnt 
negotiate everything 
provisions of the new legislation some similar to current law 
and some going beyond it would 
impose a lifetime ban on lobbying on matters where former 
officials were personally and substantially involved 
require a twoyear ban on former officials lobbying on matters 
that were under their supervision even if they had not directly 
participated 
prohibit lobbying for a year by those personally and 
substantially involved in any trade or treaty negotiation 
impose a oneyear ban on top senior executives from lobbying 
their former agency on any matter in which the exofficials would 
seek official action 
bar any former top official for one year from representing 
aiding or advising a foreign government or foreign political party 
in a matter before any department or agency

of irvine calif and a related inquiry into five senators who 
intervened on its behalf with federal regulators 
 
charles b keating jr a phoenix millionaire who as chairman 
of a home construction company american continental corp 
purchased lincoln in february 1984 for 51 million and increased 
its assets from 11 billion to 55 billion by 1988 keating waged 
a fervent fiveyear campaign against federal thrift regulators who 
opposed his direct investment of federally insured sampl deposits in 
real estate ventures in 1986 and 1987 he contributed a total of 
13 million to the political causes of five senators who 
intervened on lincolns behalf with officials of the federal home 
loan bank board lincoln was seized by the board last april and 
regulators have filed a 11 billion fraud and racketeering suit 
against keating 
edwin j gray a former white house official who as chairman 
of the bank board from 1983 until july 1987 sought to limit direct 
investments by thrifts and was sued several times by keating in 
may 1987 gray deferred action on a recommendation by regulators at 
the federal home loan bank in san francisco that lincoln be taken 
over by the government because of what they said were unsafe and 
unsound lending practices gray told the house committee he was 
summoned to an april 2 1987 meeting in the office of sen dennis 
deconcini dariz that was arranged by sen donald w reigle 
dmich at that meeting and in the presence of three other 
senators gray said deconcini asked him on behalf of their friend 
and contributor at lincoln to rescind a regulation curbing direct 
investments by thrifts gray subsequently arranged a twohour 
meeting april 9 1987 in deconcinis office between five senators 
and san francisco home loan bank officials then trying to close

succeeded gray as chairman of the bank board wall has been the 
chief target of the house banking committees chairman who last 
month asked president bush in a letter to fire him wall has said 
the board did not follow the san francisco officials 
recommendation to seize lincoln because proof was insufficient to 
justify the action 
sen dennis deconcini dariz hosted in his office in april 
1987 two meetings between thrift regulators and other senators 
deconcini received 48100 from keating and his associates for 1988 
reelection campaign but announced two months ago he would return 
the money early this year he called wall twice and also california 
state regulators urging approval for keating to sell lincoln as an 
alternative to the government seizing it deconcini has denied

flights he and his family took aboard keatings corporate planes to 
and from the bahamas in 198486 
sen john glenn dohio attended april 2 and april 9 meetings 
in deconcinis office where regulators quoted him as telling them 
to either make a case against lincoln or get off its back a 
candidate for his partys presidential nomination in 1984 the 
former astronaut received 34000 in direct political contributions 
from keating and his associates and a political action committee 
associated with glenn received another 200000 
sen donald w riegle jr met several times in 1987 with 
keating or his associates and according to gray first told him 
that he would be summoned to the april 2 meeting in deconcinis 
office riegle did not attend that meeting but was present at the 
meeting april 9 with san francisco regulators riegle received a 
76100 from keating and his associates for his 1988 reelection 
campaign but announced later he was returning the money 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas as chairman of the house 
banking committee has directed a sixhearing investigation into 
why lincoln was allowed to stay open for two years after examiners 
recommended seizing it for a year gonzalez has blamed the size of 
the sampl crisis on wall and has attempted to focus the lincoln 
hearings on him last month he asked president bush to fire wall 
michael patriarca and william k black respectively the 
principal agent in charge of the san francisco bank board office 
and its top lawyer on may 1 1987 they recommended that lincoln 
be seized following a yearlong examination of the thrift 
patriarca and black were the chief regulators summoned to the april 
9 1987 meeting in deconcinis office and are now portrayed by 
house banking committee members as the unsung heroes in the lincoln 
case 
robert s bennett a washington attorney specializing in white 
collar crime was hired by the senate ethics committee last week to 
head an investigation into the role played by the five senators in 
the lincoln case bennett is a brother of former education

so many funeral processions in one day 
five and this stricken towns sorrow seemed even greater because 
the coffins were so small one was covered with a teddy bearshaped 
wreath of flowers 
a stuffed garfield doll a small dinosaur and baseball cards lay 
nearby 
it was apparent that the bells tolled for the children not for 
the spirit of the town 
it will take time maybe a long time but we will get through 
this bud sharp was saying standing on the lawn of the first 
presbyterian church where people gathered monday for the last of 
the five funerals that gray and chilly afternoon 
the tragedy was the worst we have ever had sharp said at 
least it shook us more than any i know of but i believe it brought 
us closer together as a community as neighbors and i have a 
feeling that will last 
sharp was in charge of the first unit of volunteer firefighters 
who responded thursday to a call from the east coldenham elementary 
school a tornado had smashed down a wall of brick and glass onto 
the children at lunch killing seven youngsters and injuring 18 
others 
the towns collective grief was manifest at the two funerals on 
saturday and the five others monday 
three of the five families chose to keep the services private 
to bear their sorrow alone others did not 
about 600 mourners crowded st francis of assisi church a grand 
old brick edifice with twin bell towers and stained glass windows 
over the generations it has been the site of hundreds of funerals 
but surely few as unsettling as the requiem for adam joseph soltis 
age 7 
we remember today our little brother adam and his 
schoolmates said the pastor the rev howard dalton 
the organ sounded joyful and 600 voices found solace in ancient 
rites 
he will raise you up on eagles wings bear you on the breath 
of dawn make you to shine like the sun and hold you in the palm 
of his hand 
the music swelled within the church where 13 priests wore white 
and gold vestments the priests surrounded the candles aglow with 
life the white flowers the little coffin draped in white so tiny 
before the altar beneath the vault of the ceiling 
we have our faith said an elderly woman turning cheeks 
wet to embrace the younger man next to her 
and each other he replied 
about 100 people went to a funeral home to mourn charles 
cj scotto 7 who lay in an eggshellcolored casket decorated 
with the teddy bearshaped wreath of carnations and daisies nearby 
were his garfield doll a new york jets pin and cjs other 
treasures 
the service at first presbyterian was for maria jean stuhmer 8 
also buried monday were joanna teresa lichtler 7 and amy marie 
innis 8 
peter orsino and larae marie litchhult both 8 were buried 
saturday 
teri potter mother of four is a nurse at one of the hospitals 
where injured children were taken 
she stood at the door of a room where michael holmes and george 
marshall jr both age 7 lay in beds with their broken limbs 
encased in plaster suspended from traction slings she watched the 
firefighters who rescued them drop by to touch them and bring them 
gifts 
they were stressed out she said they wanted to come and 
see the children they saved rather than dwell on the children they 
could not they certainly brought smiles to the faces of those 
two 
mrs potter had another thought that seemed to reflect a feeling 
prevalent in this normally placid hudson valley town 
the deaths the injuries made me step back and think of my 
own life and my values think of the few things that ive been 
upset about recently 
all of them mean absolutely nothing in the perspective of one 
tragic afternoon

a former federal housing official appears to 
have repeatedly violated ethics laws by using her government 
contacts to help her private business a congressional report says 
the report endorsed by the house government operations committee 
and released monday urges the justice department to investigate 
june koch a former official at the department of housing and urban 
development 
the report based on a general accounting office investigation 
and subsequent review by a house subcommittee that investigated 
reaganera scandals at hud alleges koch used her influence on hud 
officials to benefit the consulting firm she has headed since 
leaving hud two years ago 
the firm helps us companies seeking trade with the soviet 
union while at hud koch was involved in a number of efforts to 
encourage us companies participation in the soviet unions 
construction industry 
it is clear that ms koch traded on her position at hud to 
gain benefits and access for herself and her clients said the 
report 
the justice department is not bound by the recommendation but 
generally conducts preliminary reviews of matters referred to it by 
congress or government agencies 
koch was not in her office monday according to a receptionist 
at the virginiabased consulting firm construction marketing and 
trading in april testimony to the subcommittee and in a subsequent 
interview she denied any wrongdoing 
koch was huds assistant secretary for policy development from 
1984 to 1987 her duties included arranging hud participation in a 
number of trade issues involving the soviet union including agency 
participation in a moscow trade fair the gao found was a waste of 
hud money 
she left the agency in 1987 and founded the consulting firm 
whose clients included 10 companies that participated in the 
hudsponsored soviet trip she also was retained as a consultant to 
thenhud secretary samuel pierce on sovietrelated matters 
the report said koch took a number of steps that appeared 
designed to benefit her business and clients in alleged violation 
of laws that prevent former government officials from improperly 
using their government contacts for private gain 
among the steps cited in the report were contacting hud 
officials and allegedly pressuring them to change the itineraries 
for visiting soviet delegations so that they could meet with her 
clients 
ms koch enjoyed access to hud and to visiting soviet 
delegations that was not generally offered to others the report 
said such access gave ms koch and her clients an advantage over 
competitors who might be interested in developing soviet trade 
relations 
koch had received permission from huds general counsel to serve 
as a consultant at the same time her company was involved in soviet 
trade issues but the hud attorneys had advised agency officials to 
closely monitor her activities to prevent any conflicts 
however the report said hud failed to monitor her activities 
it recommended that hud and other government agencies avoid even 
the appearance of conflicts by refusing to hire former officials as 
consultants in areas in which the former officials now are involved 
in the private sector

five asian carmakers rank at the bottom in 
providing and promoting air bags in their 1990 cars a coalition of 
auto safety and consumer groups said today 
the groups ranked chrysler corp at the top among 12 major 
manufacturers selling cars in the united states followed by 
mercedes benz chrysler is putting air bags in the drivers side of 
92 percent of its 1990 models 
three million of the 10 million 1990 cars expected to be sold in 
the united states will have air bags under federal rules according 
to a report compiled by public citizen the center for auto safety 
and motor voters 
but some drivers may not know what theyve got said joan 
claybrook president of the ralph naderfounded public citizen and 
former head of the national highway traffic safety administration 
nhtsas engine seems to be stuck in neutral on air bags 
said ms claybrook she said the agency needs to promote air bags 
and closely monitor their use to perfect the various systems being 
installed in new cars 
people should know when they buy the car that this system is 
going to inflate ms claybrook said in an interview adding some 
drivers have been surprised by air bags they didnt know were in 
their cars until they crashed 
the three safety groups were releasing data on air bag 
installation and promotion at a news conference today 
hyundai and subaru which do not have air bags in any models 
ranked at the bottom of the auto safety groups report card 
followed by honda 
other lowranking manufacturers included mazda and nissan which 
placed 8th and 9th 
volkswagen was 7th preceded by toyota in 6th place and general 
motors in 5th ford and volvo tied for 3rd place behind chrysler 
and mercedes 
air bags were first installed in 10000 general motors cars in 
the mid1970s but were not used again until they were introduced in 
some fords in 1985 
auto safety proponents have been pushing for both air bags and a 
lap and shoulder belts for all frontseat occupants 
federal rules applying to the 1990 models require either 
drivers side air bags or another passive restraint system for both 
front seats in all new cars sold in the united states some 
manufacturers have opted for seat belts that automatically encircle 
front seat occupants as they step into the car 
the safety groups ranked car builders according to the number of 
1990 models equipped with the safety devices as standard equipment 
plans for future installation of air bags protection devices used 
in all car seating positions and information provided to dealers 
and the contents of company ads 
clarence ditlow executive director of the center for auto 
safety said auto dealers are not giving customers proper 
information about air bags 
he said honda dealers told consumer surveyors air bags might 
blow up in the drivers face which he called a stunning piece of 
misinformation 
a spokeswoman for honda toni harrington said she had never 
heard of such a claim being made by honda dealers 
we would not be putting air bags in our cars if they were not 
considered safe she said honda offers air bags only in its 
topline legends but plans to add them to other models ms 
harrington said 
rosemary dunlop of motor voters said the groups are most 
concerned about the lack of availability of air bags in 
lowerpriced models 
these cars are most likely to be purchased by young drivers 
most likely to be involved in a crash she said 
the groups said all manufacturers have done poorly in providing 
air bags for vehicles other than passenger cars 
no company plans installation of air bags in vans until the 1993 
models when both ford and chrysler will introduce them in minivans

attorney general dick thornburgh wants to 
prevent felons from purchasing weapons by requiring that gun 
dealers check computerized criminal records before sales are 
completed 
thornburgh said monday that the plan will take time and 
significant amounts of money to put in place with states and the 
federal government needing to upgrade and computerize criminal 
records so they could be checked by gun dealers 
while a comprehensive accurate system for identifying felons 
at the pointofsale simply cannot be accomplished in the near 
term we must recognize it as a worthwhile goal to be accomplished 
over time thornburgh said 
under the attorney generals proposal licensed firearms dealers 
would use a touchtone telephone to check computer records to find 
if each prospective gun purchaser had a felony conviction 
thornburgh said he was ordering the fbi to expand its 
computerized data base of felons prohibited from buying guns at 
present only 40 percent to 60 percent of fbi conviction records 
are computerized 
the bureau was also ordered to draft standards for reporting 
criminal records for state and local police agencies 
thornburgh said the departments bureau of justice assistance 
will set aside 9 million for each of the next three years to help 
states comply with new reporting standards 
under legislation enacted last year the attorney general was 
required to report to congress on what steps could be taken to 
prevent felons from purchasing guns 
thornburgh rejected a more expensive option submitted to him by 
a task force that would have set up a system to instantly check the 
fingerprints of purchasers in gun stores to determine if they had 
criminal records 
the task force estimated it would cost up to 27 billion to 
automate fingerprint records and install scanning equipment in gun 
stores 
the attorney general said records will have to be improved 
before a new system can work 
no one list of felons exists in addition many of the 
criminal history records maintained by law enforcement are either 
out of date or incomplete or both thornburgh said finally 
current records often contain arrest information without a notation 
of the final disposition 
the task force estimated it would cost between 36 million and 
46 million to set up a telephone system for checking computerized 
records the system would cost 53 million to 70 million to 
operate each year 
the task force said a 7 to 9 fee charged to each prospective 
gun buyer would cover much of the costs

we will try to present something that will pull us out of 
this stalemate said the chief contra negotiator col enrique 
bermudez after a twohour negotiating session monday at the 
organization of american states 
nicaraguan vice foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said 
were going to stretch flexibility as far as it can be stretched 
we are approaching the end of the effort 
tinoco said his government is reassessing its insistence that 
the contras agree to a total withdrawal from nicaraguan territory 
to base camps in honduras as its price for agreeing to a cease 
fire he left the impression the government may settle for a 
partial withdrawal 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega suspended the ceasefire on 
nov 1 after alleging the contra forces had engaged in terrorist 
activities 
bermudez accused the sandinistas of hardening their position by 
insisting on both the withdrawal of the contras and their 
demobilization but tinoco said bermudez misunderstood the 
sandinista position 
a commission made of united nations and organization of american 
states mediators spent the weekend drawing up revisions of a plan 
they had set forth during the early going of the negotiations 
which began nov 9 
part of mondays negotiating session was spent going over the 
revisions 
before the talks resumed monday rebel spokesman bosco matamoros 
accused the sandinistas of not negotiating in good faith 
they want a total surrender he said they want an 
unconditional surrender 
matamoros called for an immediate ceasefire with appropriate 
verification procedures 
tinoco reaffirmed his governments view that the ceasefire must 
be linked to a separation of forces meaning the withdrawal of 
contra forces to base camps in honduras 
thats fundamental tinoco said 
tinoco also disclosed he had a brief meeting with a state 
department official saturday to discuss issues relating to the 
staffing of the respective embassies of the two countries 
he didnt identify the official with whom he spoke 
the administration generally has avoided highlevel contact with 
the sandinistas urging them instead to focus attention on 
resolving their differences with both the contras and the internal 
opposition

when asked to name some qualities that make 
this country special one young man offers cable tv asked how 
to encourage more young people to vote one young woman replies 
pay them 
people for the american way used these examples from a survey of 
youth values monday to sound a warning that americas youth are 
alarmingly illprepared to keep democracy alive in the 1990s and 
beyond 
our survey confirmed our worst fear american youth are turned 
off and tuning out the community and country around them said 
the groups president arthur kropp 
while the youth of china poland east germany czechoslovakia 
and elsewhere are struggling for democracy american youth are 
leaving democracy to wither said kropp while youth behind the 
iron curtain are reveling in that little freedom they have been 
allowed american youth are taking their very real freedoms for 
granted 
the survey of 1100 young people ages 1524 and 405 social 
studies teachers was conducted in four parts between april and june 
by peter d hart research associates key findings were 
72 percent of the youth asked to grade various life goals on a 
scale of 1 to 10 gave a 9 or 10 to career success 68 percent 
gave high ratings to having a closeknit family life and 56 
percent to enjoying life and having a good time twentyfour 
percent listed helping the community 
most young people do not see their own destiny as linked with 
the nations while a strong majority are confident about their own 
personal prospects only 42 percent of young people surveyed say 
they feel optimistic about americas future about 47 percent say 
they are worried that americas best years might be behind us 
only 12 percent of the youth surveyed volunteered voting as 
a basic tenet of good citizenship comparing the citizenship 
potential of todays young people with those of a decade ago 37 
percent of the teachers surveyed think todays youth are less 
likely to become good citizens while 16 percent say todays 
students are more likely to become good citizens than those of 10 
years ago 
by a more than 21 ratio 45 percent to 21 percent teachers 
say todays high school students are less interested in politics 
and public affairs than their counterparts of a decade ago 
60 percent of the young people say they know just some or 
very little about the way our government works when it comes 
to reading the newspaper or watching the news on television 57 
percent say they have just some or very little interest in 
following news about politics and government 
54 percent of teachers cite the poor example set by 
politicians as a strong reason for youths noninvolvement 
kropp said the hopeful signs in the survey are that 58 
percent reject the notion that people should take care of 
themselves and shouldnt expect others to do things for them 
while 35 percent agree with that idea also 89 percent of the 
youth support a community service program in their high school that 
offers extra credit to students who volunteer 
people for the american way chairman john buchanan called for an 
allout effort to teach every young person in america the full 
meaning of citizenship he said parents must vote and become 
involved in the community schools must provide more community 
service opportunities and political leaders must set a positive 
example that inspires citizen activism 
people for the american way is a public interest group

a maryland historian is adding a 
hallucinogenic note to the longstanding mystery of what triggered 
three weeks of terror in the french countryside that became a key 
event in the revolution of 1789 
mary kilburne mattossian in a new book called poisons of the 
past molds epidemics and history says the phenomenon 
historians call the great fear was probably caused by hallucinogens 
contained in a fungus on rye wheat 
r emmet kennedy jr a professor of european history at george 
washington university and an authority on the french revolution 
said he has not read ms matossians book but is familiar with her 
thesis and does not put much stock in it 
i am not a biologist and havent investigated but i simply 
havent taken it very seriously kennedy said in an interview 
we believe that the great fear was caused by the revolution in 
paris the storming of the bastille and specifically by the fear 
that the aristocrats were going to wage a counterrevolution 
against that revolution in paris and versailles and that they were 
setting loose brigands into the countryside to destroy their 
crops he said 
ms matossian an associate professor of history at the 
university of maryland blames the fear on ergot a fungus that 
grows on rye in certain conditions and contains the alkaloid 
lysergic acid from which the hallucinogenic drug lsd is extracted 
her view clashes with those of many historians that the 
phenomenon was an insurrection of peasants who resented paying 
taxes and tithes 
in the spring of 1789 there were peasant protests against the 
food shortage and feudal practices but the great fear of july 
and august was mainly a panic not a protest she writes in her 
book published by yale university press 
previous studies have indicated there was no foundation for 
these fears because although there were vagrants roaming the 
countryside in search of food they were apparently neither 
organized nor dangerous 
there has been documentation that shows that it was based on 
rumor kennedy said somebody would come to the outskirts of a 
village and announce that a troop of brigands were arriving and 
then somebody would go to the next village and multiply the number 
by 10 and it went on and on like that 
ms matossians book was based on research in libraries in the 
united states france england and the soviet union she said her 
conclusion was based on a series of interesting coincidences that 
make a causal connection plausible 
she cited a previous study of public health in brittany that 
reported toxic ergot had been found on about onetwelfth of all 
ears of rye in the region in july 1789 
this was indeed a prodigious amount she wrote rye flour 
containing 1 percent ergot is sufficient to cause a fullblown 
epidemic 
the great fear went on for three weeks weeping and shouting 
peasants took to the woods with pitchforks and muskets while others 
crisscrossed the countryside looting and burning chateaus 
it led french aristocrats to abandon some of their feudal 
privileges and prompted a reaction among landowners who maintained 
order should be restored in the countryside before further 
concessions were made

the bush administration may propose a new 
round of american troop reductions in western europe provided 
they are matched by soviet cutbacks as a result of an easing of 
eastwest tensions us officials say 
government studies started before the current wave of political 
reform struck the communist world are being accelerated also to 
consider new us budget constraints the officials said monday 
the studies and a recommendation to president bush could be 
completed in time for his dec 23 meeting with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev in the mediterranean 
in any event bush is likely to pursue the subject with leaders 
of the 15 nato countries when he meets with them in brussels right 
after the saltwater summit 
some of them are a little nervous about additional 
reductions said a us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
those issues as well as questions about possible german 
reunification were expected to be raised today in a meeting 
between visiting west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher and secretary of state james a baker iii west german 
officials said genschers visit was prompted by the opening of the 
berlin wall and other changes in east germany 
bush proposed at a nato summit meeting in may that us troops 
be reduced to 275000 from their current level of about 305000 
the proposal and acrosstheboard cutbacks in the allies tanks 
artillery and other conventional weapons in europe are under 
negotiation with the warsaw pact in vienna 
the reductions are contingent upon even deeper reductions by the 
sovietled bloc 
the warsaw pact advanced its own comprehensive proposal in the 
talks progress has been slowed by disagreement over the kinds of 
aircraft to place under ceilings and a dispute between greece and 
turkey over whether to include the turkish port of mersin in an 
eastwest treaty 
an argument being made here against a proposal for a second 
round of cuts is that it could slow the current negotiations the 
officials said 
but clearly the administration is thinking beyond a troop 
reduction of about 10 percent the officials said one of them 
cited a recent pentagon decision to have some american troops along 
the eastwest border carry revolvers instead of rifles the 
official said this reflected a lessening of tensions and is 
indicative of some major revamping 
meanwhile defense secretary richard b cheney said sunday the 
bush administration would consider troop reduction proposals that 
went far beyond the cuts involved in the negotiations 
the two us officials said monday the options under study were 
to revise the current nato proposal to make deeper cuts or to frame 
a second proposal that would be negotiated after a treaty is 
concluded 
bush had predicted completion of the pact by next may but since 
then many experts within the administration have registered doubts 
privately that the accord could be concluded by then 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
it is premature to talk about a second proposal for cutbacks in 
us conventional forces she said if we were to do such a thing 
it would obviously have to be carefully explored with our allies in 
the context of the vienna negotiations 
cheney appearing on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
program said the likelihood of a conflict between the united 
states and the soviet union was at its lowest point since world 
war ii 
he also said he would agree to military cuts to meet 
deficitreduction goals

a 400pound bright yellow mechanical arm 
replaces the human touch at the robot music store where customers 
sample and buy compact discs entirely by machine 
the robot system plays 30second samples of song for its 
customers takes their orders and accepts payment by cash or credit 
card it also hands over the merchandise returns change and 
receipts restocks shelves and places its own inventory orders 
developers claim the shop which opened monday is the first 
fully automated retail store 
anyone who can operate a cd machine can operate this said 
dave carroll who along with bob cahlander founded robot 
manufacturing center inc more than three years ago in red wing 40 
miles southeast of minneapolis the companys robot frying cooks 
are being tested in two mcdonalds outlets 
the store is something like a giant vending machine in the 
open court shopping area of a large office building cds are 
stacked on shelves on the inside walls of a transparent enclosure 
covering 140 square feet and standing about 8 feet high on the 
outside are four earphone sets a video screen for customers to 
punch in transactions and fixtures to take in the money or credit 
cards and deliver cds and change 
at the center of the operation is the robot arm that can rotate 
around the enclosure to grab a customers selection and deliver it 
carroll and cahlander said they will test the idea in 
minneapolis to see if it is profitable and whether customers like 
buying from a machine instead of a human 
initial reaction was mixed heather jenkel waiting to get a 
closer look at the robot before buying said she liked the idea of 
being able to listen to the music before making a purchase but 
prefers to deal with a person 
i like someone to be able to talk to me and tell me ya i 
heard this and i think its great jenkel said 
mondays test of the technology was marred by one glitch the 
robot arm was shut down for a fiveminute repair after it had 
trouble dispensing a classical cd said cahlander the arm will 
have to be retooled to pick up cds with boxes of varying sizes he 
said 
using the machine is much like banking at an automatic teller 
if customers have trouble there is a tollfree telephone number 
to call for help carroll said 
if similar machines are in use nobody else has talked about 
it said eric mittelstadt president and chief executive officer 
of gmfanuc robotics corp maker of the basic robot unit

when the plaintiffs are human and the defendants 
are beasts being a lawyer can get pretty hairy except when its 
your specialty 
for five years joleen marion has been the pet sets perry 
mason she runs legal action for animals a manhattanbased 
nonprofit group that advises on and litigates a range of animal 
issues including pet privileges lab experimentation and 
malpractice lawsuits against veterinarians 
we get about 70 calls a week from across the country on 
complaints about everything from experimental torture done on 
animals to elderly people who want to know if they can bring their 
cats to a nursing home she said 
in one instance a new york man claimed that a beavers dam had 
backed up a septic tank resulting in a foul overflow at his home 
unfortunately he wanted to exterminate the creature and would 
have gotten a permit to do so if it werent for our intervention 
she said 
ms marion alerted a group that specialized in beaver behavior 
and they were able to scare off the animal without harming it 
in another case a student objected to experiments on marsh 
turtles at his community college upon ms marions investigation 
the labs were closed because they werent registered with the state 
health department 
ive always had a love for animals and a deep concern over how 
many of them were homeless i eventually ended up going to law 
school because of it said ms marion who allows two big dogs 
and five loveable cats to frolic in her queens home 
she attended seton hall university law school where she studied 
environmental law today she teaches animal law at pace university 
when she opened her practice in 1984 her office was in her 
living room now she and four parttime interns assisted by 20 
volunteer attorneys on call around the country work out of a 42nd 
street office donated by united action for animals an animal 
advocacy group 
although she has prosecuted peopleanimal cases ms marion says 
most of the time litigation isnt necessary its more a matter 
of the law and a persons constitutional rights she said 
for example she took up the case of a high school student who 
refused to dissect a frog she claimed that the students first 
amendment rights were at issue ultimately an alternate assignment 
was made 
ms marion said there are few malpractice cases against 
veterinarians but courts have become willing to grant punitive 
damages for emotional distress to owners whose animals died in 
veterinary care 
there is very little on the books for animal rights but 
courts are very sympathetic to animal cases judges are beginning 
to realize that animals are not just inanimate objects said ms

us officials are touting a smuggled 
videotape purporting to show salvadoran guerilla leaders at a 
training base outside managua as evidence of nicaraguan complicity 
in el salvadors insurgency 
but nicaraguan vice foreign minister victor hugo tinoco 
dismissed the tape as a propaganda show that represents another 
us effort to blame nicaragua for the salvadoran civil war tinoco 
is in washington for ceasefire negotiations with the contra rebels 
us officials who showed the tape to reporters monday said 
three men who appear in the videotape are top salvadoran guerrilla 
commanders including joaquin villalobos generally regarded as the 
most important figure in the farabundo marti national liberation 
front or fmln insurgent hierarchy 
the us officials who insisted on anonymity said the light 
artillery and antiaircraft weapons shown have been used 
extensively by rebels during recent fighting in el salvador but had 
not been seen before this spring 
the tape is believed to have been made in either may or june of 
this year and was turned over to american authorities by a person 
who wished to remain anonymous said us officials 
it was not disclosed who made the tape or what the purpose was 
the original tape was said to be more than three hours long but the 
officials said the final product was reduced to the five minutes 
they said it underscored the sandinista connection with the fmln 
the officials said some of the same types of weapons shown on 
the tape were used by the fmln rebels in an october 30 attack on 
salvadoran army headquarters and the nov 11 attacks on the private 
and official residences of salvadoran president alfredo cristiani 
us analysts concluded the site of the taping was the el 
tempisque training site north of managua because of the terrain and 
the presence of soviet weapons found nowhere else in latin america 
besides cuba 
the tape was described by a us official as graphic 
confirmation that the nicaraguan government has provided weapons 
training to the fmln 
nicaraguan officials have said there may have been some 
unauthorized operations carried out by sandinista officials in 
support of the fmln in the early 1980s but that these activities 
have long since stopped 
president daniel ortega has said repeatedly nicaraguan territory 
will not be used to subvert neighboring countries 
us officials have cited the alleged sandinista support dating 
back almost a decade as a principal reason for generous us 
military support for the salvadoran government 
as further evidence of nicaraguan cooperation with the fmln the 
administration has said that on oct 18 it captured large 
quantities of weapons allegedly earmarked by the sandinistas for 
the fmln the arms were said to be found by honduran security 
guards aboard a truck near the border with nicaragua

in the penalty phase of the trial said australian consul ira 
lindeman who attended the weeklong trial 
before the trial judge lawrence johnston allowed a defense 
motion that savage be referred to as russell thomas moore his 
birth name turner contended the name savage might cause the jury 
to think of an uncivilized primitive 
savage has served four prison sentences for car theft burglary 
and violent behavior in prison including trying to kill a fellow 
inmate and a guard 
mrs barbers son bill said the family was pleased by mondays

james cason whose selection by president bush 
for a top environmental post was turned away by the senate has 
asked the white house to withdraw his nomination 
casons request announced monday effectively ends an 
eightmonth battle between bush and environmentalists over casons 
nomination for assistant secretary of agriculture for natural 
resources and the environment 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who announced casons 
request said the lobbying effort against him was both misguided 
and unfair 
there was no immediate response from the white house which 
never wavered in its support of cason despite repeated requests 
from individual senators to withdraw the nomination 
environmentalists alleged that casons record in several top 
interior department positions during the reagan administration 
showed favoritism toward private development of public lands

the energy department is telling scientists 
designing the super collider to keep the particle accelerator 
within the original standards and at its 59 billion price tag 
despite a conceptual flaw 
deputy energy secretary henson moore said the agency has no 
plans to move the collider from texas contrary to a published 
report that suggested a change in the ssc design could result in a 
smaller less powerful collider that would be unsuitable for its 
chosen ellis county site 
as far as were concerned nothings changed moore said 
monday after meeting with two texas republicans sen phil gramm 
and rep joe barton we have no official reports requests 
proposals any different than were going to build the super 
collider right there in texas for 59 billion 
the washington post in a front page story sunday quoted 
unnamed us officials and independent scientists who said 
extensive modifications could reopen the battle for the particle 
accelerator by allowing other states to argue that texas is no 
longer the ideal site

more federal money and better state planning 
could ease some of the problems that plague emergency medical 
services in rural areas according to a congressional research 
report 
the report released monday by the office of technology said 
emergency medical services in many rural areas suffer from 
personnel shortages inadequate training outdated equipment and 
lack of financial and medical resources 
federal funds for emergency medical services reached about 30 
million annually after passage of the 1973 ems systems act but 
began to decline in 1981 when the money was folded into block grant 
programs in 1988 about 18 million in federal funds went to the 
states for such services

the government has closed its road borders 
with bolivia chile and ecuador to slow the flight of dollars after 
they soared to a record high on the black market as a hedge against 
galloping inflation 
officials took the measure late monday after the blackmarket 
dollar hit an unprecedented high earlier in the day it was selling 
on the street for 11200 peruvian intis after opening the day at 
9200 
finance minister cesar vasquez bazan said in a television 
interview monday afternoon there is no objective reason for the 
rise 
vasquez bazan had said then the government would consider 
closing the chilean border and enforcing stricter customs 
regulations to stop the double profits of speculators who 
make money on the dollar and then make money on the contraband 
they bring back to peru 
he said many speculators cross the border into chile with 
dollars and buy consumer goods to sell in peru 
victor urbiola prefect of the department of puno 610 miles 
southeast of lima said by telephone on monday night that the 
measure originally adopted for the chilean border was extended to 
cover the bolivian and ecuadorean borders 
urbiola said the two main roads into bolivia were closed to 
traffic monday night 
a spokesperson for the department of tacna 700 miles southeast 
of lima confirmed late monday that the chilean border had been 
closed 
officials did not say how long the closures would last 
in the past two weeks the price of the dollar has nearly 
doubled on the black market many people in peru buy blackmarket 
dollars to offset the countrys hyperinflation and many businesses 
obtain dollars to pay for imports on the black market 
the inflation rate for 1988 was more than 1700 percent and 
this year it is expected to top 3000 percent 
the official exchange rate which is used only for some 
government transactions and to pay for certain imports was 4557 
intis to the dollar monday

a nationwide schooling system for 4yearolds 
of poor us families and ending or cutting income taxes on savings 
would help restore american leadership in semiconductors according 
to a report 
after originating the semiconductor industry and dominating it 
for three decades the united states has lost the lead to japan and 
has not responded to the challenge of regaining it said the first 
report of the national advisory committee on semiconductors 
the body created by congress last year is made up of industrial 
executives and government experts under the chairmanship of ian m 
ross president of atampt bell laboratories 
the report issued monday also proposed resurrecting the us 
consumer electronics industry with seed money from 
governmentguaranteed investments to help provide incentives and 
affordable capital needed for a major research and development 
efforts 
a nationwide preschool educational system for economically 
disadvantaged 4yearolds would be a step toward improving the 
quality of worker education the report said 
for every dollar invested in quality preschool seven are 
returned to society during the lifetime of the child in the form of 
increased earnings less crime and less welfare the committee 
said 
it also recommended subsidized literacy programs permanent tax 
concessions for research and easing of limits on taxfree 
retirement savings accounts known as iras 
the 30page report also included recommendations for overtaking 
japan in semiconductors such as pressure for reciprocal treatment 
in market access threat of sanctions against unfair trade and 
relaxing of us antitrust laws 
ironically many of the recommendations paralleled japanese 
advice for sharpening us competitiveness in the two countries 
ongoing economic structural talks such as better education and 
higher savings 
if the us position in semiconductors continues to deteriorate 
the us electronics industry will be at the mercy of foreign 
suppliers jeopardizing millions of jobs billions of dollars of 
tax revenue industrial strength and national defense the report 
said 
the shift to importing most us consumer electronics items such 
as television sets and audio equipment from asia has been 
underrated as a factor in deterioration of semiconductor 
leadership the study said 
it said the government should take the lead in establishing a 
forprofit consumer electronics capital corporation to resurrect 
the domestic industry with a multibillion dollar pool of lowcost 
longterm private investments

an oil and mining services company that 
is purchasing the anchorage times promised not to interfere with 
news coverage but said the editorial pages would be prodevelopment 
through being a prodevelopment paper maybe we can create 
more jobs said william allen chairman of the board of veco 
international people cant stay up here alaska unless they 
have jobs 
longtime owner bob atwood said he sold the evening newspaper 
hes owned since 1935 to the veco because he wanted to keep 
alaskas no 2 paper in local hands 
documents to complete the deal were signed monday by the 
82yearold atwood and allen who said negotiations for the 
purchase began about 1 years ago 
the price was not disclosed the sale is to become final dec 14 
allen said he did not see any conflict with his political 
activities or with vecos role as chief contractor for the prince 
william sound oil spill cleanup 
owning the paper is not going to change my political views 
any candidate i think is prodevelopment im probably going to 
support but the paper will not be supporting my political 
beliefs allen said 
the newspaper which celebrates its 75th anniversary next year 
and is as old as anchorage will remain the only locally owned and 
operated daily paper in alaskas largest city 
it would have been a tragedy to have outside interests control 
both newspapers in anchorage he said referring to the anchorage 
daily news a pulitzer prizewinning morning newspaper owned by 
californiabased mcclatchy newspapers group 
youll see a change in the looks of the times the content of 
the times beginning in january allen said well keep the 
same editorial philosophy were going to put the facts on the 
front page and editorialize on the editorial page 
theres not going to be any interference in the newsroom 
allen said they can report on veco as they have in the past all 
i ask is a more accurate story 
veco chafed at the coverage of its lengthy battle with the 
alaska public offices commission for the companys payroll plan for 
campaign contributions 
atwood said he sold the times to make it strong enough to 
compete with the mcclatchy group 
the times first was published in a tent during the construction 
of the alaska railroad was long the dominant paper but now is no 
2 in circulation the newspapers circulation is 34080 daily and 
44062 on sundays according to the audit bureau of circulations 
sept 30 figures the news circulation is 57671 daily and 73337 
on sundays 
veco is buying the times assets but not the anchorage times 
publishing co which will continue to be owned by atwood 
allen said his company will commit substantial resources to the 
newspaper to expand state and local coverage 
editorinchief bill tobin has expressed a desire to 
semiretire but will help during the transition allen said 
atwood will become publisher emeritus and times general manager 
william j hofer will become president and chief operating officer

many western governments are withholding 
aid the afghan people urgently need because they oppose the 
communist kabul government and want to help precipitate its 
downfall a un official says 
western donors had been counting on the swift defeat of the 
government following the soviet military pullout completed in 
february prince sadruddin aga khan told reporters monday 
they were taken by surprise that after the 15th of february 
after the last of the foreign troops withdrew that somehow a 
change in kabul did not occur very quickly said the prince who 
coordinates operation salam the un relief program for 
afghanistan 
he said a reluctance to donate has prolonged the suffering of 
afghans and discouraged the return of 5 million refugees from 
pakistan and iran 
why should they go back if their conditions outside are still 
better than those that they would find inside he asked 
the prince said many western donors disapprove of president 
najibs communist government and believe sending aid into 
afghanistan will help prop up his administration 
in point of fact a very large part of the country which is 
rural is controlled by the opposition by the resistance he 
said twothirds of the country is gradually returning to normal 
the needs are comparatively greater in those areas so by 
transferring aid to needy afghan groups in areas controlled by the 
resistance you would not be shoring up the government in kabul 
said the prince 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar appealed last 
year for 12 billion for afghan aid and reconstruction 
the prince said the western governments have not been 
extremely generous in responding to the secretarygenerals appeal 
so far 
his latest report issued monday shows moscow has pledged about 
600 million in aid and japan has pledged or given 201 million 
the united states by contrast has donated only 167 million 
in food and 2 million for instruction in clearing mines

sylvester stallone sure wouldnt have played 
it that way 
rocky balboa fought in philadelphia on monday night but he 
lost in a bout so devoid of drama it was stopped by the referee in 
the fifth round 
the story of jaime rocky balboa has little in common with 
the philadelphia prizefighter stallone played in the 1976 smash 
movie hit rocky and its sequels 
for one thing the real rocky is a welterweight not a 
heavyweight 
he didnt train by slugging sides of beef in a philly meat 
locker slogging up the steps of the art museum or through the 
italian market on ninth street and when he yells yo he means 
i 
the 27yearold balboa is a native of mexico whos now from san 
antonio 
about the only parallel with the movie that launched stallones 
movie career is that the real rocky also was an underdog the man 
who beat him meldrick taylor is an olympic gold medalist and 
unbeaten junior welterweight champ of the international boxing 
federation 
taylor who is from the city of brotherly love seemed to 
appreciate the irony 
i think its kind of sassy for rocky balboa to come to 
philadelphia and challenge me said taylor who dominated the 
fight from the outset 
when taylor connected with two lefts in the fifth round not 
even mickey the trainer or the lovely adrian could have saved 
balboa who says he was known as rocky before anyone ever heard of 
sylvester stallone 
a long time ago when id get together with my friends and 
fight they said i hit real hard he said they started calling 
me rocky

star performances can enliven the creakiest of 
drawing room comedies making the artifical and oldfashioned seem 
charming funny and even poignant 
that is the case at the ambassador theater where rex harrison 
stewart granger and particularly glynis johns resuscitate w 
somerset maughams the circle a hit from the 192122 broadway 
season if it werent for this stylish trio of veterans the play 
which opened monday night would be little more than lightweight 
stuff 
for nearly a halfhour after the curtain rises on designer 
desmond heeleys opulent flowerfilled drawing room maugham sets 
up the plot laboriously laying out the gossipy past he tells how 
30 years ago the beautiful lady kitty ran off with the great lord 
porteous leaving behind her husband clive and 5yearold son 
arnold 
now three decades later arnolds headstrong but romantic 
wife elizabeth has invited the errant mother and her lover for 
lunch of course kittys exhusband will be there too so the 
prospects of an uncomfortable reunion are downright certain 
to add to the embarrassment history may repeat itself 
elizabeth has fallen for another houseguest teddy a handsome 
colonialist from malaysia the plot turns on whether elizabeth will 
run off with teddy making the same decision her motherinlaw made 
so many years ago 
that is the principal plot development but there is more fun in 
watching the aging lovers quarrel renew their relationships and 
sharpen the points of their decadesold triangle 
harrison as the elderly playboy lord porteous resembles a 
blinking british buddha ever so polite and perplexed as he lumbers 
about the stage hes still in love with the woman he ran away with 
30 years ago but ardor can be taken for granted after so long a 
time and life keeps getting in the way 
harrisons role is small almost a throwaway but the actor is 
such a presence that he makes it seem better and bigger than it 
really is no one can growl out a line the way he can 
both porteous and especially lady kitty realize what they have 
given up for love he could have been prime minister she gave up a 
devoted husband and young son maughams play makes some 
surprisingly serious statements about the tradeoffs that people in 
love must make 
lady kitty is the plays most frivolous yet perceptive 
character old age becomes her enemy not her exhusband 
the tragedy of love is indifference she counsels the 
distraught elizabeth thats why she dyes her gray hair dresses in 
girlish pink and wears a lot of makeup she wont give up without a 
fight 
johns is superb she plays the role delicately yet with great 
comic spirit she knows just how far to go with kittys 
scatterbrained comments and actions and there are genuine tears 
when she cries over an old photograph of her much younger self 
if granger as kittys longabandoned husband cant quite keep 
up with the two other stars he does a credible job clive is the 
odd man out but maugham does not turn the husband into a moper 
and he seems a more satisfied person than the lovers who did him 
wrong 
director brian murray who supervises things at the slowest 
possible pace has less luck with the triangle of younger lovers 
roma downey and harley venton are earthbound as elizabeth and her 
newfound love robin chadwick is prissy and unconvincing as her 
husband you wonder why she married him in the first place 
but audiences are there to see harrison johns and granger and 
you feel cheated when the other actors are on too much of the time 
when the stars are center stage the circle seems complete 
when they are not this drawing room comedy is drawn out far too 
long 
critic linda winer however found the play creaked and 
wheezed a lot and managed to charm quite a bit she wrote in new 
york newsday 
johns lilting autumnal voice is perfect so is her fragile 
sense of duty rex harrison has raised crotchetiness to a great 
art granger has charm in abundance howard kissel wrote in 
the daily news 
when johns and harrison argue the new york times frank rich 
said one feels her bitterness even as one exults in the verbal 
chamber music created by two of the most distinctive speaking 
voices in the english theater 
critic clive barnes writing in the new york post praised the 
whole cast especially harrisons stately and ineffable charm 
tinged with a very correct arrogance

an elephant who had been pregnant for more than 
two years was back on her feet after veterinarians completed a 
risky caesarean section to remove a dead fetus 
six veterinarians and three equine surgeons at the san diego 
wild animal park spent 5 hours monday on the procedure on jean a 
19yearold 7000pound asian elephant who was believed to have 
been pregnant for more than 730 days the normal gestation period 
is between 618 and 648 days 
the caesarean section was performed as a last resort after jean 
was unable to deliver the 300pound calf and her system did not 
abort the fetus 
veterinarians had feared that the elephant could die a slow 
painful death if the decomposing fetus was not removed park 
spokesman tom hanscom said 
park officials will keep jean in isolation to make sure she does 
not contract infections or break her sutures 
she was a little shaky but she was a good patient during the 
anesthesia and she maintained herself very well including body 
temperature and pulse said dr jim oosterhuis the parks 
director of veterinary services who directed the procedure 
he said park officials believed it was the first caesarean 
section ever performed on an elephant 
it was very stressful it was a big procedure and it took a 
lot of effort he said theres a good possibility that she 
will not be able to breed again and even if she were able to we 
might not want to try to breed her to avoid problems that could 
occur from this procedure 
the equine surgeons were brought in because of their work with 
horses whose anatomy resembles that of an elephant hanscom said 
after weeks of tests veterinarians confirmed on saturday that 
jean was carrying a fetus that died sometime in september 
the elephant was under general anesthesia for the operation 
after the operation was completed veterinarians administered a 
drug to counteract the anesthesia 
five minutes later jean stood up on her feet to the cheer of 
the surgical team and other park employees 
we are relieved and quite pleased that she even made it 
through todays procedure hanscom said

basque separatists taking seats in 
parliament for the first time boycotted its opening ceremonies 
today hours after being attacked by masked gunmen who killed one 
deputy and badly wounded another 
both houses of parliament condemned the assassination of 
deputyelect jon josu muguruza 31 of the popular union party 
he was pronounced dead on arrival monday night at gregorio maranon 
hospital after being shot once in the head while dining in a madrid 
restaurant 
the second deputy 41yearold inaki esnaola was in very 
serious condition after six hours of surgery according to a 
hospital statement 
they said muguruza and esnaola were with the five other basque 
parliamentarians and three journalists at a table when the gunmen 
attacked 
no one claimed responsibility for the attack 
the popular union issued a statement blaming the spanish state 
apparatus and rightwing terrorists it called for a general 
strike wednesday in the threeprovince basque region to protest the 
killings 
popular union spokesman jon idigoras said the partys two other 
deputies and three senators had decided to boycott todays 
ceremonies which they believed should have been canceled following 
the assassination 
but he told reporters that his party generally considered the 
political wing of the armed separatist group eta would still 
participate in parliament for the first time since spains return 
to democracy in 1977 
if they think theyre going to intimidate us theyre 
wrong idigoras said the politicians were all elected in oct 29 
voting 
popular union spokesman xabier oleaga said on saturday that the 
party batasuna had decided to take its seats because it believed 
there would be new peace negotiations between the government and 
eta 
he said the party wants to be present in parliament to present 
its side of the issues 
eta whose initials stand for homeland and liberty in the basque 
language has claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed 
more than 600 people it began its violent campaign for 
independence from spain in 1968 
mondays shooting drew condemnation from all major political 
parties and the socialistled government 
prime minister felipe gonzalez said the attack was as 
horrendous as all terrorist acts and without doubt an attack 
against the pacification process in the basque region 
government spokeswoman rosa conde called it an attack against 
democracy and said the full weight of the law will fall on those 
responsible 
anonymous callers to several radio stations in the basque region 
said today that the attack had been carried out by the 
antiterrorist liberation groups a shadowy organization that some 
people link to the police 
in the hours after the attack police in the basque region 
reported several incidents including the explosion of a small bomb 
outside a branch office of the banco bilbao vizcaya bank in the 
town of santurce the bomb damaged a car but caused no injuries 
they said 
molotov cocktails started fires at a train station in the town 
of villabona and a bank in onate police said 
the head of the conservative popular party jose maria aznar 
told reporters he deplored the attack but he added that the basque 
partys outrage seemed hollow since it had never condemned the 
deaths of etas victims 
on sunday eta claimed responsibility for the death of an army 
lieutenant colonel gunned down in a car in downtown madrid last 
week he was the 17th victim of eta violence this year 
the gonzalez government began exploratory peace talks with 
exiled eta leaders in algeria earlier this year but canceled them 
in april when eta terrorists renewed their attacks

a commission appointed by mayor tom bradley 
has proposed a tough ethics code he called a model for other 
cities it would ban outside income for officials limit campaign 
spending and require detailed financial disclosure 
government in this country and in this city is suffering from 
a crisis in confidence panel member margaret m morrow said 
monday theres a lack of confidence in the integrity of its 
process its participants and its results 
bradleys own problems with conflictofinterest allegations led 
him to appoint the commission in april after he was elected to an 
unprecedented fifth term 
bradley would have been in violation of some provisions had the 
code been in effect panel members said 
bradley who would have to sign any ethics plan into law backed 
the package approved unanimously monday by the sevenmember 
commission to draft an ethics code for los angeles government 
they have proposed an ethics code that will pave the way for 
other cities across the nation to follow our lead bradley said 
in a statement 
he promised to work for its passage by the city council some of 
the proposals also must be approved by voters citywide because they 
would change the city charter 
mike woo who heads a council committee considering ethics 
reforms said most recommendations will be approved in some form 
but two a permanent ethics commission and public campaign 
financing have an uncertain future 
unlike some state and federal ethics measures the proposed code 
contains no provision to increase pay to make up for its ban on 
outside earned income and its strict limits on gifts 
were convinced that the best way to attract good people to 
government is it assure that the government itself will be highly 
ethical and that they will be working for an institution that is 
worthy of public respect said commission chairman geoffrey cowan 
it is the panels proposed ban on outside income for elected 
city officials and top decisionmakers that bradley would have 
violated cowan said the mayor accepted consulting fees from two 
banks that do business in the city 
there were suggestions he appointed the ethics panel to save 
face but the commission soon declared its independence from the 
mayor by obtaining private funding 
the commission recommended that elected officials and top 
appointed officials disclose in detail information about all income 
and investments including their primary home and investments 
outside the city 
the panel also called for giving the city attorney additional 
enforcement powers and appointing a special prosecutor in some 
cases 
the city attorney concluded an investigation in september by 
filing civil charges against bradley on allegations the mayor 
improperly reported some securities holdings the mayor still is 
under state and federal investigation

helicopters sprayed the san fernando valley 
against medflies overnight as agriculture officials lamented a new 
infestation threatening fruit crops elsewhere in southern 
california 
the situation is grave said roy cunningham the leading 
entomologist on the states mediterranean fruit fly advisory panel 
nobody wants more spraying but we have to face the fact that 
this is our fallback 
early today helicopters completed spraying the pesticide 
malathion over the san fernando valley communities of north 
hollywood studio city burbank and toluca lake crisscrossing a 
12squaremile section in an effort to eradicate the medfly which 
ruins fruit and vegetables 
before the aerial attack began late monday about 15 
environmentalists lined up along sunset boulevard in hollywood 
encouraging drivers to honk if they were against the spraying 
he purpose of the protest is to increase pressure on public 
officials to ban malathion said demonstrator randall toller 
the discovery monday of a pregnant medfly in brea about 25 
miles from downtown los angeles prompted state officials to order 
spraying next week in orange county to protect its 225 million 
citrus and nursery industry 
it is a tremendous threat to our industry said barbara buck 
spokeswoman for the western growers association were sensitive 
to public concern but the medfly does need to be eradicated 
in the san fernando valley residents were warned to stay 
inside keep pets indoors and cover their cars against the 
pesticides sticky fly bait which can harm automobile paint 
despite the warnings officials maintain malathion poses no harm 
to people 
pesticides have been sprayed over more than 100 square miles in 
the fourmonth medfly war in los angeles county the fight this 
year has cost taxpayers more than 10 million 
medflies threaten californias 16 billion farm economy because 
they lay eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables

soviet legislators rejected a kremlin plan to 
allow limited local autonomy with lawmakers complaining it would 
instead entrench central economic planning and worsen ethnic 
strife official news reports said today 
the soviet legislature which was reshaped over the past year 
rejected the plan in a vote monday it has been taking an 
increasingly independent role from communist party directives 
the government plan was presented to legislators by deputy 
premier leonid i abalkin president mikhail s gorbachevs top 
economic adviser it would govern relations between moscow and 
local authorities primarily those in the 15 soviet republics 
the official tass news agency said abalkin called for a cautious 
approach to economic decentralization because of the countrys 
difficult economic problems 
we are now making only the first steps on the path of the 
republics economic independence tass quoted him as saying it 
is very important not to go to extremes not to roll into a 
dangerous and unjustified separation and at the same time make a 
decisive step from extreme centralization on the union level 
but deputy vi alksnis said the plan was aimed at shaping a 
single federated government rather than a union of sovereign 
governments sought by the baltic and other republics tass said 
any other variant will lead to an aggravation of interethnic 
relations tass quoted alksnis as saying 
rejecting the administrativecommand style of managing the 
economy we must recognize that a moscow bureaucrat is no better 
than for example one from riga he added work collectives 
must at last gain the right of full independence from the central 
as well as the local apparatus 
the supreme soviet on monday also imposed price controls on 
several basic consumer goods including some foods and clothes and 
export controls on scare items like furs electrical appliances 
and fish products 
tass said the deputies imposed the price controls to help 
retirees and other lowincome groups hard hit by price increases 
and shortages of consumer goods

political leaders agreed today on a 
shortterm government of the countrys widely divided major 
parties ending a stalemate produced by inconclusive elections this 
month 
the three parties agreed to support a government whose 
lifeterm will last until midapril conservative leader 
constantine mitsotakis told a news conference 
the decision to hold general elections in april follows four 
rounds of talks between president christos sartzetakis and 
conservative socialist and communist leaders 
mitsotakis said the interim administration will be headed by a 
respected former bank of greece governor xenophon zolotas who is 
not a member of parliament 
the government will include members of all parties and also 
nonpolitical personalities mitsotakis said he added that the 
details of the cabinets makeup still have to be decided 
he said the administration will tackle pressing economic 
problems and negotiations with the united states on whether to 
renew an agreement for their bases in greece 
mitsotakis heads the new democracy party which in the nov 5 
elections came just short of winning the parliamentary majority 
needed to form a government alone 
he has since failed to find a coalition partner in either 
andreas papandreou the former socialist premier or communist 
leader harilaos florakis 
in the balloting new democracy took 148 seats in the 300member 
parliament papandreous panhellenic socialist movement won 128 and 
the communist coalition garnered 21 
on june 18 elections also failed to produce a winner a 
conservativecommunist government led the country until the 
november elections 
the talks between the party leaders had been deadlocked until 
today over a demand by former socialist premier andreas papandreou 
that the electoral system be changed before his panhellenic 
socialist movement supported any government 
his proposed change to simple proportional representation would 
have made it even harder for any party to win a majority in the 
300member unicameral parliament under the present system a party 
that receives at least 47 percent of the vote can govern alone 
mitsotakis rejected the condition he said party leaders had 
agreed that the april elections would be conducted with the 
existing electoral system

unexploded bombs on public land outside target ranges 
environmental protection chief lew dodgion who issued the order

per day per violation 
some of the bombs may have been dropped as long as 30 years ago 
no injuries have been reported 
capt rex rackowitz fallon commander said some of the bombs 
and rockets may have landed outside the fenced ranges because of 
inexperienced pilots 
other bombs may have skipped across the desert floor for miles 
before coming to rest on federal bureau of land management land 
outside the ranges he said 
the alleged violations of state law include a failure to notify 
the state and failure to get a stateapproved plan to deal with the 
situation

complying with state laws and to give us some background on when 
they discovered this problem dodgion said

were on public grazing lands for year but there was no effort made 
to remove them until recently

the bureau of land management has closed lands it holds around the 
ranges pending inspections

defense secretary dick cheney is studying 
suggestions for revolutionary changes in americas military 
including cutting 100000 army soldiers getting rid of 100 navy 
ships and closing at least a dozen air force bases pentagon 
sources say 
amid the longrange budget planning a senior pentagon official 
said monday that cheney also is considering a budget plan for the 
1991 fiscal year that could cut 20 billion from the projected 317 
billion spending level 
it could be that bad the official said it could be that 
we have to cut that much 
cheney planned to hold a second day of meetings today with 
pentagon chiefs to pore over proposed wideranging cutbacks for 
1992 to 1994 which some pentagon insiders say could be the most 
sweeping since the end of the vietnam war 
while much of the activity is driven by hints of change in the 
soviet threat the pentagon also is trying to get ahead of congress 
in planning for the nearly inevitable budget squeeze officials say 
mr cheney has no intention of going up to capitol hill and 
having his budget thrown back in his face defense department 
spokesman pete williams said monday this is going to be a very 
painful process for everyone 
some congressional sources however said they are wary about 
the pentagon projections of major force cuts suggesting the 
numbers may be overstated to grab the limelight from lawmakers who 
have been warning the pentagon to tighten its belt 
the pentagon expects to submit its 1991 spending projection to 
the office of management and budget by dec 8 the official said 
last week cheney ordered the military chiefs of the army navy 
and air force to produce worstcase budget cuts designed to 
slash projected spending including earlieranticipated increases 
by 180 billion over the threeyear period from fiscal 1992 through 
1994 
these are revolutionary changes said one knowledgeable 
military source mr cheney is really trying to shake the service 
chiefs out he wants their backs pressed to the wall telling him 
exactly what it is they can give up he wants their grimmest 
scenarios 
the army has told cheney it could cut over a fiveyear period 
as many as 100000 soldiers which could translate into at least 
several divisions said one pentagon official 
were mostly people the other forces can cut their expensive 
weapons but our money is in our folks the officials said 
wed like to make sure that if we have to have fewer units we 
want to have the best we can get 
the navy has said its worst case could envision a cut of up 
to 100 ships bringing the number down to 466 and dashing the 
dreams of the previous administrations 600ship navy one navy 
source said 
other proposals include mothballing the services four world war 
iiera battleships cutting the number of aircraft carriers from 
the current 15 to 10 or 12 and getting rid of 20 to 30 flight 
squadrons the source said 
another pentagon official said the air force has suggested 
cutting at least 12 bases stretching out purchases of the b2 
stealth bomber and eliminating five fighter wings 
the review also will require the air force to take another look 
at its proposal for two new mobile missiles the railbased mx and 
the smaller truckbased midgetman the source said 
on monday cheney held more than four hours of conferences with 
his civilian advisors the military chiefs of staff and joint 
chiefs chairman gen colin powell to review the militarys 
suggestions 
williams said cheney had not made any decisions about the 
reported suggestions 
he called the activity a budget exercise designed to force 
the pentagon to respond to the changes occurring under soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev and the budget pressures of the 
nations deficit 
williams said it was clear to the pentagon leadership that 
president bushs earlier projections for 1 percent spending 
increases for fiscal 1991 and 1992 followed by 2 percent increases 
in 1993 and 1994 arent realistic anymore

top economists today began debating the 
promarket economic program of the solidarityled government which 
described the polish economy as on the brink of collapse 
more than 400 economists representing the 55000 members of the 
polish economic society convened for a twoday meeting in the city 
of lodz the official pap news agency said 
the building energy and agriculture sectors are among those 
reporting a drop in production according to economic indicators 
for october released monday by the main statistical office known 
by its polish initials gus 
a total of 5500 apartment buildings were completed in october 
157 percent less than in october 1988 the government said 
between january and october of this year 65200 apartments were 
made available to the public 182 percent less than last year 
poles sometimes have to wait more than 20 years for apartments 
a chronic housing shortage was a major public grievance against the 
communist regime which lost control of the government in august 
after more than 40 years in power 
with winter approaching production in the fuel and power 
industry was down 16 percent and coal production was down 107 
percent from the same period in 1988 the report said 
the october inflation rate was put at 548 percent the annual 
inflation rate is now estimated at over 700 percent 
the cabinet met until late monday night to continue work on the 
1990 budget following a visit by the representatives of the 
international monetary fund to warsaw in october pap said 
its prognosis was grim 
at present polands economy is on the brink of collapse this 
state as well as the experience of other countries exclude the 
possibility of gradual overcoming of such a profound crisis pap 
said in a report on the cabinet meeting 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the former solidarity editor 
who became the first noncommunist prime minister in the east bloc 
on aug 24 already has appealed to coal miners to work saturdays 
to make up for shortfalls in coal production 
pap said monday that miners had responded to the appeal and 
extracted 116000 more tons of coal last saturday than on an 
average saturday for the last three months 
a commentary in the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza today 
criticized the economic program saying its goals exceeded the 
governments means 
the government program sounds innovative for it uses 
formulations from the arsenal of a market economy only it is not 
possible to implement it for the goals it outlines do not 
correspond to the instruments the newspaper said 
mazowiecki has stressed the need for quick implementation of the 
reforms but the government is learning that it takes time to pass 
legislation and to reverse over 40 years of bureaucratic practices 
the economic plan was announced in early october it calls for 
taking steps to change the principles of ownership changing the 
banking system and making state enterprises more efficient 
it also envisages a social security system to protect workers 
during the period of economic restructuring

drugs found in the bloodstream of a black 
motorcyclist shot to death by a policeman would not have caused him 
to attack the officer an expert for the prosecution testified 
dr herbert moskowitz an expert on druginduced behavior said 
monday that the high amounts of thc the active ingredient in 
marijuana in the bloodstream of clement lloyd would have tended 
to make him more mellow 
moskowitz of the university of california at los angeles also 
said that the small amounts of alcohol and cocaine that he had 
ingested would not have significantly affected his driving or his 
behavior 
the defense for colombianborn officer william lozano claims 
lloyd 23 aimed his motorcycle at the officer while fleeing from a 
squad car and that lozano shot him in selfdefense 
the jan 16 shooting set off three days of riots 
lloyds passenger allan blanchard 24 died in the subsequent 
crash and lozano 31 was charged with two counts of manslaughter 
in earlier testimony monday associate medical examiner arthur 
copeland said the levels of thc in lloyds bloodstream were among 
the highest on record at the medical examiners office 
he also said lloyd had a moderate amount of alcohol in his blood 
and small traces of cocaine in his nose 
using the head of a mannequin copeland traced the path of 
lozanos bullet from the left front temple to the rear of the head 
saying it appeared the officer was to the side of the motorcycle 
when the shot was fired 
the prosecution contends that the motorcycle was not headed 
directly at lozano and that he fired unnecessarily 
copeland also testified that lloyd was carrying 55 grams of 
marijuana and 1500 in cash at the time 
the rioting that followed the shooting left one person dead from 
gunfire 11 people injured and 13 buildings burned down in black 
neighborhoods

hepatitis b a bloodborne disease that can 
cause fatal liver cancer is a much greater worldwide health threat 
than aids but us doctors are doing little to promote use of a 
vaccine against the illness an infectious disease expert says 
there are 20 to 30 times more carriers of the hepatitis b virus 
than there are people infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv that causes aids dr sanford f kuvin vice 
chairman of the national foundation for infectious diseases said 
monday 
hepatitis b is the most important bloodborne disease in the 
world today and that includes aids kuvin said in an interview 
at the fourth national forum on aids and hepatitis b there are 
almost 300 million carriers of the hepatitis b virus in the world 
today and there are about 10 to 15 million carriers of the hiv 
virus 
among carriers of the hepatitis b virus 25 percent or about 60 
million will die from primary liver cancer he said an additional 
15 percent or about 45 million will die of cirrhosis another 
liver disease 
hepatitis b is as great a threat to the health of americans as 
aids kuvin said there are about 300000 new infections of 
hepatitis b annually in the united states 
about 30000 of those newly infected will become carriers who 
can spread the disease and about onefourth of this number 
eventually will die of cirrhosis or liver cancer he said 
the exact number of americans who die annually from primary 
liver cancer caused by hepatitis b is not known because records on 
liver cancer deaths do not reflect if the cancer originated in the 
liver or moved there from another site 
however controlled studies have shown that onefourth of all 
hepatitis b virus carriers will develop primary liver cancer or 
cirrhosis at some point in their lives 
as of sept 30 there have been 109167 reported cases of aids 
with 64849 deaths since june 1 1981 
in a keynote address to the conference dr louis w sullivan 
secretary of health and human services said americans need to 
take hepatitis b as seriously as they do hiv infection 
sullivan said that even though a vaccine is available to protect 
against hepatitis b the therapy is not widely used 
even health care workers who should know better have a 
problem taking hepatitis b seriously he said a centers for 
disease control survey of hospitals with vaccination programs found 
that only 36 percent of health care workers have received the 
vaccination 
sullivan said 10000 to 12000 health care workers contract 
hepatitis b annually while caring for patients and kuvin said 
about 300 of those infected health care workers die annually of 
liverrelated illnesses 
a health care worker dies virtually every day because they 
werent inoculated against this disease he said 
kuvin said that there are 26 known cases of health care workers 
becoming infected with the aids virus on the job 
both the hepatitis b virus and the aids virus are spread through 
contact with infected blood through sexual intercourse and through 
sharing of needles among intravenous drug users both viruses also 
are spread from birthing mother to newborn 
kuvin said a health care worker who receives an accidental 
needle prick while treating patients infected with hepatitis b has 
a 40 percent chance of becoming infected the threat of contracting 
aids from a needle prick is only about 05 percent he said 
most people infected with hepatitis b suffer mild symptoms and 
then recover but about 10 percent become carriers of the virus and 
a fourth of these eventually will develop liver cancer or cirrhosis 
despite the known dangers of the disease kuvin said only 24 
percent of all doctors have bothered to get the hepatitis b vaccine 
it is absurd how underutilized this vaccine is said kuvin 
he said the vaccine developed through gene manipulation techniques 
and available since 1982 is the safest and most effective 
vaccine in the world 
hepatitis b is most common in asia and africa and some 
countries there now require routine inoculations against the 
disease the world health organization has recommended the 
hepatitis b vaccine be part of routine childhood vaccination 
programs but kuvin said no legislative body in the us has 
proposed such a program for americans 
this is the first time in american history that a vaccine has 
been developed that did not produce a reduction in disease said 
the physician this is a national tragedy in incubation

nasa crews made up for lost time 
today as they worked under a tight timetable for launching space 
shuttle discovery on a fiery nighttime flight wednesday with five 
astronauts and a spy satellite 
theyre making headway and expect to be caught up by tonight 
were on schedule for wednesday night space agency spokeswoman 
lisa malone reported today 
forecasters said the weather outlook was 80 percent favorable 
but that an advancing cold front would drop the odds to 40 percent 
if the launch were postponed to thursday thanksgiving 
workers had fallen behind in checking out systems and putting 
the two solid fuel booster rockets back together they had been 
opened last week so technicians could inspect computer boxes for 
faulty wiring one box was replaced 
because the mission is secret nasa has said only that liftoff 
is scheduled between 630 pm and 1030 pm and that the agency 
will make the countdown public just nine minutes before liftoff 
the launch is expected to take place about 730 pm 
there also will be a news blackout throughout the mission 
it will be only the third afterdark launch in 32 shuttle 
missions the last one in november 1985 was visible for the 700 
miles from key west to charleston sc 
this is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the defense 
department officials said the secrecy makes it more difficult for 
soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off cape canaveral 
to track the shuttle 
the astronauts assigned to the mission slept during daylight 
hours monday to adjust their schedule to the hours they will keep 
in space because of the nighttime launch at night the commander 
air force col frederick c gregory and the pilot air force col 
john blaha practiced night landings on the shuttle runway here in 
a jet equipped to handle like a shuttle 
disovery is scheduled to land at night at edwards air force 
base calif after a flight expected to last four days gregory 
and blaha also would have to land the shuttle in the dark here or 
at emergency runways in spain or north africa in case of an abort 
after liftoff 
gregory who flew on a 1985 shuttle mission is the first black 
to command a shuttle mission 
the other crew members are navy capt manley l carter jr f 
story musgrave and kathryn c thornton all mission specialists 
their main job will be to deploy a satellite that sources who 
demanded anonymity said will listen in on diplomatic and military 
communications in the soviet union and other countries

the chief public prosecutor today said 
he will not appeal the acquittal of a man in the slaying of prime 
minister olof palme 
the prosecutor torsten jonsson said it was unrealistic to 
believe the supreme court would overturn the nov 2 decision of the 
svea court of appeals the national news agency tt reported 
palme a threetime socialist prime minister who dominated 
swedish politics for more than a decade was shot feb 28 1986 
while walking home from a movie with his wife lisbeth 
a district court in july convicted christer pettersson and 
sentenced him to life imprisonment largely based on mrs palmes 
identification 
the appellate court later ruled that mrs palmes testimony left 
too much room for uncertainty 
the appellate court however said that pettersson had no alibi 
and that he was most likely the man seen waiting for palme outside 
the movie theatre 
pettersson 42 was previously convicted of several lesser 
crimes including manslaughter he was confined for 10 months 
during the interrogation and trial for the palme slaying and could 
be arrested again in the case if new evidence is uncovered

namibias newly elected assembly broke 
into applause today at its opening session when the dominant party 
proposed democratic principles as guidelines for the territorys 
government 
the assembly is working on a constitution that will cement the 
territorys independence after 74 years of south african rule 
the southwest africa peoples organization or swapo which 
waged a 23year war against south african rule won 41 of the 72 
seats in elections earlier this month however the constitution 
must be approved by at least 48 or twothirds of the members 
the 72 assembly members gathered at the tintenpalast namibias 
seat of government since it was built by german colonial rulers in 
1910 
theoben gurirab foreign affairs secretary for swapo proposed 
that the constitution be the supreme law of the land the 
government consist of an elected executive responsible to the 
legislative branch and an independent judicial branch a 
declaration of fundamental rights be written including freedom of 
movement speech and a free press 
swapo has been known as marxist throughout most of its history 
and its stand has been vague and contradictory regarding the 
democratic principles outlined in a 1982 un document calling for 
namibias independence 
gurirabs proposal was unanimously applauded but could not be 
adopted because the constitutional assembly does not yet have rules 
of order the assembly was adjourned until next week 
the democratic turnhalle alliance a multiracial coalition that 
favors a capitalist economy for predominantly black namibia has 21 
seats in the assembly the remaining 10 are divided among five 
other parties 
im here with great humility and pride swapo president sam 
nujoma told the assembly pride because an occasion like this 
only happens once in a lifetime humility because i sam nujoma 
son of an ordinary citizen have been honored to be part of the 
struggle that brought us here and to lead us to nationhood 
hage geingob who headed swapos election campaign was elected 
chairman of the assembly 
the initial sessions are expected to focus on setting ground 
rules for writing the constitution the parties have said they hope 
the document will be completed by early next year and independence 
from south africa can be declared shortly afterward 
marrti ahtisarri head of the un team monitoring the 
transition to independence was present at the opening of the 
assembly he has said he expects namibia also known as southwest 
africa to become independent before the united nations is 
scheduled to depart at the end of march 
south africa captured namibia from germany in 1915 and gained a 
league of nations mandate to administer the territory the leagues 
successor the united nations revoked the mandate in 1966 and 
swapo launched its bush war 
south africa agreed last year to allow independence under a 
usmediated peace accord that also calls for a phased withdrawal 
of cubas 50000 troops from marxistruled angola namibias

albert hakims lawyers have reached an 
agreement with prosecutors that calls for the arms dealer to plead 
guilty today to a misdemeanor for his role in the irancontra 
affair sources said 
hakim who helped broker the sale of us arms to his native 
iran as part of thenpresident reagans efforts to free american 
hostages in the middle east is scheduled to enter the plea in 
federal court said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but the sources stressed that the deal was not final until hakim 
actually appeared in court and entered the plea before us 
district judge gerhard a gesell a previous court appearance was 
abruptly canceled recently when hakim backed out the sources said 
the exact terms of the plea agreement could not be obtained but 
sources said hakim had agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor 
mary belcher a spokeswoman for independent counsel lawrence e 
walsh declined to comment 
lawyers for reagan meanwhile filed court papers today 
indicating they were studying the possibility of resisting a 
subpoena for the former president to produce documents and testify 
at the irancontra trial of former national security adviser john 
m poindexter 
the subpoena raises novel and complex constitutional issues 
the former presidents lawyers said in seeking a twoweek delay in 
producing notes and papers sought by the subpoena 
these issues relate to the scope of the executive privilege 
the power of the court to compel a former president to testify in 
open court and the threshold requirements necessary to support a 
subpoena against a former president said reagans attorney 
theodore olson 
in the hakim case it was expected that walsh would drop major 
charges of conspiracy theft and wire fraud stemming from the arms 
dealers involvement in the diversion of weaponssale profits to 
the nicaraguan contras 
those charges were dropped against hakims other codefendants 
after the government refused to release classified information 
necessary for trying those counts in open court 
hakim also was charged with conspiracy and offering an illegal 
gratuity to former white house aide oliver l north the charges 
stem from a 200000 swiss bank account that hakim and his former 
business partner richard v secord allegedly set up for norths 
family 
north a former national security council aide and retired 
marine officer was ordered to perform 1200 hours of community 
service for his irancontra convictions 
secord a retired air force major general pleaded guilty nov 9 
to one count of lying to congress during the televised hearings 
about the irancontra affair 
the justice department also has asked for more time to comply 
with subpoenas for reagan documents in the national archives and 
records administration 
the governments pleadings indicated misgivings about the 
subpoenas seeking reagans papers and testimony at poindexters 
irancontra trial poindexter is accused of lying to congress to 
obstruct its inquiries into the irancontra affair 
the justice department asked the court to delay until dec 6 the 
deadline to comply with subpoenas for records at the archives the 
subpoenas are returnable on wednesday 
the department said it also sought a delay in the subpoena 
personally served on the former president noting that reagans 
attorney would be filing a similar request 
justice department spokesman daniel eramian said the archives 
needed more time to review more than 100000 pages of documents 
the justice department also noted that depending upon their 
nature the united states may wish to assert that certain requested 
documents must be protected from disclosure because of their 
privileged nature 
however even if some material is so privileged the united 
states may choose to make a discretionary release in any event if 
given time to consider the overall ramifications the department 
said 
the department noted that following the review of the documents 
both the united states and president reagan must consider what if 
any position each is required to take considering the fact and 
scope of the live trial testimony sought of the former president

a proplo activist says palestinians have 
lost the initiative in the nearly twoyearold uprising and is 
proposing a new strategy based on creating a provisional government 
sari nusseibah said in an interview with the associated press on 
monday that if positive energy were focused on building the 
institutions of palestinian statehood there would be less 
violence both among palestinians and with israelis 
i believe over the last few months we have lost the initiative 
and there has been a vacuum of strategy he said we havent 
had any renewed strategic plan to put into the intefadeh uprising 
in my opinion these two things have helped in creating some 
of the disorders the friction and fighting and some tendencies 
towards violence 
by focusing on building infrastructure for the state he said 
you get rid of the diversions of energy that have taken place 
over the past few months 
the remarks unusually candid for a senior palestinian 
activists in part appeared to grow out of rising frustration over 
the killing or intimidation of palestinians by other palestinians 
according to army figures released this week palestinian 
activists have carried out 670 attacks this year against other 
palestinians most accused of collaborating with israel by 
associated press count at least 147 arabs have died in such 
attacks 
some 615 palestinians have died in confrontations with soldiers 
nusseibah said the problem stemmed largely from a lack of 
overall coordination among local groups that had sprung up during 
the intefadeh which he said led to confusion and unauthorized 
initiatives 
our idea is to unite them in a single policy and seek to 
implement it he said 
as a result he said little headway in achieving statehood had 
been made since the plo met in algeria in november 1988 and 
declared an independent palestinian state in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
a philosphy professor at bir zeit university in the west bank 
nusseibah has been described in israeli court documents as closely 
associated with the proplo underground directing the uprising 
against israeli rule 
his holy land press service was closed over the summer after 
authorities said it was an intefadeh planning center and he was 
accused of acting as a conduit for plo funds 
he said that in the wake of last years plo declaration of an 
independent palestinian state in the israelioccupied lands we 
should have moved in my opinion one step further in the direction 
of state creation we didnt do that 
nusseibah said the plos 15member executive committee for 
example should be transformed into a cabinet parceling out 
responsibilities such as health services education and information 
palestinian officials in exile and those in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip would report to the same minister thus 
alleviating some of the confusion about lines of authority 
he suggested palestinians now serving in the israelirun 
military government of the west bank and gaza could be named as 
officials of a palestinian government such officials have been 
urged to resign by underground leaflets that have labeled them 
collaborations 
in the past the concept of a provisional palestinian government 
has been proposed as a vehicle for negotiations one that could get 
around israels objections to talking to the plo 
nusseibah said the plo might wither away in its present form 
if the infrastructure of a palestinian state is created allowing 
the plo to become part of the government 
i think that people have come to realize here that a 
palestinian state is not going to arrive in a wrapped package 
sent by the united nations he said they have to create it

schoolchildren clasping their parents 
hands returned to class today for the first time since a tornado 
killed seven classmates in the cafeteria 
flowers were piled high outside the cafeteria wall but with a 
stiff wind whipping the american flag on its flagpole nearby few 
people paused at the boardedup wall at east coldenham elementary 
school 
children riding school buses waved and smiled as they passed 
reporters and police clustered at the end of the driveway to the 
270student school reporters were kept away from the school and 
school officials had no comment 
seven 7 and 8yearolds were killed and 18 others injured last 
thursday when a tornado slammed into the cafeteria wall raining 
glass and concrete on students having lunch 
dozens of pupils visited the damaged cafeteria on monday though 
students and their parents were encouraged to look at the 
cafeteria they wont eat lunch there any time soon principal 
harvey gregory said 
the cafeteria carries the spraypainted epitaph pray for the 
children 
more than 20 counselors were on hand monday and were to return 
today 
in some ways the hardest task was reassuring parents gregory 
said 
students are very resilient gregory said they get back 
very quickly but parents dealing with the fears and traumas 
how do i send my kid back into the cafeteria i can reassure 
parents now that they will never go back into that cafeteria in its 
present form 
funerals were held monday for five young victims and two were 
held saturday eleven of the 18 injured children remained 
hospitalized two in critical condition 
compounding the tragedy a 5yearold east coldenham pupil 
rosalie sbordone died monday from injuries suffered in a car 
accident the day before the accident happened only a few hundred 
yards from the school but was unrelated to the steady stream of 
mourners there police said 
at the school sheryl pressel choked back sobs while leaving 
with her 10yearold son billy who wasnt hurt 
what amazes me are some of the parents of the children that 
died are in there today pressel said i dont think i could 
handle that if i had a child that i lost in that school i 
wouldnt want to go back in there 
billy said he felt sort of regular coming back to the school 
for the first time since the tornado 
all i felt was a little sadness he said it helped me a 
little 
parents leaving the school stopped their cars to watch the 
funeral procession for 8yearold maria stumer pass 
rooms at the reopened school were set aside for adults and 
children to slip off to if they become upset said horst graefe 
director of personnel for the valley central school district 
it will cost nearly 400000 to rebuild the cafeteria wall but 
school superintendent james coonan said he wants to make it look as 
different as possible with less glass 
well do anything to make it comfortable for the kids he 
said if we have to make like booths in mcdonalds we will

talks between south and north korea on 
an exchange of visits by separated family members hit a snag today 
after the north insisted on showing a revolutionary opera by its 
leader on south korean television 
red cross delegates from the two koreas agreed to continue 
discussions monday on the proposed dec 8 family exchange but the 
chances of an agreement appeared slim 
the prospect of the family exchange is dark as long as the 
north korean side sticks to its plan to show a revolutionary opera 
encouraging class struggle said south korean senior delegate 
song youngdae after eight hours of talks 
north koreas chief delegate pak yong su urged seoul to accept 
the revolutionary opera saying all the south korean people want 
to see it 
the opera is by north korean president kim il sung it glorifies 
him and his late mother kim jung suk 
i dont think it would be impossible to reach an agreement 
pak told reporters when asked about prospects for the talks which 
reopened in september after a severalmonth stalemate 
the delegates meeting at this truce village inside the 
demilitarized zone overcame one problem today when they agreed on 
the numbers an exchange of 571member delegations for a period of 
four days starting dec 8 
they also agreed that each side would determine the composition 
of its own delegation which would be comprised of separated family 
members entertainers support personnel and reporters 
but the two sides could not agree on terms for their 
entertainers to perform live on television 
north korea demanded four segments of air time each lasting at 
least three hours during the fourday exchange south korea 
revising its original proposal offered to allow three performances 
of 2 hours each 
north korean delegates insisted their entertainers needed at 
least three hours to present the opera 
south korean officials denounced north korea saying it was 
injecting political propaganda into the humanitarian project and 
strongly indicated that seoul would not accept the showing of the 
opera 
there are about 10 million separated family members in the two 
koreas which were divided by the partition of the korean peninsula 
in 1945 and the korean war in 195053 
the red cross talks are one of several channels of dialogue 
under way to help ease tension on the peninsula talks on sports 
political and parliamentary contacts also have made little progress

the federal government has gone to court in an 
unprecedented attempt to force two criminallaw firms to disclose 
the names of clients who paid them in cash 
the action filed in federal court friday was the first attempt 
to enforce internal revenue service demands for the information 
from lawyers nationwide 
a 1984 federal law aimed at money laundering requires reporting 
of cash transactions of 10000 or more 
the justice department announced the legal action monday 
both law firms involved in the case fischetti pomerantz amp 
russo and goldberger amp dubin have represented alleged mob figures 
and drug suspects 
they have refused to turn over the information saying that it 
would violate the rights of their clients and the attorneyclient 
privilege 
calls to the two firms were not returned today 
assistant us attorney kay k gardiner said the government was 
merely enforcing the law 
the law is that information regarding fees and the identity of 
clients is not privileged she said 
us district judge milton pollack ordered the firms to appear 
in court dec 19 to explain why they should not be forced to 
provide the information if they fail to comply they could face 
criminal penalties including prison terms and fines of as much as 
500000 
the action is only the latest battle between the irs and defense 
lawyers 
prosecutors in new york and washington have sought to force 
lawyers to forfeit fees paid by defendants whose money allegedly 
came from crime the supreme court approved the prosecutors 
forfeiture claims earlier this year

television cameras focused on the house of commons 
today to give britons their first live screen view of the 
venerable if sometimes raucous mother of parliaments 
the first image they saw in the live broadcast was the gowned 
bewigged speaker bernard weatherill bellowing order order 
to bring chattering excited lawmakers into line for the tv debut 
of the mother of parliaments 
the unelected house of lords has permitted television broadcasts 
of its proceedings since 1985 and queen elizabeth iis ceremonial 
opening of parliament was seen nationwide earlier this morning 
but the house of commons the often rowdy elected chamber down 
the hallway resisted the cameras until now sticking only with 
live radio broadcasts that began in 1978 
former conservative cabinet minister ian gow delivered the 
traditional message of thanks to the queen for outlining the 
governments legislative program earlier today in the house of 
lords 
prime minister margaret thatcher leader of the governing 
conservative party and neil kinnock leader of the opposition 
laborites then prepared to joust with each other about the 
contents of the queens speech 
any other lawmaker could join in providing he or she can catch 
the speakers eye by standing up and waving an order paper a 
printed copy of the days agenda and be called 
the chamber can be a noisy place with much booing and braying 
and its weatherill who can be heard repeatedly shouting order 
order in a bid to restore calm at times of tension 
but tv viewers are not going to see it all 
to prevent anything unseemly being shown such as campaign 
buttons outrageous dress or bored legislators asleep on their 
green leather benches the televisors have been ordered to show 
only the head and shoulders of whoever is speaking 
i think its terrible that head shots will only be used i 
could be wearing a tutu and nobody would notice said laborite 
austin mitchell 
debates in the 650member chamber go on for hours and hours 
sometimes all night eight remote control cameras have been 
installed in the ornate chamber britains four national channels 
and the sky satellite network will be able to broadcast as much as 
they like of the daily proceedings live or recorded 
cspan the american cablesatellite public affairs network 
planned to offer portions of the debates to its subscribers 
it has taken 30 years of debate to get cameras into the commons 
a 318264 vote in february 1988 agreed to them for an 
experimental six months although the house of lords where the 
peers most of them hereditary sit on scarlet benches have been 
on live tv since 1985 
the us house of representatives has allowed television since 
1979 
the 21month delay in getting the cameras into the commons 
included the dispatch of a delegation to canada to see how 
parliament is televised there 
planning the invasion of normandy in world war ii took only 12 
months grumbled lawmaker frank dobson

the partisan shouts and jeers of the commons have made it a 
byword for unruly behavior this weeks comments in the media 
centered on whether the cameras will make the chamber better 
behaved or possibly worse 
londons evening standard newspaper predicted monday that the 
commons was unlikely to beat the soap operas as a favorite with the 
public 
but at least we may get an insight into why they make those 
peculiar noises we have heard for so long on the commons sound

the nicaraguan government seeking a 
ceasefire agreement today dropped its demand for a total 
withdrawal of contra rebels from nicaraguan territory and called 
instead for a pullback of 2300 insurgents 
outlining the new proposal at a news conference nicaraguan vice 
foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said the figure represents the 
total number of contras who have infiltrated into nicaragua from 
base camps in honduras in recent weeks 
if the contras do not accept the proposal they have no 
interest in a ceasefire tinoco said 
he spoke to reporters at the nicaraguan embassy shortly before 
the resumption of ceasefire talks with the contras at the 
organization of american states 
the contras have insisted on a ceasefire in place and have said 
that there has been no significant increase in the number of rebels 
operating inside nicaraguan territory in recent weeks 
but tinoco said even the state department has acknowledged that 
about 2000 contras have crossed back across the border from the 
honduran base camps since the first week of october 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega suspended the ceasefire on 
nov 1 after alleging the contra forces had engaged in terrorist 
activities 
the chief contra negotiator col enrique bermudez has accused 
the sandinistas of hardening their position by insisting on both 
the withdrawal of the contras and their demobilization but tinoco 
has said bermudez misunderstood the sandinista position 
a commission made of united nations and organization of american 
states mediators spent the weekend drawing up revisions of a plan 
they had set forth during the early going of the negotiations 
which began nov 9 
part of mondays negotiating session was spent going over the 
revisions 
before the talks resumed monday rebel spokesman bosco matamoros 
accused the sandinistas of not negotiating in good faith 
they want a total surrender he said they want an 
unconditional surrender 
matamoros called for an immediate ceasefire with appropriate 
verification procedures 
tinoco reaffirmed his governments view that the ceasefire must 
be linked to a separation of forces meaning the withdrawal of 
contra forces to base camps in honduras 
thats fundamental tinoco said 
tinoco also disclosed he had a brief meeting with a state 
department official saturday to discuss issues relating to the 
staffing of the respective embassies of the two countries 
he didnt identify the official with whom he spoke 
the administration generally has avoided highlevel contact with 
the sandinistas urging them instead to focus attention on 
resolving their differences with both the contras and the internal 
opposition

delegates to a communist party 
congress today extolled hardline leader nicolae ceausescu and 
offered lavish praise for his rejection of democratic reform 
politburo member and labor leader miu dobrescu said ceausescus 
nearly sixhour speech to delegates monday was an exemplary model 
of creative tackling of presentday realities a genuine thesaurus 
of social and political thinking 
ceausescu the east blocs fiercest hardline leader opened the 
party congress with a firm rejection of reforms sweeping the 
region instead he declared his intention to increase government 
and party control of daily affairs 
the ruling out of the capitalist system is the leading 
requirement of a just society ceausescu asserted to orchestrated 
displays of adulation from more than 3000 delegates at downtown 
palace hall in bucharest 
he also called for the cancellation of the hitlerstalin pact of 
1939 under which germany and the soviet union later annexed parts 
of eastern europe the romanian province of bessarabia was annexed 
by moscow a year later under the pacts secret protocol it was the 
first time ceausescu had mentioned the accord 
a clear unequivocal stand of condemnation and cancellation 
must be taken against all the accords concluded with hitlers 
germany practical conclusions being drawn to eliminate all the 
consequences of those accords and dictates he said in his speech 
romanian communist leaders never reclaimed the province now 
called soviet moldavia however the party daily scinteia for the 
first time published a story nov 14 describing recent popular 
unrest in kishinev the republics capital 
the delegates support underscored ceausescus tight control of 
the congress and the personality cult that has grown up around him 
during his 24 years in power 
his comments were interrupted for up to 50 seconds by shouts of 
romania communism ceausescu heroism and other slogans 
shouted in unison to the accompaniment of rhythmic clapping 
the fiveday congress is expected to approve ceausescus 
economic plan for the next five years 
the plan continues strong state control of the economy 
ceausescu has invested billions of dollars in a crash 
industrialization program that led to widespread food and energy 
shortages for romanias 23 million people 
yet the longer the food lines and the more vocal the peoples 
complaints the more harshly the regime has cracked down on critics 
during the congress ceausescu as well as relatives and 
supporters were expected to win reelection to the party leadership 
although a nominal ally hungary for the first time sent no 
party delegation to the congress amid tensions over hungarys rapid 
moves toward democracy and its accusations that romania mistreats 
its hungarian minority 
also absent were all sixteen nato countries except turkey in 
the past western ambassadors have attended the opening day of the 
congress 
a us statement expressed the depths of us concern over the 
human rights situation for which the romanian communist party is 
responsible 
other embassies also said they were protesting human rights 
violations 
romania has been targeted internationally for draconian 
restrictions on its citizens romanians are forced to report 
contacts with foreigners and they have severely limited political 
and religious freedoms

four psychologists who speculated publicly about 
the reasons kitty dukakis became depressed and drank rubbing 
alcohol may face censure or have their licenses revoked by a state 
board a newspaper reported today 
the board of registration of psychologists appointed by gov 
michael s dukakis says the psychologists may have violated 
ethical principles in commenting on mrs dukakis condition in the 
boston globe the newspaper said 
the nov 10 article suggested that the governors wife broke 
down in part because she was carrying all the emotional burdens of 
the dukakis marriage 
if a complaint is filed as a result of a preliminary inquiry 
which is under way the psychologists could be censured or lose 
their licenses the psychologists are esther shapiro caroline 
maltas barry dym and david kantor 
the inquiry raises questions about professional ethics as well 
as free speech said floyd abrams a lawyer specializing in first 
amendment cases 
he said the boards actions give the appearance the state is 
trying to quash speculation about the governors wife 
in a situation like this where the governor and his family 
are under intense public scrutiny its particularly important that 
state agencies not become involved in making any threats to those 
who have been a part of the process abrams said 
andrew dreyfus a spokesman for the executive office of consumer 
affairs which oversees the states independent licensing boards 
said the order initiating the inquiry did not come from the 
governor 
herbert j hoffman a board member said the inquiry was 
prompted by the globe article which appeared on the same day as a 
board meeting after a full and lengthy discussion there was a 
consensus to contact the psychologists about their comments he 
said 
he added it is the boards duty to make sure psychologists 
conduct themselves in a professionally responsible manner when 
commenting to the media 
in letters to the psychologists the board suggested they may 
have violated at least six of the boards ethical principles 
three of the four psychologists said they believed they were 
misquoted misrepresented or quoted out of context in the nov 10 
article but would not comment beyond that statement the globe 
said shapiro confirmed that she received a letter from the board 
but would not say whether she was quoted accurately 
thomas mulvoy managing editor of the globe said the newspaper 
stands by the article he also defended the practice of reporters 
asking experts about current events even though they are not 
directly involved 
we report by analogy all the time he said if a major 
political figure has heart bypass surgery certainly a 
reasonable approach is to go to doctors and ask how the procedure 
works

a former airline pilot was convicted today 
of murdering his wife and running the body through a wood chipper 
to get rid of the evidence 
a superior court jury deliberated more than three days before 
finding richard crafts guilty in the 1986 slaying the 51yearold 
newtown man could receive up to 60 years in prison at sentencing 
jan 8 
crafts was accused of killing his danishborn wife helle in 
their bedroom cutting up the body with a chainsaw and feeding 
parts through a rented wood chipping machine 
prosecutors were unable to establish the cause of death but said 
blood was spattered on the bedroom walls 
because mrs crafts body was never found the prosecution faced 
a burden of proof unprecedented in connecticut proving that a 
woman had been murdered when the defense argued that she may still 
be alive perhaps living in europe 
the evidence included less than an ounce of human remains such 
as a fingernail and hair that the prosecution claimed were mrs 
crafts 
witnesses included three newtownarea residents who said they 
saw a man using a wood chipper on a bridge above the housatonic 
river 
damaging testimony also came from crafts brotherinlaw david 
rodgers who said crafts told him police divers would not find his 
wifes remains in the river 
according to rodgers crafts said let them dive theres no 
body its gone 
the prosecution suggested crafts acted out of anger that his 
wife a 39yearold flight attendant and mother of three had asked 
for a divorce because her husband was seeing another woman 
crafts first trial in 1988 ended in a mistrial when a juror 
walked out of deliberations after refusing to join in a guilty 
verdict

members of the newly formed civic forum opposition movement as well 
as representatives of the communist party youth movement the ctk 
state new agency reported

situation in the statecontrolled mass media is intolerable 
and that he was in favor of a different concept of the leading 
role of the party 
they also quoted him as saying he favored having in the 
federal government people with no membership in a political party 
and members of other political parties and especially young 
people 
a government spokesman marcel jansen denied earlier reports 
that the group included vaclav havel a playwright and 
czechoslovakias bestknown dissident there were no immediate 
details on the talks 
civic forum formed sunday is comprised of a dozen opposition 
groups it has demanded the resignation of officials who carried 
out purges following the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia in 
1968 and those who ordered security forces to use violence to crush 
fridays demonstrations 
a communistallied czechoslovak newspaper lidova demokrace 
published an opposition call for the ouster of top communists a 
demand of the estimated 200000 people who marched through prague 
on monday with chants of freedom 
on monday the countrys major state media also broke with past 
practice by providing extensive coverage of the march in the 
capital communist czechoslovakias largest antigovernment 
demonstration ever 
the coverage indicated the party leadership was increasingly 
shifting to the east german approach of tolerating massive public 
protests 
ctk announced that the general prosecutor of the czech republic 
had opened an investigation into the actions of security forces 
friday scores of demonstrators were beaten by riot police to break 
up an antigovernment rally

vigil in downtown wenceslas square where mondays demonstration 
began 
the prodemocracy tide now sweeping over one of the east blocs

heeded student calls to join the strike

governmentsponsored reform movement was crushed by a sovietled 
invasin 21 years ago soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is now 
encouraging east bloc allies to embrace popular demand for reforms 
student strike committee leaders said demonstrations would 
continue daily at least through this week

cancellation of a scheduled visit that was to have begun today by 
new east german leader egon krenz who is under mounting popular 
pressure to resign 
the newspaper of the communistallied christian democratic 
party lidova demokrace published a statement today from the civic 
forum opposition group that called for the resignation of jakes and 
other top party officials

communistdominated coalition are starting to distance themselves 
from their ruling allies 
in washington the state department canceled a planned visit by 
jan fojtik chief ideologist of the czechoslovak communist party 
because of the use of force against protesters

a friend of larry mahoney the driver 
blamed for the nations deadliest alcoholrelated accident 
testified today he took away mahoneys keys because he had been 
drinking too much the night of the crash 
taylor fox said he saw mahoney twice that night and that they 
had discussed driving to burlington a cincinnati suburb 
i thought hes been drinking and he doesnt have no business 
being on the road fox said i planned to take him to 
burlington anyway so i just took the keys 
mahoney 36 is charged with 27 counts of murder in the crash 
the night of may 14 1988 his pickup truck was traveling the wrong 
way on an interstate near carrollton when it slammed into a bus 
which exploded in flames 
mahoneys lawyers have contended that fox never took mahoneys 
keys they have said that socalled friends of mahoney gave him 
beer and liquor that night although he was known to have a low 
tolerance for alcohol 
fox conceded under crossexamination that mahoney was not 
staggering or slurring his words and did not otherwise appear to be 
intoxicated fox also had trouble recalling exactly when he took 
mahoneys keys 
the first prosecution witnesses testified monday that mahoney 
was drinking the afternoon and evening of the crash the nations 
seconddeadliest school bus crash and the worst involving alleged 
drunken driving 
two bartenders a liquor store clerk and two of mahoneys 
friends testified that he drank at least five beers but all said 
he didnt appear drunk 
mahoneys lawyers maintained in opening arguments monday that he 
wasnt solely responsible for the deaths of the 24 youngsters and 
three adults they argued that unsafe design made the 1977 former 
school bus a death trap 
it was a horrible tragedy a senseless tragedy one that 
didnt need to happen said defense attorney russell baldani 
the truth will lead you to a very simple conclusion larry 
mahoney is not a murderer 
the bus was taking 67 people home from an amusement park near 
cincinnati most were members of a youth group at the first 
assembly of god church in radcliff 
plain and simple this is a murder case special prosecutor 
paul richwalsky told the jury its about who was involved and 
who was responsible its about the terrible cost of drunken 
driving 
jurors monday were taken to the crash scene and to the warehouse 
where the wreckage of the bus and mahoneys toyota pickup are being 
held as evidence 
the courtroom was packed with relatives of the dead many of 
whom were from military families some were outraged at the defense 
contention that mahoney doesnt bear responsibility for the deaths 
and they equated drinking and driving with premeditated murder 
one was army 1st sgt lee williams whose wife and two daughters 
were killed 
whats the difference if you murder somebody with an ak47 a 
bomb or a steering wheel williams asked its obvious that he 
drove the vehicle that he hit the bus and theres 27 cemetery 
plots out there with 27 people in them 
mickie muller whose 13yearold daughter katrina survived 
with burns agreed this was not an accident this was a man who 
chose to drink who chose to get in a car 
defense attorneys said mahoney will accept responsibility for 
the crash but not the deaths 
they have contended that the bus which was sold as school 
surplus was a latent bomb because of a vulnerable fuel tank they 
said the bus also lacked enough exits and that its 12inchwide 
aisle was too narrow for emergency escapes 
the deaths were caused by smoke inhalation authorities said 
the prosecutor said he would prove mahoney exhibited extreme 
indifference to the value of a human life when driving north on 
i71 he crossed the median and entered the southbound lanes 
mahoney continued on for 23 miles ignoring motorists attempts 
to signal him until plowing into the bus richwalsky said 
in addition to the murder counts mahoney is charged with 42 
counts of wanton endangerment 12 counts of assault and one count 
of drunken driving

hansdietrich genscher the west german 
foreign minister today brought president bush a piece of the 
berlin wall as well as the thanks of the german people for helping 
to bring the barrier down 
i will treasure this bush told genscher as they posed for 
photographers at the outset of an oval office meeting 
genscher replied it is an expression of the strength of 
freedom and democracy all over germany that our germans were in 
a position by peaceful means to open the wall 
he said the german democratic republic east germanys formal 
name is on the way really to become a democratic republic 
although he added that this depends on free elections in the 
communist state in the year ahead 
genscher expressed our great gratitude for the support the 
help and the firmness of the american nations in the past decades 
its the result of a very clear policy of the west advocating 
freedom and democracy all over the europe he said as bush 
admired the nearly footlong gray brick that the minister had given 
him 
we will do nothing to undermine this process or even to weaken 
this process of reform throughout eastern europe said genscher 
we do not look for advantage when they have to face 
difficulty 
genscher asked about modernizing nuclear forces in west 
germany said i think this is a time to be discussed in 92 as 
was agreed in the nato communique 
genscher had been pressing for talks to reduce shortrange 
nuclear arms last spring before the north atlantic treaty 
organization rallied behind bushs arms proposals 
the west germany official told reporters after the meeting that 
he was impressed with the complete agreement he shared with 
bush and his advisers on how to approach eastern europe at this 
really historic moment of developing democracies 
genscher said it was important that the soviet union and east 
european countries understand that the western allies will do all 
we can to guarantee this stability and will do nothing from the 
outside to disturb the move to freer societies 
the meeting with the west german minister came as bush prepares 
for next weeks shipboard summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev off malta 
the president will meet with another ally british prime 
minister margaret thatcher at camp david md on friday 
bush won loud applause from audiences in rhode island on monday 
when he promised to keep my eyes wide open and approach the 
talks with caution 
i sometimes get needled a little about being cautious and 
prudent but somehow i think thats what a president of the united 
states ought to do when you go to meet a soviet leader bush 
said 
speaking today to the national association of state universities 
and landgrant colleges bush urged college presidents to take a 
stand and tell their students that society will not tolerate 
the use of drugs 
he appealed for help in drafting new national goals for 
education and also urged the administrators to take to heart an 
admonition from princeton university president harold shapiro that 
colleges must be much more selective about what we do to keep 
the costs of higher education within reasonable bounds 
bush spent monday in chicago and providence to boost the 
fortunes of two prochoice republican congresswomen reps lynn 
martin and claudine schneider who have their eyes on senate races 
next year 
but immediately after singing schneiders praises in providence 
he got aboard air force one and for a second time vetoed a district 
of columbia appropriations bill because of abortion funding 
provisions he found unacceptable 
schneider who has not yet declared her candidacy for the seat 
now occupied by democratic sen claiborne pell was a guest on the 
presidential aircraft and she told reporters im disappointed 
schneider martin and two other prochoice gop congresswomen met 
with bush last tuesday to in schneiders words ask him to make 
clear there was room within the gop for abortion rights supporters 
schneider said they asked him to find a way where he could 
still maintain the integrity of his own position on abortion 
without becoming involved in the minutiae of legislation making 
determinations of who does what with the money when 
clearly he has sent that message by coming up to rhode island 
on my behalf today she said 
but his second dc appropriations veto his fourth 
abortionrelated veto in recent weeks indicated that bush is 
adamantly opposed to any public funding for abortion except to 
save the life of the mother 
the district bill would have used federal medicaid funds for 
abortions only in those circumstances but would have allowed the 
district to pay for abortions on demand for poor women with local 
taxpayers dollars 
but under the districts home rule law even its locally 
generated tax dollars are subject to approval by congress and the 
president and bush said he wanted no part of funding abortions 
with no restriction whatsoever 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said house speaker thomas 
foley had requested quick presidential action so congress could 
have time to act on it before the thanksgiving recess 
fitzwater announced earlier that bush will stay over in europe 
an extra day after the dec 23 meeting with gorbachev to brief the 
nato allies in brussels 
at a fundraising reception for rhode island gov edward diprete 
in a tent outside his cranston ri mansion bush predicted 
its going to be a historic meeting but quickly added i 
dont want to see overpromises coming from it 
but he said we are living in times where the potential for 
peace and reduced tensions has never been better

the new communist party chief criticized his 
predecessor zhao ziyang for siding with rioters during the 
prodemocracy protests and said international hostile forces 
will continue to try to thwart socialism 
in remarks released tuesday jiang zemin also praised senior 
leader deng xiaoping who recently retired from his last party 
post and indicated deng still plays a pivotal role in government 
he also called for cooperation to strengthen the national 
economy and criticized corruption and a lack of discipline in the 
party 
jiang made his comments in a wideranging speech to the 
communist partys central committee nov 9 the speech was carried 
by the official xinhua news agency and read on television neither 
gave a reason for the delay in reporting the speech 
the struggle between international hostile forces and 
socialist countries will exist for a long time on the levels of 
infiltration and counterinfiltration subversion and 
countersubversion jiang said 
he was referring to the chinese armys bloody suppression in 
june of the prodemocracy movement which the government calls 
counterrevolutionary turmoil and says was supported from 
overseas 
because of a rampant ideological trend favoring bourgeois 
liberalization western ideals for a period in the recent past 
there was confusion about many theoretical issues jiang said 
some cadres including some leading officials were affected 
by this to different degrees and some even sided with the 
rioters he said 
he was clearly alluding to ousted party chief zhao who was 
dropped from all his party posts in june for supporting the 
studentled demonstrators and is believed to be under house arrest 
zhaos removal led to jiangs meteoric rise from shanghai party 
boss to head the party at the last central committee plenum in june 
earlier this month he was named to head the powerful central 
military commission as dengs handpicked successor deng 85 
retired as head of the commission his last party post 
jiang 62 urged patience in awaiting results from the ambitious 
marketoriented reforms started by deng a decade ago 
while dengs reforms have raised the standard of living for 
millions of chinese increased production and made more goods 
many of them imported available to consumers a common complaint 
is that the reforms have not been benefited more people 
but jiang gave high praise to deng who despite his retirement 
remains the most powerful man in china 
while the central committee initially opposed dengs desire to 
step downa consensus of views is reached that comrade xiaoping 
is farsighted so we should respect his wishes and grant his 
request jiang said 
the health and longevity of comrade xiaoping are of great 
significance to the smooth development of the work of the party and 
the state 
jiang mentioned democracy but not in the context of political 
reforms party members and leaders he saidmust adhere to the 
principle of democracy develop a democratic style of work give 
heed to opinions from all walks of life including different and 
even dissenting opinions 
he also displayed an almost disarming modesty saying he was not 
prepared to take the helm of the 47 millionmember party in june 
he lashed out at the bribery embezzlement and other corruption 
that has become widespread sayingwe must rely on the masses to 
strengthen our efforts to construct clean politics and fight 
against corruption and unhealthy tendencies in society and our 
party 
he also said party discipline had become lax 
encouragingselfish departmentalism and overstress on local 
interest 
party organizations in rural areas he saidare in a state of 
weakness and slackness paralyzed or semiparalyzed

removed today from that powerful position a party official said 
zaikov had been promoted 
zaikov 66 was relieved of his responsibilities as communist 
party first secretary for moscow by a plenary meeting of the 
moscow party committee said a duty officer at moscow party 
headquarters 
zaikovs removal is connected to his transfer to a higher 
position said the duty officer who gave his name only as ivanov 
zaikov who is also a member of the ruling politburo was named

a publisher says it has agreed to correct 
a textbook that depicts the coyote as no threat to sheep 
holt rinehart and winston inc at the behest of the state 
textbook commission will provide an amended page for utah users of 
the book 
the high school english text in an exercise on identifying 
nouns says the most widespread misperception about coyotes is 
that they prey on cattle and sheep and that no scientist has 
documented a case of coyotes killing cattle or sheep 
clair r acord executive secretary of the utah woolgrowers 
said 1988 figures from state and federal officials show that 24300 
sheep valued at 21 million were reported killed by coyotes in 
utah which has roughly 500000 sheep 
rural pupils likely wouldnt be taken in by the textbook but 
an urban child could get the idea that the coyote is a prince 
which he isnt acord said 
pat mccambridge a senior editor for holt rinehart in austin 
texas said we had no reason to believe our source was wrong and 
had no idea that this was controversial 
she said the amended page will say coyotes are known to kill 
domestic animals and can have a devastating effect on sheep herds

the house today voted for the third time to 
repeal catastrophic medical coverage for retirees setting the 
scene for the senate to offer one last proposal to salvage some of 
the benefits 
the house vote was 35263 senators were preparing to send the 
house a compromise offer to kill the unpopular surtax that finances 
catastrophic benefits under the medicare system and preserve some 
parts of the program 
at this late date and hour the only prudent action this house 
can take is force the senate into voting for repeal rep clay 
shaw rfla said as congress looked for a solution to one of the 
two major obstacles to adjournment for the year 
we are throwing out the baby with the bath water said rep 
benjamin gilman rny 
the program was enacted a year ago to prevent a major illness 
from plunging retirees into bankruptcy many of those retirees are 
objecting to having to pay for the program because they have 
private insurance coverage some higherincome retirees dont like 
having to pay an income surtax of up to 800 a year to finance the 
benefits 
congressional leaders say the house and senate will not adjourn 
for the year without repealing the surtax

president bushs senior advisers will 
recommend he sign a 146 billion foreign aid bill following an 
apparent truce on a provision that the white house believed would 
reduce its flexibility in carrying out foreign policy an 
administration official said today 
the provision bars the use of us aid money to entice foreign 
governments to carry out policies banned by american law it grew 
out of the irancontra affair in which aid to honduras was 
expedited in return for honduras agreement to shelter the 
nicaraguan contras at a time when congress had banned us military 
assistance to the rebels 
rep david obey dwis in a statement on the house floor said 
today that the provision refers only to clear written or oral 
agreements with other governments and is not an attempt to 
hamstring government officials in the course of their normal 
duties 
the administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said bush now was being advised to approve the measure 
in another area of controversy within the bill congress 
rejected attempts to restrict us military aid to el salvador but 
there were signs that a week of heightened violence has left 
lawmakers wary of continuing what one called a blankcheck 
policy 
after 10 years of bankrolling failure it is time we changed 
our policy said sen mark hatfield rore have we no right to 
ask why after almost 4 billion spent after 70000 lives lost why 
our policy has not produced different results 
both the house and the senate on monday voted down efforts to 
curb the 85 million in us military aid due to flow to the 
government of president alfredo cristiani in the coming year 
heeding a call by president bush not to further weaken that 
countrys new administration 
after a debate that rekindled old animosities over el salvador 
the house voted 215 to 194 to effectively keep the restrictions 
from being added to the foreign aid bill which contains money for 
us allies around the globe and the first cash in a new aid 
program for poland and hungary 
it sent the bill to the senate which rejected a similar 
amendment by a 5839 margin and forwarded the measure to bush for 
his signature 
bush earlier in the day had termed any attempt to cut off aid to 
the cristiani government absolutely unacceptable and added 
this is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that is 
under attack its totally unacceptable and the day of these 
marxist attacks should end right now 
but the past weeks violence in el salvador appeared to have 
created a shift of roughly 20 votes in the senate since the body 
voted 8218 sept 20 for military aid with no conditions 
and the house followed its rejection of strings on the military 
aid with nearly unanimous approval of a resolution warning that 
future aid would hinge on whether cristiani tracks down and puts on 
trial those responsible for the murder last week of six jesuit 
priests and two apparent witnesses to the killings the vote was 
4093 
rep david bonior dmich said lawmakers were coming under 
heavy pressure from christian groups to take action against el 
salvador including heavy lobbying and demonstrations at some 
members district offices 
in washington the national conference of catholic bishops 
expressed support for proposals to withhold substantial portions 
of military aid while the performance of the salvadoran government 
and military is tested 
and opponents of us aid heckled bush during an appearance in 
chicago while others in washington repeatedly interrupted senate 
floor proceedings and were forcibly ejected from the chamber by 
capitol police 
in el salvador a pitched weeklong battle that has cost more 
than 1000 lives was winding down as the leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front withdrew from the capital 
of san salvador into the countryside 
in the house rep david obey dwis had proposed to add 
language that would have held back 30 percent of this fiscal years 
military money until after april 1 of next year to keep pressure on 
the salvadoran government to solve the jesuit murders 
a similar proposal in the senate pushed by sen patrick leahy 
dvt would have withheld 30 percent of the military aid until the 
killers of the priests were apprehended and brought to trial 
but sen bob dole rkan called it a terrible amendment 
and added if we pass it we reward the communist terrorists 
and punish the democratically elected government 
to rush into this breech with this kind of amendment is 
suicide gentlemen for that country argued rep gerald solomon 
rny this amendment is a selective response to a great 
tragedy 
this is not a debate over who are the good guys and who are 
the bad guys countered rep joe moakley dmass this is a 
debate over whether the united states has an obligation to assure 
that taxpayer dollars are going to a government that protects human 
rights 
bush said he had personally told cristiani how strongly we 
feel about the killings 
and i told him that they must get to the bottom of it i am 
convinced they will the people who did this whether they come 
from the extreme left or the extreme right pay the penalty bush 
said 
major aid items included in the bill were 3 billion for israel 
21 billion for egypt 500 million for turkey 300 million for 
greece 440 million for the four central american democracies 
533 million for poland and hungary 125 million for the drug war 
in bolivia peru and colombia and 160 million for a new 
international development initiative for the philippines

the government on tuesday announced plans to 
more carefully review cases in which severely disabled children 
have been denied supplemental security income benefits 
the new procedures were announced by health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan after a study by the social security 
adminstration found that some eligible children had been improperly 
denied ssi benefits 
the ssi program provides a minimum income floor to 45 mil i want 
to be personally assured that all needy children 
entitled to disability benefits receive them and the critical 
medical coverage that often accompanies receipt of ssi through 
eligibility to the medicaid program sullivan said 
social security commissioner gwendolyn king said the new steps 
were taken after a review of 927 cases in which children were 
denied disability benefits found that 59 youngsters had been 
improperly turned down 
mrs king said the overall error rate was not statistically 
significant but that certain categories of youngsters were 
particularly prone to error such as those under age 3 and those 
suffering from congenital cardiovascular digestive or mental 
disabilities 
sullivan directed social security officials to do the following 
review all cases of disabled children from birth through age 3 
twice before a claim is denied and conduct double reviews for 
older children in certain categories prone to error 
hire more pediatricians to help judge and review childhood 
claims since they are expert in the growth and development of 
children 
review and revise the medical criteria used to determine which 
chidren are eligible for ssi benefits 
intensify training and education of all disability examiners 
and medical personnel to improve their understanding of childhood 
disabilities

a staterun newspaper today sharply 
criticized communist party chief egon krenz saying he has not won 
popular trust 
premier hans modrow meanwhile it is about to impose unpopular 
measures aimed at curbing blackmarket currency trading that has 
flourished since the lifting of travel restrictions on nov 9 
modrows statement as reported by the official news agency adn 
left unclear whether the leadership will try to cut down on the 
number of east germans who can travel to the west more than 6 
million visitors have already reached west germany and west berlin 
in west germany the masscirculation bild newspaper said krenz 
could be ousted as the nations top leader within four weeks krenz 
himself acknowledged in a television interview sunday he could lose 
his power during a party congress scheduled for dec 1517 
on monday chancellor helmut kohls visiting chief of staff 
rudolf seiters predicted east germany will hold free elections as 
soon as next fall he also said he expects the communists 
constitutional guarantee of government control to be eliminated 
next year 
also today the european community said an envoy would visit 
east berlin dec 4 and 5 to discuss east germanys request for a 
broad trade and economic cooperation accord 
there has been intense speculation about krenzs future over the 
past week major changes are expected soon in east germanys 
leadership which includes both reformers as well as holdovers from 
the era of hardliner erich honecker 
the staterun nationalzeitung daily newspaper reminded its 
readers that krenz belonged to the leadership body that is now in 
the crossfire of criticism 
in its commentary today the newspaper also emphasized krenzs 
praise for the chinese leadership after it crushed the student 
prodemocracy movement in june and brought up krenzs alleged role 
in massive election fraud in may 
egon krenz cannot make up lost ground the commentary said 
east germanys staterun press which used to reflect the party 
leaderships line without fail has been reporting a greater 
variety of views in recent weeks 
in hamburg the conservative bild newspaper said in a frontpage 
headline experts agree krenz has only four weeks 
bild did not name the experts the newspaper is published by the 
giant springer group which long has been critical of east 
germanys leadership 
the official adn news agency said more than 400000 took to the 
streets of leipzig dresden halle and karlmarxstadt in what has 
become a monday night ritual of challenge to communist rule 
street protests that began last month and a mass emigration of 
young skilled workers have prompted a shakeup in countrys 
leadership exacting from it promises of fundamental reform and the 
opening of the countrys borders to free travel on nov 9 
in leipzig demonstrators denounced government errors that have 
ruined the economy 
most of east germanys organized opposition groups are believed 
to oppose german reunification but there were calls for german 
unity among some at the leipzig rally 
we must not suppress the will for unity we are one people 
one unidentified speaker said 
seiters met with krenz and modrow for talks to work out a visit 
by kohl next month 
no date has been set for the visit but it is expected before 
christmas and after the east german communist party congress on 
dec 1517 
during the talks monday krenz indicated the communist party is 
striving for free general elections but that their date depended 
on how quickly the parliament would pass the new election law 
seiters told reporters 
the west german official kohls troubleshooter for east 
germany talked for three hours with krenz and modrow in the 
presence of aides and then had a 45minute private chat with the 
top communists

work 
the latest round of outrage focused on last weeks slaying of 
six jesuit priests their houskeeper and her daughter in el 
salvador 
the demonstrators blamed the killings on rightwing elements in 
the central american countrys military the slayings occurred amid 
heavy fighting as the government drove leftist rebels from the 
capital san salvador 
it has become very clear over this decade that united states 
aid is that which is destroying the people of el salvador

bringing the priests killers to justice would be instrumental in

former president reagans attorneys indicated 
wednesday they were considering a challenge to a subpoena for 
reagan to produce documents and testify at the irancontra trial of 
his former national security adviser john m poindexter 
in court papers asking for a twoweek delay reagans private 
attorneys said the subpoena raises novel and complex 
constitutional issues about the power of courts over a former 
chief executive 
the subpoena raises weighty and yet unsettled constitutional 
issues regarding the doctrine of separation of powers and the 
executive privilege reagans lawyers said 
the former president was directed by the subpoena to turn over 
documents needed for poindexters trial by wednesday 
the justice department also sought a delay until dec 6 for 
responding to a subpoena for reagan papers that are held by the 
national archives and records administration 
the subpoenas were served last week after they were approved by 
the judge in the poindexter case 
reagans former national security adviser is scheduled to go on 
trial jan 22 in federal court here on charges of making false 
statements to congress and obstructing congressional inquiries into 
the irancontra affair 
defense lawyers have suggested that reagan knew about letters 
that poindexter sent to congress in response to queries about 
whether the administration was secretly aiding the nicaraguan 
rebels at a time when such assistance was banned by law poindexter 
is accused of falsely assuring congress there was no such 
assistance 
reagans pleading filed by a team of lawyers headed by theodore 
b olson suggested that the former president may invoke the 
doctrine of executive privilege to resist turning over certain 
documents or answering certain questions 
executive privilege was invoked by thenpresident nixon during 
the watergate scandal when he tried to withhold tapes of 
conversations he had with aides in the oval office 
in a 1974 decision that ultimately led to nixons resignation 
the supreme court ordered him to turn over the tapes 
the highcourts 80 ruling however appeared to leave room for 
possible assertions of executive privilege to protect diplomatic 
military or state secrets 
reagans lawyers note that poindexters request for documents 
covers 67 separate subjects and the list itself is highly 
classified 
the attorneys also raised the possibility that president bush 
may seek to invoke executive privilege to block release of some of 
the documents 
in its pleading the justice department said that it had an 
obvious and strong interest in the subpoena served on reagan 
because of the sensitive nature and subject of the subpoena 
directed to him and the potential relationship of the materials 
sought to the national interest and to the presidency 
the justice department said that some of the documents sought 
from the government and from reagan may be covered by the 
classified information procedures act which regulates the 
disclosure of government secrets in court

a 14month battle between rudolf nureyev and the 
president of the paris opera ballet ended tuesday when the 
sovietborn dancer resigned as dance director of the company he 
helped bring to prominence 
a statement issued after a meeting between nureyev and president 
pierre berge said the two decided mutually that nureyev should 
step down as dance director 
the break however sounded more like a separation than divorce 
the statement said nureyev would stay on as premier 
choreographer a post created for him to insure the presence of 
his productions at the paris opera 
nureyev 51 had been artistic director since 1983 
the paris opera became almost a soap opera in recent weeks with 
tensions mounting as nureyev and berge exchanged charges in the 
press 
nureyevs contract as dance director expired aug 31 
interviewed last month by the newspaper le figaro he complained he 
had not heard from berge whom he later described as harder to 
reach than god 
berge retorted that it was difficult to communicate with someone 
who is so rarely in paris 
nureyev has been frequently absent he is touring the united 
states with the king and i and is scheduled to play the lead 
role immortalized by yul brenner for another two years 
berge called for the dancers contract to include a sixmonth 
residence clause with the ballet company which nureyev was 
certain to refuse insiders said berge hoped to boost the morale of 
the ballet company which has not appreciated nureyevs parttime 
longdistance directing 
nureyev has been replaced temporarily by ballet masters patrice 
bart and eugene polyakov whom nureyev trained and brought into the 
company 
controversy is nothing new to berge who has never been one to 
back down from a public showdown 
last year he fired daniel barenboim as director of the new 
operabastille opera house over his high fees and alleged elitist 
views on opera 
nureyev is not expected to disappear like barenboim his 
sleeping beauty is on the program dec 1631 and his swan 
lake can be seen from april 21may 13 1990 and as premier 
choreographer he is expected to revive la bayadere in time 
for next summer 
dance afficcionados say thats only fitting for the man who 
defected to the west from a paris airport with the apparent 
approval of thenculture minister andre malraux

higher gasoline and food costs pushed consumer 
prices up 05 percent last month giving the country its biggest 
spurt of inflation since last may the government reported tuesday 
the increase in the labor departments consumer price index 
which translated into an annual inflation rate of 59 percent 
followed four months in which the index recorded tiny gains of 02 
percent or less 
octobers inflation spurt was blamed on a statistical jump in 
gasoline costs hefty increases in dairy products and fruit and 
rising costs for new cars and clothing 
economists for the most part discounted the increase saying it 
did not shake their belief that price pressures will remain 
moderate in coming months 
this is the first month in five that inflation has been in the 
problem range and most likely it will not persist said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co 
inflation raced upward in the first five months of the year 
only to moderate through the summer as energy prices retreated 
through the first 10 months of the year consumer prices have 
been rising at an annual rate of 46 percent up only slightly from 
the 44 percent price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill predicted that 
the increase in consumer prices for the entire year will hold at 
46 percent and will improve to 42 percent next year 
the october increase was just a makeup for some unusually 
good numbers in the last few months he said with the slowdown 
in the economy we think we will get another year of stability in 
prices 
the bush administration was also sanguine about octobers price 
increase with presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater noting that 
in the past six months the cpi has risen at an annual rate of just 
33 percent 
this is lower than for any sixmonth period since december 
1986 and lower than the average inflation of 36 percent over the 
last seven years so inflation holds relatively steady but at a low 
level fitzwater said 
gasoline costs climbed a seasonally adjusted 09 percent in 
october the biggest jump since last may gasoline prices have been 
on a rollercoaster ride this year soaring by 212 percent in the 
first five months and then falling by 93 percent from june through 
september 
pump prices actually were unchanged in october but they 
normally fall at the end of the summer driving season thus the 
frozen price level translated into an increase after the labor 
department made adjustments to take into account normal seasonal 
pricing variations 
food costs were up 04 percent the biggest advance since a 06 
percent may increase dairy products posted a huge gain for the 
second straight month rising by 18 percent the biggest increase 
in more than nine years fruit and vegetable prices jumped 12 
percent led by big gains in the cost of apples and bananas 
consumer prices minus food and energy costs the inflation 
measure considered to be a good guage of underlying price 
pressures rose 05 percent in october matching the increase in 
the overall index 
new car prices reflecting the introduction of 1990 models and 
higher financing costs rose 06 percent after having fallen for 
five consecurtive months used car prices however continued to 
decline edging down 01 percent 
clothing costs which took a big 17 percent rise in september 
rose another 1 percent in october reflecting higher costs for the 
fall and winter lines 
home heating oil costs were up a sharp 25 percent while natural 
gas and electricity prices rose a more modest 03 percent 
medical costs which rose 07 percent in october are 81 
percent higher than a year ago the biggest increase of any of the 
major price categories 
the federal reserve which began the year fighting inflation by 
pushing interest rates higher has been lowering rates in recent 
months because of concerns over widespread economic weakness 
many analysts predicted that the october blip in consumer prices 
would not deter the fed from making further credit easing moves in 
the months ahead 
the fed doesnt like to see the inflation rates this high but 
the economy is very weak right now and that is their overriding 
concern said bruce steinberg senior economist at merrill lynch 
before taking into account normal seasonal variations the 
consumer price index stood at 1256 in october meaning that a 
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 
198284 base period would have cost 12560 last month up from 
12020 a year ago 
in a separate report tuesday the labor department said that 
americans average weekly earnings rose to 34307 in october 4 
percent higher than a year ago but not enough to keep up with 
inflation during this time period

the world bank on tuesday offered a longterm 
program aimed at reversing the decline of schools incomes and 
farming in large parts of africa during the 1980s 
the program proposes policy changes to allow african governments 
to reach a goal of 5 percent growth in annual income more emphasis 
on helping africans take responsibility for improving their lives 
better administration checking the population growth and 
protecting its enviornment and more foreign aid 
the world bank which lends about 4 billion a year to black 
africa is the largest single source of aid to third world 
countries its proposal was outlined in a 314page report 
subsaharan africa from crisis to sustainable growth 
this report examines what has gone wrong and why world 
bank president barber conable said at a news conference more 
importantly it lays out a strategic agenda for the 1990s 
the report deals with the entire african continent except the 
northern tier of egypt libya tunisia algeria and morocco 
namibia and the republic of south africa in the far south 
conable said he wanted changes in some nations military 
spending but declined to cite specific countries 
military spending has diverted enormous resources from 
southern africas development and has consumed nearly 50 percent 
of government expenditures in the countries experiencing the worst 
destabilization the report said 
conable said that for the first time defense costs will be 
formally taken into account in discussions between the bank and 
african countries its also expected to be an element in 
negotiations of the banks sister organization the international 
monetary fund 
the report predicted that black africas population would grow 
by 31 percent a year until the end of the century the same rate 
as in the 1980s and six times as fast as the average in highincome 
countries 
because total production in few african countries has been 
growing at that speed there would have to be considerable 
improvement to keep average incomes from declining further 
the report emphasized the need to increase african food 
production to keep up with population african farms increased 
their output by only 13 percent from 1980 to 1987 less than half 
the rise in population 
african imports of grain nearly doubled between 1974 and 1986 
while shipments sent as aid by the united states and other 
countries more than tripled over the same period 
the report called for continued relief from debts owed by 
african countries mainly to western governments so that payments 
in the 1990s are kept to the same level as in the 1980s about 9 
billion a year 
if this does not occur higher levels of external assistance 
will be necessary it warned 
figures used by the world bank showed total aid rising from 11 
billion in 1987 to 13 billion in 1988 aid from the united states 
has been declining from 135 billion in 1986 to 738 million in 
1988

armed rebels today stormed a 
luxury hotel in northern san salvador and held dozens of foreigners 
inside four us military advisers were reported captured 
soldiers in an armored personnel carrier rescued the secretary 
general of the organization of american states who had been inside 
a different part of the building when the leftist guerrillas 
attacked 
six government helicopters flew over the homes and tennis club 
around the sheraton hotel in the wealthy neighborhood of escalon 
hundreds of soldiers moved into the area frequently pinned down by 
guerrilla fire 
the army moved several tanks into the neighborhood to combat the 
attackers who were renewing an urban offensive that had appeared 
to be dying out 
four us military advisers and two other advisers one from 
colombia and one from guatemala were captured near the hotel said 
antonio hernandez a spokesman for the rebels farabundo marti 
national liberation front in mexico city 
they are considered prisoners but we will respect their lives 
and they will not be harmed hernandez said 
cable news network quoting an army spokesman col carlos 
amando aviles said four americans were being held at the hotel 
aviles did not say whether the americans were in the military 
us embassy spokesman jeff brown said he was unable to confirm 
the report 
i havent heard that he said by telephone i dont think 
its true but i cant be sure 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
bush administration was making plans as necessary to protect 
the lives of americans in the hotel 
twentynine people mostly foreigners were held by the 
guerrillas 
the fmln asked the government to agree to allow a red cross team 
to come to the hotel and evacuate guests aside from the military 
advisers hernandez said 
the rebels held a part of the hotel known as the vip tower 
hotel executives and others including oas chief joao baena soares 
holed up in an administrative office in the main building 
baena soares on a peace mission to el salvador told the hotel 
manager that he wanted to be evacuated with the other guests 
later soldiers in an armored personnel carrier drove up to the 
front of the main building and evacuated him it was not 
immediately clear whether others were taken with him 
brown said the embassy maintained an open line to some of the 
americans in the hotel but said he did not know how many were 
there fiftyfive us military advisers are in el salvador 
the objective is to take escalon said a guerrilla who gave 
his name as marlon he was in charge of an insurgent position 
80 yards from the fourstar hotel 
were taking escalon because here the armed forces are not 
going to bombard peoples homes this is where the oligarchy 
lives marlon said 
he said his rebel unit had been in mejicanos one of several 
poor suburbs and neighborhoods where the guerrillas dug in during 
their massive offensive last week 
the fighting ended several days of relative calm in san 
salvador one target of a rebel offensive launched nov 11 
the new attack comes one day after president bush reaffirmed his 
administrations strong support for the rightwing government of 
president alfredo cristiani the united states has provided about 
35 billion in the past 10 years to help the government fight the 
insurgency 
a guerrilla official in mexico city said monday the offensive 
would continue because the fighting had not yet convinced the 
government that it cannot win the war salvador samayoa said the 
offensive would keep on with other surprises bigger than that of 
nov 11 until the government is convinced it must make 
concessions and begin to negotiate 
at least 1000 people have been killed and hundreds if not 
thousands rendered homeless in the latest offensive 
a british journalist paul iredale was wounded today in the 
lower back and taken to the hospital rosales iredale a reuters 
reporter based in mexico city was later reported in fair condition 
the fighting followed several explosions and exchanges of rifle 
fire in the western sector of the capital at 430 am 
the blasts appeared to come from the direction of merliot a 
suburb where combat flared monday or from the slopes of the san 
salvador volcano that looms over the capitals northwestern sector 
a little less than an hour later other explosions were heard 
echoing from the direction of the volcano and an airplane equipped 
with rockets and machineguns was heard making passes over the 
citys outskirts 
the later blasts appeared to be from heavy munitions perhaps 
120mm government mortars 
officials said the rebels had blown up seven of the countrys 16 
main power lines along with about 40 towers and other equipment 
the fighting then moved to the area surrounding the sheraton 
the hotels coffee shop was the site of the jan 3 1981 slayings 
of the president of the salvadoran institute of agrarian reform and 
us aflcio advisers michael p hammer 39 of potomac md and 
mark david pearlman 36 of seattle two national guardsmen were 
convicted of murder in the killings but released in 1988 under an 
amnesty given for political crimes 
us ambassador william walker was asked monday if the raids 
the massacre of six jesuit priests on thursday and other incidents 
indicated cristiani was having trouble maintaining control over the 
more extreme elements in his rightist government 
management control problems exist in situations like this 
said walker in washington congress also rejected attempts to 
restrict us military aid to cristiani heeding an admonition from 
bush not to further weaken a freely democratically elected 
government 
the decadelong war has claimed more than 71000 lives mostly 
civilians

social security commissioner gwendolyn king on 
tuesday announced a plan to calm the turbulence in her 
discontented workforce to ensure that agency employees provide 
quality service to the public 
in a speech to 14000 social security administration workers in 
the baltimore area transmitted by satellite to employees 
elsewhere mrs king said morale has suffered in recent years as a 
result of massive staff cuts at a time when the social security 
workload was increasing 
i dont believe we can guarantee the kind of public service we 
need to unless we first take steps to ensure that our workforce 
is energized and focused on our mission she told reporters in a 
preview of the speech 
to her employees she acknowledged i realize that many of you 
feel overworked that you dont believe your efforts are properly 
recognized and that many of you wouldnt recommend ssa employment 
to a friend 
in the weeks and months ahead i will have no higher priority 
than to heal these wounds she said i want to calm the 
turbulence and replace uncertainty with stability 
the agencys workforce has been slashed by 20 percent to 65000 
over the last six years as part of a campaign to modernize and 
streamline operations surveys showed increasing numbers of 
supervisors felt the agency was doing a poor job of providing top 
quality service to the public 
when you combine cutbacks in the size of the agency with 
increased public demand for service turmoil is likely to be the 
result mrs king told reporters i believe we have to get 
beyond that 
mrs king who assumed the top social security job in august 
proposed a new compact with her employees for her part she 
promised to resist further staff cuts adjust uneven staffing 
levels that create shortages in some offices communicate with 
employees in advance of major program changes provide more 
equipment such as computer terminals and relax unreasonably 
demanding job performance standards 
employees meanwhile were asked to avoid internal strife 
become proficient in new technologies such as computers take a 
greater role in agency decisions and resolve to treat each member 
of the public as a unique individual and not a case number or a 
file 
mrs king also said additional emphasis would be placed on 
outreach programs to needy people who may not be getting the 
benefits to which they are entitled and on efforts to ensure that 
only trustworthy people are appointed to handle the social security 
checks of those who cannot manage their own finances

crews worked under a tight schedule 
to ready the shuttle discovery for an afterdark launch wednesday 
with a nasa spokesman predicting the crew would have thanksgiving 
turkey in space 
workers made up for time lost on a parts replacement earlier and 
kennedy space center spokesman dick young said from a technical 
standpoint we look good and from a weather standpoint we look 
good 
the launch time is a secret and so is the nature of the military 
payload the crew of five is to put into orbit nasa has said only 
that liftoff is set between 630 pm and 1030 pm est 
there is only a 20 percent chance weather will interfere 
forecasters said if the launch has to be thursday the weather 
outlook worsens to 60 percent unfavorable 
the menu released for the mission includes thermostabilized 
turkey and gravy which means the food has enough preservatives to 
be carried without refrigeration 
we are hopeful the crew will have thanksgiving dinner in 
space young said 
checking systems and putting the two solid fuel booster rockets 
back together had put the schedule in jeopardy the rockets were 
opened last week to inspect computer boxes for faulty wiring and 
one box was replaced 
the flight commanded by air force col frederick c gregory is 
the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the defense 
department officials said keeping advance knowledge of the 
expected liftoff time secret makes tracking the shuttle more 
difficult for soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship 
sitting off cape canaveral 
announcement of an imminent launch will be made nine minutes 
before the event but there will be no public airtoground link 
during the mission 
the cargo is believed to be a satellite capable of monitoring 
diplomatic and military communications in the soviet union and 
other countries 
the launch will be only the third after nightfall in 32 shuttle 
missions and is like the others expected to provide a spectacular 
sight in this central florida area the last night launch in 
november 1985 was visible along the 700 miles from key west fla 
to charleston sc 
gregory and the pilot air force col john blaha practiced 
night landings on the shuttle runway here in a jet equipped to 
handle like a shuttle 
disovery is scheduled to land at night at edwards air force 
base calif after a flight expected to last four days gregory 
and blaha also would have to land the shuttle in the dark here or 
at emergency runways in spain or north africa in case of an abort 
after liftoff 
gregory who flew on a 1985 shuttle mission is the first black 
shuttle commander the other crew members are navy capt manley l 
carter jr f story musgrave and kathryn c thornton

gorillas looming over their city but they plan to use the law 
rather than squadrons of fighter planes to bring down the ersatz 
king kongs 
the council tentatively approved an ordinance monday that would 
prohibit enormous inflated gorillas or any other oversized 
inflatables for promotions or advertising it would reduce their 
size to about 3 feet not very threatening to fay wray 
we dont need a 20foot gorilla on the side of highway 9 
said council member jerry cutrer its an eyesore and its 
distracting to motorists and potentially dangerous

it depends on which one you get said jud f carswell who has 
used the inflatables at his car dealership if neighboring towns

with a bellow of order order the gowned and 
bewigged speaker brought house of commons lawmakers into line 
tuesday as tv cameras gave britons their first pictures of their 
elected legislators in action 
thirty years after first rejecting the notion the elected 
chamber of the mother of parliaments finally bowed to the 
electronic age as eight remotecontrol cameras recorded the cut and 
thrust of the government and the opposition seated two sword 
lengths and a foot apart 
at precisely 230 pm speaker bernard weatherill popped onto 
tv screens resplendent in shoulderlength horsehair wig and black 
gown and called the excited fidgeting lawmakers to order 
the first images were broadcast live by two of britains four 
national networks and the satellite station sky television 
the honor of giving the first televised speech from the green 
leather benches was given to conservative ian gow a former cabinet 
minister who opposes the cameras and says he doesnt know how to 
operate his own vcr 
but labor lawmaker bob cryer beat him to it with a procedural 
interjection during weatherills annual recitation of the sessional 
orders which remind lawmakers of parliamentary rules and instruct 
scotland yard to ensure their free access to the palce of 
westminster 
gow said prime minister margaret thatcher invited him to her 
downing street residence for a drink on the eve of the first 
televised session it seems we were both feeling rather nervous 
about our speeches he confessed in a radio interview 
in her first televised speech mrs thatcher promised more of 
her freemarket medicine in 1990 opposition labor leader neil 
kinnock attacked her policies as failures the debate broke no new 
ground but seeing it on tv gave it an unusual sense of drama 
mrs thatcher was combative at times shrill when the opposition 
got raucous kinnock looked more relaxed 
the unelected house of lords has permitted tv broadcasts of its 
proceedings since 1985 including the pageantry enveloping queen 
elizabeth iis ceremonial state opening of parliament on tuesday 
morning 
but the house of commons the oftenrowdy elected chamber down 
the hallway of the palace of westminster steadfastly resisted 
until february 1988 it then agreed to a ninemonth experiment 
radio broadcasting was approved in 1978 
a parliamentary committee drafted strict rules for the cameras 
although the opening broadcasts appeared to be interpreting them 
liberally 
to deter lawmakers from mounting cameragrabbing spectacles the 
broadcasters are supposed to show only the head and shoulders of 
whoever is speaking they are also barred from showing empty 
benches lest viewers get the notion their representatives are 
goofing off 
but several speakers including kinnock were shown from the 
waist up as they spoke the shots were wide enough to show the 
facial reactions of several colleagues 
screening rowdiness is also taboo at the first hint of a 
disturbance the cameras are to focus on weatherill who is elected 
by fellow lawmakers to preside over debates and quell the booing 
and braying that often interrupts debate 
weatherill who turns 69 saturday is the son of a savile row 
tailor who still carries a thimble in his pocket because his mother 
said it would keep him humble 
weatherill approves of the televising and said tuesday he hoped 
it will show the house of commons at work as it really is 
the cameras occasionally switched to wideangle shots showing 
the 650member commons packed to the aisles the bbc called it a 
historic day while independent television news spoke of the 
newest drama in londons west end 
for the uninterested two other channels offered angel in 
exile a lowbudget western the drama serial take the high 
road the game show tell the truth and coronation 
street the popular british soap opera 
the separation of benches by swords lengths dates from older 
times when it was feared heated debate might degenerate into 
fighting 
many lawmakers chose special attire for their tv debut 
conservative bill walker sported his scots kilt and a royal air 
force tie 
narrow striped shirts have disappeared in favor of blue and 
yellow and the ties have got distinctly brighter this morning 
said conservative lawmaker kenneth hind 
hair has been shortened and some of the men are carrying 
powder puffs in their pockets to beautify their sallow complexions 
for the cameras he said 
mrs thatcher wore her customary blue suit

lev n zaikov the hardliner who has served as 
the communist party boss of moscow for two years was replaced 
tuesday to become president mikhail s gorbachevs top deputy on 
the soviet defense council 
party officials called the move a promotion for zaikov who is 
also a member of the ruling soviet politburo 
he was succeeded as moscow party boss by yuri prokofiev 50 who 
as second party secretary in the soviet capital had been zaikovs 
deputy 
the official soviet news agency tass said zaikov 66 received 
the gratitude of the moscow party committee that voted in plenary 
session to replace him indicating he was leaving in official good 
graces 
according to tass zaikovs departure is connected to his 
appointment to the post of the first deputy chairman of the defense 
council of the ussr 
gorbachev in his role as president chairs the defense council 
which is responsible for elaborating national defense policy and 
whose membership was once topsecret 
zaikov will bring to the defense council experience in 
militaryrelated matters since he formerly served under gorbachev 
as the partys top official overseeing the defense industry and in 
198385 as party chief in the leningrad region one of the centers 
of the soviet armaments industry 
he took the helm of the moscow party organization in november 
1987 after his predecessor maverick politician boris n yeltsin 
was fired in disgrace for criticizing the slow pace of gorbachevs 
reforms 
one of the most powerful officials in the communist party 
apparatus zaikov has supported the policy of promoting scientific 
and technological progress but has called for limits in the 
partys drive for glasnost or greater openness 
this spring yeltsin and zaikovs party apparatus clashed 
headon in the countrys first multicandidate elections in seven 
decades with yeltsin claiming the party was trying to sabotage his 
bid to win the moscowwide seat in the new coongress of peoples 
deputies 
muscovites massively showed their support for yeltsin giving 
him 89 percent of the vote against the party machine candidate the 
director of a moscow automobile and truck works 
a secretary at the party committee in moscows frunze district 
rejected a western reporters suggestion that zaikov had been 
ousted because of sagging popularity 
oh no you cant be more mistaken she said he wasnt 
fired far from it he was promoted a duty officer at city 
party headquarters also said zaikov had received a higher 
position

a maryland woman who said she stole 55 
million from the department of housing and urban development to 
give to the poor was indicted today by a federal grand jury in 
baltimore a court clerk said 
marilyn louise harrell who has been dubbed robin hud was 
charged with theft of government property making false statements 
to the federal government making false statements in connection 
with a loan application and aiding and abetting said the us 
district court clerk in baltimore 
the clerk spoke on condition of annoymity 
the justice department planned to announce the indictment 
formally later in the day 
attempts to reach harrells attorney federal public defender 
anthony gallagher were not immediately successful a receptionist 
at his office said gallagher was in court on an unrelated matter 
and not available 
prosecutors began presenting evidence to the grand jury not long 
after harrell testified to congress last june that she withheld the 
55 million from hud while handling the sale of governmentowned 
property and used some of it to assist charities and the homeless 
word of the possible indictment first came monday when us 
attorney breckinridge willcox of baltimore said he would announce 
today a major development in a hud case 
hud and justice department sources speaking on the condition of 
anonymity had said the announcement would involve the harrell case 
and that prosecutors had asked the grand jury to indict her 
i cant say anything more at this time willcox said in a 
brief telephone conversation monday evening 
meanwhile a report released monday by the house government 
operations committee said former hud official june koch appears to 
have repeatedly violated ethics laws by using her government 
contacts to help her private business 
the report urged the justice department to investigate koch who 
was accused of using her influence on hud officials to benefit the 
consulting firm she has headed since leaving hud two years ago 
harrells testimony to congress was among the most dramatic 
during six months of hearings into allegations of fraud 
mismanagement and political favoritism at hud during the reagan 
administration 
two weeks after she testified hud seized her house in 
washingtons maryland suburbs as well as several other properties 
she said she purchased with hud money to help various charities and 
homeless families 
i in no way justify what i have done as being anything less 
than sin she told a house subcommittee in june i do 
regardless of where my life takes me from here intend to repay in 
full all monies taken 
harrell who was a private escrow agent hired by hud to handle 
the sales of hudowned properties said she was easily able to 
withhold money from the department several top officials in huds 
washington field office to which she reported were fired because 
of the harrell case and other alleged mismanagement 
harrell is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping 
some of the money they were supposed to transfer to hud 
when she lost her house in late june harrell said she was 
moving in with her mother in fort washington md attempts to reach 
her monday were unsuccessful the mothers telephone number is 
unlisted

members of namibias new assembly 
joined in applause tuesday when the dominant party which espoused 
marxism for two decades proposed a democratic framework for the 
independence constitution 
swapo the southwest africa peoples organization fought a 
23year war against south african rule and won 41 of the 72 
constituent assembly seats earlier this month 
at least 48 members a twothirds majority must approve the 
charter written by the assembly 
twentyone seats are held by the democratic turnhalle alliance 
a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy in the 
predominantly black territory and the 10 remaining seats are 
distributed among five other parties 
the assembly met in the tintenpalast namibias seat of 
government since german colonial rulers built it in 1910 south 
africa captured the territory also known as southwest africa in 
1915 during world war i 
hage geingob elected chairman of the assembly told the opening 
session the electorate has given us a mandate to hammer out and 
adopt in a spirit of compromise a spirit of giveandtake a 
constitution that will lead our people into nationhood geingob 
was in charge of the swapo election campaign 
members applauded when theoben gurirab who handles foreign 
affairs for swapo proposed that the constitution be based on 
democratic principles outlined in a 1982 un document setting up 
the procedures for namibias transition to independence 
he offered a motion saying the constitution should be the 
supreme law of the land with specific procedures for amendment 
and namibia should have an independent judiciary and an elected 
executive responsible to the legislative branch 
guirab said a declaration of rights should include freedom of 
movement speech and association a free press the right to life 
personal liberty and property and freedom from racial ethnic 
religious or sexual discrimination 
his motion could not be adopted because the assembly will not 
have rules of order until it meets again on monday 
swapo espoused marxist principles during most of its history 
and its stand on democratic principles during the campaign was 
vague and contradictory 
sam nujoma president of swapo told the assembly im here 
with great humility and pride pride because an occasion like this 
only happens once in a lifetime humility because i sam nujoma 
son of an ordinary citizen have been honored to be part of the 
struggle that brought us here and to lead us to nationhood 
as he and other former guerrilla leaders mounted the steps of 
the yellowandwhite colonial government building erica beukes 
one of four protesters screamed that they were killers 
she and the others belonged to the parents committee which has 
demanded that swapo reveal the fates of more than 400 people it 
detained in its foreign camps as spies a un investigation 
concluded more than 100 were dead and no information could be 
obtained about 350 others 
hundreds of swaying ululating swapo supporters surged around 
nujoma chanting viva as his bodyguards pushed a path through 
the crowd 
the parties have said they hope the constitution will be 
completed by early next year and independence can be declared 
shortly afterward 
martti ahtisaari head of the un team monitoring the 
transition attended the assemblys opening session he has said he 
expects namibia to become independent before the his groups 
scheduled departure at the end of march 
south africa governed southwest africa under a league of 
nations mandate the united nations revoked it in 1966 but south 
africa refused to leave and the bush war with swapo began for 
control of the vast mineralrich territory and its 15 million 
people 
earlier this year south africa agreed to allow independence 
under a usmediated peace accord that also called for withdrawal 
of the 50000 cuban troops from angola namibias northern neighbor

nearly 600 utility workers in 41 counties have 
been organized into a network to tell police of possible drug 
laboratories 
line workers meter readers billing clerks and other employees 
were trained last month by police to look for signs of clandestine 
laboratories that make methamphetamine or speed 
were seeing more and more of these labs in rural areas where 
the neighbors are not on top of them to report things like noxious 
fumes noise and fans running all the time said walter williams 
training coordinator for the state attorney generals bureau of 
narcotics and investigations 
because rural electric linemen are out there in the 
countryside they do come across things said tom hoy a 
spokesman in washington dc for the national rural electric 
cooperative association but this is the first time i know of 
where theyre being trained or alerted to some kind of drug 
surveillance 
police say signs of an illegal drug lab include chemical odors 
coming from barns or houses discarded chemical containers fans 
whirring through the night unusually high consumption of water or 
electricity extreme fluctuations in power use and large cash 
purchases of land and equipment especially by new residents 
thirteen electricity cooperatives have established drug 
awareness teams as part of a program managed by the attorney 
generals office the cooperatives are nonprofit power companies 
whose customers are voting members with a voice in how the utility 
is run all serve rural areas where police patrols are spread thin 
rural electric workers travel the back roads and are in a 
better position to see things that normally go unnoticed said 
joseph dukick spokesman for the pennsylvania rural electric 
association a harrisburgbased trade group 
we told our people not to investigate if they see something 
suspicious turn and run in the other direction and contact the 
police he said 
utility officials said most employees endorsed the program but 
some worried they would be seen as spies by their neighbors or 
could become involved with dangerous criminals 
they want to handle it in confidence and keep a low profile 
they dont want to put themselves at risk said ed dezich 
manager of the southwest central rural electric cooperative 
the american civil liberties union sees a tremendous potential 
for abuse in the program said barbara wolvovitz executive 
director of the pittsburgh chapter 
theres nothing wrong with a lineman or anyone else reporting 
something suspicious to police she said but if fluctuating 
electricity use is the sole basis for going to court to get a 
warrant then we have a problem with that there are many innocent 
reasons for a fluctuation to occur 
wolvovitz said the aclu may monitor the program 
hoy whose association represents 1000 rural electric systems 
in 46 states and 25 million rural customers said we are 
developing a national program to identify drug problems in rural 
areas and what role rural electrics can play in solving the growing 
drug problem in rural america were beginning to talk to our 
members now to see how we can coordinate this

in this small community where ernest and 
regina twigg live friends understand but strangers question why 
the parents of seven persevered until they proved a 10yearold 
stranger was their daughter 
the folks who know us our friends have been real supportive 
some of the people who work with me for amtrak have called to say 
were with you twigg said 
but others wonder why were pursuing this why we couldnt 
just let it drop i guess youd have to be a parent to know why 
he said from the amtrak station where hes a ticket agent 
twigg went back to work monday after lawyers went public with 
the news that genetic tests showed two families had raised the 
others child the twiggs say their real daughter is kimberly mays 
of sarasota who was switched in a hospital nursery with the child 
they took home a decade ago that child arlena died last year of 
heart disease 
the girls were born just days apart at hardee memorial hospital 
in the rural central floriday city of wauchula in the fall of 1978 
test results released sunday found a 999 percent chance that 
kimberly mays is actually a twigg and a 989 percent chance that 
arlena twigg was the daughter of robert mays and his wife barbara 
who died of cancer in 1981 
mays has not commented since the test results were released he 
is expected to attend a news conference at his attorneys office in 
sarasota on wednesday 
lee salk a cornell university medical college professor of 
psychology said the revelation triggers a common fear 
this affects us all he said it brings out the were we 
switched fear i imagine it will kick up anxiety in other 
children 
salk was one of seven child psychologists or psychiatrists asked 
by mays attorney to state what effect the twiggs effort to 
ascertain biological parenthood would have on kimberly in 1988 
all seven said that pursuing the case would be harmful to the 
10yearold 
some or all of them may be called by the court to help recommend 
a visitation plan between the twiggs and kimberly the twiggs 
agreed not to seek custody of kimberly in an agreement with mays 
that allowed the genetic testing 
the likely effects psychologists cited range from shattering the 
security of kimberlys relationship with the man who reared her to 
causing depression anxiety anger or confusion and a sense of loss 
salk expressed dismay monday that the search was pursued 
the twiggs sued hardee memorial in september in us district 
court in tampa mays attorney arthur ginsburg said he would 
recommend that mays also consider suing 
the twiggs lawsuit alleges a baby swap resulted from medical 
malpractice neglect or deliberate acts and asks a jury to decide 
hardee memorial has asked that the lawsuit be dismissed on 
technical grounds 
the hospitals lawyer janet adams said floridas statute of 
limitations requires patients to file malpractice claims within 
four years since the alleged swap occurred in 1978 she said its 
too late 
but another attorney for the twiggs bill post said the clock 
did not start ticking until the twiggs knew that arlena was not 
their child

prime minister margaret thatcher waging her first 
televised parliamentary battle tuesday clashed bitterly with the 
opposition over britains place in europe 
inflation high interest rates and the deficit also played 
starring roles in the live telecast on three british networks 
mrs thatcher again attacked the european economic communitys 
plans for a social charter harmonizing workers rights in britain 
and the 11 other member states 
instead of encouraging the creation of new jobs it would add 
to industrys costs and thereby price people out of work she 
said in the debate which kicked off the years legislative program 
and marked the first time the house of commons has been televised 
the charter would export jobs to more competitive countries she 
said 
we cannot accept a text which would completely reverse the 
very policies which have been responsible for our economic success 
over the past 10 years 
what we could accept is a much more general declaration which 
respects the right of each member state to follow its own 
social policies 
the parts of the charter we are firmly in favor of are those 
parts which will lead to the creation of new jobs and will not 
oppose competition and competitive costs she said 
but she opposed the parts that would put greater burdens on 
industry and reduce our competitiveness 
neil kinnock leader of the labor party opposition chastised 
mrs thatcher for drawing a dichotomy between reform in eastern 
europe and the eecs moves toward greater unity 
for you to try to equate the efforts of any of the democracies 
in western europe with the system in the east that is collapsing 
under the weight of its own inefficiences and injustice is 
absurd he said 
you should change your attitude as it helps no one least of 
all your country before 1939 there were many europes since then 
there have been two europes bitterly divided 
now there is the beginning of a possibility that there will be 
one europe a continent with borders but without barriers 
he ridiculed mrs thatchers claim that britains economy was 
fundamentally strong 
when i hear that claim i have to ask why if there is such an 
abundance of confidence we in britain have to pay 15 percent 
interest rates in order to buy the confidence 
as for underlying strength just look at our economy in 10 
oilrich years of this government we have seen the economy 
suffering fron chronic traffic congestion delay and danger as a 
result of systematic and sustained underfunding 
mrs thatcher welcomed the changes in eastern europe and 
promised aid but warned against dropping britains military guard 
times of great change are times of great uncertainty even 
danger 
we have to be prepared for any threat however unexpected as 
events demonstrate ever more conclusively we are winning the 
battle of ideas we must make sure that we dont subsequently lose 
the peace she said 
rebutting kinnocks criticisms she said the present 73 percent 
inflation rate was lower than anything achieved by labor between 
1974 and 1979 when it was last in power 
but a rate which was a cause for celebration for them is a 
cause of concern for us because it is far too high by our 
standards she said the absolute priority is to get inflation 
down but it is not only government policy that will determine the 
prospects for growth and jobs they depend on how well businesses 
keep their costs down 
she said her governments legislative program was aimed at 
enlarging opportunity and enhancing the quality of life 
the old classbased order is being replaced by one based on 
merit ability and effort this is the new britain the britain for 
the 1990s she said

a 10yearold boy suffering from a rare brain 
tumor has captured the official world record for receiving the most 
getwell cards officials said tuesday 
craig shergolds mountain of 1256266 getwell cards tops the 
previous record of 1000265 cards held by another english boy 
12yearold mario morby 
a spokeswoman at guinness publishing ltd said craig received an 
official certificate and his record will be included in the next 
edition of the book the guinness book of records 1991 
craig said in an interview from his home in carshalton south 
london that he was confident he would make it into the record 
books when his attempt began sept 24 
marion shergold said the attempt to break the world record began 
as a way to cheer up her son after he was too sick to meet princess 
diana 
he was really feeling low after that so we said lets go 
for the guinness book of records she said 
mrs shergold said an emergency operation in january removed 
threequarters of her sons tumor 
the cancer spread to craigs spinal cord but doctors believe 
they have successfully stemmed the disease with chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy mrs shergold said 
we dont know about the tumor on the brain so we take one day 
at a time she said the cards have been the best medicine in 
the world 
if the boys health continues to improve mrs shergold said she 
and her husband ernie and their other son who is 23 are 
planning to take craig to disneyworld in february 
craig who is bald from the cancer treatments said all of the 
publicity about the card doesnt bother him although he gets tired 
the appeal began by word of mouth and then turned to fax 
machines notices were sent to companies requesting getwell cards 
and for the fax to be sent on to two more companies the faxes 
circulated throughout britain before reaching the middle east and 
north america 
jp mcdougall and co a northern england decorators supply 
company participated in the record attempt by alerting their 100 
depots the company received 30000 cards which were packed in 
bags and sent by courier to craig 
it was slow at first and then they just started flooding 
in said elsie riley who counted the pile of cards sent to 
mcdougalls mail room some people sent presents and chocolates 
it was really heartening 
the collection officially ended nov 19 but cards continue to 
arrive from all over the world mrs shergold appealed to 
wellwishers to stop sending cards 
one of craigs favorites came from capt al haynes the pilot 
credited with saving the lives of 184 of the 296 passengers on 
board the united airlines dc10 which crashed on july 19 in sioux 
city iowa 
for three months ive been receiving cards from all over the 
world from people whove cared its meant a great deal to me 
haynes wrote in the letter which included some pilot wings 
mrs shergold said their local post office had been very helpful 
theyve taken over a warehouse free of charge for us and when 
weve opened and read all of the cards we put them in bags of 
2000 mrs shergold said

president bush on tuesday signed a 157 
billion labor health and education appropropriations bill shorn of 
language that would have liberalized medicaid financing for 
abortions 
bush had vetoed an earlier version of the bill in a battle with 
congress over abortion financing 
in a statement the president praised congress for bowing to his 
insistence that medicaid fund abortions only to save the life of 
the mother 
the bill originally would have allowed medicaid to pay for 
abortions for poor women who had been raped or were the victims of 
incest bush said the provision would have deprived innocent 
unborn children of the most basic civil right the right to life 
he said the massive spending bill for the departments of labor 
education and health and human services plus related agencies 
will finance some of the nations most important programs 
programs that help the needy the unemployed the sick and the 
infirm and programs that provide for the education of american 
children 
he noted that the legislation includes nearly 16 billion to 
combat the deadly aids virus and 54 billion for remedial 
education for disadvantaged students 
bush surrounded by 13 children also signed a proclamation 
declaring this national adoption week 
bush who has sought to spur adoption as an alternative to 
abortion said each of the 50000 children adopted in the united 
states a year repay their new families a hundredfold 
but he said thousands more children still wait to be adopted 
many of them with special needs 
bush recently asked congress to pass legislation giving parents 
a 3000 tax deduction to help cover the costs of adopting children 
with disabilities or other special needs 
he shook hands and asked the names of each child recognizing at 
least one boy from an earlier adoption ceremony then expressed 
regret that first dog millie was not allowed into the ceremonial 
rooms 
mrs bush putting her husbands thought into action took care 
of that 
pretty cute kids ill tell you said the first lady she 
instructed tim mcbride the presidents personal aide to let the 
dog in and in a flash millie ran into the roosevelt room 
the dog raced in ran around the kids and raced out mrs bush 
called her back and hoisted her up for a girl in a wheelchair to 
pet 
thats all for millie goodbye said mrs bush as the pet 
trotted off

a texas man being sought in the 
abduction of his two young sons was arraigned on murder charges 
tuesday after he walked into a county jail and told a receptionist 
he had killed the boys 
roy irwin abbott sr 52 of denton texas was ordered held 
pending a bail hearing nov 29 no plea was entered 
according to affidavit by state police detective william gomane 
abbott said at the york county jail i need to see a police 
officer ive killed my kids 
abbott told police he used a 12gauge shotgun to kill the boys 
monday and left the weapon in the back of his car gomane said 
authorities said the shotgun was recovered 
authorities found the boys bodies both with gunshot wounds on 
a dirt road in a wooded area near silver lake in shapleigh maine 
state police said 
abbott a maine native and the boys apparently had been staying 
without permission at a silver lake cottage owned by abbotts 
brother benjamin abbott of portsmouth nh said state police 
sgt michael harriman 
abbott made no comments to reporters as he entered the 
courthouse 
his courtappointed lawyer stephen j schwartz of portland had 
little to say i havent even had the opportunity to discuss the 
full set of facts with my client he said 
on sept 1 abbotts divorce from maria louisa abbott 40 of 
denton became final and he took custody of his sons for the labor 
day weekend denton police capt bill cummings said abbott was 
supposed to return the boys on sept 4 but did not 
their mother contacted police the next day a kidnapping warrant 
was issued on oct 16 
abbott told police he had planned to turn himself in on the 
texas charge monday but then shot his sons when they began crying 
and did not want to go home officers said 
he started into town to turn himself in they started crying 
and he shot them cummings said 
spokesman stephen mccausland of the maine department of public 
safety identified the older boy as roy irwin abbott jr 6 maine 
officials identified the younger boy as ronney abbott 4 but texas 
authorities identified the younger boy as rooney abbott neither 
agency was able to explain the discrepancy tuesday 
autopsies tuesday revealed that the boys died of gunshot wounds 
to the head and chest harriman said adding that each boy was shot 
twice at close range 
authorities said they believe abbott came to the portsmouth area 
around sept 4 and that he worked briefly at a department store 
there before taking the boys to canaan maine 
abbott enrolled the older boy in canaan christian school in late 
october for about two weeks then moved to yarmouth where he worked 
at a dry cleaning business from nov 6 to nov 8 harriman said 
the sergeant said authorities searched for abbott in augusta 
eliot kittery and portsmouth each time we checked these 
locations there was another move on his part indicating he was 
aware he was being hunted 
cummings said texas authorities would likely wait for maine 
officials to finish legal proceedings before seeking an extradition 
on kidnapping charges

leaders of greeces three main parties 
reached agreement tuesday for an allparty interim government to 
end the stalemate that followed inconclusive elections on nov 5 
the three parties agreed to support a government whose life 
term will last until midapril conservative leader constantine 
mitsotakis told a news conference 
the decision to hold general elections in april follows four 
rounds of talks between conservative socialist and communist 
leaders with president christos sartzetakis 
mitsotakis said the interim administration will be headed by 
xenophon zolotas an economist and former governor of the bank of 
greece zolotas is not a member of parliament 
the government will include members of all parties and also 
nonpolitical personalities mitsotakis said but composition of 
the cabinet has not been decided 
he said the administrations first tasks will be to deal with 
economic problems and negotiations with the united states on 
whether to renew an agreement for us bases in greece 
in washington the state department said the united states looks 
forward to working with the new government and will raise the 
question of the status of the us bases once a cabinet is formed 
it issued a statement saying we believe it is in the interest 
of both countries to continue a strong bilateral security 
relationship we will look for a mutually satisfactory way to do 
so 
talks between the party leaders had been deadlocked over a 
demand by former socialist premier andreas papandreou that the 
electoral system be changed 
his proposed change involving the proportional representation 
system would have made it even more difficult for any party to win 
a majority in the 300member unicameral parliament under the 
present system if one party receives at least 47 percent of the 
vote it can govern alone 
mitsotakis whose new democracy party won 46 percent of the vote 
and 148 parliamentary seats in november rejected the proposal he 
said the april elections will be conducted under the present 
electoral system 
papandreou governed for eight years until the formation of a 
conservativecommunist alliance in june after elections that also 
failed to give any party a majority 
his party won 128 seats in november and the communistled 
coalition of the left and progress led by harilaos florakis won 21 
two seats went to independents and one to an environmentalist 
zolotas 85 headed the nations central bank for almost 20 
years while conservatives were in power 
the premierdesignate is not a member of any political party and 
has never run for parliament 
zolotas served as bank of greece governor from 195567 and from 
197481 he acquired a reputation as a pragmatist for maintaining 
tight economic policies to offset greeces trade deficit 
a socialist party official who was close to the negotiations 
that produced the compromise agreement said zolotas was proposed by 
mitsotakis and accepted without any objections

white house budget director richard darman 
said he hopes tuesdays deficit reduction agreement means more 
cooperation than confrontation with congress next year on budget 
issues 
darman said the deficit cutting package was made possible by 
president bushs insistence that he was willing to accept 
acrosstheboard spending cuts rather than tolerate a 1990 budget 
which met the grammrudman deficit targets through accounting 
gimmicks 
the 147 billion deficit cutting package was agreed to in 
postmidnight negotiations as members of congress rushed to 
complete their work before the thanksgiving holidays 
darman said the measure was far better than anyone thought 
likely on nov 2 when bush issued his ultimatum that he wanted to 
see at least 14 billion in real deficit reductions or he was 
prepared to live with acrosstheboard spending cuts 
the director of the office of management and budget however 
warned members of congress not to try to make changes in the 
agreement in passing the necessary implementing legislation he 
said any such changes could still prompt a presidential veto 
if they do not follow the agreement then there will not be a 
deal darman said in a meeting with reporters 
the deficitreduction package darman said should get congress 
and the administration back to where they were last spring when 
both sides reached a muchheralded budget pact that agreement 
dissolved into bitter partisan fighting over bushs efforts to 
slash capital gains tax rates 
this can get us back on a path of bipartisanship and put this 
recent period of partisan debate behind us darman said adding 
that the challenge of meeting the deficitreduction target of 64 
billion in 1991 was sizable 
the administration is preparing its 1991 budget to be submitted 
in january but darman turned aside questions about what will be in 
that package 
he did say the administration would be proposing cuts in 
entitlement programs to meet the deficit targets 
he also said that he would consider increases in alcohol and 
tobacco taxes among the revenue increases that would be prohibited 
under the presidents nonew taxes campaign pledge but he added 
that he doesnt drink or smoke and said i dont believe either 
of those should be encouraged 
the wall street journal reported tuesday that a bush 
administration task force is considering proposals to raise the 
federal tax on tobacco and liquor and impose new taxes on polluters 
and use the revenues raised to underwrite the cost to the 
government of offering individuals new tax breaks to encourage 
savings 
darman said he believed that the budget deficit which totaled 
1521 billion in the fiscal year which ended on sept 30 had now 
been stabilized at a sustainable level withthe new deficit cutting 
agreement for the current fiscal year 
there isnt the sense of erosion or lack of control that i had 
in the 1980s darman said referring to his years of service in 
the reagan administration the budget deficit hit a record of 
2211 billion in 1986

a senior member of the house armed services 
committee said tuesday that panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega 
has executed probably more than 100 officers and troops since a 
failed oct 3 coup 
as a result there cannot be a chivalrous coup detat in the 
future the next batch of coup plotters wont be interested in 
handing noriega over to us or dispatching him into exile said 
rep ike skelton dmo 
noriega has changed the ground rules so the next coup will be 
bloody 
the purge skelton said amounts to 3 percent of the men in the 
panamanian defense force 
skeltons comments came a day after his defense policy panel 
received a closeddoor topsecret briefing from gen maxwell 
thurman chief of the us southern command based in panama 
skelton said noriega had killed more than 70 and probably more 
than 100 officers and men of the panama defense force 
before october coups in panama were essentially bloodless if 
you lost a coup you lost your job but not your life noriega has 
changed all that skelton said in a statement 
the result is that any new coup attempt if successful will 
do little that we want except eliminate noriega which will 
probably happen in a manner we do not wish to be associated with 
skelton said 
whoever wins lives and whoever loses will die thats the 
game were in now he said 
intelligence sources have said that in the wake of the failed 
coup the central intelligence agency has received congressional 
clearance for a new covert plan that would spend up to 3 million 
to depose noriega the plan would permit aiding coup plotters even 
if violence were likely as long as the plot did not include plans 
for assassination 
a longstanding executive order bars us operatives from 
participating in any plot to assassinate a foreign leader 
skelton said he was satisfied that the likelihood noriega could 
die in a later coup does not necessarily represent an impediment to 
us involvement 
a death involved in a coup is different from an outandout 
assassination attempt he said 
noriegas purge has left a concentration of thugs in the 
pdf which lessens the chances that any new coup would lead to a 
restoration of democracy and elimination of drug trafficking and 
money laundering skelton said 
the coup attempt occurred during thurmans first week as the new 
chief of southcom and skelton was among the harshest congressional 
critics of us failure to give full support to the rebels led by 
maj moises giroldi 
but after thurmans briefing skelton said it was clear that the 
coup attempt was flawed because it was based on the irrational 
premise that noriega would agree to retire to his farm in panama 
and because the rebels wouldnt turn noriega over to us 
authorities would not have restored democracy and probably would 
have continued noriegas drug operations 
at the pentagon a spokeswoman maj kathy wood said security 
has been tightened at us defense sites in panama because of bomb 
threats 
wood said that the first such threat was made about a week ago 
and that the new security steps have been in effect for nearly a 
weeks time 
it means that they are inspecting cars more carefully and 
that some parking lots have been closed if they are within 75 
meters of buildings wood said 
us personnel are acting under personnel movement limitations 
that require them to keep others advised of their movements to 
exercise caution and to avoid any known trouble areas wood said

against former child television star todd bridges who was 
acquitted by a jury earlier this month of more serious charges in 
the shooting of a drug dealer 
bridges who faces up to six years in prison if convicted 
pleaded innocent to assault with a firearm and remained free on 
25000 bail pending a jan 25 hearing said mike botula of the 
district attorneys office 
jurors found bridges innocent nov 7 of attempted murder and the 
lesser charge of attempted voluntary manslaughter two days later 
the panel announced it was deadlocked 84 in favor of acquitting 
him on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon 
the former member of the cast of the series diffrent 
strokes was originally charged with shooting eight bullets into 
kenneth tex clay and slashing his throat during a feb 2 
scuffle in a southcentral los angeles crack house where 
cocaine was being peddled 
clay 25 survived the attack and testified bridges was based 
out from freebasing or smoking cocaine when the shooting 
occurred he looked like his eyes were about to jump out of his 
head clay said 
clay described himself as a bodyguard for the owner of the house 
where bridges was living and said bridges was taking weapons from 
the house and selling them 
defense attorney johnnie l cochran jr maintained throughout 
the trial that bridges shot clay in selfdefense 
bridges 24 who for eight years played actor gary colemans 
brother willis on diffrent strokes testified he became 
depressed and turned to drugs after the situation comedy was 
canceled in 1986 
on nov 13 harvie eugene duckett 31 who testified that he 
helped bridges attack clay was placed on three years probation as 
part of a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors

an official east german newspaper called 
communist party chief egon krenz a secret member of the old guard 
tuesday less than a month before a party congress that is expected 
to make leadership changes 
calls for germany reunification by protesters in leipzig added 
still another dimension to an already volatile and complicated 
political situation 
premier hans modrows new government said it was planning 
unpopular measures to curb blackmarket currency trading which 
has flourished since the borders with west germany were opened nov 
9 
a statement by modrow to workers at a berlin factory as 
reported by the official news agency adn did not make clear 
whether there would be an attempt to reduce the number of east 
germans traveling to the west more than 6 million have visited 
west berlin or west germany 
the german democratic republic east germany cannot become a 
country of currency speculators modrow said at the factory 
state television said later the new measures were customs 
controls to be revealed after a government meeting thursday the 
flood of visitors to the west has taken a huge amount of money out 
of the country adding to east germanys economic problems 
in bonn the west german government said east germany had 
rejected the idea of a joint fund to provide citizens with money 
for travel to the west 
although east germans now enjoy freedom of travel unthinkable 
less than a year ago and have been promised free elections 
opposition leaders say thats not enough 
increasingly the criticism has been aimed at krenz in part 
because 77yearold erich honecker the man he replaced oct 18 
had been his mentor 
krenz 52 has been dogged by a debate over whether he averted a 
potential massacre earlier in october by reversing honeckers 
orders to leipzig police to shoot prodemocracy protesters if 
necessary 
supporters say he did detractors say he reversed the orders 
only after being persuated by local party officials and church 
leaders 
his support for chinas crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
in june has been another obstacle in krenzs effort to win over a 
distrustful people there also have been allegations that he took 
part in massive election fraud 
as parliament weighs possible criminal charges against honecker 
and other members of his inner circle reform groups emphasize 
krenz was part of that group his promises of reform often 
expressed in careful generalities have done little to change that 
attitude 
tuesdays editions of the official daily nationalzeitung 
reminded its readers the new party chief belonged to the 
leadership body that is now in the crossfire of criticism 
egon krenz cannot make up lost ground unless he answers the 
criticisms it said in a commentary the time of glasnost demands 
honesty from everyone 
staterun newspapers which once hewed strictly to the party 
leaderships line have reported much more freely in recent weeks 
but the nationalzeitungs criticism of krenz was the harshest to 
date adn distributed the commentary after its publication 
the conservative masscirculation west german newspaper bild 
said krenz might be ousted in four weeks which roughly coincides 
with the party congress scheduled for dec 1517 
krenz has acknowledged that possibility he told state tv over 
the weekend naturally i want to fight for the changes weve 
managed so far but if the party is of another opinion then they 
should find another general secretary 
a major question is whether a former model of party loyalty can 
lead east germany through a crisis rooted in the flight of 275000 
people from a nation of 165 million and the commitment to reform 
of millions who stayed home 
opposition groups previously had expressed indifference even 
opposition to calls from bonn for german reunification but some 
of that changed monday night when protesters in leipzig called out 
we are one people and germany a united fatherland 
whether that represents a major shift in position or not west 
germans seized on the chants as growing support for a single german 
state 
in the german democratic republic the calls for a 
reunification are growing ever louder said volker ruehe general 
secretary of chancellor helmut kohls party the christian 
democrats thats what the demonstration of hundreds of thousands 
of people showed on monday evening in leipzig

four psychologists who speculated publicly about 
why kitty dukakis drank rubbing alcohol have been chastised by a 
state licensing board which said they may have violated ethical 
principles 
the state board of registration of psychologists last week sent 
letters to the psychologists criticizing them for comments 
published nov 10 in the boston globe the newspaper said tuesday 
the globes article came after mrs dukakis a recovering 
alcoholic who is the wife of gov michael s dukakis was 
hospitalized for drinking rubbing alcohol 
the article suggested that mrs dukakis broke down in part 
because she was carrying all the emotional burdens of the dukakis 
marriage it quoted psychologist david kantor as recommending the 
governor resign to give the couple the privacy they need to address 
their personal problems 
if the board files a complaint following a preliminary inquiry 
which is under way the psychologists could be censured or lose 
their licenses the globe said 
dr jessica daniels chairwoman of the board would only say 
tuesday that the letters were letters of inquiry she would not say 
whether an investigation was under way 
the letters said the psychologists may have violated six ethical 
principles the globe said 
one of the psychologists caroline maltas told the associated 
press she was misquoted and had protested to the globe 
the globe said maltas kantor and psychologist barry dym said 
they believed they were misquoted misrepresented or quoted out of 
context in the nov 10 article the globe said the fourth 
psychologist esther shapiro would not say whd a letter from the 
board but would not say whether she was quoted accurately 
maltas codirector of the mclean institute for couples and 
families in suburban belmont said the boards action could damage 
her 16year psychology practice 
i give these kinds of interviews all the time i consider it 
my professional responsibility to educate the public maltas told 
the ap 
im going to be unbelievably careful about who i talk to in 
the future she said 
shapiro dym and kantor did not return telephone calls tuesday 
seeking comment 
the order initiating the inquiry did not come from the governor 
said andrew dreyfus a spokesman for the executive office of 
consumer affairs which oversees all the states independent 
licensing boards 
no one in this office the governors office or the director 
of the division of registrations office had any prior knowledge 
of the inquiry dreyfus said 
board member herbert j hoffman said the inquiry was prompted by 
the globe article which appeared the same day as a board meeting 
after a full and lengthy discussion there was a consensus to 
contact the psychologists about their comments he said 
globe managing editor thomas mulvoy said the newspaper stands by 
the article and defended the practice of reporters asking experts 
about current events even though they are not directly involved 
we report by analogy all the time he said if a major 
political figure has heart bypass surgery certainly a 
reasonable approach is to go to doctors and ask how the procedure 
works 
under american psychiatric association guidelines mentalhealth 
professionals can comment on psychological problems if they add the 
disclaimer that they are talking generally and not about a specific 
person said dr bernard katz chief of the human resource 
institution in brookline 
maltas said she was aware of the guidelines and had restricted 
her comments to general issues 
in addition to questions about professional ethics the boards 
inquiry also raises freespeech issues said floyd abrams a 
prominent first amendment attorney 
abrams said the boards actions give the appearance that the 
state is trying to quash psychological speculation about the 
governors wife making people think twice before talking to 
reporters 
in a situation like this where the governor and his family 
are under intense public scrutiny its particularly important that 
state agencies not become involved in making any threats to those 
who have been a part of the process abrams said

the house on tuesday approved a compromise 
240 million antidrug bill that includes new military aid for the 
three andean countries that are the major source of cocaine flowing 
into the united states 
the bill was approved on a voice vote and sent to the senate 
which was expected to approve it and send it to the white house 
before adjourning for the year 
a centerpiece of the measure was 125 million in military aid 
including weapons and police training to bolivia colombia and 
peru for the fiscal year that began oct 1 the aid is intended for 
units organized specifically for narcotics control and can be used 
so long as police forces do not commit gross human rights 
violations 
another major feature was authorization of 115 million for 
operations of international narcotics control programs through the 
state department it continued the requirement that countries be 
certified as cooperating fully with us antidrug efforts before 
receiving aid 
under the bill us officials may help in training foreign 
antidrug personnel and may accompany them on forays but are barred 
from direct involvement in arrests in foreign countries 
house and senate negotiators at the insistence of sen robert 
byrd dwva dropped from the bill authority to use some money 
for nonandean countries that are major drug transit points that 
meant that 25 million in weaponry and 1 million in police 
training would be lost to mexico ecuador paraguay brazil 
jamaica and the bahamas 
another change gave more flexibility to the administration to 
reward new drug eradication or interdiction efforts in peru 
bolivia and colombia by waiving repayment of official debts owed 
to the us government

a former adviser to two secretaries of defense 
says the united states could safely trim defense spending by 145 
billion over 10 years and should take such action as part of a 
revolution in military affairs 
in a 100page paper to be published next month by the brookings 
institution william h kaufmann outlines cuts that would reduce 
the pentagons current budget of 305 billion to 160 billion by 
1999 he says the cumulative reductions would add up to 500 
billion in savings 
a revolution in military affairs could be in the making at 
least in part because of the economic distress in the ussr and the 
changes in soviet leadership kaufmann a harvard university 
lecturer and pentagon veteran writes 
the revolution will not progress much further without 
initiatives and cooperation by the united states he said 
kaufmann argues that proposals by soviet officials to cut their 
defense budget are worth encouraging not by increasing us 
defense spending and the modernization of its forces but by 
relaxing to some degree the us effort 
kaufmann is a nonresident senior fellow in foreign policy 
studies at the liberalleaning brookings institution he is a 
professor emeritus at the massachusetts institute of technology and 
has served as a consultant to former secretaries of defense robert 
s mcnamara of the kennedy and johnson administrations and harold 
brown of the carter administration 
draft copies of his report began circulating as pentagon sources 
said that defense secretary dick cheney was studying suggestions 
for sweeping changes including cutting 100000 army soldiers 
getting rid of 100 navy ships and closing at least a dozen air 
force bases 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity said cheney is 
considering a budget plan for the 1991 fiscal year that could cut 
20 billion from the projected 317 billion spending level 
the pentagon is expected to submit its 1991 spending projection 
to the office of management and budget by dec 8 the official 
said kaufmann said a copy of his study with its call for much 
deeper cuts was sent to omb 
in the first five years alone it calls for cutting one 
activeduty army division in the united states while keeping forces 
at their present level in europe until a conventionalforces 
reduction agreement is signed with the soviet union 
it also recommends scaling back the air forces b2 stealth 
bomber force to 13 planes and canceling the c17 cargo plane 
for the navy it proposes the elimination of two of the 14 
aircraft carrier battle groups 
kaufmann also proposed canceling the mx rail garrison strategic 
missile and the smaller midgetman missile and focusing on a 
strategic deterrent based on trident ballistic missile submarines 
kaufmann argued that such reductions could be made without 
sacrificing us global commitments or undermining arms control 
talks with the soviet union

the air force has concluded that a powerful 
radar system built to detect submarinelaunched missiles off the 
southeastern united states poses a potential risk to virtually all 
military aircraft landing at robins air force base in central 
georgia 
the conclusion was disclosed tuesday in a letter made public by 
sen sam nunn dga the senate armed services committee chairman 
who last year asked the air force to assess the danger posed to 
aircraft by the pave paws radar installation two miles south of the 
robins airfield 
pave paws stands for precision acquisition vehicle entry phased 
array warning system the 10story pyramid shaped installation at 
robins one of four such facilities nationwide consists of 
thousands of computerdirected antennas that can scan 240 degrees 
for 3000 miles the radar reportedly can identify an object the 
size of a basketball 1500 miles away 
the air force acknowledged in january that since 1987 it has 
been turning off the north face of the radar every time a plane 
carrying an externally mounted electroexplosive device eed lands 
at robins 
the shutdowns are designed to keep the radars electromagnetic 
radiation from accidentally detonating the eeds the tiny explosive 
charges that are used among other things to trigger weapons 
systems and ejection seats or jettison bombs and fuel tanks 
the explosive devices normally are detonated by an electrical 
circuit but they also can be set off high levels of 
electromagnetic energy from such sources as radio waves radar 
emissions static electricity and lightning 
in the letter to nunn brig gen burton r moore said an air 
force review of the problem has concluded that the radar poses a 
potential risk to aircraft with internal eeds such as those used 
to power ejection seats as well as to aircraft with the devices 
mounted externally 
it would look like most aircraft would probably have internal 
eeds of one sort or another lt col joseph w purka jr an air 
force spokesman said tuesday 
purka said the north face of the radar now is turned off when 
any plane enters the onenautical mile restricted zone around the 
facility 
purka said there was no incident that triggered the decision 
to begin shutting down the radar for some planes 
moore told nunn the shutdown procedures will have a minimal 
impact on missile warning operations 
the air force convened a panel of senior generals in january to 
develop a permanent solution to the problem the panel was supposed 
to have finished its work by june but purka said tuesday the group 
recommended this month that the temporary shutdown procedures 
remain in effect for another year while further study is done

sometimes but it was my life and nobody was going to take it away 
from me she said 
she said she ditched her pack and kept only some dried apples to 
eat 
i felt i had to let go of my belongings to survive and run as 
far and as fast as i could she said 
she said she saw rescue helicopters overhead but didnt build a 
fire to attract attention because it might have given her away to 
the men she believed were chasing her 
i wasnt hungry she said it didnt matter i was too 
scared and cold to be hungry 
miss lindsay said she found a cache of doughnuts and pound cake 
hanging from a tree and sought shelter from rain in a burnedout

president fw de klerk asked 
for an official report on alleged killings by police death squads 
but newspapers demanded tuesday that an independent inquiry be 
conducted 
casper venter spokesman for de klerk said the president told 
law and order minister adriaan vlok last week to provide a 
detailed indepth report on the allegations that opponents of 
the government have been assassinated 
this may satisfy the president but it will not satisfy anyone 
else said the star the nations largest daily its editorial 
was one of many demanding an inquiry by someone outside the 
official establishment 
only a fullscale open judicial inquiry can clear the air 
said the paper which often opposes the government without it 
the stain on south africa will be indelible 
three former policemen including a white captain have said 
they took part in the killings on orders from superiors 
a former police commissioner a ranking officer investigating 
the bombing of an antiapartheid church organization and other high 
officers still in service were named by former capt dirk johannes 
coetzee during an interview in mauritius last week after he left 
south africa 
it is neither right nor fair to the police to appoint the 
head of the internal affairs division to investigate such 
horrendous and politically explosive allegations against his own 
colleagues the cape times newspaper said 
that official and a provincial attorney general were appointed 
to investigate when the charges first arose in an affidavit by a 
black former security policeman 
butane nofomela scheduled to hang oct 20 for the murder of a 
white farmer in a case with no apparent political overtones 
summoned lawyers the night before and signed a statement that 
coetzee was his superior in a death squad that killed political 
activists prisoners and african national congress guerrillas 
he has been granted a stay of execution while his allegations 
are checked investigators did not get in touch with coetzee who 
was given a medical discharge from the police in 1986 and he left 
the country more than two weeks later 
last weekend newspapers quoted black former policeman david 
tshikalange as saying he also was part of a police death squad and 
had left the country 
it is essential that the truth comes to light there should 
not be a scrap of suspicion about the police being neutral in its 
duty of keeping law and order said die burger an afrikaans 
language paper that supports the government 
business day the leading financial daily commented the 
credibility of the police has simply collapsed the general public 
reaction to the allegations has been that given the secrecy in 
which the police operate and the accumulation of unsolved murder 
cases in which the victims have been opponents of the government 
an assassination squad might well have existed nofomelas 
statement focused mainly on the killing in 1982 of griffiths 
mxenge a black lawyer and civil rights activist he and coetzee 
said mxenge was stabbed to death in an attack made to look like a 
robbery his dogs were poisoned and his car was taken away and 
burned 
in parts of the statement obtained tuesday by the independent 
south african press association nofomela said a radiotape deck 
was removed from mxenges car before it was destroyed and was 
installed in a police vehicle used by brig willem schoon 
both nofomela and coetzee said schoon ordered the killing and 
nofomela said the brigadier supervised several squads that carried 
out assassinations and other crimes in south africa and neighboring 
countries 
schoon has refused to talk to the press police headquarters in 
pretoria issued a statement tuesday saying his retirement oct 31 
had been planned since july and was not related to the allegations 
dozens of killings of antiapartheid activists in the 1980s 
remain unsolved and human rights groups have said for years they 
believed security forces were responsible

a lutheran minister on tuesday 
criticized us and canadian aid to el salvador where he directed 
an orphanage until his arrest by salvadoran security forces 
the rev brian rude said he planned a speaking tour to address 
the suffering of many salvadorans who resent the foreign 
assistance to the rightist government of president alfredo 
cristiani 
certainly the preference there would be that it aid be 
discontinued and that the salvadorans be allowed to resolve their 
problems without what they see as that kind of interference rude 
told a news conference hours after his return to calgary 
the united states has provided 35 billion in aid to battle the 
decadeold insurgency and canada has a 12 million program that 
aids farmers 
rude 33 worked in an orphanage outside san salvador for a year 
and was also caring for people wounded or displaced by fighting 
between government troops and leftist rebels 
he was among a dozen lutheran missionaries arrested thursday by 
salvadoran security forces in a government crackdown on people 
suspected of leftist sympathies 
the arrests came hours after six jesuit priests their 
housekeeper and her 15yearold daughter were mutilated and slain 
roman catholic officials blamed rightwing death squads and the 
united states said it would pressure cristiani to fully investigate 
the slayings 
the slight lutheran minister spent a night blindfolded and 
handcuffed in a jail before his release he returned to calgary 
late monday to the cheers of friends and family 
rude who was originally scheduled to return to calgary in 
december said he will go on a speaking tour to tell the stories 
that are not getting out 
i feel disconnected even while i was there listening to news 
reports from other parts of the world over shortwave i realized 
that a lot of the information going out wasnt necessarily the way 
we were experiencing it 
the minister said he was concerned canadian aid was not being 
distributed properly 
there is some potential for the aid to be used in positive 
ways but i think if it were channelled more directly through 
churches it could be used in a better way than it is being used 
he said 
since 1986 the canadian international development agency has 
sent more than 12 million to the country in fertilizer that is 
sold by a local bank on the open market the proceeds are used for 
special projects 
i feel the aid we offer as a canadian government even though 
its not directed through the salvadoran government does offer 
some legitimacy to the government of el salvador which can be 
interpreted in the wrong way 
more than 1000 people have died since the farabundo marti 
national liberation front launched a nationwide offensive nov 11 
at least 71000 people mostly civilians have been killed in the 
insurgency

about 55 us military advisers 
are based in el salvador limited in number by congress and 
forbidden from firing unless they are fired upon 
a us source said the military men trapped in a guerrilla 
attack on the el salvador sheraton hotel on tuesday were not part 
of the adviser group but were on a twoweek training mission and 
had been due to leave tuesday 
the source who declined to be further identified would not say 
how large the group was where it was based in the united states or 
its specific mission 
the limit on advisers was set in 1980 a year before the first 
ones arrived to avoid the appearance of the type of military 
buildup that occurred in vietnam but officials say the number is 
often larger because rotations overlap and the advisers are joined 
by logistical and administrative support 
the advisers come to train the salvadoran armed forces to battle 
guerrillas of the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front 
they are assigned to each of the six salvadoran military bases 
and other major installations others work with the navy air 
force joint chiefs of staff or at a military training school 
using both classroom work and military exercises 
the advisers train salvadoran soldiers in patrolling 
counterinsurgency techniques and other tactics in a program that 
draws from courses in venezuela colombia israel and britain as 
well as the united states 
the rules of engagement for the americans bar them from entering 
zones where combat is likely or from taking part in patrols but if 
fired upon they can fire back as at least one did in a sept 13 
1988 guerrilla attack on el paraiso the 4th army brigade 
headquarters in northern chalatenango province 
sgt gregory fronius was killed in a march 1987 attack at el 
paraiso the only american soldier to die in combat in the 
10yearold salvadoran war 
eleven other us military personnel have been killed in el 
salvador five in shootings and six in a helicopter crash

congressional passage of a deficit reduction 
package is expected to force a 15 percent budget cut on defense 
spending for this fiscal year but the pentagon spokesman said 
tuesday the precise effect is unclear 
what that translates into in terms of people and systems 
we are not prepared to say said pentagon spokesman pete williams 
while saying that the impact could be 6 or 7 billion 
williams added that pentagon officials are not yet able to estimate 
the exact magnitude of the cuts under the complicated features of 
the grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction law 
the figure is widely expected to be at least several billion 
dollars at least 
although congress approved a 286 billion defense budget for the 
1990 fiscal year that began oct 1 president bush has not yet 
signed it into law 
williams said it is difficult to determine the exact nature of 
the impact of the cuts because different rules may apply to 
various dod accounts under the budget reduction law 
its very hard to know precisely what the impact would be but 
we think it would be about a 15 percent recutive for the defense 
department over four months williams said 
had the terms of the grammrudman law been fully enforced over a 
years time defense programs would have to be pared by 8 billion 
or half the 16 billion spending reductions the law would have 
automatically imposed on most federal programs 
bush stated repeatedly in recent weeks that he preferred 
retaining the acrosstheboard cuts for a full year to accepting 
congressional efforts to reduce the deficit which he said 
contained phony savings 
pentagon officials had warned of severe cutbacks in military 
personnel and weapons acquisition if the grammrudman cuts had been 
left in place the entire year 
on capitol hill lawmakers ran into lastminute delays in 
beginning debate on the 147 billion budgetcutting bill for the 
current fiscal year 
the bill relies heavily on acrosstheboard cuts triggered last 
month by the grammrudman deficitreduction law a mechanism 
designed to shrink federal spending 
williams said that defense secretary dick cheney and his top 
aides are also in the final stages of putting together some final 
numbers for the departments 1991 fiscal year budget 
department sources said the secretary is considering a cut 
ranging from 10 billion to 20 billion for the next year bringing 
the level down to the range of around 297 billion 
the spokesman refused to confirm those figures saying with a 
laugh ive heard numbers lower and ive heard nubmers higher 
williams said cheney had also spent part of the day discussing 
with the service chiefs their suggestions for the longterm cuts 
for the years 199294 which have been reported to be in the range 
of 180 billion 
the spokesman said that no decisions have been made on those 
cuts but that the talks have been a good starting point

a federal panel tuesday accused massachusetts 
attorney general james shannon of unfairly delaying the seabrook 
nh nuclear power plant and reaffirmed its view that evacuation 
plans for nearby residents are adequate 
the atomic safety and licensing board in a 41page memo dated 
monday and made public tuesday said concerns raised by a 
higherlevel regulatory board should not prevent seabrook from 
getting a fullpower operating license 
using unusually harsh language the licensing board said shannon 
had raised the specter of the deplored endless loop of 
litigation in opposing seabrook even though seabrook is 
entitled to a license 
the attorney general of massachusetts is carrying out his 
announced strategy of filing contentions at every opportunity 
the board wrote adding that shannons large staff of assistants 
with their fecund word processors can produce motions for renewed 
litigation faster than the board and parties can deal with them 
if the practice is allowed to continue the board wrote there 
is no hope for the seabrook station despite applicants fairly won 
victory 
stephen jonas shannons top deputy handling the seabrook issue 
said the licensing boards decision was based on impatience not 
law 
the thrust of the decision is were tired of this 
litigation theres no legal substance to their arguments jonas 
said theyre trying to railroad this thing through 
the memo comes a week after the board touched off a furor among 
seabrook opponents by ruling that seabrook should be granted a 
fullpower license despite concerns raised by the atomic safety and 
licensing appeal board shannon called the ruling lawless 
both the licensing and appeal boards are branches of the federal 
nuclear regulatory commission

three auto safety groups accused the federal 
government tuesday of failing to promote and enforce air bag rules 
but a government highway safety spokesman said car passenger 
protection is its top priority 
public citizen the center for auto safety and motor voters also 
issued a report card on air bags giving failing grades to all 
but four auto manufacturers for laxity in installation of the 
passengerprotection devices 
a virginia woman appearing at a news conference with the 
coalition of safety and consumer groups said she survived a 110 
mph headon collision because an air bag popped out of her steering 
wheel 
the groups estimate that nearly onethird of the 10 million 1990 
cars sold in the united states will be equipped with driversside 
air bags compared to about 400000 of the 1989 models a new 
safety administration rule requires either a drivers air bag or 
lap and shoulder belts that automatically encircle both frontseat 
occupants in all 1990model cars 
nhtsas engine seems to be stuck in neutral on air bags 
said joan claybrook head of public citizen she said the national 
highway traffic safety administration which she once headed needs 
to promote air bags and closely monitor air bag use to perfect the 
several systems that are being installed in new cars 
ms claybrook said the agency should conduct its crash tests at 
higher speeds and upgrade its standards to mandate air bags for 
small vans as well as cars 
we are dumbfounded and mystified by her criticism said 
nhtsa spokesman barry mccahill 
he said the agency has made the promotion of all types of 
occupant protection its number one priority 
mccahill said the agencys decision to allow manufacturers the 
option of installing air bags on the drivers side in combination 
with automatic belts on the passenger side initially has 
accelerated the program eventually passengerside air bags will 
also be required he said 
its truly good to be here literally said denise rusk of 
kilmarnock va who said she could not remember what happened 
after a ford station wagon crossed into her lane on sept 22 1988 
and smashed headon into her car both vehicles were going 55 mph 
putting the force of the impact at 110 mph 
showing no sign of her injuries mrs rusk said she suffered 36 
broken bones but the air bag prevented her from slamming into the 
steering wheel and dashboard of her new chrysler lebaron 
convertible the driver of the other car was killed 
everything around the air bag seemed to be broken she said 
mrs rusk said she planned to buy another lebaron convertible 
with an airbag 
the auto safety groups gave chrysler corp the highest score on 
its air bag report card of the 12 major manufacturers selling 
cars in the united states followed by mercedes ford and volvo 
tied for third place 
all other automakers failed said clarence ditlow of the 
center for auto safety general motors ranked 5th 
manufacturers ranking at the bottom in order after gm were 
toyota volkswagen mazda nissan honda hyundai and subaru 
gm president robert c stempel said in a statement that the 
company expects to be the largest producer of cars with air bags by 
1994 with plans for more driversside air bags in 1991 and 
passengerside bags in some 1992 models 
gm has taken great care in designing its air bag system 
stempel said as a result we believe our system supplies 
superior supplemental protection for our customers he cautioned 
along with the safety groups that lapshoulder belts always should 
be used even in cars with air bags 
the groups said the rankings were based on the number of 1990 
models equipped with the safety devices as standard equipment 
plans for future installation of air bags protection devices used 
in all seating positions of cars information provided to dealers 
and the contents of company ads 
ditlow said two honda dealers told consumer surveyors that air

stunning piece of misinformation

the white house hinted broadly tuesday that 
us military force might be used to assist americans trapped in a 
hotel seized by by leftist guerrillas in el salvador president 
bush said it was a tough situation 
the president believes very strongly in our responsibility to 
protect american citizens white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said 
four us military advisers were among the americans and other 
foreigners that the rebels said they captured at a luxury hotel 
in northern san salvador however there was some doubt about the 
guerrillas claims 
at least six armed military men believed to be the us 
advisers were seen by an associated press reporter barricaded on 
the fourth floor of the hotel they were brandishing m16 rifles 
guerrillas and an unknown number of guests were on the fifth 
floor and guerrillas on the third floor 
one of the americans told reporters in the hotel that he and his 
companions were not hostages but could not leave were here 
because we feel we cant leave safely he said one of the 
military men said they did not fire at the rebels because they were 
not shot at 
fitzwater refused to say what steps were being considered but 
added we are making plans as necessary and we feel we have a 
very specific responsibility in this area he said no options 
including military ones were being ruled out 
its a tough situation there bush told congressional 
leaders summoned to the white house to discuss his summit next week 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
afterward rep henry hyde rill said if diplomatic notes 
and representations wont get them free then we must do what we 
must do that would include in my book military action but im 
just speaking for myself he said bush did not discuss military 
options 
the state department issued a warning to us citizens not to 
travel to el salvador and urged americans already there to register 
with the us embassy 
a military source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
pentagon was making preparations to send intelligence and 
tactical assistance to el salvador he declined to elaborate on 
the number of men the equipment they would carry or from where 
they would travel 
he later said special operation forces were put on a heightened 
alert 
although always on alert for this type of situation their 
status has been raised he said 
the source said any involvement of us military personnel 
depended on a request for assistance from salvadoran president 
alfredo cristiani followed by the final goahead from bush 
comparing the holding of the four military advisers to the 
murder of marine lt col william higgins in lebanon he said 
were not going to get another bloody eye not this time not 
again 
the source said military strategists did not rule out direct 
us intervention but said they would rather see salvadoran troops 
acting on the advice of us advisers 
as recently as monday bush reaffirmed his administrations 
strong support for the rightwing government of president alfredo 
cristiani against the guerrillas the united states has provided 
about 35 billion in the past 10 years to oppose the insurgency 
with weapons and other american support 
bush was briefed several times during the day on san salvador by 
top military and foreign policy advisers 
fitzwater also said a group of officials from the pentagon cia 
state department and national security council met in the white 
house situation room to monitor events the panel known as the 
deputies committee was formed to improve coordination in the 
aftermath of the abortive coup in panama 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said no 
negotiations were under consideration with the rebels whom she 
called terrorists pure and simple 
she said about a dozen of the rebels deliberately targeting 
civilians had entered the el salvador sheraton hotel shortly 
before dawn they were later reinforced by up to 150 guerrillas 
some of them set up as snipers in the area ms tutwiler said 
although the hotel is called the sheraton the usbased hotel 
chain said it sold its interest several years ago 
mrs tutwiler said the salvadoran army had surrounded the hotel 
she described the situation as very fluid and dangerous and in 
an ambiguous warning to the rebels declared we will not 
speculate on the steps the united states and the salvadoran 
government might take 
fitzwater told reporters at the white house that the rebels had 
embarked on a despicable road of violence by threatening 
citizens americans and innocent citizens of all nations who may be 
in their path 
the united states stands committed to the people and the 
government of el salvador the spokesman said 
similarly fitzwater said the president believes very 
strongly in our responsibility to protect american citizens but we 
cannot speculate on steps the us or the salvadoran government 
might be undertaking or considering at this time 
these marxist guerrillas have shown their true colors 
fitzwater said they are attacking defenseless citizens in a 
civilian hotel and using the surrounding neighborhood of 
defenseless salvadoran citizens as a shield against the government 
forces 
the rebels launched an offensive a little more than a week ago 
occupying poor and workingclass neighborhoods in the vicinity of 
the capital there were indications on monday that their offensive 
had subsided under pressure of strong air and ground attacks by 
government forces however the seizure of the sheraton indicated a 
new show of strength by the guerrillas

states 
in addition the department will establish procedures to ensure 
that its cooperative defense programs are in compliance with 
missile technology control regime a 10nation agreement among 
western nations to curb the spread of dangerous missiles

domestic it gives us more leverage well have the authority now

president nicolae ceausescu suggests 
the soviet union give up territory gained through a pact with nazi 
germany that would include moldavia part of which josef stalin 
took from romania 
in comments from a speech to the 14th romanian communist party 
congress published tuesday ceausescu said the nonaggression pact 
of 1939 in which stalin and adolf hitler divided eastern europe 
into spheres of influence should be canceled 
among countries and territories assigned to the soviet union 
were the baltic republics estonia latvia and lithuania and 
bessarabia romanian until 1940 and now part of soviet moldavia 
the soviet union also absorbed the baltic states in 1940 
ceausecu a communist autocrat in his own country and a maverick 
in the soviet bloc told the party congress 
first of all a clear unequivocal stand of condemnation and 
cancellation must be taken on all the accords concluded with 
hitlers germany to eliminate all the consequences of those 
accords and dictates 
he did not go into detail but his allusion to hitlerstalin 
pact was clear ceausescus suggestion comes at a time of political 
and ethnic turmoil in many parts of the soviet union including 
moldavia and the baltic republics 
in the speech delivered monday to the opening session of the 
congress the romanian leader also rejected political and economic 
liberalization of the kind sweeping through the soviet bloc 
his contempt for reform was contained in a prepared text of the 
speech which lasted more than five hours he departed from the 
text to comment on the 1939 treaty 
romanias official media published their first reports of unrest 
in the moldavia where 60 percent of the people are ethnic 
romanians 
scinteia the communist party daily carried a dispatch tuesday 
from the official soviet news agency tass that described a 
crackdown on ethnic romanian demonstrators in the city of kishinve 
several days earlier 
a western diplomat said privately romania was showing increased 
interest recently in its former territory which officials still 
call bessarabia 
although regaining the territory may be part of his vision 
the diplomat said ceausescus primary purpose probably was to 
demonstrate independence of moscow 
romanian officials speaking anonymously for fear of 
retribution agreed that ceausescu appeared to be making more of a 
political statement than a demand for the return of lost territory

peace talks between the nicaraguan government 
and the contra rebels were suspended tuesday night after the two 
sides were unable to agree on terms for a ceasefire 
nicaraguan vice foreign minister victor hugo tinoco told 
reporters his government plans to call for an emergency meeting of 
central american presidents to decide on next steps 
the chief contra negotiator col enrique bermudez expressed 
regret over the breakdown and he blamed the sandinista negotiators 
he said the rebel side had made flexible proposals and was 
willing to continue the talks 
the talks collapsed when the contras refused a sandinista demand 
that they agree to a partial withdrawal of their forces to base 
camps in honduras said paul reichler an american member of the 
sandinista negotiating team 
the contras refused to go beyond a promise not to infiltrate any 
more forces from the units based in honduras 
tinoco said the contra refusal to withdraw troops to honduras 
shows they are not interested in peace he also criticized the 
state department for doing absolutely nothing to facilitate an 
agreement 
mediators from the organization of american states and the 
united nations issued a statement saying they will remain in 
contact with both sides for the purpose of reconvening the 
discussions at the earliest date 
hours earlier the sandinistas unveiled a comprehensive 
ceasefire proposal that omitted a previous demand for the 
withdrawal of all contra forces from nicaragua and called instead 
for a pullback of 2300 insurgents 
the new proposal outlined by tinoco at a news conference would 
establish corridors through which the retreating contras would 
return safely to base camps in honduras 
the process would be verified by 620 united nations peacekeepers 
who are scheduled to take up duties in central america shortly 
under the proposal both sides would agree to cease all military 
operations inside nicaragua until dec 31 
if the contras do not accept the proposal they have no 
interest in a ceasefire tinoco told reporters at the nicaraguan 
embassy 
the un peacekeepers will be comprised of west germans 
spaniards and canadians in addition to monitoring the ceasefire 
they also are entrusted with ensuring that the territory of one 
central american county is not used to launch subversive activities 
in another 
the negotiations began on nov 9 and were aimed at restoring the 
ceasefire that president daniel ortega suspended eight days 
earlier after alleging that the rebels had engaged in widespread 
terrorist activities 
as of monday the negotiators had met eight times with 
mediators from the organization of american states and the united 
nations prodding the two sides toward agreement 
the contras have called for a ceasefire in place as an initial 
step aimed at an overall accommodation between the two sides 
culminating in the peaceful rebel reintegration in nicaraguan 
society national elections are set for feb 25 
tinoco said the 2300 contras being asked to leave under the 
sandinista proposal represent the number of rebels who have 
infiltrated into nicaragua from the honduran base camps in recent 
weeks 
the contras maintain that there has been no increase only a 
rotation of forces but the state department has said there has 
been a major infiltration of contras since early october raising 
the total number inside nicaragua to about 5000 
tinoco indicated that the proposal was about as far as the 
sandinistas could go in efforts to meet the rebels half way he 
noted that the government initially had demanded a complete 
demobilization of the contras as the price for a ceasefire but 
dropped that provision last week 
the five central american presidents called last august for the 
voluntary demobilization of the contras by dec 5 since that date 
is no longer feasible the sandinista plan requests the five 
presidents to set dec 31 as the new target date

businessman albert hakim pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor and one of his corporations used to divert arms sale 
profits pleaded guilty to a felony tuesday in the irancontra 
scandal 
the iranianborn hakim admitted that he had helped supplement 
the salary of exwhite house aide oliver north by paying for a 
security fence at norths home with funds from the enterprise 
the complex of foreign companies hakim operated in the irancontra 
scandal 
lake resources inc a swiss company used as a conduit for iran 
arms sale money and aid to the nicaraguan contras pleaded guilty 
to theft of government property a felony carrying a maximum 
penalty of up to 500000 
hakim who faces sentencing feb 1 could face up to a year in 
jail and a 100000 fine it is illegal to supplement the salaries 
of government employees 
us district court judge gerhard gesell initially rejected the 
proposed plea agreement calling it a charade and complaining 
that the us government wasnt being given an opportunity to 
recover the diverted money 
but after meeting with prosecutors and defense attorneys gesell 
returned to the courtroom and accepted the pleas which were 
accompanied by a plea agreement slightly altered at his request 
outside the courtroom associate independent counsel stuart 
abrams said the plea agreement with lake resources now a paper 
company with no assets does not keep the government from seeking 
restitution 
some 38 million from the administrations secret arms sales to 
iran was funneled to the rebel force during a congressional ban on 
us military aid to the contras 
about 8 million from the maze of companies operated by hakim 
and his business partner richard secord remain frozen in swiss bank 
accounts which the two men formerly controlled the funds came from 
thirdcountry contributions to the contras private fundraising 
efforts in the united states and the secret arms sales 
the plea agreement filed with the court by the government says 
that from late 1985 to november 1986 hakim his business partner 
richard secord north and national security adviser john poindexter 
used their influence to generate and divert approxmiately 162 
million to enterprise bank accounts 
hakim agreed to cooperate with the investigation by independent 
counsel lawrence walsh to testify at pending trials and to supply 
financial records and other documents 
in norths case the 13000 security fence and other equipment 
constituted an illegal gratuity and his acceptance of it was one of 
the three felony counts for which north was convicted 
hakim answering gesells question what was it that north 
got said the security fence was installed for the protection of 
col north from terrorist attacks a terrorist organization 
run by abu nidal had threatened to kill north acording to 
congressional testimony 
asked how he concealed the gift hakim said by maintaining 
bank accounts in a secret manner 
hakims other answers were brief yes your honor or no 
your honor responses 
in another irancontra development former president reagans 
attorneys were granted a twoweek delay by us district judge 
harold h greene for consideration of a court challenge to a 
subpoena asking reagan to produce documents and testify at the 
trial of his former national security adviser john m poindexter 
who was norths boss 
reagans attorneys said the subpoena raises novel and complex 
constitutional issues about the power of courts over a former 
chief executive 
we disagree with gesells characterization of the agreement 
as a charade said abrams 
he said negotiations were under way on an unspecified civil 
matter which could affect restitution to the us government 
abrams said gesell will be able to conduct a hearing on 
restitution and whether lake resources transferred funds to 
other corporations so that someone else could be liable for 
returning the money to the united states 
hakim got rid of his assets to keep anybody from finding 
them complained gesell the judge said i am not anxious to 
conduct a trial to determine what happened to the money and said 
the plea agreement should answer the questions of who diverted 
the money who is responsible 
i am not getting an admission here of anything except 100 
bucks gesell said in regard to the corporate guilty plea 
the plea agreement specifies that lake resources is charged with 
converting to its own use property of the united states worth more 
than 100 
before meeting privately with prosecutors and defense attorneys 
gesell said in court that you cant fancydance through the 
paragraphs 
if there is a fancy dance he said there is no point in 
pleading 
the judge called the proposed agreement simply public 
relations efforts that dont have any place in a court 
at gesells request two paragraphs were dropped from the 
agreement concerning hakims guilty plea they would have preserved 
hakims rights to appeal an adverse decision by gesell on a motion 
that has been pending since last june

the house gave about 100 soviet soldiers a 
standing ovation tuesday and a congressional tape of upcoming 
events played show tunes as congress plunged through what it hoped 
was its last day of business for the year 
with enough unresolved business to last until after midnight 
or even next week members of congress were in jovial spirits as 
they began the day after a late night session monday 
maybe its because theyre getting a raise said a staff 
member 
the house went into session at 9 am an hour earlier than 
normal causing some observers to ask why the lawmakers were 
pushing themselves so hard 
are you kidding responded rep joe moakley dmass 
chairman of the rules committee give these guys a good nights 
sleep and a strong wind at their back and well be here until 
christmas 
the senate slept in with no floor business until noon 
not many house members showed up for opening formalities but 
those who did were studied carefully from the gallery by an 
impressive contingent of soviet soldiers resplendent in their 
olive and red uniforms 
a scene that couldnt have been imagined two years ago unfolded 
as the 12 or so house members recited the pledge of allegiance and 
then turned and applauded the soldiers 
the soviets members of a military choral group on tour in the 
united states clapped back 
fortyfive years ago our countries were together against 
hitler reminded one of the soldiers later as reps steny hoyer 
dmd and sonny montgomery dmiss gave the group a guided tour 
of the capitol 
its an exciting time in which we live hoyer said a 
hopeful time for our generation and generations to come in terms of 
deescalating the tension that has existed between the two greatest 
military powers of the globe not only to our benefit but to the 
benefit of the world 
a few hours later an encounter of quite a different nature 
occurred between several people in the senate gallery and the 
lawmakers below 
demonstrators opposed to the us policy in el salvador shouted 
slogans from the viewing seats and were dragged from the chamber by 
capitol police 
the senate responded by temporarily closing the gallery to 
visitors 
three of the protesters were charged with disrupting congress 
and demonstrating within the capitol each charge is punishable by 
a maximum fine of 500 and or six months in jail 
the long legislative day required action by both houses on much 
of the same legislation including the complicated deficit 
reduction package 
the senate stayed in session taking quorum calls when it 
had no business to handle but the house recessed periodically 
through the day while waiting to vote on legislation 
at lunch the house dining room treated members and visitors to 
a turkey buffet with all the thanksgiving trimmings 
during the morning cspan which broadcasts congress used the 
channel that usually carries the senate to show the british 
parliament in action 
that prompted house speaker thomas s foley dwash to quip to 
reporters i know youre going to think theyre much more 
interesting and much more witty and much more stimulating in every 
way 
foley said he entertained the speaker of the house of commons 
about a month ago who asked him how many speakers had preceded him 
foley replied he was the 49th speaker of the house 
he said he was the 634th they generally date the speakership 
from 1377 foley said and i said well thats what we call a 
putdown in the united states mr speaker and he said well 
eight of them were beheaded two of them on the same day 
congressional staffers eager to get their bosses out of town 
were much gentler in their approach 
show tunes such as the impossible dream one day more 
and tonight were programmed into the house republican cloakroom 
legislative tape of upcoming events 
the democrats staff members said they were keeping their jokes 
inside the cloakroom

president bush met tuesday with west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who gave him a piece of 
the berlin wall 
i will treasure this bush told genscher 
genscher said the gray block represented the thanks of the 
german people to the american people for their faithfulness 
support and steadfastness in bad and good times that helped lead 
to the opening of the wall 
the talks between bush and genscher focused on the presidents 
dec 23 meeting with soviet president mikhail gorbachev in the 
mediterranean sea off malta said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
bush indicated they would be talking about eastern europe and 
other matters of general interest fitzwater said 
genscher said after the meeting that he and bush were in 
complete agreement about the approach to eastern europe 
it is important that the west gives the soviet union and its 
allies a clear and unambiguous sign that we are aware that the 
reform process will cause problems even of crisis proportions 
the west he said is interested that the reforms proceed in a 
stable framework and has no intention of trying to take advantage 
of the situation 
we will for that reason do nothing that will endanger or 
disturb this reform process from outside gencher said we will 
do everything we can to guarantee stability 
genscher dismissed reports that west german officials had said 
that the changes in eastern europe had made it impossible to deploy 
a new generation of shortrange us nuclear missiles in germany as 
the united states has proposed 
this is a theme to be discussed in 92 as was agreed in the 
nato communique genscher told reporters 
east germany genscher said is on the way really to becoming 
a democratic republic if free elections are held next year as 
proposed 
its the result of a very clear policy of the west advocating 
freedom and democracy all over the europe 
after his 15minute session with bush genscher met with 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and secretary of state 
james a baker iii 
later genscher stressed that there should be no fear of 
possible reunification of east and west germany 
it is no cause for anyone to worry if germans opt for freedom 
and democracy and if all germans live in freedom and democracy but 
it is an enrichment for the whole of europe he said 
we want no separate german way but we want western europe and 
eastern europe get closer and closer together and thereby bring the 
germans closer together

robin hud the woman who admitted stealing 
millions of dollars from the government and giving some of it to 
the poor was indicted tuesday in one of the most prominent cases 
of the housing and urban development scandal 
marilyn louise harrell was charged with embezzling 56 million 
from hud two counts of making false statements to the federal 
government and one count of making false statements in connection 
with a loan application 
the indictment sends a firm message to those who think its 
business as usual when dealing with hud we have zero tolerance 
for theft regardless of the reason or how it is done hud 
secretary jack kemp said in a statement issued before a news 
conference tuesday afternoon 
she really gives charity a bad name kemp said later 
he said stricter standards for more than 100 escrow agents who 
are empowered to sell hud property for the government are now 
required including bonding and certification 
this case represents perhaps the largest single theft of 
government funds ever charged against an individual attorney 
general dick thornburgh said 
it is the fourth indictment this year involving the theft of 
more than 1 million from hud although it may not be the largest 
by the time the government investigation is concluded thornburgh 
said 
despite testimony before a congressional committee that she gave 
stolen hud money to the needy the governments eightmonth probe 
found that the single largest charity by far was herself said 
breckinridge l willcox us attorney for maryland 
government prosecutors declined to say how much of the money 
their probe found had been given to charity 
according to willcox about 625000 of the embezzled funds have 
been recovered by seizing harrells home and automobiles im not 
sure theres a whole lot left he said 
evidence presented to a federal grand jury in baltimore 
allegedly showed that harrell who was entrusted with hud funds as 
a private escrow agent misused government money on several 
occasions hud and justice department sources said monday 
attempts to reach harrells attorney federal public defender 
anthony gallagher were not successful a receptionist at his 
office said gallagher was in court on an unrelated matter 
harrells testimony to congress was among the most dramatic 
during six months of hearings into allegations of fraud 
mismanagement and political favoritism at hud during the reagan 
administration 
a discrepancy between the 55 million harrell testified about 
and the 56 million mentioned in the indictment could not 
immediately be resolved 
two weeks after she testified hud seized her house in 
washingtons maryland suburbs as well as several other properties 
she said she purchased with hud money to help charities and 
homeless families 
i in no way justify what i have done as being anything less 
than sin harrell who was dubbed robin hud by federal 
investigators testified before a house subcommittee in june i 
do regardless of where my life takes me from here intend to repay 
in full all monies taken 
harrell said she was easily able to withhold money from hud 
several top officials in huds washington field office to which 
she reported were fired because of the harrell case and other 
alleged mismanagement 
harrell is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping 
more than 10 million they were supposed to transfer to hud 
efforts to indict them and seek restitution are at various stages 
harrell is the second escrow agent to be indicted 
when she lost her house in late june harrell 46 said she was 
moving in with her mother in the maryland suburb of fort 
washington attempts to reach her were unsuccessful the mothers 
telephone number is unlisted 
the indictment charges harrell with embezzling about 56 
million belonging to hud between november 1985 and december 1988 
giving false explanations to hud for her delay in remitting 
department funds and lying about her net worth in an application 
to the second federal savings bank for a 150000 loan 
several members of the house subcommittee have been critical of 
the justice department accusing it of not aggressively pursuing 
hudrelated crimes 
the departments statement announcing the harrell indictment 
indirectly responded to such criticism noting that the government 
had obtained 140 hudrelated convictions nationwide in fiscal 1989 
and nearly 600 in the last four years 
most of those cases have involved individuals charged with 
defrauding hud loan programs congressional critics have said 
thornburgh has shown little zeal for investigating former top 
agency officials and prominent republicans who participated in hud 
programs found to have been tainted by political influence 
thornburgh has rejected the criticism as partisan sniping

the georgia supreme court ruled tuesday that a 
33yearold quadriplegic has a constitutional right to withdraw 
from the breathing apparatus that has kept him alive for four years 
but the court declined to use the case to set nonjudicial 
guidelines for future cases suggesting that is a task for the 
legislature 
the court said in a unanimous opinion that larry mcafees right 
to discontinue the treatment falls under privacy rights guaranteed 
by the state and federal constitutions 
those rights outweigh whatever interests the state has in 
preserving life the ruling said 
mcafee suffered a severe spinal cord injury in a 1985 motorcycle 
accident which left him a quadriplegic he is incapable of 
spontaneous respiration and is dependent upon a ventilator to 
breathe 
mcafee living in an alabaster ala nursing home has said he 
plans to return to georgia sometime after the holiday season to 
shut off his ventilator 
he is most gratified that the highest court in georgia has 
affirmed his right to decide his own destiny said mcafees 
attorney randall davis 
he is currently reviewing several options which have been 
offered to him but he does not necessarily believe that he will 
change his mind as to the removal of his life support system 
in september mcafee won a superior court judges permission to 
turn off the ventilator himself by activating a timer but the 
judge instructed the state to appeal the decision in order to 
establish nonjudicial procedures to guide future cases 
the supreme court which heard arguments in the case only a week 
ago declined to go that far 
it noted the existence of a living will act in georgia which 
allows competent adults to execute documents directing physicians 
not to use extraordinary procedures to keep them alive if their 
conditions become terminal 
but the court said mcafees case doesnt fit those conditions 
the legislature might well choose to legislate in this area to 
provide appropriate nonjudicial procedures for competent adult 
patients who do not have terminal conditions but who wish to 
exercise their rights to refuse medical treatment by the withdrawal 
of lifesustaining procedures the court held 
the supreme court agreed with the trial judge that mcafee has a 
right to a sedative to relieve the pain when the ventilator is 
disconnected 
state attorney general michael bowers said he would have liked 
the court to set guidelines but said im pleased they affirmed 
the trial courts order im very pleased for mcafee

under pressure by thousands of 
demonstrators for a fifth day czechoslovakias premier told 
opposition leaders tuesday he favored a role for noncommunists in 
the government 
dissidents including banned playwright vaclav havel addressed 
a crowd of 150000 people jamming wenceslas square without police 
interference an actor later called for the resignations of 
communist party leaders and demonstrators chanted punish 
punish punish 
the comments by premier ladislav adamec relayed by participants 
in the meeting were a sharp break with current government policy 
it was not clear what significance his statements would have 
because the head of government traditionally has far less power 
than the communist party leader 
party chief milos jakes in a television appearance tuesday 
night accused the demonstrators of trying to disrupt the 
socialist system and unleash emotion and passions with 
unforeseeable consequences 
although he said he welcomed a dialogue with all who stand for 
socialism even though they criticize abuses he maintained a hard 
line denouncing organizers of the demonstrations and saying the 
cause of the working people and socialism is at stake 
a jakes ally prague communist party boss miroslav stepan said 
in a statement that the opposition was whipping up hysteria 
we are calling on the workers of prague the members of the 
peoples militia police to stand firmly said the statement 
issued by the prague party leadership 
adamec told a delegation that included opposition leaders he was 
in favor of a different concept of the leading role of the 
party and favored having noncommunists in the government 
according to two members of the group journalist michael horacek 
and composer michael kocab adamecs statement about noncommunists 
in the government was not carried by the ctk state news agency 
adamec also promised the government would not impose martial 
law and he suggested dissidents no longer be persecuted 
the opposition members quoted him as saying the government would 
not rule out talking with charter 77 eastern europes oldest human 
rights group which authorities previously refused to negotiate 
with 
however adamec said protests must stop and socialism must 
remain intact 
czechoslovakias hardline leaders have kept a tight rein on 
society and rejected the reforms transforming other east bloc 
societies 
the leadership appears to be softening however in the face of 
its biggest government crisis since the 1968 sovietled invasion 
that snuffed out the prague spring reform period the extent of 
public discontent was underlined by the huge crowds demonstrating 
tuesday and on monday when 200000 marched in the largest 
demonstration ever 
state tv also reported protesters filled the streets of 
bratislava but it did not give a crowd estimate at least 10000 
marched there monday 
on tuesday speakers addressed the crowd in wenceslas square 
from the balcony of a staterun newspaper svobodne slovo which 
has criticized the government 
the rev vaclav maly a dissident read a message from 
czechoslovak cardinal frantisek tomasek we cannot wait any 
longer we need a democratic government at this decisive moment 
no one must stand aside 
the crowd later dispersed still cryingfreedom freedom 
witnesses said police and armored vehicles surrounded the main 
offices of the federal government but they did not interfere 
also tuesday ctk reported the general prosecutor of the czech 
republic had opened an investigation into the actions of security 
forces who clubbed and fired tear gas at demonstrators friday 
injuring scores dissidents said one student was killed by police 
in the protest but the government denied it 
czechoslovak media devoted unusual coverage to mondays 
demonstration and employees of state tv voted to provide time on 
news broadcasts for opposition opinion a source said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the most important 
exponent of reform in the east bloc expressed strong support 
tuesday for the changes sweeping eastern europe including 
czechoslovakia 
i think the change is very important and the importance of 
the change will be that it will create a better society a more 
open society a more democratic society gorbachev said in moscow 
in the meeting with opposition leaders adamec said he favored 
having in the federal government people with no membership in a 
political party and members of other political parties and 
especially young people horacek said 
horacek and kocab belong to an organization of intellectuals 
called most which means bridge it promotes dialogue between 
authorities and the opposition 
adamec also said the government was open to talks and added 
we do not exclude anybody from the dialogue including charter 
77 
we must free ourselves from the wrongdoings of the past he 
was quoted as saying 
in its report ctk also quoted adamec as saying we shall 
protect socialism there can be no discussion about this he said 
political changes were necessary but a dialogue about many 
serious problems cannot be sensibly conducted in the street 
in addition to the representatives of most the 10member 
delegation included four members of the newly formed civic forum 
umbrella opposition group as well as members of official communist 
organizations 
havel walked with delegation members to the meeting but did not 
take part officials said 
thousands of students were on strike in prague and other cities 
at the damu acting school in prague a center of the strike 
movement students displayed six letters from factories in prague 
supporting their demands for more democracy and an end to police 
brutality so far workers have not been extensively involved in 
the antigovernment protests 
there were other signs of protest in the capital including 
posters condemning police brutality on shop windows and office 
buildings

a snipers view of elm street beckons the 
thousands of sightseers trekking to dealey plaza wednesday to mark 
the 26th anniversary of president john f kennedys death 
the sixth floor exhibit a tribute to kennedys life and a 
shrine for his death opened in february amid tears and prayers 
its open for the first time on an assassination anniversary 
until presidents day of this year the public could not enter 
the sixth floor of the old school book depository in downtown 
dallas where its believed lee harvey oswald fired the shots that 
killed kennedy 
about 15000 visited on the opening and about 1000 people 
visit the building every day officials say 
the creation of an exhibit or major memorial had been delayed 
in part by fears that it would only extend any infamy attached to 
the city by kennedys death 
it was a courageous thing for dallasites to do said 
lyndalyn adams chairwoman of the dallas county historical 
foundation which led the drive to open the sixth floor this 
city had to go back to a time when dallas meant assassination 
for years sightseers found little to mark the site of kennedys 
fatal motorcade through downtown dallas 
dallas lacked anything explaining kennedys death in its 
historic context said bob hays sixth floor director 
the city has been linked with the assassination by the public 
throughout the world hays said the city needed to address it 
and this is what we have done 
sen edward kennedy the presidents brother opposed the 
exhibit saying the family would prefer the public to remember the 
presidents life rather than his death 
mrs adams hopes public approval of the exhibit may change his 
mind she has sent him pages of the memory book signed by 
visitors 
he did not return several calls to his washington office from 
the associated press 
the cost of a visit to the sixth floor is 4 to 6 with 
proceeds going to the county visitors walk through a maze of 
interpretive panels with more than 400 photographs a narrative 
encompasses kennedys life and death 
films include footage of kennedys motorcade rolling through 
dealey plaza and nbcs live broadcast of jack ruby fatally shooting 
oswald in the basement of the dallas police department 
through glass panels visitors can see where investigators say 
oswald perched on boxes ate his lunch while waiting for the 
motorcade and fired his rifle out a corner window on nov 22 1963 
the exhibit mentions the controversies over the accuracy of the 
warren commissions report on the assassination and whether oswald 
may have had conspirators 
conspiracy theories are addressed more indepth at the jfk 
assassination information center a threeroom privately run 
exhibit that opened in august a few blocks away 
the center is directed by j gary shaw whose 1976 book 
coverup suggested the use of a second weapon and a government 
coverup of the assassination the center supplements the sixth 
floor shaw said 
people come to dallas and want to see these spots shaw 
said their lives were changed by what happened here

two federal loans that helped finance a strip 
club across the river from ottawa canadas federal capital were a 
mistake that wont be repeated officials said tuesday 
an error was made harvie andre minister of regional 
industrial expansion said in the house of commons procedures 
are being amended to insure this doesnt happen again 
the federal business development bank a government agency made 
two loans totaling 899000 1 million canadian to two 
businessmen in hull quebec over 18 months to buy land and a 
building for the bar called le lido 
its against the banks policy to finance clubs of that 
kind spokesman ken cavanagh said by telephone from bank 
headquarters in montreal it was an error made at the local 
level 
a report monday by radiocanada television the frenchlanguage 
service of the canadian broadcasting corp disclosed the loans to 
andre frechette and frank bentivoglio it said they totaled 11 
million but cavanagh said that was too high and provided the lower 
figure 
hull on the quebec side of the ottawa river is the site of 
many office buildings in the national capital district le lido is 
near the promenade du portage one of the largest office complexes 
andre said the federal agencys officers in hull did not tell 
superiors in montreal what the loans were buying 
during the commons debate tuesday in ottawa donald boudria of 
the opposition liberal party asked havent we had enough of this 
nonsense why doesnt the government clean up its act once and for 
all 
frechette operates le lido and employs about 20 young women to 
dance he said in an interview with radiocanada that most 
afternoon customers were government employees many of high rank 
who took cigarette breaks at the club because smoking was 
prohibited in government buildings 
the federal business development banks purpose is to make loans 
and provide management counseling to small and mediumsized 
businesses 
cavanagh said helping finance bars or discotheques would not be 
against bank policy if they were not of an erotic nature 
we intend to tighten up the policy and make it clearer he 
said senior officials of the bank are going to be looking into 
the entire process

two seattle union activists were murdered in 1981 
because a vicious thug didnt get his way in a union dispute 
not because the martiallaw government of former philippines 
president ferdinand marcos had marked them for death a defense 
attorney said tuesday 
the murders of silme domingo and gene viernes at the alaska 
cannery workers union offices resulted from a dispute over gambling 
and work assignments in alaskan fish canneries richard hibey told 
a federal court 
hibey is the washington dc attorney for the estate of marcos 
and for marcos widow imelda they are among the defendants in a 
30 million civil lawsuit filed september 1982 that claims the 
marcos government ordered the seattle killings because of domingo 
and viernes antimarcos agitation 
the trial began monday and is expected to last three to five 
weeks 
friends and relatives of the dead men hope to prove before us 
district judge barbara rothstein that domingo and viernes were 
targeted by a philippines intelligence network that kept track of 
antimarcos dissidents in this country 
hibey called the murders an undeniable terrible fact but 
added nothing was going on in seattle that had anything to do 
with filipino politics that could ever rise to the level to 
cause the deaths of mr domingo and mr viernes 
no matter how many witnesses no matter how many selfstyled 
experts are called to testify about the politics of the 
philippines there will be no evidence of any link any relation 
any connection between what these politics were and the deaths of 
mr domingo and mr viernes hibey said 
a jury of eight including two alternates is hearing the case 
against the marcoses rothstein will judge liability of the other 
defendants 
at the original criminal trial at which three men were 
convicted and given life prison sentences prosecutors said the 
murders occurred because domingo and viernes were union reformers 
working to eliminate gambling in the canneries 
that hibey said is the accurate motive in the case 
six days before the 1981 murders hibey said viernes argued 
with one of those convicted fortunato dictado about dispatching 
gang members to work in the canneries 
evidence will show that dictado muttered im going to get rid 
of you hibey said 
the motive hibey said was simply the demands of a vicious 
thug whose demands were not met when he wanted them to be met by 
viernes domingo died hibey said because he happened to be 
there 
this was a union local that had suffered from the ravages 
of bribes and kickbacks in order to get jobs where violence 
and thuggery were the order of the day he said 
on monday jeff robinson an attorney for the plaintiffs argued 
that evidence will show that the uniondispute motive was only a 
cover for the men being marked for death by marcos intelligence 
network 
jailing and killing dissidents or causing them to disappear were 
weapons in marcos antiopponent arsenal before his government was 
toppled in 1986 robinson said

the state prison system must accept inmates 
who have been sentenced to state prison but are being held in local 
jails because of prison overcrowding a judge ruled tuesday 
state district judge joe hart also said the state must pay the 
counties for housing and feeding the inmates 
numerous counties have complained that they are being forced to 
house inmates who cant immediately enter state prisons because of 
a federal court ordering limiting inmate population 
twelve counties sued the state in an effort to force the 
transfer of an estimated 6000 felons from their jails statewide 
an estimated 12000 inmates have been sentenced to state prison but 
are being held in local jails because the prison system has delayed 
accepting them 
attorney general jim mattox said the state would appeal 
there is just not enough room in the inn mattox said we 
cant violate the federal court order and take additional prisoners 
into the department of corrections 
hart did not specify how much the texas department of 
corrections should pay the counties for housing the state prisoners 
ann clark snell representing 11 counties in the lawsuit said 
the counties want compensation because the state neglected its 
duty she said each inmate costs the state 40 a day to maintain 
at that rate the cost for 6000 inmates in the 12 counties 
could be more than 87 million a year 
mattox urged gov bill clements to allow the current special 
legislative session to consider payments to counties clements had 
no immediate comment on the ruling or mattoxs suggestion 
hart said there are many measures that the state could use to 
take the prisoners off the counties hands 
such other methods include contracting with private vendors 
the federal government and local government and greater use of 
the prison management act furloughs and good time he wrote

a former spokeswoman for american continental 
corp says company chairman charles keating jr personally directed 
preparation of a press release saying the sale of the companys 
troubled lincoln savings and loan was imminent when it really 
wasnt 
patricia johnson a former american continental public relations 
executive said tuesday she wrote the release regarding the 
proposed sale of the subsidiary at keatings direction 
he was concerned about the publicity and the stock was 
falling and he asked me for advice ms johnson told the 
associated press 
lincoln savings in irvine calif was taken over by federal 
regulators last april its failure which could end up costing 
taxpayers as much as 2 billion and keating have been the subject 
of congressional hearings and a securities and exchange commission 
investigation 
the feb 9 press release ms johnson discussed was distributed 
the day after american continentals stock fell 87 cents to 550 
a share market observers blamed the slide on rumors that lincoln 
savings proposed ale to a group of california investors had hit 
snags and that american continental was in financial trouble 
following american continentals announcement that the sale of 
lincoln was imminent the stock rose to 625 per share and 
trading volume increased sharply 
the sale didnt take place american continental filed for 
protection under bankruptcy laws on april 14 the day before 
lincoln savings was taken over by the government american 
continental stock now trades for 5 cents a share 
ms johnson told the arizona republic she had recommended that a 
press release about the sale be issued and that keating specified 
that the word imminent had to be used 
he said that he wanted no matter what else i put in the press 
release to make sure i used the word imminent ms johnson told 
the newspaper 
ms johnson said she has a draft of the release that has a 
notation written in the margin by keating 
there was no immediate comment tuesday from american 
continental company officials didnt return phone calls however 
in documents prepared for the securities exchange commission 
american continental officials have said ms johnson was 
responsible for the press releases contents and that the release 
was issued in response to news media inquiries 
i didnt create the news i only disseminated the news ms 
johnson said tuesday i had no reason to believe the information 
he had given me was incorrect 
several individuals familiar with american continentals attempt 
to sell lincoln told the republic the statement about a sale being 
imminent was false 
it was untrue in our judgment said ernest leff one of the 
investors interested in buying the thrift i smiled when i saw 
charlie making his flamboyant statements 
what bothered me was that they lied said william davis 
chief deputy commissioner of the california department of savings 
and loan they knew absolutely dead certain that the sale was not 
imminent 
ms johnson said she has cooperated with government officials 
who contacted her but she said there was no indication if shell 
be called to testify in any proceedings 
ms johnson said keating called her into his office in april and 
told her american continental was dismantling its public relations 
unit which consisted of herself and clerical staff she said she 
didnt receive severance vacation pay or even compensation for the 
day she was told she was dismissed 
a single mother of three ms johnson said she does some 
publicrelations consulting work from her home but has had 
difficulty finding work because of her past with american

the el salvador sheraton hotel 
bristled with guns tuesday salvadoran soldiers with assault rifles 
crouched in the lobby sharpshooters perched on the roof 
armored personnel carriers occupied the parking lot instead of 
the usual luxury sedans and ambulances were parked ominously 
nearby helicopters and warplanes roared overhead 
the stretch of swimming pool and lounge chairs between the main 
building and the vip tower which the guerrillas had taken was 
nomans land 
at least four armed us military advisers were trapped on the 
fourth floor of the tower reports later tuesday indicated 12 us 
green berets were believed among those holed up in the hotel which 
is not now part of the usbased hotel group guerrillas were on 
the floor above along with guests and on the floor below 
a small band of reporters crouched in the entranceway to the 
tower next to the stairwell that the americans covered with their 
m16 assault rifles the american advisers said they were under 
orders not to shoot unless fired upon 
it was a bizarre standoff 
no one wanted to move no one wanted anyone else to move 
neither the guerrillas nor the americans wanted to start shooting 
no one knew if or when the salvadoran troops might try to take the 
tower 
the reporters crawled over to the edge of the stairwell calling 
down to the guerrillas none wanted to be interviewed the 
reporters then called down the hallway to the americans 
no sudden moves it was simple for us let everyone know who you 
are where you are what you want 
one of the americans agreed to talk three reporters were 
allowed around the corner into the hallway 
we would like to leave the soldier said matteroffactly 
he asked the reporters to let the us embassy know they were 
trapped in the hotel and asked too that the salvadoran troops hold 
their fire 
were here because we dont feel we can leave safely he 
said 
the guerrillas and the soldiers had surprised each other in the 
hallway shortly after the predawn rebel attack on the hotel he 
said both sides took up defensive positions 
we were talking to them trying to calm them down he said 
after several hours the guerrillas moved off the fourth floor 
the soldier said his group had not fired on the guerrillas he 
cited the rules of engagement for us military personnel in el 
salvador unless were fired upon we dont fire 
the reporters returned to the entranceway 
suddenly a young guerrilla appeared on the stairwell from above 
he sat there in the soldiers line of fire looking curiously down 
at the reporters smiling as the reporters left he gave a little 
wave 
the neighborhood around the sheraton one of the wealthiest in 
warravaged san salvador was a battleground too 
more than 200 soldiers of the cavalry regiment the national 
polices panther battalion and the armys 1st brigade occupied the 
streets 
private guards at many of the luxurious mansions surrounded by 
barbed wiretopped fences added yet another element of risk to 
those foolish enough to venture out 
few did the streets were virtually deserted except for 
soldiers police and a few journalists waving white flags and 
crying prensa prensa press press 
shots echoed and bullets whistled along the streets throughout 
the day from every direction turning a corner or crossing an 
intersection was something that required serious consideration 
a plane armed with rockets and machine guns made several passes 
over the hotel and fired at least six rockets 
they landed about 200 yards from the sheraton in a ravine 
alongside the hotel 
dozens of poor people fled the community of shacks along the 
ravine 
the rockets blew our roof off said antonio herrera as he 
hustled down the street with his sobbing wife and two little girls 
we were on the floor all afternoon under our beds

president bush on tuesday signed a 34 
billion budget bill for the district of columbia after congress 
stripped from the measure an abortion provision that had provoked 
two vetoes 
the measure for the fiscal year that began last oct 1 
includes the federal governments annual 435 million contribution 
to the district government the rest of the funds are paid by local 
taxpayers but must be appropriated by congress before the dc 
government can spend anything 
bush on monday night vetoed the dc appropriations bill for the 
second time because of abortion provisions that would not have 
restricted the use of the taxpayerpaid money while limiting 
federal medicaid funds to abortions to save the life of the mother 
until last year the district had been funding 
abortionondemand for poor women with locally raised money 
bush exercised similar vetoes on two other measures over 
abortion issues 
one was a bill providing funds for the department of health and 
human services which would have expanded use of medicaid funds to 
cover abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest 
congress sustained bushs veto then sent him a new bill without 
the abortion liberalization provison which he signed 
bush also vetoed a foreign aid bill that contained a provision 
giving money to a united nations population control program the 
program in turn supported a chinese program under which abortions 
were sometimes utilized 
congress removed that provision from the measure and sent it 
back to bush for his expected signature

the senate voted 99 to 0 tuesday for a 
resolution condemning continuing violence on all sides in el 
salvador and vowing to reconsider us aid if the killers of six 
jesuit priests are not brought to justice 
both the fmln leftist guerrillas and the salvadoran 
government must take strong action to end the violence that both 
sides seem to have taken against the innocent population said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
the nonbinding resolution came a day after congress refused to 
attach any restrictions on this years 85 million in us military 
aid to el salvador heeding president bushs argument that such a 
move would undercut the new government of rightist president 
alfredo cristiani 
but senate minority leader bob dole rkan noted that votes 
like yesterdays can be misinterpreted and added this 
resolution makes clear that we deplore all violence in el salvador 
whether it comes from the extreme right or the communist left 
the comments were indicative of a growing restiveness in 
congress with us policy toward el salvador 
the question isnt what we think of the rebels said rep 
david obey dwis whose appropriations subcommittee writes 
foreign aid legislation 
the question is what we think of the ability of the existing 
policy to succeed the very fact that the rebels have been able to 
do this after ten years of supporting the salvador government 
demonstrates to me that that government is not nearly as in control 
of the military situation as they have indicated 
added rep dan glickman dkan the extremists on both sides 
are driving this country into the sea and in the meantime us 
citizens are starting to get affected by it the president needs to 
personally get involved to get a ceasefire in place 
the senate resolution was similar to a resolution passed a day 
earlier by the house and stated unequivocally that if the 
government does not make a goodfaith effort to apprehend and 
prosecute the murderers of six jesuit priests and two apparent 
witnesses the congress will carefully review and consider the 
question of aid to el salvador 
the military and those who may have been involved in some of 
these violent acts should understand that were not necessarily 
going to be writing a blank check in perpetuity and its extremely 
important that president cristiani understand this said sen 
christopher dodd dconn 
congress may find it necessary to condition or curtail 
future salvadoran aid he said 
the resolution also asked that the bush administration report to 
congress by feb 20 on the status of the investigation into those 
deaths 
dole said tuesdays guerrilla attack on a san salvador hotel 
reaffirmed congress decision not to slap limits on the military 
aid for cristianis government 
but the resolution also gave those who voted against 
restrictions on us aid a day earlier a chance to vote for 
language deploring violence in the face of heavy lobbying and 
public protests by church and other groups opposed to us aid 
it was approved unanimously with sen jake garn rutah not 
voting 
as the senate vote proceeded police forcibly removed several 
protesters from the visitors galleries who began shouting comments 
againt us policy the entire gallery was cleared for the second 
time this week something that has happened only twice before in 
this century 
sen john chafee rri objected to the action saying its 
giving in to a few malcontents to clear everybody out because there 
are a few disturbers 
us capitol police said three demonstrators were arrested on 
charges of disrupting congress and demonstrating within the 
capitol each charge is punishable by a maximum fine of 500 and or 
six months in jail

a yale lecturers angry letter to a 
prominent harvard psychiatrist attacking him for his comments on 
the gang rape of a jogger in new york city has led to charges and 
countercharges of racism 
the latest salvo was fired this month in the yale daily news 
the student newspaper alexander theroux wrote a column defending 
his letter to dr alvin poussaint and accusing the psychiatrist of 
trying to have him fired by the ivy league school 
theroux sent the letter to poussaint after hearing him 
interviewed on abctvs this week with david brinkley about six 
young men accused of raping and badly beating the woman jogging in 
central park on april 19 the woman was released from a 
rehabilitation center in wallingford only last wednesday 
theroux said in an interview last week that he described the 
attackers as monkeys in his letter because he felt the attack 
was animallike 
poussaint who is also a consultant to televisions the cosby 
show is black theroux a novelist and lecturer in english who 
said he is a friend of the victim is white 
poussaint viewing the term monkeys as a racist remark 
passed the letter on to a boston globe columnist after failing to 
get what he felt was a proper response from yale he said he 
believed the letter warranted an apology 
theroux said the subsequent column in the globe transformed an 
angry letter into a racial one and prompted him to respond that 
he was being treated in a racist manner 
theroux said his choice of the word monkey may have been 
injudicious but he did not use the term as a racial slur 
it wasnt and isnt a racial term to me he wrote in the 
yale daily news it could have been pigs dogs scumfish they 
had behaved literally worse than animals 
theroux said he wrote poussaint because he was outraged by the 
psychiatrists description of the young men as having been angry 
which he viewed as a partial defense of the womans attackers 
the yale lecturer said he told poussaint that he could create a 
backlash in the white community by defending such people my 
point was to tell him he was an irresponsible idiot he said 
poussaint said that in the television interview he said that 
any kids who attack and brutalize a woman this way must have some 
terrible anger and rage inside them 
it was not an attempt on my part to excuse these kids 
behavior he said in an interview last week that would be 
absurd 
poussaint said he didnt think theroux could be that 
unsophisticated not to understand what the term monkey meant he 
picked a common term used in derision of blacks 
the harvard psychiatrist wrote the chairman of yales english 
department richard h brodhead to call his attention to the 
letter poussaint said he also sent copies of his letter to yale 
president benno c schmidt jr and the universitys affirmative 
action officer 
the letter was written on yale stationery poussaint said he had 
thought it might be a forgery because of its tone and that if it 
were not the english department should question its author 
the letter raised questions about professionalism and whether 
a person holding such views was appropriate to be a teacher of 
black students poussaint said 
theroux who is in his second oneyear appointment to the 
english department was chastised by the chairman for using yale 
stationery to write the personal letter but was not subjected to 
any other action 
for a university to get into the position of firing someone for 
saying something others may find distasteful is to do the work of 
censorship said brodhead

sen john mccain wrote the senate ethics 
committee on tuesday that he never acted improperly on behalf of a 
collapsing savings bank whose top official gave him campaign money 
and use of an airplane 
i have every confidence that you and the committee will 
determine that there has been no improper conduct on my part and 
that you will clear my name the arizona republican wrote ethics 
committee chairman howell heflin dala and vice chairman warren 
rudman rnh 
mccain is one of five senators who received campaign money from 
charles h keating jr who headed lincoln savings and loan of 
irvine calif when it collapsed becoming the nations largest 
thrift failure 
the ethics panel had written to the five asking whether their 
intervention for keating and his bank with federal regulators was 
prompted by keatings campaign contributions all have denied any 
wrongdoing the ethics committee has hired an outside counsel to 
gather information in the case 
mccain said he always represents constituents keating lives in 
arizona when they have a valid complaint and denied his help 
is ever based on their campaign contributions 
mccain admitted however that he inadvertently did not pay in a 
timely fashion for flights on keatings corporate plane although 
he eventually discovered he paid twice for some flights 
mccain received 112000 from keating his family members and 
business associates from 198286 although the senator has 
contended that some of them might have contributed to his campaigns 
independently of keating 
mccain and three other senators met with thenchairman edwin 
gray of the federal home loan bank board on april 2 1987 to 
discuss the boards investigation of lincoln 
one week later mccain joined four senators in a meeting with 
the regulators who were conducting the examination 
the senator said he attended the meetings after complaints from 
keating and after receiving favorable reports on the bank from the 
large accounting firm of arthur young and from alan greenspan now 
chairman of the federal reserve board but a consultant for keating 
when he wrote a letter on the banks behalf 
keating complained in march 1987 that the examination of lincoln 
was taking too long and that bank board examiners were being 
unreasonably critical of lincolns investments 
arthur young which was working for keating supported his 
contention the greenspan letter written in 1985 but given to 
mccain two years later endorsed lincolns investment policies and 
its management 
mccain noting that the banks parent company american 
continental corp was based in arizona said i felt reasonable 
questions were being raised about whether the bank was receiving 
fair and equitable treatment by the bank board 
mccain told the ethics panel that after the san franciscobased 
bank examiners informed the senators they had uncovered potentially 
serious legal and financial problems at lincoln he was totally 
satisfied that the examination was fair and never intervened 
again

president bush vetoed the annual bill 
authorizing operations of the state department late tuesday and 
congress scrambled to pass a version acceptable to the president 
before adjourning for the year 
bush objected to a provision that officials said would tie the 
governments hands in conducting foreign policy the provision 
stemming from the irancontra affair would have imposed criminal 
penalties on any official convicted of using us aid to pressure 
foreign governments into carrying out polices contrary to us law 
the house immediately passed by voice vote a new clean 
version of the bill with the offending provision stripped out and 
sent it to the senate in the hope of winning approval before 
congress adjourned for the year 
the measure authorizes the spending of up to 97 billion over 
the next two years and includes a series of trade sanctions 
against china as a protest against its brutal crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators last spring 
the china sanctions include suspension of risk insurance for 
companies doing business in china suspension of trade assistance 
a freeze on exports of us satellites a halt to sales of 
controlled munitions and an end to sale of certain nuclear 
materials and components 
the bill also provides authority for the administration to spend 
up to 16 million to begin us governmentsponsored television 
broadcasts to cuba modeled after radio marti a government 
broadcasting effort which has operated for the past several years 
also included are 910 million over two years for refugee and 
migration assistance 2 billion for the us information agency 
and 600 million for the board for international broadcasting 
the provision to which bush objected would severely hamper the 
conduct of us foreign policy and would impose an unfair and 
unreasonable burden on our diplomats and on the conduct of our 
diplomacy and intelligence activities according to a white house 
letter to capitol hill 
while congress backed down from the language the confrontation 
damaged relations with some white house allies on capitol hill and 
left lingering anger at white house counsel c boyden gray 
i frankly think its left some scars that are very deep with 
people up here sen warren rudman rnh said after talks 
aimed at finding a compromise broke down 
congressional proponents of the provision took some solace in 
the passage of a separate foreign aid bill which contained similar 
language without the criminal penalties

premier miklos nemeth told parliament 
tuesday that hungarys true foreign debt is 20 billion 3 billion 
more than previously reported 
nemeth told stunned legislators that false figures on the debt 
had been published for years because the communist leadership 
feared an admission of the correct amount would endanger talks with 
foreign creditors 
last month parliament adopted laws and constitutional amendments 
to prepare for a democratic transformation that includes the first 
free elections in more than 40 years and the establishment of a 
hungarian republic without communist domination 
the communist party was disbanded replaced by a 
westernoriented socialist party that promised to surrender power 
if it loses elections scheduled for next june at latest 
nemeth said while hungarians greeted those changes with 
jubilation other reforms needed to revitalize the economy probably 
will lead to lower living standards and more unemployment 
the decisions that need to be made now will not be applauded 
by tens of thousands of people he told parliament in a 
nationally televised session 
wanting democracy the majority supported the dismantling of 
the party state but the new changes will be more divisive 
there have been calls for elections to be held before june so 
that opposition groups can elect represtentatives to the new 
legisalature still controlled by deputies who had been from the 
ruling communist party 
one legislator gyoergy banffy said monday parliament should 
dissolve itself at its session next month 
elections would have to be called within three months after 
parliament was dissolved and banffy proposed they be scheduled by 
march 11 his motion is to be discussed by the legislatore later 
this week 
nemeth said until the elections his government will work to 
put national interest ahead of everything else 
he said that would include a new relationship with the warsaw 
pact military alliance and the sovietled eastern trading bloc 
comecon 
he did not elaborate but hungary has increasingly been turning 
toward the west for trade and often has criticized comecon as 
ineffective 
hungarian leaders have pledged to remain in the warsaw pact but 
advocate greater sovereignty within the alliance

nowdefunct defense contractor 
the indictment said the defendant gordon osgood sr reviewed 
wedtechs performance on army contracts while he was a civilian 
employee at the armys tank automotive command in warren mich 
prosecutors allege osgood received more than 569000 in illegal 
payoffs from wedtech officials between 1980 and 1985 in exchange 
for favorable performance evaluations confidential army contract 
information and help with receiving advance payments the company 
also allegedly provided osgood 66 of romeo mich with use of a 
leased mercedesbenz in 1984 and 1985

bronx machine shop grew into a multimilliondollar military 
contractor through various bribe schemes the company collapsed in 
december 1986 amid allegations of corruption 
among those convicted in previous wedtech cases were us rep 
robert garcia dbronx and his wife former rep mario biaggi and

the former chairman of floridas democratic party 
was indicted tuesday on federal charges he schemed to bribe 
dominican republic officials to release airplanes confiscated for 
drug trafficking 
alfredo duran an attorney who headed the party from 1976 to 
1980 was accused of conspiracy to violate the federal foreign 
corrupt practices act 
a former dominican general joaquin pou 54 and his aide jose 
guasch 43 were arrested in the case nov 5 and are free on bond 
durans attorney donald bierman said his client would turn 
himself in to a federal magistrate wednesday 
if convicted each of the three men face maximum sentences of 
five years in prison and a 100000 fine 
the federal grand jurys indictment announced by us attorney 
dexter lehtinen accuses the three of seeking to bribe dominican 
officials to obtain the release of two planes by the caribbean 
island country 
duran 53 strongly denied the charges in a news conference 
shortly after the indictment was announced 
i am shocked and disappointed that this charge has been 
made he said in a statement i have voluntarily taken lie 
detector tests and have totally passed those tests on all 
issues raised in this matter 
state democratic party spokeswoman gayle andrews said she had no 
doubt the indictment was political was perhaps an effort to win 
the judgeship left vacant by the impeachment of former us 
district judge alcee hastings 
you have to be a blind man not to see whats happening here 
andrews said its obviously political mr lehtinen wants to 
make a name for himself 
before being appointed us attorney lehtinen was a gop state 
senator from the miami area his wife republican ileana 
roslehtinen was elected to congress nov 7 
dianne cossin a spokeswoman for lehtinen said any 
accusation that a grand jury indictment is motivated by a political 
agenda is false unwarranted and shows a lack of understanding of 
how our legal system works 
todays indictment was returned by a federal grand jury that 
considered the evidence they took into consideration much 
information gathered by law enforcement agencies she said 
according to the indictment the three men had to pay to falsify 
documents to hide the planes drug connections and ease their 
release 
the indictment said pou was paid 8000 to smooth the release of 
one of the aircraft 
duran held 12000 in escrow and 5000 in cash to be paid 
later for that plane the indictment said the deal involving the 
second plane was never consummated according to an affidavit by 
us treasury agent gary j lang 
robert gurin who was named in a federal arrest warrant when pou 
and guasch were picked up was not indicted tuesday he has 
reportedly been cooperating with authorities in the case 
gurin headed aea aircraft recovery in coral gables which 
specialized in recovering planes for owners 
according to langs affidavit the government investigated gurin 
because of allegations he had bribed highranking military 
officials in the dominican republic and other caribbean countries 
to recover drug planes 
the government used an informant to pose as an agent for the 
owner of a plane seized by the dominican military 
gurin told the informant that duran would channel the money to 
generals of the dominican military through his escrow account the 
affidavit said 
between february and october the informant met with gurin pou 
guasch and duran to iron out the bribery details the affidavit 
said most of the meetings were taperecorded or videotaped by fbi 
and us customs officials

president bush signed into law a 146 billion 
foreign aid bill tuesday night that includes the first cash in a 
promised threeyear aid program for poland and hungary 
the measure included 533 million in new aid for poland and 
hungary aid which has become politically popular because of the 
wave of economic and political reform sweeping eastern europe 
about 293 million would be in cash including support for new 
private enterprise and to stabilize polands currency the rest 
would come in trade and investment insurance 
it also includes 85 million in unfettered military aid for el 
salvador where a weeklong spate of intense warfare has prompted 
congressional calls for a reexamination of us policy 
as usual more than onethird of us aid goes to the two 
parties to the camp david peace accord israel and egypt israel is 
due to receive 18 billion in military aid and 12 billion in 
economic aid while egypt will get 13 billion in military aid and 
815 million in economic assistance 
other aid in the bill is earmarked for the philippines which 
would get 160 million as the us share of a new international 
assistance program turkey with 500 million in military aid 
greece with 350 million in military aid 230 million in economic 
aid for pakistan 440 million in economic aid to be shared among 
the four central american democracies as the administration sees 
fit and 20 million for an economic development fund for northern 
ireland 
the administration agreed to accept one item it had argued 
vociferously against a section written by rep david obey dwis 
that would bar the administration from using aid money to buy 
support from other countries for policies the united states could 
not legally carry out itself 
agreement came after obey rose on the house floor and announced 
the section was not intended to tie the hands of administration 
officials carrying out their normal diplomatic duties but was only 
to bar explicit quid pro quo deals with other countries to 
carry out prohibited activities 
a similar provision in the bill authorizing state department 
activities prompted a veto by bush tuesday night 
the bill survived a major battle over whether the united states 
should reverse a fiveyear policy and renew contributions to the 
united nations population fund which carries out family planning 
programs in thirdworld countries 
pressed by antiabortion forces bush vetoed an earlier version 
of the bill over a provision giving the un agency 15 million 
and the section was later stripped from the bill opponents noted 
the agency operates in china which they contended forces women to 
have abortions to enforce its onechildperfamily policy

police fanned out across india as voters 
in the worlds most populous democracy began casting ballots 
wednesday to decide the fate of prime minister rajiv gandhi and his 
beleaguered congress party 
more than 100000 paramilitary troopers were deployed to 
reinforce local police to prevent violence that has claimed 39 
lives since the election for a new parliament was announced a month 
ago 
most of the victims were campaign workers who were stabbed 
stoned shot or hacked to death by supporters of rival parties 
late tuesday the health minister of western gujarat state was 
fatally stabbed while getting into his car after addressing a 
congress party rally in hatmatiana a village 600 miles southwest 
of new delhi the assailant escaped 
the minister vallabhbhai patel died early wednesday while 
undergoing surgery united news of india reported 
gandhi in one of his last campaign speeches told a 
middleofthenight rally at kanakapura in southern karnataka state 
that only his congress party could give the nation the stability it 
needs 
at stake are 524 of the 543 seats in the lok sabha the 
decisionmaking lower house of parliament 
voters in only 15 of indias 24 states and five of its seven 
federally governed territorities cast their ballots wednesday the 
rest of the country goes to the polls friday and sunday results 
are not to be announced until late sunday or monday 
elections in india are spread over several days because of the 
countrys size which compounds communications difficulties and 
spreads security forces thin 
authorities in eastern orissa state were using trained pigeons 
to carry messages from remote villages to the state police 
more than 6000 candidates are running for seats in the lok 
sabha voting was postponed indefinitely in assam state because 
electoral rolls were incomplete and balloting was delayed in 
several constituencies because of the deaths of candidates 
the national front a coalition of five opposition parties made 
government corruption the heart of its campaign the coalition 
leader who is expected to be prime minister if it wins is 
vishwanath pratap singh formerly one of gandhis most trusted 
ministers 
a national front victory would loosen a dynastic family grip on 
indian politics handed down from rajivs grandfather jawaharlal 
nehru through his mother indira it could splinter the party that 
has governed india for all but 29 months since independence from 
britain in 1947 
nearly 500 million of the 880 million people are eligible to 
vote because the literacy rate is only 36 percent a voter marks a 
candidates symbol on the ballot 
at least 37 million government officials will supervise 600000 
voting stations 
the outcome will be determined in the hindispeaking heartland 
of northern india that stretches from rajasthan in the west across 
haryana uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh to bihar in the east 
nearly half the lok sabha is elected from what is called the hindi 
belt 
most indians see the election as a referendum on gandhis record 
since he became prime minister after two sikh bodyguards 
assassinated his mother on oct 31 1984 
less than two months later the congress party won an 
unprecedented 415 seats in the lower house which gave it a mandate 
to change traditionbound india and attack its ancient problems of 
poverty and illiteracy 
gandhi liberalized the economy and opened the door to foreign 
investment but failed to reform the notoriously inefficient 
bureaucracy or clean up politics and the congress party 
ram kumar a 79yearold bricklayer in agra said the 
congress candidates are thieves but ill vote for them anyway 
because im afraid the opposition will be even more corrupt 
opposition leaders built their anticorruption campaign around a 
14 billion contract with the swedish arms manufacturer bofors for 
400 army artillery pieces they and several indian newspapers say 
bofors paid up to 50 million in kickbacks 
the prime minister denied any wrongdoing and no evidence has 
been presented that links him or his family to the deal congress 
party officials retaliated by accusing opposition leaders of 
corruption nepotism and murder 
bofors has become the rallying cry against the corruption that 
plagues daily life in india where a bribe usually is needed to get 
a telephone a job or even into school 
once in 1977 the congress party was beaten factionalism 
destroyed that government after 29 months however and congress 
won the 1980 elections

us soldiers withdrew from positions in 
front of an american military hospital tuesday after two days of 
protests by panamanian civilians and government officials 
there was a brief scuffle between six soldiers and 30 panamanian 
demonstrators when the soldiers tried to remove protesters who had 
walked between two armored personnel carriers 
no injuries were reported and shortly after the shoving match 
us and panamanian representatives negotiated a settlement 
it provided for the us troops to withdraw with panamanian 
military police taking responsibility for the street between the 
gorgas hospital and a panamanian health ministry building 
us armored personnel carriers and coils of barbed wire around 
the hospital had blocked access to the panamanian offices 
shouting gringos go home and gringo animal get out of 
the canal more than 100 members of the progovernment dignity 
battalions had hoisted panamanian flags outside the hospital 
the battalions support gen manuel antonio noriega the 
commander of panamas defense forces who controls the government 
mercedes morris a spokeswoman for the us southern command 
said american soldiers were stationed in front of the hospital 
after panamanian defense forces refused to increase security 
following bomb threats 
a spokesman for the protesters said the us servicemen were 
posted at the hospital because the hospital was being used to treat 
people wounded in the civil war in el salvador the southern 
command denied salvadorans were being flown in for treatment 
the panamanian foreign ministry said tuesday the us deployment 
was a powerful affront to our territorial sovereignty a flagrant 
violation of the 1977 panama canal treaties that give panama 
control of the waterway at the end of 1999 
washington has been pressing for noriegas removal since he was 
indicted in february 1988 by federal grand juries in florida on 
drug trafficking charges 
noriega has denied the charges and accuses the united states of 
trying to renege on the canal treaties

the federal government accusing new york 
telephone co of not telling employees what hazardous materials 
they were working with on tuesday proposed 377240 in fines for 
the company 
if the fines are levied they would be the highest the 
occupational safety and health administration has ever imposed on a 
telecommunications company the agency said 
its a very widespread case said edward jerome an official 
at oshas albany regional office the company has the health 
and safety resources to get into compliance 
the company will challenge the fines said new york telephone 
spokesman tony pappas this company has always been interested in 
safety pappas said a willful violation is not something the 
company would do 
osha said it cited new york telephone for 16 serious violations 
62 willful violations and two other violations the citations 
resulted from 26 surprise visits to new york telephone workplaces 
around the state in july 
osha claimed the company knowingly violated osha standards by 
failing to maintain safety information for each hazardous chemical 
used at workplaces and failing to provide employees with 
information and training on proper handling of hazardous materials 
according to jerome 
the agency also accused the company of failing to properly test 
employees for possible exposure to lead and failing to properly 
store compressed gas cylinders 
osha said it found employees at an office in schenectady were 
not trained to deal with organic solvents compressed gases leaded 
solder and crc 556 a petroleum distillate in an aerosol can 
we are not alleging employees were overexposed to these 
materials said anthony desiervi osha assistant regional 
administrator in new york city 
however marsha love regional health and safety director for 
the communications workers of america said the union was concerned 
about what its members might have been exposed to 
she said the company had eight years to implement safety 
measures under state law that was superseded by federal law in 
august 1988 
the union has been talking to the company for some time about 
safety concerns love said she said the cwa finally went to osha 
in july and the agency began inspecting new york telephone 
workplaces

at last theyre singing august wilsons theatrical 
blues in london 
after years of being virtually unknown in britain the pulitzer 
prizewinning american playwright is responsible for one of the 
hits of the london fall ma raineys black bottom at the royal 
national theater 
ma rainey ran eight months on broadway in the 19845 season 
was named best play by the new york drama critics circle and was a 
tony nominee 
wilsons next play fences again won the drama critics 
award as well as the tony and the pulitzer prize joe turners 
come and gone netted wilsons third drama critics award in four 
years 
in the united states wilson is considered one of the great 
finds of the decade in playwriting a former poet born in 
pittsburgh to a black mother and a white father wilson is writing 
a cycle of plays about the black experience this century one play 
for each decade 
now confounding those who doubted wilsons pungently 
colloquial bluesbased language could travel overseas ma 
rainey has won plaudits in london vindicating the playwrights 
belief that his message and characters transcend borders 
i think its a true test of the universality of the play if 
you can move from the specifics of black american expression and 
say ok the plays are about that but they are also about the 
human condition wilson said in an interview at the national 
where ma rainey opened oct 25 in the small cottesloe 
auditorium intended to run until jan 27 the production has been 
extended through may 
set in a chicago recording studio in 1927 the play tells a 
rending story of racial exploitation and divisiveness involving ma 
rainey the mother of the blues the four black members of her 
band and the two white men who are her producer and manager 
the cast mixes local talent such as oxfordeducated hugh 
quarshie with such american expatriates as clarke peters who 
starred in driving miss daisy on the west end 
the director is englishman howard davies whose last american 
play was tennessee williams cat on a hot tin roof at the 
national in 1988 he also directed les liaisons dangereuses in 
london and on broadway 
carol woodscoleman who plays ma rainey initially doubted the 
actors and director would mesh in their approach to the play 
i was wondering about that prior to meeting howard but our 
first meeting put all those queries at ease said woodscoleman 
she praised davies as sensitive and sensible and a very 
thorough director 
he let us move with our experience of being black and knowing 
about black history without putting bridles on us said the 
actress who won london acclaim in 1987 for the musical blues in 
the night she starred in an offbroadway production of that show 
last fall 
in the united states wilson has worked almost exclusively 
alongside black director lloyd richards and feels ma rainey is 
best served by a black director 
but any human should be interested in and able to recognize 
the humanity in it he says 
because the play is about betrayal and honor and duty and love 
and all these other universal things it should be able to be 
directed by anyone white asian whoever 
ma rainey is the second recent american play following 
david mamets speedtheplow which the national has staged 
commendably this year 
two other wilson plays debut in britain in march joe turners 
come and gone at the fringe tricycle theater in northwest 
london and fences at the liverpool playhouse with richards 
repeating his tonywinning direction 
wilsons next broadway play the piano lesson opens april 
16 at the walter kerr theater

when youre talking about the book blinds amp 
shutters subtitled the photographic collection of michael 
cooper further subtitled text and actual signatures of his 
friends the worlds pop and art legends youre talking big 
numbers 
the 384page book of which 5000 have been printed weighs 11 
pounds has a pricetag of 595 and cost bill wyman the rolling 
stones bassist 100000 
its sold by mail from christopher cabot and fuller in 
atlanta 
cooper a young british photographer who hung out in the worlds 
of art fashion and pop music died in 1973 the book includes a 
suicide letter addressed to his 8yearold son adam adam cooper 
now works as a clapper loader on movies 
michael was hanging around with a camera wyman recalls 
nobody paid much attention he took pictures without you 
realizing it those were the days you werent afraid of the gutter 
press in england you never thought of a photographer interfering 
in your privacy lucky michael he did our their satanic majesties 
request cover and the beatles sgt peppers lonely hearts club 
band 
wyman was involved in the largerthanexpected project of 
compiling the book for six years 
i was approached by michaels son and his assistant wyman 
recalled in an interview 
they wanted to put together a really good book about michaels 
life i put them in touch with various people they came back a 
month later they werent having much joy 
wyman said they had print and identify for about 70000 
negatives very few had been seen before 
we had continual meetings i put them in touch with people to 
do one and twohour interviews with people who loved michael 
theyd show eric clapton a picture and ask him to say something 
about it and they did general interviews 
wyman said he financed everything i dread to think how much i 
spent it was 100000 at a minimum i might recoup some i thought 
it was a nice project to be involved in it has been done very 
nicely if i dont recoup ill still be happy its something 
special wyman says that some people buy expensive limited 
edition books hoping to sell them later at a profit 
since cooper was a special friend of keith richards and not 
close to wyman why did coopers son approach wyman for help 
keith isnt the kind of person that would do a thing like 
that cooper said im more organized than keith businesswise 
ive got an office in london ive always been interested in other 
projects im almost finished with my history of the rolling stones 
book 
many of the reminiscences culled from the interviews included 
between pictures talk about the drug scene 
it is hard for me to talk about that because i wasnt 
involved i had family i was one of the two married stones at that 
time charlie watts was the other we didnt hang out with the 
fraternity very much at all he said 
the music business and people around that i was very into i 
didnt know fashion people artists writers and poets so much 
there were a few clubs that everybody used to go to peter blake 
who did the wonderful painting of the beatles with just the eyes i 
became great friends with him and am to this day 
each book has 10 original signatures some even contain andy 
warhols 
cooper took pictures from the early 60s to the early 70s 
commenting on the 60s wyman says it was rather wonderful i 
dont think anybody was really aware of the enormity of change we 
the rolling stones were responsible for certain changes in 
fashion and hair being the longhaired ones at the beginning we 
made it possible for places like restaurants bars and clubs to let 
you in without ties and jackets the casual approach was unheard of 
then through a lot of problems we had at the beginning things 
changed 
we were all ostracized for minor things we couldnt go into 
pubs and buy cigarettes they would tell us we dont serve the 
likes of you we were refused food in restaurants we were not 
conventional and theyd rather not deal with us i suppose it 
happened in every country 
we were the only band that went on stage without uniforms the 
rolling stones walked on casually now everybody has done it ever 
since 
asked whether the 1989 rolling stones tour is exhausting wyman 
says the shows arent going on stage has always been a joy 
still is good fun the energy is wonderful moving traveling 
unpacking trying to get food and laundry done all those silly 
things are exhausting 
we do have the odd day off everybody took a week off in los 
angeles except me i was doing work for this book 
has he ever thought since the tour started im too old for 
this 
a smile creases wymans face i wondered but since the tour 
has been going its been ok

when benny hill was a lad his grandad took him 
to places of learning in london these places had revues called 
piccadilly spangles or toujours la femme and dance troupes 
like the saucy girls 
a fine education but what most interested him was the 
princom the principal comedian little benny saw that the 
princom got lots of laughter and hugs and kisses from all the 
dancing girls 
id think thats not a bad life he recalls and i 
think thats when i got hooked 
thus it has been for most of hills working life dancing girls 
in minimalist costumes slighty naughty comedy wordplay a bit of 
music hall much of it still is on display on about 100 us tv 
stations as the syndicated the benny hill show 
sight gags abound in his shows a recent one here showed him as 
a ships captain about to sing as he opened his mouth the ships 
foghorn made what sounded like a basso whoopee cushion being sat on 
it bothers him not that some dare call this vulgar you can do 
a show for six of your friends or you can do a show for as many 
people as possible id rather make a hundred million people 
laugh 
his halfhour shows seen since 1979 in the united states 
actually are bits and pieces of the three to five onehour specials 
he usually makes each year in london he reckons hes made about 70 
in 20 years 
he usually takes four days to rehearse each one then five to 
film them the skits are rapidfire not so the writing of them 
the longest part is the writing he says i write the show on 
trains on buses in hotel rooms on the beach at st tropez his 
voice trails off and he smiles 
this is far better than the early days when he was a struggling 
young straightmanturnedcomic in music halls pubs and the army 
camps where during and shortly after world war ii he honed his 
entertainers skills 
the army pay was minimal he notes but it was a very good 
audience you didnt have to sweat blood for them 
the man the british tabloids call king leer spoke of these 
things while on a recent visit to manhattan to case the joint for a 
onehour special hell tape it here at least sketches on the 
streets in april or may 
some comics when offstage are said to be quiet anguished 
souls who are on a firstname basis with the dreads not hill 64 
a lifelong bachelor 
sitting in an office here with dennis kirkland for 20 years the 
producerdirector of his shows he remains an epic in extrovert 
skittering from thought to thought accent to accent 
the tour of accents in understandable hills cast of characters 
is many and varied ranging from a japanese warrior to a french 
waiter at the hotel sordide but he has shakespeare time logged 
too as bottom in a tv production of a midsummer nights dream 
he admires the fine british comic spike milligan an 
original also wc fields one of his heroes and danny thomas 
whose gentle tales of family life might seem an odd choice given 
hills quickhit style of humor 
he first saw thomas in 1948 in london he was the first comic 
id seen who spoke the truth or i thought it was the truth hill 
says 
most british comics did quick jokes 
afunnythinghappenedtomeonthewayto gags he says but 
when danny thomas talks about his home he seems to be telling the 
truth and thats why its more funny 
during his visit here hill briefly visited with a civilian a 
fan named donald trump trump as the world knows is somewhat 
wealthy 
hill also is in the chips although to a lesser extent unlike 
trump he lives quietly without flash and sometimes takes buses 
this makes the british tabloids consider him eccentric 
he in turn considers them eccentric at one point in the 
interview he mentions that a news photographer in london spent 12 
weeks perched in a tree to get a shot not involving him of a 
furtive affairinprogress 
but that is the way of the tabloids back home he says and why 
he is wary of journalists there eyes twinkling benny hill quotes 
what he says is a british saying 
the only reason that people believe truth is stranger than 
fiction is because theyre not so used to reading it

financial need forced karen coats back into the 
workplace four years ago but temporary employment has since 
allowed her to spend the time she needs with her two teenage boys 
theres spurts of time when home is the priority mrs coats 
said i totally lose touch with whats going on at home with my 
husband and kids if i work 40 hours a week 
mrs coats 37 of indianapolis is just one of many americans 
flocking to temporary employment agencies some are parents seeking 
flexibility others are students seeking summer jobs housewives or 
retirees looking to relieve boredom or people easing back into the 
workplace some make temporary work their career 
the image people have of temporaries is oh these are people 
who cant get a fulltime job said laurie andersen information 
specialist at manpower temporary services but that is passe 
manpower inc based in surburban milwaukee is the worlds 
largest temporary agency employing about 1 million people a year 
ms andersen said manpower has 1450 offices and 300000 customer 
companies in 33 countries 
britains blue arrow plc bought manpower in 1987 but in a 
switch manpower president mitchell fromstein became the chief 
executive of the smaller blue arrow 
flexibility and the chance to make extra money are primary 
reasons single and married parents choose temporary employment she 
said temporaries can tell the agency if they prefer longterm or 
shortterm assignments and can refuse a call to work she said 
many temporaries are secondary wage earners and responsible 
for running the household and taking care of the children she 
said they dont have the pressing need to work 40 hours a week 
ms andersen said temporary workers wages depend on the job 
company and location a file clerk with minimal skills could make 
5 an hour while people with specialized computer skills can earn 
more than 20 an hour she said 
some workers who have a need for fulltime employment still rely 
on temporary work either as a career or as a steppingstone to more 
permanent jobs 
temporary work has given me an overview of whats available in 
the employment arena said marianne dubois 41 a single parent 
who moved to grand rapids mich from california last summer it 
does meet my needs at this point 
for many people the biggest drawbacks of temporary work are the 
lack of employment security and health and pension benefits that 
regular employees get but many temporary agencies now offer 
employee benefits such as insurance coverage and paid vacations 
after a certain length of service 
its great for me said pam skallinger of maplewood mich 
who has been a temporary for six years ive got all the benefits 
plus the flexibility 
it gives me a chance to be a good mother and give my all to my 
assignment when i have one she said 
college students make up a large part of the temporary work 
force for several reasons said jim dinsmore public relations 
manager for kelly services inc in troy mich 
it gives a lot of students the chance to work during the 
summers but its also a good way to get exposed to the job market 
for recent graduates he said 
temporary agencies also provide a chance for companies to see 
workers in action before committing to hire them permanently 
manpowers workforce went from 330000 in 1979 to 1 million this 
year and kellys rose from 330000 to 550000 during the same 
period the companies reported 
while more men are entering the temporary workforce they make 
up only about 10 percent to 15 percent of their current employees 
most temporaries are office workers 
one area of major growth has been older workers workers aged 55 
and up make up 15 percent of manpowers workforce kelly has an 
encore program to recruit and retain senior employees 
we get a lot of older retired people who are bored he 
said they want to stay busy but they cant work full time or 
they might lose their social security 
dinsmore said he believes temporary workers have found a 
permanent spot with many companies 
a lot of companies have temporary workers as a line item on 
their budgets he said its becoming more and more popular to 
use temporaries for special projects instead of just to fill in for 
sick people or vacation time

a variety of activists on environmental energy 
and social issues are drafting a political program to create a 
national green political party as early as next year organizers 
say 
modeled after green parties in europe the party would seek to 
build nationwide policy on environmental and social issues that it 
says get inadequate attention from the republican and democratic 
parties 
but green planners are divided on whether their new party should 
make an early run at national office traditionally almost 
impossible for american third parties or first concentrate its 
efforts on capturing local and state offices 
the green committees of correspondence a federation of about 
200 groups nationwide mailed a 36page list of proposed stands to 
3500 people this fall said jim richmond coordinator for the 
groups national clearinghouse in kansas city mo 
the greens as they call themselves plan to ratify the final 
platform at a september 1990 meeting in boulder colo meanwhile 
the 200 groups are planning regional meetings to debate stands on 
19 issues including land use water social justice energy 
health education and finance 
its activists and just regular folks of all stripes who are 
concerned what direction this planet is headed in richmond said 
of the 4yearold group 
born from the remnants of vietnam war protesters and the 
environmental and antinuclear movements that appeared in the 
1960s the largely white welleducated greens are far behind 
european parties with the same name said writer brian tokar an 
organizer 
tokar a toxic chemical and energy consultant said the us and 
canadian greens movements have been held back by the political 
systems in each country 
many european countries use a system of proportional 
representation in parliamentary elections which allows even small 
parties to get into parliament if they win a minor percentage of 
the vote nationwide fringe parties have a harder time under the 
us and canadian systems which elect representatives by district 
european greens united by polluted rivers and forests dying 
from acid rain won 30 seats this year in the 475seat european 
parliament 
west germany has the largest greens contingent 42 of the 519 
federal parliamentarians they also are in the legislatures of 
belgium italy austria and the netherlands 
european greens are basically defined by four pillars said 
tokar those are ecology social responsibility 
communityoriented democracy and the nonviolent movement where 
they are often seen demonstrating against nuclear missiles 
greens in this country strongly embrace those principles but 
weve sought to elaborate on them tokar said from his 
plainfield vt home 
the draft political program emphasizes 
creating environmental and economic policy that is not harmful 
to the united states or the world 
decentralization bringing decisionmaking back from the 
federal and state level to local communities and the people whose 
lives it affects 
an end to oppression based on race sex and economics 
focusing on how the nation can work in harmony with the world 
community and nature 
the centerpiece is to rethink our relationship to the earth 
said john rensenbrink professor of political science at bowdoin 
college in maine another organizer 
issues such as the destruction of the earths protecting ozone 
layer are related to any number of government decisions in areas of 
energy health education and finance he said 
a handful of people guide the group which opposes the concept 
of hierarchy decisions are made by committees of representatives 
and a national leadership probably will not be chosen until the 
us greens jump into politics he said 
as they continue to organize greens are forming clubs at 
universities and have state organizations in michigan california 
georgia maine wisconsin and massachusetts rensenbrink said 
however the wouldbe political party is hindered by divisions 
on several issues 
green principles call for restraining capitalism where it harms 
the environment or community life but conservative greens who 
joined to fight pollution believe in a national economy driven by 
relatively free capitalism tokar said 
greens members debating the proposed national platform are 
leaning toward a prochoice abortion stance but some members are 
antiabortion said richmond and rensenbrink 
some greens want a national party to organize on the state and 
local level while others want to field a national candidate 
greens leaders said 
while the greens are closest ideologically to liberal democrats 
democratic national committee spokeswoman ginny terzano said her 
party is not worried 
the bottom line is that the democratic party has a strong 
platform she said adding that it includes environmental and 
human rights issues 
patrick stroh a new york university instructor in american 
politics said the greens may be able to push the issues they 
champion up on the agenda of the established parties 
but he expects the winnertakeall election system coupled with 
difficulty raising money from their grassroots activist 
constituency will keep the greens all but invisible in us 
politics third parties usually are most successful in local 
elections 
my overall assessment of their chances is very very gloomy 
stroh said

heres a diagnosis of woody allens crimes and 
misdemeanors courtesy of martin s bergmann a therapist for 
more than 40 years and clinical professor of psychology at new york 
university 
you have a very a successful physician martin landau who is 
starting an affair where he doesnt know what hes getting himself 
into he doesnt show you at any time what the mistress anjelica 
huston really meant we really dont understand what she once met 
to him nor do we understand what the marriage means to him 
then you have the character of clifford that woody allen 
represents who is kind of idealistic but very unsuccessful he 
falls in love with this woman mia farrow and eventually she too 
disappoints him 
you have to ask yourself not whether it makes sense in an 
isolated event but whether it makes sense in the framework i must 
say it does make sense there is a kind of chaplinesque idea there 
that life is very mysterious and you are a very small man 
very perceptive for a man who knows more about analytic couches 
than casting couches but what business does a psychiatrist have 
rating films in this case plenty 
actors have played therapists notably ingrid bergman and 
gregory peck in alfred hitchcocks 1945 thriller spellbound 
and montgomery clift starred as john hustons freud now an 
analyst has turned actor 
in a major breakthrough for the psychiatric field bergmann 
makes his film debut in crimes and misdemeanors portraying the 
kindly dr levy a philosopher of love and the subject of a 
documentary clifford is producing 
although an admirer of allens work bergmann wasnt looking to 
be in the movies his discovery came through an unexpected 
connection a student who knew allens casting director 
recommended bergmann for the part 
he allen took me to a room and asked me questions 
bergmann recalled he wanted me to talk he wanted me to talk 
about love death and religion i spoke about all of these topics 
for an hour and a half he used a few excerpts in the movie 
he only worked on the set for half a day and actually filmed a 
few scenes that were cut from the final release one segment in 
which bergmann and allen were to have a philosophical conversation 
while walking through central park was cut because of cold 
weather another was scuttled because of a misconnection between 
the film world and academia 
i was supposed to teach a class on the holocaust bergmann 
said but there i was trying to ask questions and all the 
students were dummy actors who were not supposed to answer 
questions i am accustomed to an exchange and none of my questions 
were picked up 
psychiatry is his profession but bergmann really has read 
enough to qualify as a doctor of love as well hes even written a 
book the anatomy of love 1450 columbia university press 
an academics attempt to examine how the great thinkers of the ages 
have tried to make sense out of an emotion that seems without logic 
literature on love originated in egypt 3500 years ago and 
the metaphors which the egyptians used are still our metaphors now 
love as a sickness with the beloved as a physician that love is a 
trap they had already developed metaphors persist unchanged 
plato believed that we were once one person that some of us 
were men and women some of us were only women and some of us were 
only men we were cut in half and each half yearns for the other 
bergmann was born in 1913 in czechoslovakia lived in israel in 
the 1920s and 30s and began practicing psychiatry when he 
emigrated to the united states after world war ii 
hes a fan of movies but warns against taking them too 
seriously there are no clark gables in real life no cary grants 
not even any dr levys 
we begin life kind of living in fantasy we acquire reality 
only slowly and relinquish our world of fantasy only slowly long 
before movies were ever invented the adjustment to reality was a 
very slow process because we have to accept limitations and 
limitations are always painful 
so we reserve a domain called fantasy in which we are still 
king and where our wishes can be met then come the movies and 
its on the screen so its no longer in the head it has a 
quasireality for many people it is full reality

weve already had rudolph the chipmunks and the 
raisins 
now hopping and bopping to our shores from the north of england 
comes a creature with its a compliment in the music business 
ears 
hes jive bunny 
his first record is swing the mood which sounds a lot like 
glenn millers in the mood the beat is whats happening now 
in clubs whose dancers have parents too young to remember that 
glenn miller and swing were once the worlds dance music 
swing the mood has hit no 1 in nine countries britain 
west germany finland denmark belgium the netherlands norway 
australia and new zealand its the fastest selling record in four 
years in britain 
as jive bunny comes to the united states his creator john 
pickles comes with him visiting atco records doing the talking 
for his rabbit frontman and handing out plastic carrot ballpoints 
to nosetwitching journalists 
he says the reason swing the mood is such a big success is 
that the older generation likes the glenn miller sound people his 
age like the nostalgic rock thats mixed into it teens like the 
dance beat and kids like the bunny 
pickles always wanted to be in show business and now at 47 he 
is his father a yorkshire miner became ill and couldnt work so 
young pickles left school and got a job in an electrical shop 
before he was 15 he bought it at 25 and still has it retail 
and repair domestic 
he also has been a frequent master of ceremonies and 
afterdinner speaker ive always been involved in a lot of 
things im a nutter that way 
pickles who drew up his own jive bunny contracts sounds the 
opposite of a nut case or a simple boy from yorkshire which he 
terms himself hes proud that the artist who drew jive bunny and 
the company that made 20 heads for appearances by the 
fingersnapping dancing rabbit are yorkshiremen hes determined 
not to move from rotherham to london 
and if his novelty lapin goes down the burrow as fast as he shot 
up pickles can cope whats important to me is being happy and 
content money doesnt make me tick its nice to have financial 
stability but its not the beall and endall i like to have a 
good time 
pickles son and two daughters from his first marriage matthew 
john was born to pickles and his second wife oct 18 while swing 
the mood was no 1 in england used to like bedtime stories he 
made up so he has written some jive bunny stories in rhyme 
publishers tv and stuffed toy makers have shown an interested 
whisker 
the tale of jive bunny began when pickles bought and revamped 
in 1983 a goingoutofbusiness recording studio where he used to 
record songs he composed he named it music factory i was 
reminded by my bank manager it was an expensive hobby i decided to 
make it a moneymaking hobby 
in 1986 after much negotiating for a license with the agency 
representing united kingdom record companies he started 
mastermixer a service to disc jockeys in dance clubs the second 
such business in england it built to 1500 djs across europe this 
year pickles decided to put dance mixes theyre spliced from 
existing recordings on the general market 
he looked through mixes on hand to see what might sell pickles 
came across one by les hemstock an englishman living in norway 
one of eight mixers working for him pickles flew him to england 
and paired him in the studio with his 20yearold son andy to 
polish it for a sixminute 12inch dance record 
it took them five days to create swing the mood and took me 
four months to clear all the tracks nobody understood what i was 
talking about when id say i want to license 20 seconds of your 
record pickles said in an interview 
even in the mood used as underpinning for swing the 
mood gave pickles trouble it was recorded in glenn miller style 
by the john anderson band which he couldnt find eventually he 
discovered it in northern ireland operated by two men who had day 
jobs and owned their own obscure record label 
pickles mixers use machinemade drum loops vintage music had 
human drummers youve got to keep varying the tempo of the old 
music pickles said it can take six hours to get a 20second 
link so it matches our back beat 
hes horrified at the suggestion of using another human drummer 
that wouldnt work weve taken the good old tracks and given 
them a todays feel 
pickles cogitated decided the record needed a frontman andy 
snapped his fingers and proclaimed jive bunny 
the younger pickles had labored in his fathers electrical 
workshop where one man called everybody bunny they called him 
jack bunny 
pickles phoned an artist friend i want a rabbit he is hip 
he is today he is cool jive bunny was born 
we all know how much money can be lost in the record pressing 
business pickles said i pressed up 2000 records gave 1000 
to disc jockeys sold 1000 in europe to agents ive got out there 
and went on holiday for two weeks in may when i got back 
everybody in europe was crazy for swing the mood i released it 
in july hoping itd get into the top 75 
its second week it was 31 two weeks later it was no 1 where 
it stayed five weeks 
followups were needed the second single by jive bunny and the 
mastermixers is thats what i like using the twist chubby 
checker has done some voiceovers for the company the john anderson 
band was commissioned to record hawaii fiveo music jive 
bunny the album to be released here in december has eight 
mixes made from 70 recordings pickles will take hopping mad 
off the album add some christmas music and release it in england 
as lets party 
bookmakers are betting itll be a christmas favorite pickles 
says and the record isnt created yet jive bunny whose father 
christmas suit is on the drawing board isnt worried

the tinsel is on the tree the egg nog is 
poured and the yule log aglow all you need is something on the 
stereo to complete that holiday mood 
theres always bing crosbys timehonored croon of white 
christmas nat king coles voice remains forever strong on the 
christmas song elvis presleys blue christmas still tugs at 
hearts 
if youre thinking they dont make them like they used to 
youre right 
its been a long time since somethings come along thats 
become a classic said joel whitburn whose milwaukeebased 
record research inc monitors whats hot and whats not in the 
music world 
money pressures and the daunting prospect of competing with 
stillpopular standards from decades even centuries ago mean that 
few artists even try to write new holiday standards today 
if youre going to write a whole bunch of new christmas 
carols who cares said nebraskabased composer chip davis 
davis who records as a oneman band under the name mannheim 
steamroller is responsible for one of the few holiday music 
success stories of the 1980s he records instrumental new age 
versions of christmas classics specifically designed for compact 
disc players 
with record companies rereleasing classics by crosby the 
carpenters johnny mathis and phil spector every year it may be a 
surprise to learn that davis 1984 release mannheim steamroller 
christmas and his 1988 recording a fresh aire christmas 
were the top two selling holiday albums last year 
it was for davis 
i didnt really expect it to do anything because it was sort 
of a known thing that this sort of junk just croaks said davis 
who was advised against recording holiday songs of how christmas 
music fares in the marketplace 
christmas albums were pretty much considered death in the 
industry davis said if you did a christmas album it was like 
signing off 
the mannheim steamroller records wed the old and new in a 
combination perfect for listeners too old for rock n roll novelty 
records and too young for lawrence welk orchestras synthesizers 
and electric guitars are used in instrumental versions of classics 
and a few new compositions 
davis records along with george winstons december album 
on windham hill records are expected to be hot sellers again this 
year 
it has a broad appeal said geoff mayfield associate 
research director for billboard magazine if you like traditional 
christmas music thats what its about but its presented in a 
new way people with gray hair can like it and if youre a kid you 
can sit through it and it doesnt have to sound like mitch 
miller 
holiday records have always been a strange stepchild of the 
music industry artists compete during a compressed time period to 
sell music to be heard in the background at a few parties then 
tossed into closets for 11 months 
this kind of highrisk lowreturn work makes many songwriters 
run in the other direction davis said your ego gets stepped 
on he said 
theyre probably some of the most difficult types of songs to 
write and have catch on because theres such an established litany 
of old material that people are fond of said david mclees 
artists and repertoire coordinator for rhino records 
the alltime champ of the modern era is irving berlins 
composition of white christmas heard first in the 1942 movie 
holiday inn the song has sold in excess of 100 million copies 
with crosbys version accounting for about 30 million whitburn 
said 
the christmas song thats sold the most copies since 1955 is a 
little less reverent its the novelty record the chipmunk 
song first released in 1958 whitburn said 
most of the christmas records that are played repeatedly on the 
radio these days date from the 195565 decade they include 
jingle bell rock silver bells the little drummer boy 
please come home for christmas the christmas song and 
rockin around the christmas tree 
in fact of the top 10 bestselling christmas songs for what 
billboard magazine defines as the rock era 1955 and after 
only one is from after 1970 thats the barked version of jingle 
bells by the singing dogs 
the only new song of the 1980s to show any staying power is elmo 
and patsys warped grandma got run over by a reindeer from 
1983 the jurys still out on do they know its christmas the 
band aid song that launched the rock n roll philanthropy trend of 
the 1980s 
mannheim steamroller and other new age records will face 
stiff competition this year from teenage chartbusters new kids on 
the block 
theyve released a christmas album with several new compositions 
by their behindthescenes guru maurice starr and yes another 
version of white christmas it already achieved the relatively 
rare feat of appearing on billboards top album not christmas 
album chart in october 
other artists planning new christmas records this year are kenny 
rogers randy travis wynton marsalis ricky van shelton leon 
redbone and roger whitaker 
some record companies are hoping creative approaches to 
packaging will gain them a niche in the christmas market motown 
records is releasing a collection of songs from many of its 
artists including smokey robinson and the temptations tvt records 
is presenting a sampling of christmas songs sung by soap opera 
stars 
rhino records known for its aggressive repackaging will 
present bummed out christmas a collection for christmas cynics 
featuring such songs as santa came home drunk christmas in 
prison and somebody stole my santa claus suit 
rhinos collectibles also feature hillbilly holiday cool 
yule and albums by dr demento spike jones james brown and the 
three stooges 
rhino is not neglecting new material its releasing a 
collection of new recordings by dr john nicolette larson and the 
roches but mclees said theres not much of a market out there 
anymore for new christmas songs 
it has to be a great song to break through and come back every 
christmas he said

south carolina school principal ben nesbit 
became suspicious when two students who had been suspended for 
illicit drug use passed a drug test with little trouble 
we found out a couple of weeks ago that theres a chemical 
that washes drugs out of the system said nesbit whose school 
spring valley high of columbia sc has received national 
acclaim for its drugfighting efforts the students use it full 
time washing out their systems and being tested all the time 
being high 
the street name of the chemical is golden seal said 
district of columbia teacher leroy lewis jr explaining the 
herb also is popular with students in the nations capital 
this latest student scam is proof that the war on drugs in 
schools is serious and must be waged in a nononsense but flexible 
manner lewis said 
kids recognize all the problems of the system said lewis a 
us government teacher at spingarn senior high school they know 
how to circumvent us better than we know how to plan 
the battle to keep the nations youngsters away from drugs has 
evolved from a mere just say no slogan devised by former first 
lady nancy reagan to a threat by the bush adminitration to end 
federal aid to schools colleges and universities that fail to 
document tough policies against illegal drug use 
the tougher approach reflects the nations growing concern with 
drug abuse statistics say that 5 percent of high school seniors 
drink daily and more than 60000 adolescents ages 12 and 13 have 
tried cocaine 
young people show a faster propensity to develop an addiction 
and the damage by addiction can be more permanent said doug hall 
of the national parents resource institute for drug education 
the government is expected to spend some 500 million under the 
drug education program this fiscal year about 180 million more 
than the year that ended sept 30 in 1986 only 3 million was 
budgeted for drug education 
almost all high schools and 87 percent of elementary schools 
offer some sort of antidrug lessons the new national drug 
strategy says schoolbased prevention programs should be reinforced 
by tough policies on use possession and distribution of drugs 
schools are trying a variety of approaches with no clear trend 
emerging success is hard to determine since so many of the 
approaches are new 
in texas football players are tested illinois and delaware 
laws allow spot searches of students and delaware plans to use 
drugsniffing dogs in the schools 
jefferson county ky schools notify police of every campus 
drug incident suspend students for six to 10 days for drug 
possession or use and transfer repeat offenders the pittsburgh 
board of education has decided any student convicted of trafficking 
in or possessing drugs on or off school property will be subject 
to expulsion 
drug free zone signs surround public and private schools in 
prince georges county md warning that anyone found possessing 
or distributing drugs within 1000 feet of a school yard faces 
strict penalties ranging from 5 to 40 years in prison 
education officials estimate as many as 25 states have some sort 
of drugfree zone programs or laws 
we see more expulsions and suspensions for use because its 
against the law said james better staff director of the 
education departments drugfree schools recognition program but 
most schools have referral and reentry programs 
at the local level education department officials estimate 73 
percent of americas 16490 school districts have written policies 
against substance abuse of these more than 90 percent involve 
notification of parents and or police suspension or counseling 
most major education groups avoid advocating specific drug 
policies for schools at most they offer general guidelines like 
those jointly developed by the american association of school 
administrators the national association of school nurses and the 
national education association 
we have problems when the feds try to impose decisions on the 
locals so national groups avoid doing the same thing said lew 
armistead of the national association of secondary school 
principals 
hall vice president of the national parents resource institute 
for drug education in atlanta said we dont believe in dealing 
with these people as criminals you really cant incarcerate your 
way out of a drug problem 
hall pointed to statistics that say school buildings or 
campuses are one of the least popular places for students to use 
or distribute drugs also he said students tend to use drugs more 
at night and on weekends 
pride supports treatment on demand said hall but the 
problem is its difficult to draw the line on whether the school is 
responsible or the parents 
nesbit insisted it is a school problem because they cant 
learn when they are stoned they cant learn when theyre dead 
they cant learn when theyre in the hospital were going to be 
paying for their rehabilitation forever and ever because so many 
people are hooked 
nesbit said his drugfighting efforts encompass more grassroots 
approaches of sending out letters of complaints to local liquor 
stores that sell alcohol to minors to encouraging temporary 
suspensions for drug use and automatic expulsion for drug sales 
in addition to the district of columbias citywide policies 
lewis offers earlymorning tutoring for students who want help with 
school work and to talk about whats going on with them with 
somebody they want to trust 
jenlane gee a teacher from modesto calif recognized along 
with nesbit and lewis as among the nations best teachers and 
principals complained that the governments drugfighting efforts 
have ignored elementary schools 
gee who teaches third graders at christine sipherd school said 
just as much emphasis should be focused on the elementary schools 
because studies show that children usually decide by the third to 
fifth grade whether to experiment with drugs 
nesbit added that simply talking or acting tough wont stem 
student drug use 
i think theres a hard line emerging in the schools he 
said but theres no comprehensive policy that helps kids to make 
good decisions about their future their bodies and their values

rural advocates for years have urged more 
attention for the medical needs of sparsely settled areas the 
small towns and farms where a fourth of americas people live 
a recent study done for the national rural electric cooperative 
association says improved health care insurance would help as much 
as anything ranking with jobs water and sewer systems 
the association a lobbying force on capitol hill is a major 
backer of comprehensive rural development legislation 
rural development is also the concern of a number of 
congressional leaders including sen patrick leahy dvt 
chairman of the senate agriculture committee who says we cannot 
have two americas one a land of opportunity and a second rural 
america left behind 
leahy said rural areas with an estimated 61 million people and 
14000 small towns and cities are in trouble because of higher 
unemployment and poverty rates than in metropolitan areas 
the problems of rural health care seem obvious to the casual 
observer there are simply not enough doctors and hospitals in the 
countryside a sick or injured person in the big city has a much 
better chance of getting quick treatment than a farmer in the 
middle of a pasture in kansas or wyoming 
yet some believe there is a more promising side to this dark 
coin and that there are solutions 
almost all rural hospitals are losing money as a result of 
dramatic declines in use changes in government funding and fewer 
local doctors says an agriculture department report but that 
does not mean that rural residents must forgo local medical care 
rural areas can have a strong base for local health care given 
some creativity and persistence the report said there are 
alternatives to hospitalization and sometimes to doctors 
themselves 
most patients no longer need a bed in a hospital the report 
said and modern emergency care techniques can stabilize patients 
for transport to a more distant hospital physician assistants and 
nurse practitioners can help ease the workload of the local 
physicians 
the report rural america and the revolution in health care 
was written by jeffrey c bauer a former professor at the 
university of colorado medical center and now head of his own 
rural health consulting firm coauthor eileen weis a registered 
nurse is a strategic planner with the same firm the bauer group 
of hillrose colo 
rural areas today have too few physicians the report said 
some areas have none unlike their citybased colleagues many 
rural physicians are the only doctor in town bearing all the 
burdens of being on call every evening and every weekend 
moreover it said disproportionally large numbers of 
governmentinsured or uninsured patients live in rural areas and 
that means lower income for doctors 
faced with career burnout and lower pay many head for the 
cities and more lucrative fields hospitals built 30 or 40 years 
ago have vacancies galore 
most small and rural hospitals today fill less than 30 percent 
of their beds 80 percent occupancy levels were common just 10 
years ago the report said however rural communities should 
not assume that their hospitals problems will all be solved if 
more doctors move into town or if hospital reimbursement rates are 
equalized 
one of the basic alternatives has been the development of 
primary medical care without putting patients in a hospital bed 
uptodate primary care practitioners can meet 80 percent to 
90 percent of all health care needs without acute care hospital 
beds the report said technological advances now enable 
primary care specialists to provide advanced diagnostic 
capabilities in their offices or clinics 
nurse practitioners and doctor assistants can perform many 
primary care functions with varying degrees of supervision by 
physicians 
the report said emergency medical services or ems provide the 
other key to the future of rural health 
because of recent scientific and technological advances a 
modern ems system can actually be better than a typical emergency 
room in a rural hospital the report said with a trained crew 
working with a fully equipped modern ambulance most critically ill 
or injured patients can be stabilized at the scene 
thus saving a small rural hospital to preserve emergency 
care is not necessarily the best way to keep emergency care in 
rural areas the report said in many smaller towns money 
spent toward emergency medical care is better spent on upgraded ems 
capabilities 
but talk of closing hospitals can strike nerves as sen max 
baucus dmont demonstrated recently during a veterans affairs 
committee hearing washington policy makers are fundamentally 
oblivious to the needs of rural america he charged 
they really dont understand the sense of space and distance 
in rural areas baucus said the discussion at the time involved 
the possibility of closing rural va hospitals in montana a move 
ruled out at the hearing by veterans secretary edward j derwinski 
the national rural electric cooperative association says 
expanded medical insurance coverage heads its list of ways to 
improve rural health care 
bob bergland vice president and general manager of the 
association said we want to make sure that the needs of rural 
americans are considered in the current debate on medical insurance 
coverage and other health care problems 
bergland who was secretary of agriculture in the carter 
administration said rural residents are less likely than city 
people to benefit from tax incentives and other programs aimed at 
making health care more available and affordable 
but he added doctors and nurses will be the first to tell you 
that its not just their numbers that are important for good rural 
health care weve got to assure things like adequate water and 
sewer facilities nutrition education and preventive health care

the justice department says the proposed 
merger of the nations two largest armoredcar companies would 
reduce competition and should be reviewed carefully 
the departments views on the proposed purchase of loomis 
armored inc by brinks inc the nations largest armored car 
company were expressed in a petition to the interstate commerce 
commission which must approve the deal 
the justice departments antitrust division said monday it 
opposed a request by brinks a subsidiary of the pittston co for 
an exemption from icc regulatory review of its proposed acquisition 
of loomis which is owned by mayne nickless ltd of melbourne 
australia 
the justice department urged the icc to conduct a full hearing 
on the antitrust implications of the proposed combination 
there appears to be industrywide concern that the proposed 
merger may adversely affect competition the department said in 
its complaint to the icc 
a significant number of customers have told us they would not 
be surprised to see prices rise as a result of the merger because 
alternatives to service from brinks or loomis will either be 
unavailable or difficult to obtain the department said 
in a statement assistant attorney general james f rill said 
that in some major cities the merger will leave brinks as the 
sole or dominant provider of armored car services 
the purchase of loomis which is based in piscataway nj was 
announced in september terms were not disclosed

sluggish car and truck sales may force 
chrysler corp to increase budget cuts above a planned 1 billion 
by the end of 1990 and the company may be forced to close assembly 
plants chairman lee iacocca says 
i think the billion is a catalyst to say youve got to 
continue to find efficiencies every day of your life guys and it 
doesnt stop after you get to 1 billion you keep going 
iacocca said monday 
so i think itd be safe to say the billion is for openers and 
weve probably got another half a billion were thinking about 
already he said 
asked whether additional plant closings were likely he said 
maybe we dont know how deep the recession is yet 
earlier this month chrysler said it would stop production of 
its omni and horizon subcompacts at a detroit assembly plant in 
february 
the announcement drew heated criticism from the united auto 
workers union which planned a demonstration today outside chrysler 
headquarters in detroit 
iacocca held a brief news conference monday after a luncheon 
during which allstate insurance co presented the nations no 3 
automaker with its safety leadership award chrysler is the first 
us automaker to make driversside air bags a standard feature on 
all usmade cars for the 1990 model year 
iacocca said closing the jefferson avenue plant in detroit was 
necessary and he denied it violated the letter or spirit of the 
uaw contract with chrysler 
the cars arent selling and we couldnt have the people come 
in and dust off the plant or go bowling inside the plant he 
said the contract language is pretty clear if the people arent 
buying the cars youre building then people have to go home 
an optimistic prediction for 1990 car and truck sales 
industrywide would be 145 million iacocca said but things are 
little grim at the moment he said the auto industry was in a 
recession 
general motors corp officials have predicted total 1990 car and 
truck sales of about 15 million vehicles ford motor co executives 
have withheld predictions until later this year 
in his luncheon remarks iacocca called chryslers decision to 
offer standard driversside air bags a gamble that the public 
would be willing to pay hundreds of dollars extra per car for 
additional safety 
i dont know if the american public is totally sold on this 
idea he said i hope the jurys not out too long cause im 
liable to get crushed 
under federal law all cars made in the united states after last 
sept 1 must have either an air bag or automatic seatbelt on the 
drivers side 
meanwhile monday gm said it planned to more than double the 
number of air bagequipped cars it produces increasing to 13 
million for the 1991 model year 
gm president robert c stempel said driversside air bags would 
be standard on 13 of the automakers 1991 models including the 
chevrolet corsica buick electra and oldsmobile ninetyeight 
gm is including driversside air bags on about 500000 of its 
1990 cars the safety device is standard equipment on 13 models for 
the current year including the buick reatta cadillac allante 
chevrolet camaro and geo metro air bags were optional on some 
1988 and 1989model gm cars 
following our announced plan to phase in air bags on our 
passenger cars the 1992 model year will include passengerside 
protection on some models stempel added assuming normal 
market conditions we could be in the 27 million range by 1994 
chrysler and ford motor co each are producing 1 million 1990 
cars with driversside air bags

opec faces a ticklish situation at this 
weeks muchanticipated meeting 
the dilemma involves devising a way to stop the cheating by opec 
members who want a higher quota boosting oil prices a bit and 
setting a production ceiling in line with consumer demand 
whatever the cartel ultimately decides its going to be a 
very difficult meeting predicts pierre terzian editor of 
petrostrategies an oil newsletter based in paris 
oil prices are holding steady even though some members are 
openly cheating on their production quotas opec is producing at 
the highest level since 1981 
on saturday the 13 ministers of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries are scheduled to meet to decide their strategy 
for next year 
if the ministers raise opecs output ceiling too high theyre 
running the risk of jeopardizing the whole party warns peter 
gignoux the international energy director for shearson lehman 
hutton in london 
on thursday opecs eightmember monitoring panel will begin 
laying the groundwork for the meeting to be held in vienna 
austria 
just a year ago oil prices were in the doldrums the average 
price of seven crudes monitored by opec was 1234 a barrel well 
under the cartels target of 18 west texas intermediate the 
benchmark american crude fell to 1260 
since then prices have risen sharply last week the opec 
basket was at 1776 a barrel it briefly topped the 18 mark last 
spring 
futures prices for west texas intermediate have been about 20 a 
barrel middle eastern varieties are several dollars a barrel below 
that 
early in the year the oilproducing nations curbed their 
production to help drive up prices but in recent months they have 
turned their taps wider without hurting prices thanks to soaring 
demand in developing countries 
this is not a bad deal said gignoux 
ian graham an analyst at county natwest in london said 
theres not the same pressure to come up with a novel 
compromise 
terzian estimated opec production climbed to 234 million 
barrels a day last month with big surges by saudi arabia kuwait 
and the united arab emirates the output was well over the cartels 
ceiling of 205 million barrels a day for the last quarter of this 
year 
not since the spring of 1981 has opec produced so much 
according to figures from the international energy agency its 
output amounted to 232 million barrels a day in the second quarter 
of that year 
analysts say the cartels luck may not hold next year when 
demand for opec oil is expected to slip due partly to seasonal 
factors and saturated storage tanks 
the international energy agency predicted earlier this month 
that demand for opec crude in the first half of 1990 would be 
slightly under 21 million barrels a day 
if so the cartel would have to cut current output to keep 
prices steady 
the problem is getting production down so it doesnt 
oversupply the market said graham 
to do that will require hard bargaining 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have been flagrantly 
violating their quotas the individual supply targets set by the 
cartel for each member to press their demands for a larger share 
of the output total 
terzian estimated the two countries each were producing more 
than 2 million barrels a day last month about double their 
production caps 
he said saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter lifted 
about 56 million barrels a day in october higher than its quota 
of 5 million barrels 
analysts believe the saudis as a negotiating tactic before this 
weeks meetings have decided to pump more to try to maintain their 
share of the cartels increased production saudi arabia is 
assigned about a quarter of the total output 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer has said he would not give up 
any of his countrys share 
at talks in geneva in late september the ministers seriously 
considered an iranian proposal to meet the demands for bigger 
chunks of the production pie by kuwait and the united arab 
emirates the ministers were expected to renew those discussions 
this week 
under irans plan the cartels production ceiling would rise to 
215 million barrels a day to cover the requests of kuwait and the 
united arab emirates for higher shares gabon and ecuador also 
would get more 
smaller shares would be parceled out to algeria indonesia 
nigeria and venezuela iran and iraq also would lose a bit saudi 
arabia libya and qatar would stay the same

the us international trade commission has 
ruled that several small business telephone systems made in japan 
and taiwan are being sold here at unfairly low prices causing harm 
to american telephone amp telegraph co and smaller us 
manufacturers 
the decision monday opened the way for us customs starting 
next month to start collecting dumping duties of more than 100 
percent from importers of one taiwan maker and several japanese 
makers 
that is expected to result in higher prices for the systems in 
this country or fewer imports or a combination of both 
the sixmember commission voted 33 on an antidumping petition 
filed by two us makers atampt and comdial corp of 
charlottesville va the tie vote means acceptance of their claims 
the commerce department which earlier ruled that office phone 
systems with from two to 256 lines were being dumped in this 
country will instruct us customs in the first part of december 
to start depositing higher duties officials said 
the decision in a similar case involving imported south korean 
telephone equipment was postponed for 60 days at the request of the 
korean manufacturers they reported 
the dumping margin on japanese imports to be reflected in 
higher duties was fixed by commerce at 179 percent for products of 
matsushita electric 137 percent for those of toshiba electric and 
158 percent for all others 
the margin on nitsukoi products from taiwan was set for 130 
percent while the commerce department found no dumping margin 
for other taiwanese brands 
us small business telephone systems are made mostly in the 
states of louisiana texas virginia mississippi and colorado the 
itc said 
atampt welcomed the commission decision declaring in a statement 
that we are confident that all us manufacturers can be very 
successful in this market once unlawful pricing ends it added 
that the decision will enable atampt to continue to be able to 
bring its innovative strength to this marketplace and bring new 
even more innovative solitions to small business customer needs

the music is still playing in the marathon 
contest for control of lin broadcasting corp and neither suitor 
is ready to give up 
mccaw cellular communications inc which started the dance with 
an unsolicited buyout offer in early june said monday it was 
increasing its cash tender offer for a controlling interest in lin 
by 625 million to 34 billion 
mccaw also said that if its offer succeeded it would have lin 
borrow 425 million to buy mccaw stock which then would be 
distributed to remaining lin shareholders 
our amended offer which has a value more than 800 million 
higher than our earlier offer is clearly the superior alternative 
for lins shareholders said mccaws chairman and chief 
executive craig o mccaw 
the alternative is a competing offer from bellsouth corp the 
atlantabased regional telephone company that has agreed to merge 
its cellular telephone operations with lins cellular business 
new yorkbased lin said its board would review the revised 
proposal on a timely basis but urged its shareholders against 
tendering to mccaw until its board announced its recommendation 
bellsouth said it was studying the revised offer but that its 
first reading indicated its own deal with lin offered more 
strength and value to lin shareholders 
analysts said they valued mccaws new offer at 123 to 128 a 
share compared with 110 to 113 a share under mccaws previous 
offer and 117 to 124 a share under the bellsouth offer 
i am sure that bellsouth will come back with a higher offer 
said geoffrey johnson telecommunications analyst for argus 
research corp 
in overthecounter trading lin climbed 437 a share to close 
at 12012 while mccaw fell 125 to 3575 bellsouth rose 50 
cents a share to 5175 on the new york stock exchange 
mccaw based in kirkland wash asked lin to put its new offer 
to a vote at the previously scheduled jan 12 meeting at which 
lins shareholders are being asked to consider bellsouths offer 
mccaw said that if lin refuses it intends to take our case 
directly to the lin stockholders by mounting a proxy fight for 
control of the lin board 
mccaw is the nations largest cellular company but lins plan 
to merge its cellular operations with those of bellsouth would 
create a cellular company larger than mccaw 
under its latest offer mccaw said it would pay 150 a share for 
225 million lin shares or 34 billion its previous offer was 
125 per share for 22 million shares a total of 275 billion 
mccaw already owns about 51 million lin shares and the revised 
offer would give it 512 percent of lins 539 million shares 
in addition mccaw said that as soon as possible after the 
tender offer is completed mccaw would have lin buy 425 million of 
mccaw stock and distribute it to lin shareholders at a value of 
1617 in stock for each lin share held 
the new offer expires at midnight est dec 15 although it would 
be extended until the lin shareholder meeting if lin puts the bid 
to a vote 
under the deal with bellsouth lin shareholders would get a cash 
dividend of 42 a share stock in the new cellular company that 
would be created by the merger of lin and bellsouth cellular 
interests and stock in a new company that would consist of lins 
seven television stations 
the participants in both deals have offered guarantees that lin 
shareholders who hold on to their stock in the cellular company 
will get private market value for it several years down the road 
bellsouth and lin said in announcing their merger plan in 
october that they felt the deal could be closed in the first 
quarter of 1990 
mccaw said regulatory approvals could delay the bellsouthlin 
deal for up to a year mccaw said its deal could be closed much 
sooner and said it would demonstrate its confidence in that by 
paying interest of 12 percent annually on its cash tender offer if 
the offer closes after march 31 1990 
mccaw said last week it has received firm commitments totaling 
3 billion from a 22bank syndicate which with about 12 billion 
of its own cash and marketable securities is enough to complete 
the tender offer

a dramatic reduction in stockbroker commissions 
by wall streets secondlargest firm heralds further retrenchment 
during an industrywide slowdown in brokerage activity by individual 
investors analysts say 
shearson lehman hutton inc announced a rollback monday of 1 to 
2 percentage points for 1990 in the portion of the commission a 
broker gets for selling investment products it was shearsons 
first commission cut in 15 years 
that amounts to a lot of money when it gets all done said 
an official at one large wall street firm who asked not to be 
identified im surprised at that 
analysts said the reduction was the first direct commission 
cutback in the last year by a brokerage house 
business has lagged on wall street partly because of an exodus 
of individual investors since the october 1987 stock market crash 
and firms have laid off thousands of employees in an effort to save 
money 
brokerages also have imposed a variety of customer fees that go 
directly to the brokerage but do not affect the size of brokers 
commissions but firms such as merrill lynch amp co the nations 
biggest brokerage and dean witter reynolds inc said monday they 
do not plan to reduce broker commissions 
such fees result in a slightly higher take for the company 
than it does for the representative but its not as brutal as 
this said james p hanbury a securities industry analyst with 
wertheim schroeder inc 
youre trying to raise the revenue to the firm because the 
overall business is not that robust he said 
hanbury said he expected other wall street houses to cut 
commissions either the business gets better or youre going to 
see it and i think youre going to see it he said 
shearson which is 61 percent owned by american express co has 
been contemplating trimming the commission a broker gets known as 
the payout rate by 4 to 5 percentage points over the next four to 
five years shearson spokesman michael oneill said 
in 1989 shearson retail brokers brought in commissions 
averaging 228000 shearson returned 465 percent of the total to 
brokers and their supervisors in the form of direct payments 
employee benefits and deferred payments 
in 1986 when an average shearson retail broker brought in 
265000 in commissions the payout rate was 43 percent wall 
street officials said most firms payout rates were are about 37 
percent 
shearson stung by declining profits and a low stock price 
announced earlier this month it was laying off up to 800 employees 
and restructuring its senior management 
while not slashing commissions virtually all wall street firms 
have imposed handling fees on customer accounts to help enhance 
revenue without boosting expenses 
earlier this month for example bear stearns amp co imposed a 
250 handling charge on all individual investors stock and bond 
trades merrill lynch boosted its service charge last year to 235 
for each trade from 185 
the securities industry association expects thirdquarter 
industry pretax profits to be about half of the 1 billion in 
pretax profits in the second quarter 
the secondquarter profit marked a sharp jump from 200 million 
in the previous quarter and was attributed to increased volume and 
declining interest rates the bulk of the recovery came from the 10 
largest investment banks which recovered from 63 million in 
firstquarter losses 
but retail commissions accounted for just 17 percent of revenue 
in the first half of the year unchanged from 1988 but down 25 
percent from 1987 and 35 percent from 1980 
the shearson cut is expected to hurt the firm in hiring new 
stockbrokers shearson was one of several wall street firms to 
reduce its inhouse broker training programs after the 1987 crash 
in favor of recruiting from other firms officials said they 
expected some brokers to leave the company in protest 
its difficult to go to the troops in a tough market where 
theyre breaking their backs and say were cutting you the wall 
street official said the last people you want to go to is the 
producers

legislation concerned with the problems caused 
by corporate takeovers has been introduced by at least four 
senators sponsoring separate bills 
the senate banking committees securities subcommittee heard 
testimony monday about bills that seek to curb takeovers and 
leveraged buyouts while protecting shareholders rights 
the senators appearing before the subcommittee were howard m 
metzenbaum dohio terry sanford dnc arlen specter rpa 
and richard shelby dala 
many in congress are concerned that the wave of hostile 
takeovers mergers and acquisitions and corporate raids for profit 
are hurting the economy and turning american managements attention 
away from longterm planning 
the subcommittee chairman sen christopher j dodd dconn 
said he and the ranking republican sen john heinz of 
pennsylvania called the hearing to provide a record for 
consideration of these measures in the next session 
congressional leaders were trying to wrap up business this week 
so they could adjourn for the holidays until january 
all four bills would limit or close the 10day window stock 
purchasers have to declare their intentions after they buy 5 
percent or more of a companys stock 
under the williams act anyone acquiring 5 percent of a 
companys stock must disclose their holdings and whether they 
intend a takeover within 10 days in a securities and exchange 
commission document known as a 13d 
most of the bills would cut that 10day period to curtail what 
specter called creeping takeovers 
because the individual can continue purchasing shares during 
the 10day period he said his or her ownership can greatly 
exceed 5 percent by the time the public actually is informed 
his bill would require disclosure within 48 hours sanfords 
would cut it to five days the fiveday limit would kick in if the 
purchaser acquires more than 5 percent in shelbys bill and 
metzenbaums bill would cut the limit to 4 percent and require 
diclosure within one day 
the senators also want to curb the practice of paying 
greenmail 
too often a raider making a play for a company becomes rich 
when a corporation is forced to buy its own stock at a premium 
said metzenbaum its blackmail but weve made it more dignified 
and call it greenmail he added 
his bill would prohibit the payment of greenmail unless approved 
by a majority of those holding the outstanding voting securities of 
the issuer 
he and other senators said small shareholders often dont have 
enough say in whether greenmail should be paid 
shelbys bill would allow a company to recover any profit made 
by a person who sells the company its own stock if that person 
holds more than 3 percent of the companys stock and has held it 
for less than a year 
specters bill combined elements of the two bills allowing a 
company to recover its greenmanil payments unless the payments 
were approved by a vote of the majority of the aggregate 
outstanding voting securities of the issuer 
sanford said we need to shift the debate and focus our 
legislation away from the old raiders versus entrenched 
management fight to the more fundamental problems of encouraging 
corporate management to manage for the long term and encouraging 
investors to take a longerterm view 
his bill would treat 5 percent holders of a companys stock as 
insiders and block their ability to make a profit on stock of the 
company bought or sold within a sixmonth period

one week swinging a machete in the 
scorching sugar cane fields hardened william pauls hands and his 
resolve 
if i knew it would be like this i would have stayed home 
said the 25yearold father who grows yams and peas on the 
caribbean island of st lucia to me its not worth six months 
from home its like slavery 
but fray clinton who stays in another of the us sugar corp 
bunkhouses has returned to cut cane since 1984 he boasts of the 
cash in his jamaican bank account and the new clothes and household 
items he can afford 
no one promised no easy work he said i got no 
complaints 
seasonal laborers from the caribbean have been coming to south 
florida cane fields since the 1940s but a recent book critical of 
the program and congressional review of the nations sugar policies 
have drawn attention to the cutters lives 
in big sugar author alex wilkinson describes the sugar cane 
fields south of lake okeechobee as a place of misery where poorly 
paid cutters struggle in spartan camps run by profitminded 
companies 
the most perilous work in america is the harvest of sugar cane 
in south florida he wrote 
sugar industry operators and officials dismiss the book as 
misleading and inaccurate 
walking through us sugars pelican lake workers camp near 
pahokee on the southeast shore of lake okeechobee earle whyte 
shakes his head at the suggestions of enslavement 
every year we have people on the islands begging crying for 
these jobs said whyte senior liaison officer of the west indies 
central labour organization 
the camp considered by workers to be better than most is a 
collection of concreteblock buildings each housing 22 cutters on 
bunk beds a dining hall and store are near the main road although 
the cutters can travel the 10 miles into pahokee to shop or eat 
sweatstained clothes are draped outside nearly every building 
this is tough work no doubt said bob lee vice president 
of personnel for us sugar the nations oldest cane refiner 
the nature of this work probably brings a little more discontent 
than others 
at least twice during the past decade cutters have challenged 
their conditions in november 1986 police riot squads were called 
to take away more than 300 okeelanta sugar corp employees who 
stopped work in a wage protest workers were returned to the 
islands a smaller incident occurred in 1982 with workers also 
being sent home 
in pale dawn light on a recent day alfred blake and the rest of 
the osceola farms cutters rise in the barracks over their work 
clothes they strap on metal shin and hand guards 
by bus they travel to the field burned the day before to remove 
excess leaves from the stalks blakes machete slices easily 
through five or six stalks at a time the tops are also hacked off 
the harvest is piled on the chocolatecolored soil sometimes alive 
with aggressive fire ants 
by noon break blake has made about 25 at the minimum rate of 
530 an hour a 51aweek food charge is taken out of his pay 
clothing and other needs are his own responsibility 
yeah its hard very hard to save any money said blake 
23 my friends had come before and i wanted to experience it we 
have no good jobs in jamaica we got no choice but to cut cane and 
do such things 
blake arrived in florida last month after picking apples in new 
england where orchards bring foreign workers in under the same 
special immigration rule 
this year about 9000 cane cutters mostly jamaicans came to 
florida under the program which pays for transportation to and 
from the islands thats about 900 fewer than last year due to the 
expanded use of mechanical harvesters in the 413000 acres of sugar 
cane fields florida is the nations largest sugar cane producer 
growers however say full mechanization of the harvest is not 
in sight the cutters can work in muck areas not accessible to the 
giant machines in other sugar cane states hawaii louisiana and 
texas most harvesting is done by machine 
congress is expected early next year to scrutinize the 
canecutter program during hearings on the farm bill which sets 
import quotas on foreign sugar the bill is scheduled to expire 
next year 
in the fields however the concerns are much more immediate 
food injuries and saving money 
jamaican levi graham rested on a pile of cut cane after a 
sixhour work day sweat covered his arms and face 
its not a place you want to be these fields i liked doing 
the apples but the cane is a tough thing said graham 25 on 
his fifth harvest season we must come or stay in jamaica and 
look for a job its better than staying home

former billionaire brothers william herbert hunt 
and nelson bunker hunt could emerge from bankruptcy before the end 
of december following a compromise reached by major creditors 
as a federal bankruptcy judge poised to convert the chapter 11 
bankruptcies of one of william herbert hunt to a chapter 7 
liquidation spokesmen for two creditors minpeco sa and 
manufacturers hanover trust co of new york announced monday they 
agreed on settlement terms 
terms were not disclosed however 
us bankruptcy judge harold abramson emerged from hours of 
closeddoor meetings to announce he would defer until dec 15 
signing the order if the agreement breaks down abramson could 
proceed with liquidation 
abramson notified all parties two weeks ago that without an 
agreement by nov 20 he would convert the case to a chapter 7 
under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws a debtor is allowed 
to continue to operate with protection from creditors claims while 
a debt repayment schedule is arranged under chapter 7 assets are 
sold to repay creditors 
according to bankruptcy court filings herbert lists 169 
million in assets and bunker lists assets of 250 million 
we couldnt be happier said stephen mccartin head attorney 
for herbert hunt who had asked for a delay in abramsons 
conversion order 
the compromise between manufacturers hanover trust and minpeco 
a mining company owned by the peruvian government refocuses both 
cases toward a more orderly reorganization away from chapter 
liquidation feared by creditors 
major creditors said they would have received nothing under a 
firesale chapter 7 liquidation and most of the money from the two 
brothers estates would have gone to the internal revenue service 
which claims 80 percent of herbert hunts assets and 70 percent of 
bunker hunts 
four of the largest creditors in the case manufacturers 
hanover minpeco the irs and the trustee for hunt international 
resources co said they and the debtors would file joint plans of 
reorganization today in abramsons court 
minpeco has been trying to collect a 132 million judgment 
against the brothers stemming from the 197980 silver market 
collapse with attorneys fees and interest the judgment has 
swelled to more than 250 million 
other creditors led by manufacturers hanover which is owed 
36 million argued that minpeco already has recovered its silver 
losses from other thirdparty defendants and that the money would 
be better spent paying other creditors

thrift regulator m danny wall acknowledging 
mistakes in his handling of the nations largest savings and loan 
failure today vigorously defended his overall performance and 
declared no political figure influenced my decisions 
we have all learned some tough lessons from this case we made 
some mistakes and in retrospect we would do some things 
differently wall said in testimony prepared for delivery under 
oath to the house banking committee 
the panel chaired by rep henry b gonzalez dtexas was 
conducting the last of six scheduled hearings investigating the 
collapse of lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
gonzalez in an opening statement chastized wall for rejecting 
a 1987 recommendation from field examiners in san francisco who 
wanted to seize lincoln 
san francisco sounded an eightalarm warning but for 23 
months and two weeks washington failed to take definitive and 
effective action he said 
the committee also planned to hear from the thrifts owner 
charles h keating jr but it was unclear whether keating would 
refuse to testify by asserting his constitutional protection 
against selfincrimination 
keating a phoenix ariz millionaire is the target of a 
federal grand jury probe and of a 11 billion fraud and 
racketeering suit filed by regulators congressional sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity said his attorneys were 
advising him to remain silent today 
rep chalmers wylie rohio who has been critical of wall at 
times drew a contrast between the regulator and keating 
danny wall has made a career of public service while mr 
keating has made a career of selfservice he said 
democrats on the committee have been focusing on walls 
performance while republicans also have used the sessions to bring 
out the role of five senators four of them senior democrats who 
intervened on lincolns behalf after accepting 13 million in 
political contributions from keating 
they met with regulators on lincolns behalf in april 1987 
three months before wall took office as chairman of the federal 
home loan bank board now called the office of thrift supervision 
the five are alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini dariz 
donald w riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio and john mccain 
rariz 
wall said in his formal testimony that he had no direct 
knowledge of that incident but he declared my decisions in the 
lincoln case were my own they were devoid of any political 
influence i was not under the spell of charles keating 
wall has acknowledged receiving calls concerning lincoln from 
three members of congress deconcini cranston and rep carroll 
hubbard dky but he said those calls were well within the 
limits of propriety 
their inquiries were for a status report or to urge action 
but in no way were they attempts to tell me what action to take 
wall said 
hubbard in an emotional defense of himself told the banking 
committee he made the call at a request of former rep john 
rouselot rcalif who was then seeking to arrange the sale of 
lincoln 
i have no relationship with mr charles keating he said 
adding im proud to call danny wall my friend 
the chief thrift regulators defense comes after weeks of 
critical testimony and may be too late to secure his political 
future in response to a call from gonzalez for walls resignation 
president bush said a week ago he was not closing the door on 
the walls departure bush added he would make changes if it is 
proven that regulators were not aggressive enough 
much of the testimony in the previous five allday hearings has 
concentrated on why wall rejected a 1987 recommendation from 
examiners in his regional office to seize lincoln and put a stop to 
unsound practices 
instead wall transferred the jurisdiction over lincoln from san 
francisco to agency headquarters in washington and ordered a second 
examination delaying lincolns seizure until april of this year 
gonzalez blames the regulator for the delay which he says 
ballooned the expected 2 billion cost of the failure 
walls prepared testimony rejected that saying his decisions 
at most delayed action less than six months adding the 
preponderance of the losses at lincoln was embedded prior to the 
time i became chairman of the bank board 
however he admitted he should have insisted officials from the 
san francisco case participate in the second examination of 
lincoln even though he still believes their first examination did 
not turn up enough information to legally justify seizing lincoln 
the san francisco examiners found smoke but no fire he 
said 
meanwhile a classaction federal lawsuit was filed in los 
angeles on monday by lincoln investors seeking to freeze more than 
100 million in investor funds that they contend were illegally 
transported overseas 
the lawsuit contends lincoln misled 22000 investors into buying 
nearly 200 million in nonrated highrisk securities the suit 
contends keating and his family converted the funds to their own 
use by investing them in banks and companies in switzerland the 
bahamas and panama a court hearing was scheduled for dec 4

vegetable prices

congressional leaders worked today at 
smoothing rough edges in a 148 billion budgetcutting package and 
completing a separate measure eliminating some medicare benefits 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters a few 
glitches have developed today in efforts to pass the 
deficitreduction measure quickly but aides said the problem was 
not serious and would not prevent congress from approving the 
measure quickly and adjourning for the year 
i think it is just a question of getting everything down 
said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine theres a 
lot of complex drafting and talking taking place it takes a while 
to get it done 
house and senate leaders of both parties shook hands on the 
budget plan shortly after midnight the package derives about 46 
billion nearly onethird of its savings from acrosstheboard 
cuts in most federal programs they predicted quick approval by the 
full chambers and the signature of president bush 
it will pass overwhelmingly i think in both bodies because 
its a pretty good savings measure rep bill frenzel of 
minnesota ranking republican on the house budget committee told 
reporters 
it is a very strong effective deficitreduction package 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine told his 
colleagues 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said white house budget 
director richard darman and treasury secretary nicholas brady had 
told him that the white house will support this package 
the agreement forged after weeks of closeddoor talks puts to 
rest a budget year that has seen almost continual clashes between 
bush and congressional democrats despite a springtime budget 
agreement that both sides thought would smooth their work ongoing 
battles largely involving the presidents unsuccessful quest to 
shrink capital gains tax rates were the dominant theme 
nonetheless optimism reigned in the capitol that this years 
session would end today by monday evening a telephone tape 
recording that normally provides scheduling information for 
republicans was playing a song called one more day from the 
musical les miserables 
the budgetcutting compromise includes about 57 billion in new 
taxes most of them on corporations 
one change affecting many wageearners would include deferred 
compensation such as the earnings some employees place into 
401k retirement plans in the formula that determines the amount 
of wages subject to social security taxes that could require 
workers in the 50000 range to pay social security tax on slightly 
more of their earnings beginning in 1990 
that item agreed to toward the end of the bipartisan 
negotiations would raise 400 million this year 
the bill also claims about 46 billion in savings by leaving 
the grammrudman deficitreduction laws cuts in most federal 
programs in effect through the first week in february those 
spending slashes took effect oct 1 when bush and congress failed 
to agree on reducing the federal shortfall which congressional 
analysts project will surpass 140 billion this year 
the bills acrosstheboard cuts would result in reductions of 
about 18 percent in domestic programs and 16 percent in defense 
spending according to sen pete domenici rnm ranking 
republican on the senate budget committee 
other savings would come from other selected spending cutbacks 
and from a series of accounting shifts 
negotiators agreed to add to the bill a provision dramatically 
revising the governments system of reimbursing doctors for 
services to medicare patients the change will hold down medical 
costs in the long run and help assure that highquality medical 
services are available to rural areas and inner cities according 
to two sponsors sens jay rockefeller dwva and david 
durenberger rminn 
the plan establishes a national fee schedule based on costs of 
providing services physicians now are reimbursed on the basis of 
historical fee patterns that often have little relationship to 
costs of providing care 
separately lawmakers hoped to close another elusive deal on 
repealing all or part of the newly enacted medicare coverage of 
the costs of extremely long illnesses 
the benefit was created just last year with popular support 
with proponents trumpeting a bill that would prevent the sick 
elderly from being driven into poverty by doctor bills 
but many seniors have rebelled because many of them will have to 
pay a surtax to pay for the program that tax reaches 800 this 
year for the 40 percent of them with the most financial resources 
the house has been insisting for weeks that the entire program 
be repealed while the senate wants to spare minor benefits such 
as coverage for hospital costs lawmakers insist they will do 
something before they leave town rather than face furious 
constituents 
in other business monday congress returned the final three 1990 
spending bills to bush for his signature all of which he had 
vetoed at least in part for abortion provisions 
these included a 146 billion foreign aid bill a 1567 
billion measure for health and welfare programs and one providing 
500 million for washington dcs budget lawmakers realizing 
they could not override another bush veto stripped the abortion 
language from each measure 
should congress leave town before thanksgiving it would be only 
the second time it had done so in a nonelection year since 1965 
the last time being 1983

machinists on strike for 48 days against boeing 
head back to work wednesday after overwhelmingly approving a 
threeyear contract that could become the standard for the 
aerospace industry 
a company spokesman today said he hoped for a speedy return to 
full production at the worlds no 1 maker of passenger jets but a 
union head predicted operations would be slowed for as long as a 
year because of lingering resentment 
i think that its going to take awhile for the company to get 
their production back up to speed as theyd like it said tom 
baker president of district lodge 751 of the machinists union 
more than eight in 10 boeing workers voted in favor of the 
contract monday night baker said 
the strike affected more than 57000 workers in nine states it 
came as the company had a record backlog of aircraft orders of more 
than a decade in part because airlines are replacing their aging 
fleets 
i talked to my supervisor yesterday and actually its a big 
relief said carla bowman who tests new equipment and writes 
operating manuals at boeings suburban auburn plant 
theres no bitterness when youre on strike youre on 
strike but when you go back you go in there and work hard she 
said today 
a settlement with boeing machinists traditionally sets the 
pattern for other aerospace companies especially lockheed corp 
and mcdonnell douglas corp as well as for other unions at boeing 
divisions 
the 1989 strike will be remembered as the strongest and best 
strike in our history baker told union members as they gathered 
to vote in seattles kingdome i knew you wouldnt back down 
union members also met in wichita kan and in portland ore 
to approve the settlement and end the secondlongest strike against 
boeing 
boeing spokesman russ young said company supervisors and 
managers would spend today planning for the workers return with 
wednesday devoted mostly to regrouping boeing shuts down nearly 
all operations thursday through sunday for thanksgiving 
were going to put everything we can into getting back on 
schedule young said from day one we said that this is going 
to impact us so the opportunity to get everybody back as soon as 
possible has been important from day one 
average wages will increase 114 an hour in the first year and 
324 an hour over three years not counting lump sum bonuses 
baker said current hourly wages range from 888 to 1842 
before the vote cheers and boos rang out as union leaders 
entered the kingdome 
but in contrast to an oct 3 meeting during which members 
rejected a boeing offer and approved the strike only a few members 
threw paper airplanes made from pages of the contract offer 
owen nissen 62 who has worked for 20 years for boeing said it 
was easy for him to vote for the new pact because he was close to 
retirement but he expected even the most militant strikers to go 
along as well 
i think everybody wants to go back to work because they have 
to make car payments house payments buy groceries and theyre 
thinking about christmas he said 
ray mooney 30 an inspector in everett with 11 years at boeing 
said the contract is just a little better too many people 
are hurting too much to vote no 
negotiators agreed on the proposal early sunday after 14 hours 
of talks 
the union represents about 57800 boeing workers including 
43300 in the seattle area 12000 in wichita and 1700 in 
portland a few hundred more work at scattered sites in california 
hawaii utah wyoming montana north dakota and other states 
the contract contained annual wage increases of 4 percent 3 
percent and 3 percent the same as in the oct 3 and nov 4 offers 
baker said the contract substantially improved two earlier 
offers the new pact includes 
lump sum bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year 5 
percent the second and 4 percent the third on wednesday most 
workers will receive a 500 advance on their bonus 
a reduction in mandatory overtime to two consecutive weekends 
and 144 hours per quarter with doubletime pay after 160 hours 
boeing had record earnings in its most recent quarter and holds 
a backlog of more than 1700 jets worth about 85 billion with 
delivery dates stretching beyond the turn of the century 
the strike virtually halted production at boeing delaying 
deliveries to airlines at a time of growing passenger loads and 
rising concern over aging jets 
using supervisory and nonstriking workers boeing delivered 23 
planes during the strike but all were virtually complete before 
the walkout 
the last boeing strike in 1977 ended after 45 days its 
longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948

consumer prices shot up 05 percent last month 
as higher gasoline and food costs gave the country its biggest 
inflation spurt since may the government said today 
the october increase in the labor departments consumer price 
index which translated into an annual inflation rate of 59 
percent followed four months in which the index recorded modest 
monthly gains of 02 percent or less 
the price spurt was slightly worse than analysts had been 
expecting the government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline 
costs higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit 
and vegetable prices 
through the first 10 months of this year consumer prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 46 percent up only slightly from the 
44 percent price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988 
many economists are predicting that the best news on inflation 
has passed and that coming months will show higher inflationary 
pressures still few analysts are concerned that the price 
increases will worsen beyond annual rates of around 5 percent 
underlying inflationary pressures had been masked during the 
summer because of big declines in energy prices with energy prices 
now rebounding somewhat analysts predicted that inflationary 
pressures will be intensifying in coming months 
inflation pressures are persisting despite the slowdown in the 
economy said bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch 
we had a long string of very moderate inflation reports but 
inflation was never as good as those numbers indicated 
wall street took the latest inflation report in stride the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials rose by almost 6 points in early 
trading 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
shrugged off last months surge in consumer prices by noting that 
if the past six months were averaged the cpi would show an annual 
increase of just 33 percent 
this is lower than that for any sixmonth period since 
december 1986 and lower than the average inflation of 36 percent 
over the last seven years so inflation holds relatively steady but 
at a low level fitzwater said 
in a second report today the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings rose to 34307 in october 4 percent 
higher than a year ago but not enough to keep up with inflation 
during this time period 
leading the october advance in the consumer price index was a 
09 percent seasonally adjusted jump in gasoline costs the biggest 
increase since a 39 percent surge in may gasoline prices have 
been on a roller coaster this year soaring by 212 percent in the 
first five months of the year and then falling by 93 percent from 
june through september 
the price that consumers actually paid at the pump was unchanged 
in october however gasoline prices normally fall in october so 
the frozen prices translated into an increase after the labor 
department made its adjustments to take seasonal factors into 
account 
food costs were up 04 percent in october the biggest advance 
since a 06 percent rise in may 
fruit and vegetable prices jumped 12 percent reflecting higher 
costs for apples and bananas dairy products posted a huge gain for 
the second straight month rising 18 percent for the biggest 
advance since may 1980 
new car prices were also up in october rising by 06 percent 
after having fallen for five consecutive months the jump reflected 
higher costs for the 1990 models and a big 13 percent rise in auto 
financing costs usedcar prices however continued to decline 
edging down 01 percent after a 07 percent drop in september 
other forms of energy also posted increases in october with 
heatingoil prices jumping by 25 percent and natural gas and 
electricity costs rising by 03 percent 
consumer prices after discounting food and energy also rose by 
05 percent many analysts consider this to be a better indication 
of the underlying inflation rate because it removes the effects of 
two of the most volatile categories 
clothing costs were up 1 percent in october reflecting a second 
month of rising costs with the introduction of new fall and winter 
clothing lines 
before taking into account normal seasonal changes the consumer 
price index stood at 1256 in october meaning that a hypothetical 
selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 198284 base 
period would have cost 12560 last month up from 12020 a year 
ago 
while october spurt in prices was slightly higher than many 
economists had been expecting they said it confrmed their view 
that inflationary pressures are on the rise 
inflation is creeping upwards said frank mccormick senior 
economist at bank of america in san francisco we see the 
underlying rate of inflation going to around 5 percent a year 
as the year began the federal reserve was fighting inflationary 
pressures by pushing interest rates higher in an effort to dampen 
economic demand but since late may the central bank has been 
gradually lowering rates in response to fears that the 
credittightening threatened to push the economy into a recession 
mccormick predicted the central bank would cut interest rates 
one more time probably in december but he said by may of next 
year the central bank will begin raising interest rates again and 
would continue tightening through the rest of the year 
but lawrence chimerine senior adviser to the wefa group an 
economic consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa said he believed the 
fed was making a mistake by moving so cautiously in cutting 
interest rates 
he predicted inflation would stay in a moderate range with 
annual increases under 45 percent leaving the fed with enough 
room to do more to lower interest rates he said such moves were 
needed to keep the economy from stagnating 
i dont see any risk of a major speedup in inflation 
chimerine said we are not getting the wageprice spiral that 
people had expected 
the labor department reported earlier that wholesale prices rose 
04 percent in october leaving wholesale prices rising at an 
annual rate of 52 percent through the first 10 months of the year

government lawyers said tuesday that former 
chicago mercantile exchange chairman brian monieson knew that two 
of his employees were bilking customers of thousands of dollars 
but the statements contrasted with testimony by others 
including agriculture secretary clayton k yeutter who said 
monieson enjoyed an unblemished reputation in the futures industry 
attorneys for the commodity futures trading comission which 
regulates the nations commodity markets said monieson was aware 
that two of his employees ira p greenspon and norman k furlett 
at gnp commodities inc of chicago were cheating customers 
greenspon and furlett both now of malibu calif deny any 
wrongdoing as does monieson of northbrook ill 
the testimony came at a hearing before an administrative law 
judge on a complaint against three men brought by the cftc if 
found guilty monieson furlett and greenspon could be permanently 
barred from trading 
what did he monieson do sent norm furlett and ira greenspon 
back to handle more orders government attorney patricia donahue 
said 
moniesons lawyer jerrold salzman acknowledged that traders 
may have injured customers but said his client had no role and 
did not supervise furlett or greenspon 
the question is whether he failed to act in good faith 
salzman said mr moniesons conduct was appropriate 
he is chairman of the board he is not the chief executive 
officer he has a right to rely on others to keep an eye on daily 
operations the attorney said 
the government maintains furlett and greenspon engaged in 
allocated trades that defrauded customers the term refers to 
initiating futures contracts without the required customer account 
numbers then keeping profitable trades for themselves while 
sticking customers with the losses 
the government is not accusing monieson of committing the 
trades but it claims he was told several times between june 1985 
and may 1986 that furlett and greenspon were making bad deals 
futures are contracts to buy or sell commodities ranging from 
orange juice to stocks at a specified price on a future date the 
contracts are traded either to lock in commodity prices in advance 
thereby reducing their financial risk or to speculate on price 
changes 
yeutter who was president of the merc when monieson was merc 
chairman from 198385 was one of several character witnesses 
called before administrative law judge george painter 
brian monieson had an undisputed reputation as a man of 
honesty and integrity he said 
leo melamed chairman of the mercs executive committee said 
i have no doubt about his integrity or his honesty his general 
reputation is very good 
painter is to issue a ruling early next year after attorneys for 
both sides submit final written statements 
melameds decision to testify and salzmans to defend monieson 
prompted former sen thomas f eagleton of missouri to resign from 
the mercs board of governors eagleton said merc officials should 
stay away from monieson not help bail him out salzman is the 
mercs outside counsel

pan american world airways said tuesday it will 
increase commuter service in florida using a fleet of 40 new 
turboprop aircraft leased from british aerospace 
pan am said the expansion out of miami international airport 
initially will serve five cities and increase to 10 next fall 
the move is the latest by a major carrier to offer instate 
travelers better prices and more options and is expected to 
intensify competition in florida 
american airlines initiated its american eagle commuter service 
in october and plans to serve eight cities by years end 
continentaleastern express flies to 10 cities from miami with 
eight planes on dec 15 the service will drop continental from 
its name and plans to add six planes and 25 flights in february 
eastern spokesman robin matell said 
it will be a buyers market said jack guiteras president 
of lorraine travel 
guiteras said he expected the increased competition to lead to 
lower fares since travelers to smaller florida locales will have 
wider choices of airlines flight times and fares 
candace browning an airline analyst with wertheim schroder amp 
co in new york said pan am is taking a longterm perspective 
toward building their market share 
pan am chairman thomas plaskett said the first of the new 
aircraft is scheduled for delivery next spring and will be put into 
service by pan am express in intraflorida markets to feed pan 
american world airways growing hub operation out of miami 
the service is to include 25 daily roundtrip flights all 
operated into miami five daily round trips from key west six from 
sarasota six from fort myers five from west palm beach and three 
from melbourne 
the flights will connect with pan american world airways miami 
departures which by dec 15 will total 66 daily including 42 
flights to other us cities and 24 to international destinations 
in europe latin america and the caribbean 
the additional 25 pan am express departures would increase the 
daily operations of the two pan am corp subsidiaries to 91 
with the growing popularity of florida as a destination for 
europeans and north and south americans alike we are confident 
that the demand for increased capacity provides an advantageous 
time for pan am express to enter florida plaskett said 
pan am express purchased by pan am corp in 1987 currently 
serves 11 cities in the northeastern united states los angeles and 
san diego as well as 11 european cities 
its fleet includes 12 50passenger dehavilland dash 7 aircraft 
and 10 44passenger atr 42s another 13 aircraft already were on 
order 
in addition to the 19seat jetstream 31 aircraft the pan am 
express order from british aerospace includes 29seat jetstream 41s 
pan am will get 10 jetstream 31s to be delivered in 1990 and 10 
jetstream 41s a new stretch version of the 31 to be delivered in 
1993 also pan am has options on an additional 10 of each type of 
aircraft

hundreds of united auto workers 
union members chanting lee lies paraded outside chrysler corp 
headquarters tuesday to protest the closing of a car assembly plant 
chrysler earlier this month announced it would halt production 
of dodge omni and plymouth horizon subcompact cars at its jefferson 
avenue plant in early february and lay off about 1700 workers 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca on monday said further plant 
closings may occur because of weak sales 
this gives lee iacocca a black eye with his credibility 
said don petty chief steward of uaw local 1264 at a chrysler plant 
in sterling heights 
about 500 protesters marched behind a banner reading iacocca 
lied again among other signs was one picturing iacocca as a 
chicken smoking a cigar above a caption reading mr no show in 
louisville 
iacocca has declined to attend the uaws meeting next week in 
kentucky the first time since 1986 he wont appear two chrysler 
executives are scheduled to replace iacocca 
the rally also gave indications that national contract 
negotiations which open next summer could be acrimonious uaw 
contracts with chrysler general motors corp and ford motor co 
expire on sept 14 1990 
this is not just a rally for the jefferson closing said 
aaron taylor president of uaw local 7 at the jefferson avenue 
plant 
workers from syracuse ny and chryslers acustar plant in 
huntsville ala joined detroitarea workers at the march 
its a scary feeling said nancy adams who was laid off a 
few weeks ago from chryslers transmission plant in syracuse and 
remains a member of local 624 
the company said the jefferson avenue plant closing is permitted 
under its contract which allows for shutdowns due to slow sales 
omni and horizon sales have been slumping 
but union officials have said the move violates local and 
national contracts and they are angry they were not notified about 
the action before it appeared in the media 
uaw vice president stan marshall head of the unions chrysler 
department said relations between the union and chrysler are 
strained because of the plant closing and iacoccas statement in 
washington monday that others could follow 
uaw region 1 director bob lent said the conflict could continue 
into contract negotiations 
said marshall i think that they are the ones trying to set 
the atmosphere by lee going out there and making all kinds of 
statements like well we might have to close other assembly 
plants and everything

possibly wideranging cuts in military spending 
could hurt some programs of the nations two largest defense 
contractors but mcdonnell douglas corp and general dynamics corp 
indicated tuesday they did not feel immediately threatened 
diversification into areas such as the booming commercial 
aircraft market plus expectations of a continuing need for some 
major weapons systems could soften the impact on both the 
companies and local economies of any cuts 
defense company stocks fell broadly monday on word that defense 
secretary richard cheney was considering suggestions for 180 
billion in spending cuts over the next several years due to budget 
concerns and reduced tensions in eastern europe 
possible proposals include cutting the army by 100000 soldiers 
getting rid of 100 navy ships and closing at least a dozen air 
force bases 
st louisbased general dynamics down 487 a share on monday 
fell another 1 to 4312 on tuesday mcdonnell douglas down 
112 monday fell another 62 cents to 6762 a share 
at mcdonnell douglas corp the st louis areas biggest 
employer the cutbacks could hurt the f15 eagle and the fa18 
hornet fighter jet programs the company also makes the 
av8bharrier the harpoon missile and the tomahawk cruise missile 
but without specific cuts outlined it was too early to 
speculate on the impact on mcdonnell douglas spokesman jim reed 
said 
general dynamics is the nations secondlargest defense 
contractor while mcdonnell douglas has a commercial aircraft 
program general dynamics is defenseoriented and could be more 
vulnerable to cuts 
but general dynamics spokesman pete connolly said the company 
didnt feel threatened because it had concentrated on making basic 
military equipment 
this has been something that weve anticipated so weve put 
our bets down on the programs that we think we can do best 
connolly said the bottom line is we think our strategy has given 
us a very strong foothold for the 90s 
connolly said the companys f16 fighter jets m1 tanks and 
trident and seawolf submarines were the programs that we think 
are going to be around 
sure there will be some cutbacks but we dont see that any 
of our programs are going to be on the cancellation list theres 
always going to be a defense requirement in this country thats 
never going to go away he said 
any impact on the contractors could be repeated in a number of 
other regions with big defense industries although several experts 
said st louis would feel little economic strain if eventual cuts 
were along the lines of those mentioned by cheney 
sure mcdonnell douglas is the largest single employer but 
manufacturing has become a slow second to service areas in general 
in the metropolitan area said murray weidenbaum of the center 
for the study of american business at washington university in st 
louis 
weidenbaum also said the defense industry was accustomed to 
cycles although some past attempts at diversification such as 
grumman corps onetime production of powered wheelbarrows have 
not done well 
i dont know what theyre going to do but it isnt easy to 
turn a large aerospace company around quickly because theyre 
geared to producing items that are so different from a civilian 
item 
mcdonnell douglas president gerald johnston recently 
acknowledged that the defense industry was likely to have difficult 
adjustments in the coming years 
but i believe our industry is uniquely capable of shifting 
from military to civil production if called upon to do so he 
said in a recent speech 
julie niemann an analyst from stifel nicolaus amp co inc said 
mcdonnell douglas already was relying more heavily on its 
commercial aircraft business 
theyre smart people out there they knew the defense cuts 
were coming niemann said 
mcdonnell douglas commercial aircraft operation douglas 
aircraft in long beach calif is booming and accounts for about 
30 percent of the companys overall business mcdonnell douglas 
officials said

the markets resurgence during the past five weeks 
its been coming up gradually said analyst sharon ziemian 
of citibank in new york 
you havent seen jumps of 20 at a pop and those kinds of big 
pops are things that tend to set the market back fairly quickly

sudden sharp gains 
indeed few recent buyers have taken profits in the 5 weeks 
since the gold market began rising from the 365anounce area at 
which it had traded for much of 1989 
the holders of the metal believe its going to go higher and 
that is the sign of a true bull market said don mackaycoghill 
chief executive officer of goldcorp australia a stateowned 
corporation established to market australian precious metals 
mackaycoghill who is touring the united states to promote his 
companys gold and platinum investment coins said he was 
delighted with goldcorps sales volume 
investors seeking safety from the volatile stock market continue 
to lead the gold rally analysts said 
tuesdays government report that consumer prices rose 05 
percent last month may have spurred the rise of the 
inflationsensitive gold market they said the report added one 
more note of uncertainty to an already clouded economic outlook 
i dont think people are looking to gold to make big gains 
said ms ziemian i think people are looking to gold as a safe 
haven

analysts said an early advance ran out of steam when the market 
took a closer look at a government report on inflation that was 
slightly worse than most experts had been expecting

percent last month as higher gasoline and food costs gave the 
country its biggest inflation surge since may 
that obviously didnt help stock prices said bill raftery 
an analyst at smith barney harris upham amp co 
the government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline costs 
higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and 
vegetable prices 
much of tuesdays selling focused on stocks of companies 
involved in takeover attempts analysts said 
georgia gulf for example dropped 6 to 46 the chemical 
manufacturer announced that it has decided against a merger with nl

that had made a 11 billion takeover offer

intends to acquire 15 percent or more of its common stock lockheed

gold prices soared past 400 an ounce tuesday 
crossing that psychologically important barrier for the first time 
since late january 
meanwhile the dollar fell sharply amid speculation that 
interest rates might rise in west germany 
gold prices have been inching upward in recent weeks but when 
they crossed the 400 a troy ounce level tuesday buyers 
enthusiastically began to snap up the metal 
on the commodity exchange in new york a troy ounce of gold 
surged 550 to 40370 while republic national bank quoted a late 
bid of 40350 for a troy ounce also up 550 from late monday 
gold and silver all of a sudden are back in favor said 
steven pepper a precious metals analyst with republic 
silver picked up 146 cents to close at 5834 a troy ounce on 
the commodity exchange although it fell earlier in london to a 
late bid price of 571 a troy ounce from late mondays 574 
in earlier overseas trading dealers said gold benefited from 
the dollars fall and from the turmoil in eastern europe 
gold jumped more than 6 in london to a late bid price of 
40275 a troy ounce compared with 39650 bid late monday and in 
zurich the metal rose to a bid of 399 from late mondays 39665 
in hong kong gold rose 221 to close at a bid 39861 a troy 
ounce 
the dollar slumped as speculation grew that west germanys 
central bank the bundesbank would be forced to raise interest 
rates because the influx of east germans into the country might 
boost economic growth 
when foreign interest rates rise and us rates do not keep 
pace the dollar becomes less attractive to overseas investors 
speculation that interest rates might go up abroad often sparks 
selling of the us currency 
overseas the dollar reached its lowest level since late 
february against the west german french dutch and italian 
currencies in new york its tone was stronger because the domestic 
market was reluctant to turn bearish on the us currency said 
linda mclaughlin a trader at chemical new york capital markets 
group 
however the dollar still suffered sharp losses on domestic 
markets late dollar rates in new york compared with late mondays 
prices included 181375 west german marks down from 18338 
16130 swiss francs down from 162975 61775 french francs down 
from 62435 133600 italian lire down from 135000 and 116995 
canadian dollars down from 117105 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late mondays 
quotes included 18200 west german marks down from 18360 
16200 swiss francs down from 16315 62000 french francs down

italian lire down from 135100 11705 canadian dollars down

boeing co managers huddled tuesday on how to 
resume full operations while machinists members picked up a final 
strike paycheck and prepared to resume work wednesday following the 
end of their 48day strike 
a spokesman for boeing which already had an order backlog of 
1700 jetliners before the strike said the company may not be 
able to resume full production until after the first of the year 
workers seemed mixed in their opinion of the threeyear contract 
ratified with 814 percent approval late monday night but most 
said they were relieved to see an end to the secondlongest strike 
in boeings history 
i think its fair but for the amount of days we were out we 
could have done better said carl olson a jig builder at boeing 
advanced systems 
im glad to get back to work but i voted against the 
contract said machinist richard duncalf he said the union had 
struck to get higher wage increases but failed to get improvements 
in that area over a contract rejected oct 3 the day before 
machinists walked out 
the offer ratified late monday provides wage increases totaling 
10 percent over three years plus annual bonuses totaling 10 
percent of gross pay over the first year 5 percent the second and 
4 percent the third 
on wednesday most workers will receive a 500 advance on their 
bonus 
a costofliving adjustment formula will account for virtually 
all of inflation workers will receive a 60centperhour 
costofliving increase immediately and a 45 cents an hour base pay 
increase to ake up for a 1986 adjustment that workers didnt get 
the contract also reduces mandatory overtime to two consecutive 
weekends and 144 hours per quarter with doubletime pay after 160 
hours in the old contract workers could be required to work 200 
hours a quarter and four weekends in a row a key consideration in 
attempting to deal with boeings order backlog 
i think it stinks said ronda jones a nineyear boeing 
worker its hardly any better than the contract first offered 
but she said that with the holidays approaching people wanted 
to be back at work 
boeing had record profits in its most recent quarter and has a 
backlog of more than 1700 planes worth about 85 billion with 
deliveries for those jets stretching past the year 2000 the 
machinists had received bonuses but no wage increases in the past 
six years 
production was severely curtailed during the strike athough 
supervisors and nonstriking personnel delivered 24 planes many of 
which had been virtually completed before the walkout began 
jack gamble a spokesman for boeing commercial airplanes said 
managers and supervisors spent tuesday planning ways to smooth the 
strikers return 
on wednesday most of the day will be spent in crew meetings and 
other discussions of what work needs to be done on different 
projects gamble said the work also has to be secured before the 
start of the fourday thanksgiving holiday weekend 
gamble said there are only four weeks after thanksgiving before 
the contractmandated holiday period of dec 25 through jan 1 and 
it was questionable whether production could be back at full speed 
by then 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 here said 
it may take time for the membership to get over bitterness from the 
strike many workers always thought the company would take care

backers of sweeping changes in the way 
medicare reimburses physicians said tuesday the plan if it becomes 
law will change the way medicine is practiced in the united states 
the compromise plan worked out by house and senate negotiators 
monday as part of the budget reconciliation bill would have no 
immediately discernible impact on the 33 million elderly and 
disabled americans who receive medicare 
over the longer term however supporters say the plan would 
improve medicare beneficiaries access to medical services and 
would help stabilize the costs of the program which have been 
climbing more than 15 percent a year and are expected to reach 44 
billion this year 
congress was working toward final passage of the overall bill 
tuesday 
its the beginning of a fundamental change in physician 
behavior patterns said sen jay rockefeller dwva an 
architect of the plan 
within the next three or four years there is really going to 
be significant change in terms of procedures volume of 
procedures which is what drive up the cost of medicare he said 
the result rockefeller said would be a greater emphasis on 
less expensive primary care including preventive care 
although the changes would begin with the medicare program 
rockefeller said private insurance companies which also are trying 
to rein in the costs of medical care likely would implement the 
changes eventually because medicine follows medicare in the 
united states 
the american medical association supports the plan as a 
coststabilizing measure john zapp the associations director of 
government relations said beneficiaries probably wouldnt notice a 
difference in care 
opponents however say the plan would lead to rationing of 
health care and a decline in the quality of services edmund 
haislmaier a healthcare policy analyst at the conservative 
heritage foundation said that the plan may initially level out 
costs but that it does not contain the incentives necessary to 
control expenditures over the long term 
over time it could lead to rationing of medical services he 
said adding its not going to happen tomorrow but youre 
setting the stage for it 
the plan to be phased in over five years beginning in 1992 
includes a new payment schedule for reimbursing physicians who 
treat medicare patients now reimbursements are based on a 
doctors customary charges which can have little relationship to 
cost and can vary from region to region 
the new rates would boost fees for family and generalpractice 
physicians and internists fees would be lowered for surgeons 
radiologists and other specialties that are procedurebased 
the fees would be standardized by specialty with geographic 
adjustments designed to account for regional differences in costs 
the american society of internal medicine the leading 
professional organization for internists backs the plan saying 
the fee schedule will neutralize incentives for physicians to 
practice a very hightech oriented style of medicine helping to 
moderate future increases in medicare costs 
a spokeswoman for the american college of surgeons declined to 
comment in detail until its officials read the final language of 
the measure but she said that right now were very favorable 
this group realizes the world is different and theres a 
certain reality out there said spokeswoman linn meyer theres 
a lot of concern with the costs of medicine and there has to 
be belt tightening all healthcare sectors are going to be 
affected 
another part of the plan attempts to slow the increase in 
payments to physicians and to control the volume of services they 
provide by linking increases in physician payments to a medicare 
spending goal if physician payments exceed the goal reimbursement 
rates could be cut 
the plan also requires physicians to submit claims for 
beneficiaries some now require the patient to pay the bill and 
seek reimbursement from medicare 
also the plan continues but simplifies limits on how much 
physicians can charge medicare patients over the amount they will 
be reimbursed by the program

georgia gulf corp said tuesday it was 
considering a debtfinanced recapitalization a defensive move 
against nl industries incs recent unsolicited 11 billion bid to 
buy the chemical manufacturer 
georgia gulf said in a vaguely worded statement it had decided a 
recapitalization was the best way for the company to benefit its 
stockholders 
the company did not disclose any details of its plans it said a 
special shareholders meeting would be called once arrangements were 
made 
georgia gulf said it had considered other alternatives to nls 
50 a share bid which was announced oct 31 and has since expired 
georgia gulf said it had discussed the possibility of a business 
combination with or acquisition of the chemical maker by third 
parties who had expressed interest in the firm 
a leveraged recapitalization among the various transactions 
under consideration would be the most favorable to the companys 
stockholders georgia gulf said 
under a leveraged recapitalization a company usually borrows a 
significant amount of money and uses it to pay shareholders a 
dividend or expand the business 
houstonbased nl which owns about 99 percent of georgia gulfs 
256 million outstanding shares offered last month to buy the rest 
of the company for 11 billion during the summer texas 
billionaire harold simmons who controls nl said his holdings in 
georgia gulf were no longer for the sole purpose of investment 
nl said in a statement tuesday it was willing to reinstate its 
offer and also said it would support the proposed recapitalization 
if the deal would pay stockholders a higher amount than simmons 
50 a share bid 
nl said it was leaving its options open and would consider 
either adding to or reducing its georgia gulf stake depending on 
future events 
john garcia an analyst with wertheim schroder amp co in new 
york said the proposed recapitalization could result in the price 
of georgia gulfs stock increasing to about 55 a share 
but in the absence of any details about the recapitalization 
georgia gulf shares skidded in new york stock exchange composite 
trading the companys stock fell 612 to 4625 a share 
raising the stock price and the value of his holdings by 
forcing a recapitalization may have been what simmons wanted all 
along garcia said 
i think a recap at 55 ends the takeover story said 
garcia who previously characterized simmons bid as an attempt to 
drive the stock price up a recapitalization was the most likely 
outcome in the first place 
charles rose an analyst with oppenheimer amp co in new york 
said georgia gulfs announcement was obviously a defensive step 
but he said it was too soon to say if the strategy would take nl 
out of the picture he noted that nothing has been disclosed 
about the terms of the recapitalization 
garcia said georgia gulf probably decided against a merger 
because of antitrust considerations 
georgia gulf was created in 1985 when georgiapacific corp 
divested itself of its commodity chemicals business with 1988 
sales of 106 billion the company manufactures a variety of 
chemicals and polymers including aromatic natural gas and 
electrochemical products as well as thermoplastic and 
thermosetting resins

a federal agency on tuesday ordered an 
election to determine whether an estimated 8000 usair fleet 
service workers will be represented by the teamsters union the 
third such election in eight years 
the federal mediation board said the new election was necessary 
because many of the fleet service workers who handle usairs 
baggage catering and field operations were nonunion workers with 
piedmont airlines prior to the august merger of the two carriers 
its disgraceful we have to go through this election again 
william genoese the head of the teamsters airline division said 
in a statement but weve beaten this company twice and we can do 
it again 
attempts to reach usair for comment tuesday were unsuccessful 
word of the decision was received after the airlines virginia 
headquarters had closed for the day 
the teamsters said the addition of the former piedmont workers 
would make it the largest union election in the private sector in 
four years 
the teamsters won an election among the fleet service agents in 
1981 but a new vote was ordered last year because of of usairs 
subsequent purchases of several smaller carriers the teamsters 
again prevailed 
in ordering the new election the mediation board rejected 
arguments by the teamsters that since piedmonta work force was 
smaller than the number of usair workers already represented by the 
teamsters the new workers should have automatically fallen under 
the unions jurisdiction 
genoese contended usair sought the election because it hopes to 
decertify the union and then contract out the work 
three other unions representing usair workers the air line 
pilots association the association of flight attendants and the 
international association of machinists gained representation 
rights of the former piedmont workers without elections 
pittsburgh and charlotte nc are the two cities with the 
largest number of affected workers about 1100 in each city both 
of which are major usair hubs in all approximately 8000 workers 
at 147 airports in virtually every state are eligible to vote in 
the election 
ballots will be mailed out within 45 days and workers have 30 
days to return them only those workers in favor of union 
representation have to return the ballots those not returned are 
counted as no votes 
the union must get votes from 50 percent a the work force 
approximately 4000 to win the election

charles h keating jr the central figure in 
an influence peddling investigation involving the nations biggest 
savings and loan failure refused to testify before a house 
committee tuesday 
keating who serves as chairman of the parent company of lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif cited his fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination 
on the advice of counsel i respectfully exercise my 
constitutional prerogative and privilege and refuse to answer 
questions here today the phoenix millionaire told the house 
banking committee 
keatin also rebuffed reporters shouted questions in entering 
and leaving the committee room but the parent company american 
continental corp released a statement in which he challenged 
congress to do a better job in its investigation and added that he 
had doubts it is really up to the task 
earlier tuesday the nations top thrift regulator said elected 
politicians to whom keating contributed millions of dollars since 
buying lincoln in 1984 had no influence on his decision in 1987 
against immediately seizing the savings and loan 
no political figure influenced my decision said m danny 
wall director of the new office of thrift regulation and chairman 
of the federal home loan bank board that preceded it as the 
industrys regulator i dont know how i can say that more 
emphatically 
the senate ethics committee last week hired an outside counsel 
to investigate allegations that five senators who received 13 
million in political gifts from keating improperly intervened with 
regulators on lincolns behalf 
all five sens dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz 
donald w riegle jr dmich alan cranston dcalif and john 
glenn dohio have denied violating any laws or ethics rules of 
the senate 
at tuesdays hearing keating invoked a house rule allowing him 
to bar broadcasting of his remarks by television and radio and to 
forbid still photographers from taking pictures 
however the committees chairman rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas allowed coverage of him swearing in keating as a witness 
keating also asked the committee to invoke another rule that 
would have allowed it to hear what he had to say in a closed 
executive session but withdrew the request after several 
congressmen raised questions about the procedure 
after his appearance american continental corp issued a 
release saying keating invoked the fifth amendment most 
reluctantly and stated that he is hopeful he can freely testify 
before the committee in the near future 
keating is the subject of a federal grand jury probe in los 
angeles and has been sued by federal regulators in a 11 billion 
fraud and racketeering suit 
in the statement keating said congress should provide more 
than mere lip service to its investigation and ferret through 
the real facts 
i am not sure congress is really up to the task he said 
wall told the committee he had made mistakes regarding the 
lincoln case from the time he assumed the bank boards chairmanship 
in july 1987 until it was taken over by regulators last april 
government officials have put the cost to taxpayers of lincolns 
failure at 233 billion a figure that rep jim leach riowa 
said represents 50 for every family in this country 
clearly had we known then what we know now we would have 
acted differently wall said 
california regulators and midlevel officials in walls agency 
have testified in previous hearings that keatings political 
influence hampered their efforts to uncover and stop what wall on 
tuesday called a heist of federally insured deposits in lincoln 
wall said lawmakers had spoken with him on behalf of the sampl and 
its owner phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr but he said 
his decisions were devoid of any political influence and he 
added i was not under the spell of charles keating 
wall acknowledged receiving telephone calls from deconcini 
cranston and rep carroll hubbard jr dky about keatings 
efforts to sell lincoln earlier this year before the government 
seized it 
but those calls were well within the limits of propriety he 
said their inquiries were for a status report or to urge action 
but in no way were they attempts to tell me what action to take 
hubbard the fourthranking democrat on the house panel 
vigorously defended his action at the opening of the hearing 
saying he called wall only at the request of former rep john 
rousselot rcalif who was then trying to arrange a sale of 
lincoln 
gonzalez chastised wall for rejecting a may 1987 recommendation 
from field examiners in the bank boards san francisco office to 
seize lincoln then 
san francisco sounded an eightalarm warning but for 23 
months and two weeks washington failed to take definitive and 
effective action said gonzalez who has asked president bush to 
fire wall 
gonzalez faulted washington regulators for failing to sense 
who they were dealing with in charlie keating whom he accused of 
using lincoln like an automatic teller machine as a source for cash 
wall defended his rejection of the san francisco examiners 
suggestion saying they had found smoke but no fire 
but he admitted that in hindsight he erred in postponing a 
scheduled field examination of lincolns offices in september 1987 
after the thrift threatened to get a court order to bar entry 
you can secondguess yourself to the point of distraction 
he said at the time we were on the brink of disaster in the 
thrift industry and lincoln was just barely on our scope 
in turn wall blamed the san francisco staff for approving a 
taxsharing agreement drafted by lincolns parent company american 
continental corp that he said allowed it to illegally drain 95 
million from the thrift between april 1986 and july 1988 
the heist was halted he said only after ban board 
officials in washington acted on a tip from california state 
regulators and launched a new examination of their own both into 
lincoln and its holding company

manufacturers hanover trust co said tuesday it 
plans to take a 50 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter in 
connection with allegations of fraud reported earlier at its 
geneva switzerland office 
the banking company which also previously disclosed it had 
dismissed an officer at the branch as a result of the allegations 
said an investigation was continuing and that the bank is working 
with swiss authorities 
it said the charge which amounts to 35 million after taxes 
resulted from losses on foreign exchange trading for customer 
accounts interest to be paid on such accounts and embezzlement 
the banks geneva office is principally engaged in asset 
management for individuals 
last month swiss police arrested a former manufacturers hanover 
investment banker in connection with an embezzlement that they said 
amounted to 22 million from the banks geneva office 
manufacturers hanover declined to comment at the time on the 
amount of money embezzled but said that losses like those incurred 
at the geneva office are normally covered by insurance and do not 
affect earnings 
the bank said tuesday it would seek to minimize the loss through 
recoveries and insurance 
manufacturers hanover earned 224 million or 428 a share in 
the fourth quarter of 1988 that was an exceptionally strong 
performance however as the results included 146 million in 
pastdue interest payments on loans to brazil

great northern nekoosa corps board of 
directors on tuesday recommended that its stockholders reject 
georgiapacific corps sweetened 36 billion takeover bid saying 
it was still too low and was illegal 
georgiapacific which on sunday increased its offer to 63 a 
share from 58 a share responded that it would continue its 
pursuit of the paper products company 
in a letter sunday to great northern chairman william r laidig 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr said the new offer 
represented a 63 percent premium above great northerns share price 
before georgiapacifics original 31 billion offer was made oct 
31 
but laidig in a letter to shareholders tuesday said the 
modest increase in the price of georgiapacifics offer announced 
on nov 19 has done nothing to change your boards determination 
that the offer is not in the best interests of your company and its 
shareowners 
also laidig said his companys attorneys maintain the deal 
would violate antitrust laws he said the board has determined 
with the advice of the companys financial adviser goldman sachs amp 
co that the increased per share price of the offer remains 
inadequate 
hahn disputed laidigs contentions in a statement tuesday a 
5 increase certainly is not modest he said 
i wonder how many of great northerns shareholders agree that 
a 63 percent premium above the unaffected market price is 
inadequate hahn said 
georgiapacific said it would continue its effort to present the 
bid to great northern stockholders 
great northern rejected the first offer as too low illegal on 
antitrust grounds and potentially disastrous for the combined 
company great northern filed an antitrust suit in federal court 
hahns sunday letter disputed great northerns contentions about 
the deals financial implications he also demanded a special 
meeting of great northern shareholders and urged laidig to meet 
with him personally to discuss the proposal 
we are prepared to consider an additional increase in price if 
you come to the negotiating table early and demonstrate to our 
satisfaction that greater value exists he wrote 
prior to great northerns rejection announcement 
georgiapacific filed an amended lawsuit against great northern in 
us district court in portland maine accusing great northernss 
directors of shirking their duty to shareholders by ignoring the 
tender offer 
the lawsuit also accuses great northern directors of plotting to 
thwart the takeover by setting up golden parachutes to pay 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to executives in the event they 
lose their jobs in a takeover 
georgiapacific which employs 44000 people had revenue of 
95 billion last year from sales of paper other forest products 
and building materials it is based in atlanta 
norwalk connbased great northern with 20000 workers and 
1988 sales of 36 billion makes paper containers and envelopes 
the amended lawsuit claims that after georgiapacific made the 
offer laidig refused to take even the minimal steps necessary to 
begin to apprise himself of the potential benefits to shareholders 
of a negotiated resolution or even simply of further talks 
benefits about which he could not possibly have known much less 
conclusively evaluated 
it also accuses great northern of setting up a tin parachute 
plan that could cost millions of additional dollars in payments to 
some 5850 nonunion employees who might lose their jobs in a 
takeover 
laidig disputed the contention that extra compensation voted by 
the board was a golden parachute plan 
the original lawsuit amended by tuesdays filing challenged 
great northerns bylaws and maines antitakeover statute which 
require hostile suitors to wait five years before they take over a 
company unless the directors of the target company approve the 
deal

former billionaires william herbert hunt and 
nelson bunker hunt on tuesday filed a joint 105 million 
reorganization plan approved by their major creditors who have 
been at odds for months 
attorneys for the hunts and for minpeco sa and manufacturers 
hanover trust co of new york signed the plans and filed them in 
us bankruptcy court in dallas other creditors have until dec 15 
to file objections 
the reorganization agreements could head off a bankruptcy 
judges threat to convert the brothers bankruptcies from chapter 
11 reorganization to chapter 7 liquidation of their assets 
us bankruptcy judge harold abramson notified all parties two 
weeks ago that without an agreement by nov 20 he would convert the 
cases to chapter 7 status 
the agreements filed tuesday were reached verbally monday 
following hours of closeddoor meetings after which abramson said 
he would defer the liquidation order until dec 15 
several of the attorneys said tuesday the plan wouldnt have 
come about without such pressure 
it was a combination of the judge ordering conversion of 
herberts case as well as the irs telling us that if we didnt have 
plans by the end of the year they would seek conversion of the 
case said barbara houser a dallas bankruptcy attorney 
representing minpeco a mining company owned by the peruvian 
government 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act a debtor is 
allowed to continue to operate with protection from creditors 
claims while a debt repayment schedule is arranged under chapter 
7 assets are sold to pay creditors 
according to bankruptcy court filings william herbert has 169 
million in assets and bunker has assets of 250 million 
under terms of the agreement the irs would get 70 percent of 
william herberts estate valued at 125 million and unsecured 
creditors would get another 30 percent 
nelson bunker hunt would pay 80 percent of his estate valued at 
150 million to the internal revenue service and 20 percent to 
unsecured creditors 
the hunts would be able to keep their personal effects but 
abramson ordered an auction of a coin collection and antiques 
major creditors said they would have received nothing under a 
firesale chapter 7 liquidation and most of the money from the 
estates would have gone to the irs 
we couldnt be happier said stephen mccartin head attorney 
for herbert hunt who had asked for a delay in abramsons 
conversion order 
the compromise between manufacturers hanover and minpeco 
refocuses both cases away from liquidation 
minpeco and manufacturers hanover are each to receive 346 
percent or 366 million of each brothers estate the total of 
all allowed claims is 1058 million 
minpeco has been trying to collect a 132 million court judgment 
against the brothers stemming from their alleged attempt in 197980 
to corner the silver market which ended with the collapse of 
silver prices with attorneys fees and interest the judgment has 
swelled to more than 250 million 
other creditors led by manufacturers hanover which is owed 
36 million have argued that minpeco already has recovered its 
silver losses from other thirdparty defendants and that the money 
would be better spent paying other creditors 
abramson has allowed only 20 million of the peruvian mining 
concerns claim
